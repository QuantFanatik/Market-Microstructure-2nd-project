PART I 

Item 1. Business 
 GENERAL 
 Coeur Mining, Inc. Coeur , the Company , or we ), founded in 1928, is a precious metals producer with assets located in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Our common stock is listed on The New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CDE . 
 Coeur s strategy is to be a well-diversified, growing precious metals producer with a focus on generating sustainable, high-quality cash flow and returns from a balanced, prospective asset base in mining-friendly jurisdictions along with our commitment to exploration and expansions. Our strategy is guided by our purpose statement, We Pursue a Higher Standard , and three key principles: Protect our People, Places and Planet; Develop Quality Resources, Growth and Plans; and Deliver Impactful Results Through Teamwork . We conduct our business with a proactive focus on positively impacting the health, safety and socioeconomic status of our people and the communities in which we operate as well as the environment. 
 OUR BUSINESS 
 Operating Segments 
 We produce and sell precious metals from the following operating segments: 
 The Palmarejo gold-silver complex, located in the State of Chihuahua in Northern Mexico, which has been in operation since 2009. The processing facility at the Palmarejo complex is fed by the Guadalupe, Independencia and La Naci n underground mines. The Company also carries out exploration activities across the Palmarejo property package. 
 The Rochester open pit heap leach silver-gold mine located in northwestern Nevada, which has been in operation since 1986. Coeur Rochester commenced a significant expansion project in 2020 (Plan of Operations Amendment No. 11, or POA 11 consisting of construction of a new leach pad, crushing facility, process plant and related infrastructure, which is expected to support an extended mine life. The construction is expected to be completed during 2023. Coeur Rochester also acquired the Lincoln Hill, Gold Ridge, and related exploration assets adjacent to its Rochester mine in 2018. 
 The Kensington underground gold mine located north of Juneau, Alaska, which began operations in 2010. Coeur Alaska received a favorable final Record of Decision from the Forest Service for their Plan of Operations Amendment 1 POA 1 on February 24, 2022. POA 1 gives Coeur Alaska the ability to increase tailings and waste rock storage capacity to support an expected longer mine life, reflecting positive exploration results, current metal prices, and ongoing operational efficiencies. Coeur Alaska is now working on supplemental permit requirements following this significant milestone. 
 The Wharf open pit heap leach gold mine located near Lead, South Dakota, which was acquired by Coeur in 2015. 
 In addition, the Company operates the Silvertip underground silver-zinc-lead exploration project located in northern British Columbia, Canada, which was acquired by Coeur in 2017. Silvertip commenced commercial production ramp up in 2018. In February 2020, we announced a suspension of mining and processing activities at Silvertip. While mining activities are suspended, the Company (i) is investing in exploration to potentially further expand the resource and extend the mine life, and (ii) continues to work to pursue a mill expansion to improve the asset s cost structure and its ability to deliver sustainable cash flow. 
 The Company has interests in other precious metals exploration projects throughout North America, other mineral interests, strategic equity investments, among other items, which are included in Other for segment reporting purposes. The Company sold the La Preciosa project in the first quarter of 2022 and the Crown and Sterling projects in the fourth quarter of 2022. 
 Metals Prices and Hedging Activities 
 The results of the Company and its operating segments are substantially dependent upon the market prices of gold and silver, which fluctuate widely. The Company has in the past and may in the future enter into derivative contracts to protect the selling price for certain anticipated gold and silver production and to manage risks associated with foreign currencies. For additional information see Item 1A Risk Factors , Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Note 15 Derivative Financial Instruments in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Metal Processing, Marketing and Sales 
 We produce gold and silver dor , as well as gold concentrate. The dor produced at the Palmarejo complex and Rochester mine, as well as the concentrate product produced by the Wharf mine, is refined by a geographically diverse group of third-party refiners into gold and silver bullion according to benchmark standards set by the London Bullion Market Association, which regulates the acceptable requirements for bullion traded in the London precious metals markets. We then sell gold and silver bullion to multi-national banks, bullion trading houses, and refiners across the globe. Our gold concentrate product from the Kensington mine is sold under a variety of agreements with a geographically diverse group of third-party smelters and traders, and the smelters and traders pay us for the metals recovered from the concentrates. 
 We believe that the loss of any one smelter, refiner, trader or third-party customer would not materially adversely affect us due to the liquidity of the markets and current availability of alternative trading counterparties. 
 Commodities 
 We purchase materials and supplies from third parties to conduct our business, including electricity, fuel, chemical reagents, explosives, steel and concrete. Prices for these commodities are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict, including inflation, currency fluctuations, global competition for resources, consumer or industrial demand and other factors . For most of these commodities, we have existing alternate sources of supply or alternate sources of supply are readily available. We continuously monitor supply and cost trends for these items. 
 GOVERNMENT REGULATION 
 General 
 Our business is subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws governing the protection of the environment, prospecting, development, production, mine closure, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, mine safety, toxic substances, protection of endangered, protected or other specified species and other matters. The costs to comply with these regulatory requirements are substantial and possible future legislation and regulations could cause additional expense, capital expenditures, restrictions and delays in the development and continued operation of our properties, the extent of which cannot be predicted. Expenditures for environmental compliance in 2023 are expected to range from 9.2 million to 10.2 million. We have reviewed and considered current federal legislation relating to climate change and do not believe the legislation to have a material effect on our operations. Future changes in U.S., Mexican or Canadian federal, state or provincial laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect upon us and our results of operations. For additional information regarding key regulatory risks, please see the section titled Risk Factors included in Item 1A. 
 Permitting 
 The Rochester, Kensington and Wharf mines are subject to extensive U.S. federal and state permitting laws and regulations. Mexico, where the Palmarejo complex is located, and Canada, where the Silvertip exploration property is located, have both adopted laws and guidelines for environmental permitting that are similar to those in effect in the United States. The permitting process in each jurisdiction requires, among other things, a thorough study to determine the baseline condition of the mining site and surrounding area, an environmental impact analysis, and proposed mitigation measures to minimize and offset the environmental impact of mining operations, in addition to consultation requirements with local indigenous groups, in certain instances. We have received all permits required to operate and carry out the current scope of activities at the Palmarejo complex, Rochester, Kensington and Wharf mines, and the Silvertip exploration property. We are in the process of amending existing permits at our Palmarejo complex and Wharf mine to support future planned activities. If we pursue an expansion at Silvertip, it will require new or amended permits. 
 Maintenance of Mining Claims 
 All of the jurisdictions where we operate impose federal, state and/or provincial requirements for maintaining mining claims (United States), mining concessions (Mexico) and mineral claims and mining leases (British Columbia), including fees, reporting, and/or evidence of work, among other requirements. Our failure to comply with any of these requirements could result in the loss of our ability to conduct mining activities in a particular location, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. 
 HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 
 Effective human capital management at Coeur is critical to achieving our strategic goals. We aim to be an employer of choice by promoting safety first, proactively developing our people and fostering a diverse and inclusive culture. In 2022, we were proudly named one of Crain s Chicago s Best Places to Work. At December 31, 2022, we had approximately 2,107 employees (1,091 in the U.S., 74 in Canada and 942 in Mexico) and 1,072 people were working as contractors in support of 
 5 

Coeur s operations. Approximately 65 of the employees of Coeur Mexicana are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. 
 Culture Assessment 
 We are focused on regular evaluation of our culture. In 2019 and again in 2021, we invited all employees to participate in a culture assessment by completing an anonymous survey. Employee participation in 2021 was over 93 , which exceeded industry benchmarks. Feedback was reviewed by the management team and our Board of Directors (our Board ). The management team also reviewed the results with employees at each of our operations through facilitated discussions to gain additional insight into the feedback. We developed site-specific action plans to address feedback and monitor progress in the future. The results of the assessment confirmed our belief that we have an ethical, safe, engaged, and proud workforce and also highlighted areas for improvement that are now being addressed. Specific action plans taken in 2022 included diversity, equity and inclusion DEI training forums with hourly employees, bolstered communications through written and in-person meetings, and implementation of a career progression ladder to provide guidelines for employees skill development. The organization will be surveyed again in 2023. 
 Recruitment 
 We seek to recruit and retain employees at all levels who embody our purpose statement, We Pursue a Higher Standard , through safe and ethical conduct. Our strong culture of teamwork and our reputation as a responsible company and an engaged community member motivates new employee referrals. We have also created a series of partnership programs in local communities to provide internships, scholarships, and apprenticeships to build a pipeline of potential employees in the next generation. We have maintained an average employee age of 40 years old since 2018 by focusing on building our bench strength and increasing our under 40 population to 34 of our workforce. 
 Diversity Inclusion 
 Our President CEO, Mitchell Krebs, was the first precious metals mining CEO to sign the CEO ACTION for Diversity Inclusion pledge. This pledge highlights Coeur s continuing commitment to fostering a diverse, equitable and inclusive workforce, evidenced by programs such as Coeur Heroes , which provided over 80 career opportunities to current and former U.S. Military personnel last year. Fifty percent of our Board members have indicated that they are diverse, 12 of our employees are female, up from 10 in 2020. While we continue to work to increase our overall female population, over 60 of our female employees are supervisor or higher-level positions. In the US and Canada approximately 21 of our workforce is non-white, up from 18 in 2020, Partnerships with organizations like the National Society of Black Engineers and Women in Mining at their U.S. university chapters are providing further avenues for recruiting diverse talent. In order to emphasize the importance of DEI in the workplace, we provided training to our hourly workforce at every operation on topics such as bullying, bystander intervention and education on overall mental wellness to ensure each employee feels respected and included at work. 
 Employee Development 
 We periodically solicit feedback on each member of our executive team through 360 assessments. We believe this feedback is important to maintaining a strong culture by effectively assessing leadership performance and development, increasing accountability, facilitating succession planning and identifying areas for improvement and change. We provide opportunities for employees to participate in IMPACT training, an intensive one-year training program we created for front-line supervisors throughout our organizational structure to focus on leadership development and mining as a business. Through IMPACT training, we have invested over 22,124 cumulative hours of leadership training and personal development in almost 200 employees. In 2022, after many employees had graduated from IMPACT training over the last 4 years, we introduced our first Advanced IMPACT training for employees at manager and director levels in the organization. 
 Succession Planning 
 We conduct robust succession planning throughout the organization annually, by employing specific talent diagnostics and skills development. High potential performers and diversity discussions, along with action plans, are reviewed starting from the front-line supervisors to the Chief Operating Officer. 
 Our Board oversees the recruitment, development, and retention of our senior executives. Significant focus is placed on succession planning both for key executive roles and also deeper into the organization. In-depth discussions occur multiple times per year in meetings of the Board, Compensation and Leadership Development Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, including in executive sessions to foster candid conversations. Directors have regular and direct exposure to senior leadership and high-potential employees during Board and committee meetings and through other informal meetings and events held during the year. 
 6 

Local Hire 
 Investing in local communities extends beyond financial support. Since 2018, we have hired an average of 60 of our new hires from local communities. During 2022, we provided over 50 apprenticeships and internships and worked with organizations such as By the Hand Club in Chicago to educate youth in our communities about career opportunities in mining. Providing career opportunities to local community members and participating in community initiatives creates a closer connection between our operations and local stakeholders and communities. 
 Rewards Wellness 
 As part of our fundamental need to attract and retain talent, we regularly evaluate our compensation, benefits, and employee wellness offerings. We have determined that our average employee earns over 40 more than the average employee in their local markets according to industry benchmarking. Over 94 of U.S. employees are enrolled in our medical benefit plan, and over 90 of U.S. employees contribute to our 401(k) plan. Supplemental healthcare is provided above government requirements in both Canada and Mexico. We were a leader in the mining industry by providing domestic partner benefits in 2017 and participation has increased 150 since introduction. New in 2022, we have expanded paid parental and primary caregiver leave for US employees. 
 In addition, we have engaged a third-party mental health care provider for innovative care and counseling resources throughout our footprint. This resource leverages technology and clinical best practices to assist our employees and their families gain fast access to highly effective quality care when needed most. We are also developing a Total Worker Health program, which is expected to be implemented by the end of 2023, that integrates protection from work-related safety and health hazards with promotion of injury and illness-prevention efforts to advance worker well-being both physically and mentally. 
 RESPONSIBILITY 
 At Coeur, we strive for best-in-class environmental performance while meeting the needs of today and respecting the needs of future generations. As a precious metals producer, we have the unique opportunity to supply the raw materials that play a key role in the clean energy transition. We work to protect our environment through an approach of responsible production and a focus on best practices. On an ongoing basis, we conduct site-specific environmental risk reviews and utilize a set of key performance indicators KPIs to evaluate performance results by mine. We believe that this systematic approach leads to awareness, risk mitigation and a pursuit of continuous improvement. Comprehensive environmental management plans in conjunction with topic-specific plans, such as waste management and storm water protection, at each site provide guidance on how to implement our environmental initiatives and meet or exceed regulatory standards. 
 We recognize that the climate is changing, which may adversely affect the environment, our business and the communities where we operate over the long-term. To that end, we are assessing the extent of these risks and potential opportunities and are taking action to manage our climate-related risks as well as the potential impact we have on climate. For example, we: 
 updated our initial greenhouse gas GHG emissions intensity reduction target in 2022 to 35 reduction in net intensity by the end of 2024 compared to base-year and tied 20 of the 2022 executive performance share award to achievement of that goal; 
 enhanced our climate disclosure in-line with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures TCFD recommendations; 
 conducted site-specific scenario analysis workshops, energy and emissions diagnostics and financial modeling; 
 completed an initial scope 3 quantification exercise; and 
 continue to incorporate climate risks and opportunities into our long-term business planning and strategy.

 CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING DISCLOSURE OF MINERAL PROPERTIES 
 Mineral Reserves and Resources 
 We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and applicable Canadian securities laws, and as a result we report our mineral reserves and mineral resources according to two different standards. U.S. reporting requirements, are governed by Item 1300 of Regulation S-K S-K 1300 ), as issued by the SEC. Canadian reporting requirements for disclosure of mineral properties are governed by National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects NI 43-101 ), as adopted from the definitions provided by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum. Both sets of reporting standards have similar goals in terms of conveying an appropriate level of confidence in the disclosures being reported, but the standards embody slightly different approaches and definitions. 
 In our public filings in the U.S. and Canada and in certain other announcements not filed with the SEC, we disclose proven and probable reserves and measured, indicated and inferred resources, each as defined in S-K 1300. The estimation of measured resources and indicated resources involve greater uncertainty as to their existence and economic feasibility than the estimation of proven and probable reserves, and therefore investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of measured or indicated resources will ever be converted into S-K 1300-compliant reserves. The estimation of inferred resources involves far greater uncertainty as to their existence and economic viability than the estimation of other categories of resources, and therefore it cannot be assumed that all or any part of inferred resources will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Therefore, 
 8 

investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of inferred resources exist, or that they can be mined legally or economically. 
 Technical Report Summaries and Qualified Persons 
 The scientific and technical information concerning our mineral projects in this Form 10-K have been reviewed and approved by qualified persons under S-K 1300, including our Director, Technical Services, Christopher Pascoe. For a description of the key assumptions, parameters and methods used to estimate mineral reserves and mineral resources included in this Form 10-K, as well as data verification procedures and a general discussion of the extent to which the estimates may be affected by any known environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, sociopolitical, marketing or other relevant factors, please review the Technical Report Summaries for each of the Company s material properties which are included as exhibits to, and incorporated by reference into, this Report.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY 
 Our results of operations, cash flows and operating costs are highly dependent upon the market prices of gold and silver and of key input commodities used in our business, which are volatile and beyond our control. 
 Gold and silver are actively traded commodities, and their prices are volatile. During the 12 months ended December 31, 2022, the high and low price for each commodity are set forth in the following table: 
 Metal High Price for 2022 Date Low Price for 2022 Date Gold (per ounce) 2,039 March 8, 2022 1,618 September 28, 2022 Silver (per ounce) 26.18 March 9, 2022 17.77 September 1, 2022 
 Gold and silver prices are affected by many factors beyond the Company s control, including U.S. dollar strength or weakness, speculation, global currency values, global and regional demand and production, political and economic conditions and other factors. In addition, Exchange Traded Funds ETFs ), which have substantially facilitated the ability of large and small investors to buy and sell precious metals, have become significant holders of gold and silver. Gold and silver prices are also affected by prevailing interest rates and returns on other asset classes, expectations of the future rate of inflation and governmental monetary decisions regarding central bank holdings. 
 Because we derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales of these metals, our results of operations and cash flows will fluctuate as the prices of these metals change. A period of significant and sustained lower prices would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In response to lower metal price and/or higher treatment and refining charge environments, we may have to revise our operating plans, including reducing operating costs and capital expenditures, terminating or suspending mining operations at one or more of our properties and discontinuing certain exploration and development plans. These types of initiatives may not sufficiently offset reductions in revenues, and we may continue to incur losses associated with sustained lower metals prices. 
 Operating costs at our mines are also affected by the price of input commodities, such as fuel, electricity, labor, chemical reagents, explosives, steel and concrete. Prices for these input commodities are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict, including global competition for resources, inflation (as was the case during 2022), currency fluctuations, consumer or industrial demand and other factors. An increase in the cost, or decrease in the availability, of input commodities, labor, or equipment, due to factors beyond the Company s control such as a pandemic or a similar public health threat, may affect the timely conduct and cost of our operations and development projects. Continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase could lead to higher costs, which would adversely affect results of operations and cash flows. 
 Volatility in metals prices may also impact the price of our outstanding securities. 
 Although our results of operations and cash flow will reflect fluctuations in the prices of the metals we produce, short term volatility in the prices of these metals due to speculation in the market may result in significant changes in the price of our securities, which may not be reflective of our operating performance or financial results. For example, the price of silver increased 14 between September 28, 2022 and October 4, 2022, and then decreased by 13 on October 19, 2022. This swing in the price of silver was seemingly attributable to a coordinated effort by market participants to drive up the price of silver and did not reflect changes in the underlying fundamentals that typically drive changes in the price of silver, including supply and demand. The price of our common stock increased by 13 and decreased by 6 during the same periods. The trading volume for shares of our common stock also increased significantly during this period. This volatility in the price of our common stock did not, in our view, reflect any significant change in our business or results of operations during the same period. 
 The estimation of mineral reserves and mineral resources is imprecise and depends upon subjective factors. Estimated mineral reserves and mineral resources may not be realized in actual production. Our results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected by inaccurate estimates. 
 The mineral reserve and mineral resource figures presented in our public filings are estimates made by our technical personnel and independent mining consultants with whom we contract. Mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates are a function of geological and engineering analyses that require us to make assumptions about production costs, recoveries and gold, silver, zinc and lead market prices. While the Company believes that its mineral reserve and resource estimates are developed using well-established practices and with appropriate controls, mineral reserve and mineral resource estimation is an imprecise and subjective process. The accuracy of these estimates is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation, judgment and experience. Assumptions about gold, silver, zinc and lead market prices are subject to great uncertainty as those prices fluctuate widely. Declines in the market prices of gold, silver, zinc or lead 
 10 

may render mineral reserves and mineral resources containing relatively lower grades of mineralization uneconomic to exploit, and we may be required to reduce mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates, discontinue development or mining at one or more of our properties or write down assets as impaired. Should we encounter mineralization or geologic formations at any of our mines or projects that are different from those predicted, we may adjust our mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates and alter our mining plans. No assurances can be given that any mineral resource estimate will ultimately be reclassified as proven or probable mineral reserves or that inferred resources will be upgraded to measured or indicated resources. Updates to our mining plans or new or updated technical or geological information may also impact anticipated metal recovery rates. Any of these adjustments may adversely affect actual operating performance, production, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 A significant delay or disruption in sales of concentrates or dor as a result of the unexpected disruption in services provided by smelters or refiners or other third parties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 We rely on refiners and smelters to refine and process and, in some cases, purchase, the gold and silver dor and gold and silver concentrate produced by our mines. Access to refiners and smelters on economic terms is critical to our ability to sell our products to buyers and generate revenues. We have existing agreements with refiners and smelters, some of whom operate their refining or smelting facilities outside the United States. We believe we currently have contractual arrangements with a sufficient number of refiners and smelters so that the loss of any one refiner or smelter would not significantly or materially impact our operations or our ability to generate revenues. Nevertheless, services provided by a refiner or smelter may be disrupted by new or increased tariffs, duties or other cross-border trade barriers, shipping delays, the bankruptcy or insolvency of one or more refiners or smelters or the inability to agree on acceptable commercial or legal terms with a refiner or smelter. Such an event or events may disrupt an existing relationship with a refiner or smelter or result in the inability to create (or the necessity to terminate) a contractual relationship with a refiner or smelter, which may leave us with limited, uneconomic or no access to refining or smelting services for short or long periods of time. Epidemics, pandemics or natural disasters may also impact refiners, smelters or other third parties with whom we have contractual arrangements or have an indirect effect on our ability to obtain refining, smelting or other third-party services. 
 Any delay or loss of access to refiners or smelters may significantly impact our ability to sell dor and concentrate products and generate revenues. A default by a refiner or smelter on its contractual obligations to us or an insolvency event or bankruptcy filing by a refiner or smelter may result in the loss of all or part of our dor or concentrate in the possession of the refiner or smelter, and such a loss likely would not be insured by our insurance policies. We cannot ensure that alternative refiners or smelters would be available or offer comparable terms if the need for them were to arise or that it would not experience delays or disruptions in sales that would materially and adversely affect results of operations. 
 There are significant hazards associated with mining activities, some of which may not be fully covered by insurance. 
 The mining business is subject to risks and hazards, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, the encountering of unusual or unexpected geological formations, cave-ins, flooding, earthquakes and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions or machine failure. These occurrences could result in damage to, or destruction of, mineral properties or production facilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage, reduced production and delays in mining, asset write-downs, monetary losses and possible legal liability. 
 We maintain insurance policies that protect against property loss and business interruption in amounts that we believe are reasonable taking into account the nature of, and risks related to, our business and operations as well as the cost of policy premiums. Such insurance is, however, subject to certain exclusions and potential claims could exceed policy limits. There is no guarantee that we will receive insurance proceeds with respect to a particular event or loss. Insurance fully covering many environmental risks, including potential liability for pollution or other hazards as a result of disposal of waste products occurring from exploration and production, is not generally available. Any liabilities that we incur for these risks and hazards could be significant and could adversely affect results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 
 RISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS 
 Our future growth will depend upon our ability to expand existing mines and develop and start-up new mines, either through exploration at existing properties or by acquisition of other mining companies or properties. 
 Because mines have limited lives based on proven and probable mineral reserves, our ability to achieve significant additional growth in revenues and cash flows will depend upon our success in further developing and expanding existing properties and the opportunistic acquisition or development and start-up of exploration projects or new mining properties, such as the Silvertip exploration property and the Lincoln Hill project and related assets. 
 While initial development of the Palmarejo, Rochester, and Kensington mines has been substantially completed, development work continues to expand these mines while leveraging existing infrastructure. Palmarejo completed open pit mining several years ago and evolved to be an underground-only operation, developing new underground mining operations. At 
 11 

Rochester, a crushing circuit using high pressure grinding roll HPGR technology was commissioned in 2019, and, in 2020, we obtained permitting for, and began construction of POA 11, which is a significant additional expansion expected to be completed in mid-2023, including the construction of a new leach pad, a crushing facility equipped with two HPGR units and a prescreen, processing facilities and related infrastructure to support the extension of Rochester s mine life. At Kensington, we completed development and commenced commercial production from a new deposit in 2018 and amended our operating permit to allow for an additional 10 years of mine life by providing for expanded tailings and waste rock storage, increased mill throughput, enhanced infrastructure and other benefits POA 1 ). Our ability to timely complete these and future mine expansion and mine life extension projects is dependent on numerous factors, many of which are outside of our control, including, among others, availability of funding on acceptable terms, timing of receipt of permits and approvals from regulatory authorities, obtaining materials and equipment and construction, engineering and other services at favorable prices and terms, and disputes with third-party providers of materials, equipment or services. The construction services related to POA 11 are being performed by contractors, which creates a risk of delays or additional costs to the project resulting from, among other factors: inability to negotiate contracts with favorable pricing and terms; delays in performance of the services; failure of a contractor to comply with applicable laws and regulations; termination of a contract by a contractor before completion of the services; failure by a contractor to obtain necessary equipment or materials; mismanagement by a contractor of its workforce; and insolvency or other financial difficulty encountered by a contractor which results in a delay in services or termination of a contract with the contractor. Expected project benefits are based on estimates of a variety of key factors, including mineral reserves and resources, grade, recovery rates, and operating costs among others. However, achieving results in line with those estimates is subject to risks and uncertainties such as variability in grade, recovery rates and cost inputs. For example, in 2022, Rochester experienced lower than expected silver recovery rates from its HPGR-crushed ore, which negatively impacted production, costs and cash flow. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to successfully expand or extend the lives of existing mining operations, and a completed project may not yield the anticipated operational or financial benefits, such as expected availability, throughput, metal recovery rates, concentrate quality, unit costs, operating margin and/or cash flows, any of which may have a material negative impact on returns on invested capital, operating costs or cash flows. 
 In addition, we acquired several mining properties in recent years, namely, the Lincoln Hill project and related assets and the Silvertip exploration property. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully develop and start-up new mining properties, restart mining and processing activities at the Silvertip exploration property or acquire additional mining properties on favorable economic terms or at all. 
 We regularly evaluate and engage in discussions or negotiations regarding acquisition opportunities. Any transactions that we contemplate or pursue would involve risks and uncertainties and would be subject to competition from other mining companies. There can be no assurance with respect to the timing, likelihood or business effect of any possible transaction. 
 We may be unable to successfully integrate, may not realize the expected benefits of recent or future acquisitions or may face risks associated with divestitures. 
 We regularly explore opportunities to selectively acquire other businesses or assets or to divest ourselves of all or part of certain assets in support of our growth plans and strategic objectives. There can be no assurance that the anticipated benefits of past acquisitions (including the Silvertip exploration property and Lincoln Hill project) or any future acquisition, will be realized on the originally anticipated timeline or at all. The success and the ability to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition will depend upon our ability to effectively manage the integration, performance and operations of entities or properties we acquire. The process of managing acquired businesses or assets may involve unforeseen challenges and may require a disproportionate amount of our resources, which may divert focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and/or from operational matters during this process. As an example, the ramp up of the Silvertip exploration property, acquired in late 2017, was slower and less profitable than originally anticipated, due primarily to more significant mill availability and maintenance challenges than were anticipated at the time Silvertip was acquired, as well as deteriorating zinc and lead market conditions. 
 In addition to the above, any acquisition would be accompanied by risks, including: 
 a significant change in macroeconomic conditions, including commodity prices, treatment and refining charges or stock prices after we have committed to complete the transaction and established the purchase price or exchange ratio; 
 additional debt incurred or issued to fund some or all of acquisition consideration (as was the case with Silvertip and Wharf), resulting in increased interest expense and other borrowing costs; 
 issuance of equity securities as acquisition consideration (which occurred in the Lincoln Hill and Silvertip project acquisitions), resulting in dilution of our existing stockholders; 
 a material ore body may prove to be below our expectations; 
 12 

processing facilities may not operate as well as anticipated, and may require significant maintenance, downtime and capital investment, such as the mill at Silvertip; 
 difficulties integrating and assimilating the operations and personnel of any acquired companies and supporting expanded operations, realizing anticipated synergies and maximizing the financial and strategic position of the combined enterprise, and maintaining uniform standards, policies and controls across the organization; 
 difficulties or loss of social license to operate resulting from failure of efforts to establish positive relationships and/or agreements with local communities or local indigenous peoples; and 
 the acquired business or assets may have significant liabilities, such as environmental liabilities, or significant capital expenditures that we failed to discover or have underestimated. 
 We cannot predict the impact of future acquisitions on the price of our common stock or assure that we will be able to obtain necessary acquisition or development financing on acceptable terms or at all. Unprofitable acquisitions, or additional liabilities, indebtedness or issuances of securities in connection with such acquisitions or any future mine development, may negatively affect our results of operations. 
 The Company recently sold its interests in the Crown, Sterling and La Preciosa projects. In connection with these dispositions, the Company has provided representations and warranties and indemnities customary for transactions of these types. There may be a risk that the Company may incur liability in the future associated with assets it no longer owns or in which it has a reduced interest. 
 Significant investment risks and operational costs are associated with exploration and development activities. These risks and costs may result in lower economic returns and may adversely affect our business. 
 Our ability to sustain or increase current production levels depends in part on successful exploration and development of new ore bodies and expansion of existing mining operations. Substantial expenditures are required to establish mineral reserves, to extract metals from ore and, in the case of new properties, to construct mining and processing facilities. 
 Our plans include several significant projects to construct or upgrade mining and processing facilities at our existing mining operations or exploration properties, including the POA 11 expansion project at Rochester and the POA 1 planned mine life extension at Kensington, and future plans to develop the Silvertip and Lincoln Hill projects. These projects can take up to several months or years to complete, are complex and require significant capital expenditures. These projects are subject to significant risks described in this Item, any of which may have a material negative impact on returns on invested capital, operating costs or cash flows. 
 Mineral exploration involves many risks and is frequently unproductive. Even if mineral deposits are found, those deposits may be insufficient in quantity and quality to return a profit from production, or it may take a number of years until production is possible, during which time the economic viability of the project may change. Few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. The commercial viability of a mineral deposit, once developed, depends on a number of factors, including: the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure; government regulations including taxes, royalties and land tenure; land use; importing and exporting of minerals; environmental protection; mineral prices; and issuance and maintenance of necessary permits. Factors that affect adequacy of infrastructure include: reliability of roads, bridges, power sources and water supply; unusual or infrequent weather phenomena; sabotage; and government or other interference in the maintenance or provision of such infrastructure. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination may result in not receiving an adequate return on invested capital. 
 In addition, exploration projects, such as the Silvertip or Lincoln Hill projects may have little or no operating history upon which to base estimates of future operating costs and capital requirements. Exploration project items such as estimates of resources and reserves, metal recoveries and cash operating costs are to a large extent based upon the interpretation of geologic data, obtained from a limited number of drill holes and other sampling techniques, and feasibility studies. Estimates of operating costs are then derived based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of ore to be mined and processed, the configuration of the ore body, expected recovery rates of metals from the ore, comparable facility and equipment costs, anticipated climate conditions and other factors. As a result, actual operating costs and economic returns of any and all exploration projects may materially differ from the costs and returns estimated, and accordingly, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected. 
 The Company may be affected by global supply chain disruptions. 
 The Company may face supply chain disruptions as a result of macroeconomic matters outside of the Company s control or ability to mitigate, such as natural disasters, transportation disruptions, economic instability, and global pandemics, among others. Most recently, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has resulted in losses of life, displacement of people, and 
 13 

political and economic disruptions on a global scale. There may be unforeseen impacts from these events globally on commodity prices, liquidity and credit or supply chains, and the Company continues to monitor them closely. 
 We may be required to write down certain long-lived assets, due to metal prices, operational challenges or other factors. Such write- downs may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 We review our long-lived assets for recoverability pursuant to the Financial Accounting Standard Board s Accounting Standards Codification Section 360. Under that standard, we review the recoverability of our long-lived assets, such as our mining properties, upon a triggering event. Such review involves estimating the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Impairment, measured by comparing an asset s carrying value to its fair value, must be recognized when the carrying value of the asset exceeds these cash flows. We conduct a review of the financial performance of our mines in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for each reported period and determine whether any triggering events are indicated. 
 If there are significant and sustained declines in relevant metal prices, or if we fail to control production and operating costs or realize the mineable ore reserves at its mining properties, we may terminate or suspend mining operations at one or more properties. These events could require a further write-down of the carrying value of our assets. Any such actions would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 We may record other types of charges in the future if we sell a property or asset for a price less than its carrying value or have to increase reclamation liabilities in connection with the closure and reclamation of a property. Any additional write-downs of mining properties or other assets could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Coeur is an international company and is exposed to political and social risks associated with its foreign operations. 
 A significant portion of our revenues is generated by operations outside the United States. Exploration, development, production and closure activities in many countries are potentially subject to heightened political and social risks that are beyond our control and could result in increased costs, capacity constraints and potential disruptions to our business. These risks include the possible unilateral cancellation or forced renegotiation of contracts in which we, directly or indirectly, may have an interest, unfavorable changes in foreign laws and regulations, royalty and tax increases (including taxes associated with the import or export of goods), risks associated with the value-added tax VAT and income tax refund recovery and collection process, erection of trade barriers, including tariffs and duties, claims by governmental entities or indigenous communities, expropriation or nationalization of property and other risks arising out of foreign sovereignty over areas in which our operations are conducted. As an example, as disclosed in Note 19 -- Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are currently engaged in efforts to recover VAT paid to the Mexican government that is owed to Coeur associated with Coeur Mexicana s prior royalty agreement, including through international arbitration. While the Company believes that it remains legally entitled to be refunded the full amount of the VAT receivable and intends to rigorously continue its VAT recovery efforts, based on the continued failure to recover the VAT receivable and unfavorable Mexican court decisions, the Company determined to write down the carrying value of the VAT receivable of 26.0 million at September 2021. The right to import and export gold and silver may depend on obtaining certain licenses and quotas, which could be delayed or denied at the discretion of the relevant regulatory authorities, or could become subject to new taxes, tariffs or duties imposed by U.S. or foreign jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or future prospects. In addition, our rights under local law may be less secure in countries where judicial systems are susceptible to manipulation and intimidation by government agencies, non-governmental organizations or civic groups. 
 Any of these developments could require us to curtail or terminate operations at our mines, incur significant costs to renegotiate contracts, meet newly-imposed environmental or other standards, pay greater royalties or higher prices for labor or services and recognize higher taxes, or experience significant delays or obstacles in the recovery of VAT or income tax refunds owed, which could materially and adversely affect financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Our operations outside the United States also expose us to economic and operational risks. 
 Our operations outside the United States also expose us to economic and operational risks. Local economic conditions, as well as epidemics, pandemics or natural disasters, can cause shortages of skilled workers and supplies, increase costs and adversely affect the security of operations. In addition, higher incidences of criminal activity and violence in the area of some of our foreign operations, including drug cartel-related violence in Mexico, could adversely affect our ability to operate in an optimal fashion and may impose greater risks of extortion and theft and greater risks to our personnel, supply of goods and services to our operations and our property. These conditions, including security concerns in certain communities surrounding the Palmarejo complex in 2022 impacting third party deliveries of supplies to Palmarejo, could adversely impact our operations and lead to lower productivity and higher costs, which would adversely affect results of operations and cash flows. 
 In addition, acts of civil disobedience are not uncommon in areas in Mexico where our operations or projects are located. In recent years, many mining companies have been the targets of actions to restrict their legally entitled access to 
 14 

mining concessions or property. Such acts of civil disobedience often occur with no warning and can result in significant direct and indirect costs. We cannot provide assurance that there will be no disruptions to site access in the future, which could adversely affect our business. 
 We sell silver and gold dor , gold concentrate, and silver concentrate in U.S. dollars, but we conduct operations outside the United States in local currency. Currency exchange movements could also adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Our success depends on developing and maintaining relationships with local communities and other stakeholders. 
 Our ongoing and future success depends on developing and maintaining productive relationships with the communities surrounding our operations, including indigenous peoples who may have rights or may assert rights to certain of our properties, and other stakeholders in our operating locations. We believe our operations can provide valuable benefits to surrounding communities, in terms of direct employment, training and skills development and other benefits associated with ongoing payment of taxes. In addition, we seek to maintain our partnerships and relationships with local communities, including indigenous peoples, and stakeholders in a variety of ways, including in-kind contributions, volunteer time, sponsorships and donations. There is an increasing level of public concern relating to the perceived effect of mining activities on indigenous communities. Evolving expectations related to human rights, indigenous interests and environmental protection may result in opposition to the Company s current or future activities. Notwithstanding our ongoing efforts, local communities and stakeholders can become dissatisfied with our activities or the level of benefits provided, which may result in legal or administrative proceedings, civil unrest, protests, direct action or campaigns against us or our operations. Any such occurrences could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Our mining assets are subject to geotechnical and hydrological risks, and a related incident could materially and adversely impact our production, profitability and financial condition and the value of our common stock. 
 Our mining assets are subject to geotechnical and hydrological risks which could impact the structural integrity of our mines, stockpiles, leach pads and tailings storage facilities. No assurances can be given that unanticipated adverse geotechnical and hydrological conditions, such as landslides, pit wall failures or tailings dam instability will not occur in the future or that such events will be detected in advance. Geotechnical and hydrological instabilities can be difficult to predict and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control, such as severe weather and considerable rainfall, which may lead to periodic floods, mudslides, wall instability and seismic activity, which may result in slippage of material. 
 Waste rock in the form of tailings generated as a by-product of processed ore is produced at the Kensington and Palmarejo Mines. We place tailings into engineered containments, underground as structural backfill, and as a dry stack material. In response to several recent tailings dam failures unrelated to our operations that have involved loss of life and resulted in severe property and environmental ecosystem damage, we completed a comprehensive review of our tailings dams and operational practices to characterize our risk profile. We concluded that our tailings dams represent a low exposure risk profile for several reasons, including that our tailings dams were constructed using construction methods recognized in the industry as the most stable tailings dam design using high strength and chemically stable rock in construction. Our dams are continuously monitored and inspected by internal resources as well as third-party industry qualified experts. The significant dam failure events at third party locations that have occurred in recent years may lead to regulatory governance changes stemming from updated laws, regulation or guidance, which could result in increased operational and compliance costs if we need to make changes to existing facilities. The failure of a tailings dam or tailings storage facility at one of our mine sites could result in severe, and in some cases catastrophic, property and environmental damage and loss of life. Geotechnical or hydrological failures could result in limited or restricted access to mine sites, suspension of operations, government investigations, lawsuits filed by parties who suffer injuries or property damage from such events, increased monitoring costs, remediation costs, loss of mineral reserves and resources and other impacts, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position as well as the value of our common stock. 
 Our estimates of future production, costs, expenditures and financial results are imprecise, depend upon subjective factors, may not be realized in actual production and such estimates speak only as of their respective dates. 
 We have in the past, and may in the future, provide estimates and projections of our future production, costs, expenditures and financial results. Any such information is forward-looking. Neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines these forward-looking statements and, accordingly, do not express any opinion or any other form of assurance on these estimates and projections. Estimates and projections are made by our management and technical personnel and are qualified by, and subject to the assumptions contained or referred in the filing, release or presentation in which they are made, including assumptions about the availability, accessibility, sufficiency and quality of mineralization, recovery rates, our costs of production, the market prices of gold and silver, our ability to sustain and increase production levels, the ability to produce and sell marketable concentrates and dor and related treatment and refining charges, the sufficiency of our infrastructure, the performance of our personnel and equipment, our ability to maintain and obtain mining interests and permits, the state of government and community relations, and our 
 15 

compliance with existing and future laws and regulations. We sometimes state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges. Actual results and experience may differ materially from these assumptions. Any production, cost, expenditure or financial results estimates speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we disclaim any intent or obligation to update such estimates, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Accordingly, these forward-looking statements should be considered in the context in which they are made, and undue reliance should not be placed on them. 
 Our use of derivative contracts to protect against market price volatility exposes us to risk of opportunity loss, mark-to-market fair value adjustments, potential cash collateral calls and exposure to counterparty credit risk. 
 We have in the past and in the future may enter into price risk management contracts to protect against fluctuations in the price of gold and silver, foreign currency rates and changes in the prices of fuel and other input costs. These contracts could include forward sales or purchase contracts, futures contracts, purchased or sold put and call options and other derivative instruments. We entered into price risk management contracts on 2021, 2022 and 2023 gold sales after a significant increase in gold prices during 2019 and 2020. We determined to implement these contracts to provide for a minimum level of revenue from the sales of the covered gold ounces in order to mitigate the risk of not being able to fund all or a portion of the costs of several significant projects at existing operations such as POA 11 as well as provide greater certainty in our planning and budgeting process. As of December 31, 2022, contracts with respect to 130,500 ounces of gold were outstanding. See Note 15 Derivative Financial Instruments in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 The use of derivative instruments can expose us to risk of an opportunity loss and may also result in significant mark-to-market fair value adjustments, which may require us to post cash or other collateral or have a material adverse impact on reported financial results. Our exposure may be particularly acute for our derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges, because those contracts are cash net settled on a monthly basis. The ceiling on the gold ounces covered by the price risk management contracts described above, representing the highest price we could realize for those ounces under outstanding contracts, averages approximately 1,957 per ounce for 2023 production. The price ceiling may be lower than actual spot gold prices at the time of sale under those contracts. In early 2023, the Company added 49,998 ounces of gold forward contracts and 3.2 million ounces of silver forward contracts that settle monthly through December 2023. Taking into account the additional gold and silver hedges added in early 2023 the weighted average fixed price on the forward contracts is 1,961 per ounce of gold and 24.55 per ounce of silver. On February 22, 2023, the closing price of gold and silver was 1,836 and 21.86 per ounce, respectively. We are exposed to credit risk with contract counterparties, including, but not limited to, sales contracts and derivative contracts. In the event of nonperformance in connection with a contract, we could be exposed to a loss of value for that contract. 
 We are dependent upon information technology systems, which are subject to cybersecurity incidents, disruption, damage, failure and other risks associated with implementation and integration. 
 Our information technology systems used in our operations are subject to disruption, damage or failure from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches, cyberattacks, natural disasters and defects in design. Cybersecurity incidents, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data or machines and equipment, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, the corruption of data or the disabling, misuse or malfunction of machines and equipment. Various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to information technology systems and network disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information or operational technology disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, operating accidents, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on cash flows, financial condition or results of operations. 
 We could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems are defective, not installed properly or not properly integrated into operations. Various measures have been implemented to manage the risks related to the system implementation and modification, but system modification failures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. Although the Company has not experienced any material loss to date relating to cybersecurity, there can be no assurance that the Company will not incur such loss in the future. 
 We may be expected to continue enhancing our ESG practices to meet evolving and inconsistent standards. 
 ESG factors, including climate-related initiatives such as GHG emissions targets and climate risk management, are increasingly becoming a metric for institutional shareholders to review and assess the performance of the Company and a significant factor in their investment decisions. We believe we have established ourselves as a leader among peers in ESG and 
 16 

continued to advance our ESG initiatives in 2022, including publishing our 2021 ESG Report, which included specific, objective goals to continue to improve our industry leading safety record, reduce the net intensity of our GHG emissions across the Company, build on our commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and protect critical habitat. However, there are no assurances that our efforts will be sufficient or meet the standards set by ESG analysts or institutional or other investors. 
 Our operations may be disrupted, and our financial results may be adversely affected by an outbreak of infectious disease or pandemic. 
 An outbreak of infectious disease, pandemic or a similar public health threat, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the response thereto, could adversely impact our business and operations. If a significant portion of our workforce becomes unable to work or travel to our operations due to illness or state or federal government restrictions (including travel restrictions and shelter-in-place and similar orders restricting certain activities that may be issued or extended by authorities), we may be forced to reduce or suspend operations at one or more of our mines, which could reduce production, limit exploration activities and development projects and impact liquidity and financial results. While we have implemented several initiatives to protect the health and safety of our employees, contractors and communities to date, some of which have and may result in additional costs to us, there can be no assurance that the Company will remain unaffected by potential future health crises. 
 Illnesses or government restrictions, including potential closure of national borders, related to COVID-19 or a similar public health threat may disrupt the supply of raw goods, equipment, supplies and services upon which our operations rely. 
 Third parties with whom we conduct business, including the refiners and smelters that process and, in some cases, purchase the dor and concentrate produced by our mines, are also subject to these risks and may be required to reduce or suspend operations, which could impact our ability to conduct our operations, advance exploration, development and expansion projects, sell our products and generate revenues. 
 To the extent the COVID-19 or any other pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Risk Factors section as well as those contained in the 2021 10-K, such as those relating to our operations and indebtedness and financing. Because of the highly uncertain and dynamic nature of events relating to the COVID-19 or similar pandemic, it is not currently possible to estimate the full impact of the pandemic on our business. However, these effects could have a material impact on our operations, and we will continue to monitor such situations closely. 
 Our business depends on good relations with, and the retention and hiring of, employees. 
 We may experience labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions in production that could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Labor disruptions may be used to advocate labor, political or social goals, particularly at non-U.S. mines. For example, labor disruptions may occur in sympathy with strikes or labor unrest in other sectors of local economies. We cannot assure that work stoppages, union organizing activities or other disruptions will not occur in the future. Any such work stoppage or disruption could expose us to significant costs and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
 We compete with other mining companies to attract and retain key executives, skilled labor, contractors and other employees. We may be unable to continue to attract and retain skilled and experienced employees, which could have an adverse effect on our competitive position or adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition. 
 Continuation of our mining operations is dependent on the availability of sufficient and affordable water supplies. 
 Our mining operations require significant quantities of water for mining, ore processing and related support facilities. In particular, our properties in Mexico and Nevada are in areas where water is scarce and competition among users for continuing access to water is significant. Continuous production and mine development is dependent on our ability to acquire and maintain water rights and claims and to defeat claims adverse to current water uses in legal proceedings. Although each of our operating mines currently has sufficient water rights and claims to cover its operational demands, we cannot predict the potential outcome of pending or future legal proceedings relating to enforcement of water rights, claims and uses, or potential pressure from other users of water, government agencies and officials, and/or non-governmental organizations to limit the amount of water made available to or used for mining activities, regardless of legally valid water rights. Water shortages may also result from weather or environmental and climate impacts outside of our control. Shortages in water supply could result in production and processing interruptions. In addition, the scarcity of water in certain regions could result in increased costs to obtain sufficient quantities of water to conduct our operations. The loss of some or all water rights, ongoing litigation to enforce existing water rights, ongoing shortages of water to which we have rights and/or significantly higher costs to obtain sufficient quantities of water could result in our inability to maintain production at current or expected levels, require us to curtail or shut down mining operations and could prevent us from pursuing expansion or development opportunities, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Laws and regulations may be introduced in some jurisdictions in which 
 17 

we operate which could also limit access to sufficient water resources, adversely affecting our existing operations or our expansion or development plans. 
 We may not be able to recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets. 
 We have accrued deferred tax assets in various jurisdictions from past operating losses, however, we may not be able to utilize part or all of these assets in the future. We recognize the expected future tax benefit from these assets only if it is considered more likely than not that the tax benefit will be realized. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied against deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be utilized. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income, including application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction, assumptions about future metals prices, the macroeconomic environment and results of our operations. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, our ability to realize deferred tax assets could be impacted. Additionally, future changes in tax laws could limit our ability to obtain the future benefits represented by our deferred tax assets and annual limitations may impact the timeframe over which the net operating loss carryforwards can be used, potentially impacting cash tax liabilities in a future period. 
 RISKS RELATED TO INDEBTEDNESS AND FINANCING 
 Our future operating performance may not generate cash flows sufficient to meet debt payment obligations. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 515.9 million of outstanding indebtedness. Our ability to make scheduled debt payments on outstanding indebtedness will depend on future results of operations and cash flows. Our results of operations and cash flows, in part, are subject to economic factors beyond our control, including the market prices of gold and silver, among other factors described in this Item. Although we have been successful in repaying or refinancing debt historically, there can be no assurance that we can continue to do so. We may not be able to generate enough cash flow to meet obligations and commitments under outstanding debt instruments. 
 If and to the extent liquidity resources are insufficient to support short- and long-term expenditures, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, dispose of material assets or operations, incur additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We cannot predict whether we would be able to refinance debt, issue equity or debt securities or dispose of assets to raise funds on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company. In a rising interest rate environment, the costs of borrowing additional funds or refinancing outstanding indebtedness would also be expected to increase. The agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due. 
 The terms of our debt impose restrictions on our operations. 
 The agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness include a number of significant negative covenants. These covenants, among other things: 
 limit our ability to obtain additional financing, repurchase outstanding equity or issue debt securities; 
 require us to meet certain financial covenants including a senior secured leverage ratio, a consolidated net leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio; 
 require a portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, which reduces the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; 
 limit our ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets, enter into transactions with and invest capital in affiliates, enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends, consolidate, amalgamate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets; 
 increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; 
 limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete; and 
 place us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors. 
 18 

A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement governing our outstanding indebtedness that, if not cured or waived, could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the debt to be due and payable immediately. Acceleration of any debt could result in cross-defaults under our other debt instruments. Our inability to meet any of these covenants may also result in a lender requiring us to agree to additional restrictive covenants which may, among other things, limit our ability to fund our existing operations or incur additional indebtedness. Our assets and cash flow may be insufficient to repay borrowings fully under all of our outstanding debt instruments if any of our debt instruments are accelerated upon an event of default, which could force the Company into bankruptcy or liquidation. 
 Any downgrade in the credit ratings assigned to us or our debt securities could increase future borrowing costs, adversely affect the availability of new financing and may result in increased collateral requirements under our existing surety bond portfolio. 
 There can be no assurance that any rating currently assigned by Standard Poor s Rating Services or Moody s Investors Service to us or our debt securities will remain unchanged for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered if, in that rating agency s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant. If we are unable to maintain our outstanding debt and financial ratios at levels acceptable to the credit rating agencies, or should our business prospects or financial results deteriorate, including as a result of declines in gold and silver prices or other factors beyond our control, our ratings could be downgraded by the rating agencies. A downgrade by the rating agencies could adversely affect the value of our outstanding debt securities, our existing debt, and our ability to obtain new financing on favorable terms, if at all, increase borrowing costs, and may result in increased collateral requirements under our existing surety bond portfolio, which in turn may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. 
 RISKS RELATED TO APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS 
 We are subject to significant governmental regulations, including the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Act, the Health, Safety and Reclamation Code for Mines under the British Columbia Mines Act and Relevant Sections of the Mexican Official Regulations, and related costs and delays associated with compliance may negatively affect our business. 
 Mining activities are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing environmental protection, natural resources, prospecting, development, production, post-closure reclamation, taxes, labor standards and occupational health and safety laws and regulations, including mine safety, toxic substances and other matters. The costs associated with compliance with such laws and regulations are substantial. Changes in existing laws, possible future laws and regulations, or more restrictive interpretations of current laws and regulations by governmental authorities, could cause additional expense, capital expenditures, restrictions on or suspensions of operations and delays in the development of new properties. 
 U.S. surface and underground mines like the Kensington, Rochester and Wharf mines are regularly inspected by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration MSHA ). These inspections may lead to written citations or violation notices, which are reported in Exhibit 95.1 to this Report. Recently, MSHA has been conducting more comprehensive inspections of mining operations in general, focusing on miner health and critical safety hazards. Similar inspections are conducted in British Columbia, Canada, at the Silvertip exploration property and in Mexico at the Palmarejo complex by the British Columbia Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources and the Mexican Secretaria del Trabajo y Prevision Social (Secretary of Labor and Social Safety), respectively. 
 Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permitting requirements may result in temporary or extended shutdowns, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities causing operations to cease or be curtailed, which may require corrective measures including the payment of fines or penalties, capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment or remedial actions, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 Compliance with environmental regulations and litigation based on environmental regulations could require significant expenditures. 
 Environmental regulations mandate, among other things, the maintenance of air and water quality standards, land development and land reclamation, and set forth limitations on the generation, transportation, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. Environmental legislation and environmental justice provisions are evolving in a manner that may require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects, and a heightened degree of responsibility for mining companies and their officers, directors and employees. We may incur environmental costs that could have a material adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations. Any failure to remedy an environmental problem could require us to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy. The environmental standards that ultimately may be imposed at a mine site affect the cost of remediation and could exceed the financial accruals that we have made for such remediation. 
 19 

The potential exposure may be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Moreover, governmental authorities and private parties may bring lawsuits based upon damage to property and injury to persons resulting from the environmental, health and safety impacts of prior and current operations, including operations conducted by other mining companies many years ago at sites located on properties that we currently or formerly owned. These lawsuits could lead to the imposition of substantial fines, remediation costs, penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions. Substantial costs and liabilities, including for restoring the environment after the closure of mines, are inherent in our operations. We cannot assure that any such law, regulation, enforcement or private claim would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 Some of the mining waste from our U.S. mines currently are exempt to a limited extent from the extensive set of EPA regulations governing hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act RCRA ). If the EPA were to repeal this exemption, and designate these mining wastes as hazardous under RCRA, we would be required to make significant expenditures to manage the waste and to construct hazardous waste storage or disposal facilities. Under the Mercury Export Ban Act of 2008 MEBA ), incidental elemental mercury generated at our Rochester mine as part of the processing of ore may not be exported outside of the United States and is required to be stored in a facility capable for long-term mercury management designated by the U.S. Department of Energy DOE ). The DOE is undergoing processes to designate such a facility and to establish storage and handling fees, which is not yet final. The outcome could result in material cost being incurred to ship and store Coeur Rochester's mercury. In addition, if any of these wastes causes contamination in or damage to the environment at a U.S. mining facility, that facility could be designated as a Superfund site under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act CERCLA ). Under CERCLA, any present owner or operator of a Superfund site or the owner or operator at the time of contamination may be held jointly and severally liable regardless of fault and may be forced to undertake extensive remedial cleanup action or to pay for the cleanup efforts. The owner or operator also may be liable to federal, state and tribal/indigenous governmental entities for the cost of damages to natural resources, which could be substantial. Additional regulations or requirements also are imposed on our tailings and waste disposal areas in Alaska under the federal Clean Water Act CWA ), in Nevada under the Nevada Water Pollution Control Law which implements the CWA, in South Dakota under the South Dakota Water Pollution Control Act and the Administrative Rules of the State of South Dakota, in British Columbia (Canada) under the Health, Safety and Reclamation Code for Mines in British Columbia, the British Columbia Environmental Management Act and the Canadian Metal and Diamond Mining Effluent Regulations, and in Mexico under the General Law of Ecological Balance and Protection of the Environment (the "GLEBPE") and the regulations under the GLEBPE related to environmental protection in impact assessment matters. 
 Airborne emissions are subject to controls under air pollution statutes implementing the Clean Air Act in the U.S., and are regulated under the Environmental Management Act in British Columbia (Canada) and the GLEBPE and the regulations under GLEBPE related to prevention and control of the pollution of the atmosphere in Mexico. In addition, there are numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives related to climate change, reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, or energy policy and adoption of these initiatives through legislative actions or administrative policy could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and cash flows. 
 In addition, U.S. environmental conservation efforts could result in the withdrawal of certain federal lands from mineral entry under the Mining Law, which could have the effect of restricting our current or future planned activities involving our unpatented mining claims on the affected public lands. 
 We are required to obtain and renew governmental permits in order to conduct operations, a process which is often costly and time-consuming. Our ability to obtain necessary government permits to expand operations or begin new operations may be materially affected by third-party activists. 
 In the normal course of our business, we are required to obtain and renew governmental permits for exploration, operations and expansion of existing operations and for the development of new projects, such as the permits recently obtained for POA 11 at Rochester, POA 1 at Kensington and at Palmarejo to allow the deposit of future tailings into the legacy open pit rather than expand the current tailings impoundment facility. Obtaining and renewing governmental permits is a complex and time-consuming process. The timeliness and success of permitting efforts are contingent upon many variables not within our control, including the interpretation of permit approval requirements administered by the applicable permitting authority and government and third-party sentiment towards the mining industry generally. We may not be able to obtain or renew permits that are necessary to our operations or the cost and time required to obtain or renew permits may exceed our expectations. Any unexpected delays or costs associated with the permitting process could delay the development or impede the operation of a mine, which in turn could materially adversely affect our revenues and future growth. For example, we experienced prolonged delays by the Mexican federal environmental authority, SEMARNAT, in approving the permit described above to deposit future tailings into the legacy open pit at Palmarejo. As has been publicized in media coverage, we understand that other mining projects in Mexico are also experiencing permitting delays or, in certain circumstances, denials of permits. Any delay in obtaining a permit may require us to revise mine plans or curtail expected production, which could materially adversely affect 
 20 

results of operations and cash flow. In addition, key permits and approvals may be revoked or suspended or may be changed in a manner that adversely affects our operations. 
 Private parties such as environmental activists frequently attempt to intervene in the permitting process and to persuade regulators to deny necessary permits or seek to overturn permits that have been issued. Obtaining the necessary governmental permits is a complex and time-consuming process involving numerous jurisdictions and often involving public hearings and costly undertakings. These third-party actions can materially increase the costs and cause delays in the permitting process and could cause us to not proceed with the development or expansion of a mine. In addition, our ability to successfully obtain key permits and approvals to explore for, develop, operate and expand mines and to conduct our operations will likely depend on our ability to develop, operate, expand and close mines in a manner that is consistent with the creation of social and economic benefits in the surrounding communities, which may or may not be required by law. Our ability to obtain permits and approvals and to successfully operate in particular communities may be adversely impacted by real or perceived detrimental events associated with our activities or those of other mining companies affecting the environment, human health and safety of communities in which we operate. 
 Our business is subject to anti-bribery laws, a breach or violation of which could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, loss of licenses or permits and reputational harm. 
 We operate in certain jurisdictions that have experienced governmental and private sector corruption. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as well as Canadian and Mexican anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other commercial advantage. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, litigation, and loss of operating licenses or permits, and may damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and other corporate policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws and we provide training and education on these topics to our employees; however, there can be no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from recklessness, fraudulent behavior, dishonesty or other inappropriate acts or violations of laws committed by our affiliates, employees or agents. 
 We are subject to litigation and may be subject to additional litigation in the future. 
 We are currently, and may in the future become, subject to other litigation, arbitration (including the current NAFTA arbitration matter involving recovery of Mexican VAT) or proceedings with other parties. If decided adversely to us, these legal proceedings, or others that could be brought against us in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or prospects. We are currently engaged in litigation with a third party regarding the terms of a royalty impacting a portion of the Kensington mine property. While we believe our claims and counter-claims in this matter are valid, litigation matters are inherently uncertain and there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves or that our assessment of the materiality and the likely outcome of this matter will be consistent with the ultimate resolution of the matter. Responding to disputes, even those that are without merit or ultimately decided in our favor, may require us to incur significant expense, devote significant resources, and may generate adverse publicity, which could materially and adversely affect our business. In the event of a dispute arising at our foreign operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitral panels or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts or arbitral panels in the United States. Our inability to enforce our rights and the enforcement of rights on a prejudicial basis by foreign courts or arbitral panels could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. 
 Disputes regarding our mining claims, concessions or surface rights to land in the vicinity of our mining projects could adversely impact operations. 
 The validity of mining or exploration claims, concessions or rights, which constitute most of our property holdings, is often uncertain and may be contested. We have used commercially reasonable efforts, in accordance with industry standards, to investigate our title or claims to our various properties, however, no assurance can be given that applicable governments will not revoke or significantly alter the conditions of the applicable exploration and mining claims, concessions or rights or that such exploration and mining claims, concessions or rights will not be challenged by third parties. Although we have attempted to acquire satisfactory title to undeveloped properties, in accordance with mining industry practice we do not generally obtain title opinions until a decision is made to develop a property. As a result, some titles, particularly titles to undeveloped properties may be defective. Defective title to any of our exploration and mining claims, concessions or rights could result in litigation, insurance claims and potential losses affecting our business as a whole. There may be challenges to the title of any of the claims comprising our projects that, if successful, could impair development and operations. A defect could result in us losing all or a portion of our right, title, estate and interest in and to the properties to which the title defect relates. 
 In Mexico, while mineral rights are administered by the federal government through federally issued mining concessions, federally recognized agrarian communities called ejidos control surface or surface access rights to the land. An ejido may sell or lease lands directly to a private entity. While we have agreements or are in the process of negotiating 
 21 

agreements with the ejidos that impact all of our projects in Mexico, some of these agreements may be subject to renegotiation or legal challenges. 
 The Company s effective tax rate could be volatile and materially change as a result of changes in tax laws, mix of earnings and other factors. 
 We are subject to tax laws in the United States and several foreign jurisdictions. U.S. President Biden s administration (the Administration has called for changes to fiscal and tax policies, which may include comprehensive tax reform. 
 The Administration has previously proposed an increase in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 21 to 28 , doubling the rate of tax on certain earnings of foreign subsidiaries, a 15 minimum tax on worldwide book income, and other various tax law changes. If any or all of these (or similar) proposals are enacted into law, in whole or in part, they could have a negative impact on the Company s effective tax rate. 
 Additionally, the jurisdictions in which we operate have and may in the future continue to encounter financial difficulties resulting from one or both of lower tax revenue and new and increased costs related to continuing to manage COVID-19 or remedy its impact. National, state or local governments may seek to raise existing taxes or introduce new taxes which may adversely affect our business and financial results. 
 Currently, the Company incurs losses in certain countries where it does not receive a financial statement benefit, and the Company operates in countries which have different statutory rates. Consequently, changes in the mix and source of earnings between countries could have a material impact on the Company s overall effective tax rate. 
 In addition, new tax legislation in certain jurisdictions where we operate could negatively affect us. For example, in Nevada, where the Rochester mine and Lincoln Hill project are located, in response to a significant loss of tourism and gaming revenue during 2020, in June 2021 the Governor signed into law a new excise tax on gross proceeds derived from mining gold and silver. In addition, there have been recent proposals by elected officials in Mexico for even more significant increases in mining taxes, although it is unclear whether those proposals will result in legislation. It is difficult to predict whether proposed changes to tax laws in the jurisdictions where we operate will be passed and if passed, the impact of those changes on the Company. Any additional taxes imposed on us could adversely affect our financial condition. 
 RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK 
 We have the ability to issue additional equity securities, including in connection with an acquisition of other companies, which would lead to dilution of our issued and outstanding common stock and may materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock. 
 The issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, whether to acquire new companies or businesses or for other strategic benefits, would result in dilution of our existing stockholders equity ownership. In March 2022 and December 2022, the Company completed 100.0 million and 50.0 million at the market offerings of its common stock, par value 0.01 per share, respectively, and sold a tota l of 36.8 million shares of common stock at an average price of 4.07 per share. 
 We are authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, 10.0 million shares of preferred stock in one or more series, to establish the number of shares to be included in each series and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and relative participating, optional, conversion and other special rights of the shares of each series as well as the qualification, limitations or restrictions on each series. Any series of preferred stock could contain dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights of holders of our common stock. If we issue additional equity securities, the price of our common stock may be materially and adversely affected. 
 Holders of our common stock may not receive dividends. 
 We have not historically declared cash dividends on our common stock. Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. We are incorporated in Delaware and governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Delaware law allows a corporation to pay dividends only out of surplus, as determined under Delaware law or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend was declared and for the preceding fiscal year. Under Delaware law, however, we cannot pay dividends out of net profits if, after we pay the dividend, our capital would be less than the capital represented by the outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets. Our ability to pay dividends will be subject to our future earnings, capital requirements and financial condition, as well as our compliance with covenants related to existing or future indebtedness and would only be declared in the discretion of our Board of Directors.

Major authorizations were obtained through the completion of several MIAs (Manifestaci n de Impacto Ambiental), permits associated with forestry vegetation disturbance of change in soil use (Cambio de Uso de Suelo en Terrenos Forestales), and the required authorizations from the National Water Commission (Comisi n Nacional del Agua or CONAGUA) for water use, effluent discharge, and to construct facilities in federal watersheds. Operational standards and best management practices (BMPs) have been established to maintain compliance with applicable regulatory standards and permits. Other: A portion of the Palmarejo complex is subject to a gold stream agreement with a subsidiary of Franco Nevada Corporation and related property encumbrances 
 USA (Nevada) Rochester 
 The Rochester mine and associated heap leach facilities, operated by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Coeur Rochester, Inc. Coeur Rochester ), is an open pit silver and gold mine located in Pershing County, Nevada, approximately 13 miles northeast of the city of Lovelock. The mine consists of the main Rochester deposit and the adjacent Nevada Packard deposit, southwest of the Rochester mine. The centroid location for the Rochester site is 400600 E, 4460300 N and the centroid of Rochester pit is located at 4002045 E, 4460050 N and Nevada Packard open pit is located at 400600E, 4456675E. All coordinates are in Universal Transverse Mercator (WSG 84), Zone 11T. In November 2018, Coeur Rochester acquired the Lincoln Hill, Gold Ridge and Wilco projects adjacent to Rochester from Alio Gold. The Rochester mine is fully supported with electricity, supplied by a local power company. Ore is mined using conventional open pit methods, with gold and silver recovered by heap leaching of crushed open-pit ore placed on pads located within the Rochester mining area. 
 Rochester is currently undergoing an expansion under POA 11. The expansion project includes the construction of a new leach pad, a crushing facility equipped with two high-pressure grinding roll units and a prescreen, a Merrill-Crowe process plant, and related infrastructure to support the extension of Rochester s mine life and is expected to be completed in mid-2023.

Key Permit Conditions: The Rochester Mine has in place and operates subject to all necessary environmental permits and licenses from the appropriate local, state, and federal agencies for typical life of mine functions involving exploration, the open pit mines, heap leach pads, processing infrastructure, and all necessary support facilities. Operational standards and best management practices have been established to maintain compliance with applicable regulatory standards and permits. Major permits or approvals are in place from the U.S. Department of Interior Bureau of Land Management, Nevada Division of Water Resources, the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection, as well through other federal, state, and local entities. The environmental effects of the operation were comprehensively evaluated through the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) through Environmental Impact Statements. Monitoring programs are in place, and there is an approved reclamation and closure plan that reflects current mining, mitigation, and site facilities. 
 Other: A security interest in the Rochester mine has been granted in favor of the lenders under the RCF (as defined below) 
 Certain royalty interests have been granted with respect to the Rochester property 
 
 USA (Alaska) Kensington 
 The Kensington underground gold mine and associated milling facilities, operated by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Coeur Alaska, Inc. Coeur Alaska ), are located on the east side of the Lynn Canal about 45 miles north-northwest of Juneau, Alaska. The mine consists of the (i) Kensington Main deposit, (ii) Elmira, and (iii) other nearby deposits and exploration targets. The mine is accessed by a horizontal tunnel and utilizes conventional and mechanized underground mining methods. Coordinates for the project centroid are 0494796 E, 652068 N and the Kensington Portal is located at 0494796 E, 6530584 N. All coordinates are in Universal Transverse Mercator (NAD 1983), Zone 8V. 
 Kensington is currently undertaking a planned expansion under POA 1, which would increase tailings and waste rock storage capacity to support an expected longer mine life, reflecting positive exploration results, improved metal prices and ongoing operational efficiencies. 
 Stage: Production Location: Juneau, Alaska (Southeast Alaska, USA) Mine Type: Underground Metals/Mineralization: Gold; gold-bearing mesothermal, quartz, carbonate and pyrite vein swarms and discrete quartz-pyrite veins hosted in Cretaceous-aged Jualin diorite.

 29 

Development of our mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates use tools and processes such as mine design, scheduling and geostatistical tools that conform to industry best practices and are regularly reviewed and reconciled by internal and external parties. There are internal and external audit processes for mineral resource and mineral reserve estimation. 
 Mineral resources and mineral reserves are estimates that contain inherent risk and depend upon geologic interpretation and statistical inferences drawn from drilling and sampling analysis, which may prove to be unreliable. See Risk Factors in Item 1A for additional information.

 (1) Certain definitions: 
 The term reserve means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. The term proven (measured) reserves means reserves for which (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes, grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling; and (b) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established. The term probable (indicated) reserves means reserves for which quantity and grade and/or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven (measured) reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven (measured) reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation. The term cutoff grade means the lowest grade of mineralized material considered economic to process. Cutoff grades vary between deposits depending upon prevailing economic conditions, mineability of the deposit, by-products, amenability of the mineralized material to silver or gold extraction and type of milling or leaching facilities available.

(1) Certain definitions: 
 The term resource means that it is a concentration or occurrence of material of economic interest in or on the Earth s crust in such form, grade or quantity that there are reasonable prospects for economic extraction. Inferred, Indicated, and Measured resources are in order of increasing confidence based on level of underlying geological evidence. The term inferred resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling. The term limited geological evidence means evidence that is only sufficient to establish that geological and grade or quality continuity is more likely than not. The level of geological uncertainty associated an inferred mineral resource is too high to apply relevant technical and economic factors likely to influence the prospects of economic extraction in a manner useful for evaluation of economic viability and must have a reasonable expectation that the majority of inferred mineral resources could be upgraded to indicated or measured mineral resources with continued exploration. 
 (2) Mineral Resource estimates are reported exclusive of mineral reserves, are current as of December 31, 2022, are reported using definitions in Item 1300 of Regulation S-K and were prepared by the company s technical staff. 
 (3) Assumed metal prices for 2022 estimated Mineral Resources were 25.00 per ounce of silver, 1,800 per ounce of gold, 1.30 per pound of zinc, 1.00 per pound of lead, unless otherwise noted. 
 (4) Mineral Resource estimates use the following key input parameters: Assumption of conventional longhole underground mining; reported above a variable gold equivalent cut-off grade that ranges from 1.75-1.84 g/t AuEq; metallurgical recovery assumption of 90.5 for gold and 82.5 for silver; variable mining costs that range from US 42.50 US 47.13/tonne, surface haulage costs of US 4.01/tonne, process costs of US 29.17/tonne, general and administrative costs of US 12.56/tonne, and surface/auxiliary support costs of US 3.24/tonne. Excludes the impact of the Franco-Nevada gold stream agreement at Palmarejo in calculation of Mineral Resources. 
 (5) Mineral Resource estimates use the following key input parameters: assumption of conventional longhole underground mining; reported above a variable gold cut-off grade that ranges from 0.125 0.191 oz/ton Au; metallurgical recovery assumption of 94 ; gold payability of 97.5 , variable mining costs that range from US 87.13 175.48/ton mined; process costs of US 54.38/ton processed; general and administrative costs of US 54.76/ton processed; and concentrate refining and shipping costs of US 88.39/oz sold. 
 (6) Mineral Resource estimates use the following key input parameters: assumption of conventional open pit mining; reported above a gold cut-off grade of 0.010 oz/ton Au; average metallurgical recovery assumption of 78.7 across all rock types; royalty burden of US 64/oz Au; pit slope angles that vary from 34 50 mining costs of 2.39/ton mined, process costs of US 11.91/ton processed (includes general and administrative costs). 
 (7) Mineral Resource estimates are tabulated within a confining pit shell and use the following input parameters: Rochester oxide variable recovery Au = 77.7-93.7 and Ag = 59.4 ; Rochester sulfide variable recovery Au = 15.2-77.7 and Ag = 0.0-59.4 ; with a net smelter return cutoff of 3.25/st oxide and US 3.35/st sulfide; Nevada Packard oxide recovery Au = 92.0 and Ag = 61.0 ; with a net smelter return cutoff of 4.40/st for oxide, where the NSR is calculated as resource net smelter return (NSR) = silver grade (oz/ton) silver recovery ) (silver price /oz) - refining cost /oz)) + gold grade (oz/ton) gold recovery ) (gold price /oz) - refining cost /oz)); variable pit slope angles that approximately average 43 over the life-of-mine. 
 (8) Underground Mineral Resource estimates are reported using a net smelter return NSR cutoff of US 130/tonne. Mineral Resources are reported insitu using the following assumptions: The estimate use the following key input parameters: lead recovery of 89-90 , zinc recovery of 82-83 and silver recovery of 83-84 . Lead concentrate grade of 53-54 ; zinc concentrate grade of 56-57 ; mining costs of US 68.77/tonne; processing costs of US 58.20/tonne and US 46.49/tonne, where the NSR /tonne) = tonnes x grade x metal prices x metallurgical recoveries royalties TCRCs transport costs over the life of the mine. 
 (9) Open Pit Mineral Resource estimates are reported in-situ and are contained within a confining pit shell and use the following key input parameters: reported above an oxide gold equivalent cutoff of 0.15 ounces per ton and 0.20 oz ounces per ton assuming a silver to gold ratio of 60:1; gold recoveries of 64 ; silver recoveries of 59 ; mining costs of US 3.10/ton; process costs of US 3.60/ton; general and administrative costs of 1.50/ton processed; average pit slope angles of 45 over the life-of-mine. The technical and economic parameters are those that were used in the 2018 Resource Estimation. Based on the QPs review of the estimate, there would be no material change to the Mineral Resource if a gold price of US 1,700/oz, a silver price of US 22/oz or economic parameters were updated. Therefore the 2018 Mineral Resource is considered current and is presented unchanged. 
 (10) Open Pit Mineral Resource estimates are reported using an equivalent gold cutoff of 0.20 ounces per ton assuming a silver to gold ratio of 60:1. Resources are reported in-situ and contained withed a conceptual measured, indicated and inferred optimized pit shell. Silver price of US 20/oz, gold price of US 1,400/oz.

Open pit mining cost is US 1.50/ton, processing and processing and G A cost is US 5.46/ton; average pit slope angles of 50 . The technical and economic parameters are those that were used in the 2018 Resource Estimation. Based on the QPs review of the estimate, there would be no material change to the mineral resources if a gold price of US 1,700/oz, a silver price of US 22/oz or economic parameters were updated. Therefore the 2018 Mineral Resource report is considered current and is presented unchanged.

Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following Management s Discussion and Analysis MD A provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Coeur Mining, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively the Company , our , or we ). We use certain non-GAAP financial performance measures in our MD A. For a detailed description of these measures, please see Non-GAAP Financial Performance Measures at the end of this Item. We provide Costs applicable to sales CAS allocation, referred to as the co-product method, based on revenue contribution for Palmarejo and Rochester and based on the primary metal, referred to as the by-product method, for Wharf. Revenue from secondary metal, such as silver at Wharf, is treated as a cost credit. 
 Overview 
 We are primarily a gold and silver producer with operating assets located in the United States and Mexico and an exploration project in Canada. 
 2022 Highlights 
 For the full year 2022, Coeur reported revenue of 785.6 million and cash provided by operating activities of 25.6 million. We reported GAAP net loss of 78.1 million, or (0.28) per diluted share. On a non-GAAP adjusted basis 1 , the Company reported EBITDA of 139.0 million and net loss of 89.1 million or (0.32) per diluted share. 
 Solid fourth quarter production growth led to full-year production within guidance ranges Gold and silver production increased 5 and 4 quarter-over-quarter, respectively, to 87,727 ounces and 2.5 million ounces. Full-year gold and silver production totaled 330,346 ounces and 9.8 million ounces, respectively, within the Company s consolidated production guidance ranges 
 Rochester delivered strong quarterly performance Fourth quarter production at Rochester totaled 973,000 ounces and 11,589 ounces of silver and gold, respectively, representing quarter-over-quarter increases of 31 and 32 . 
 POA 11 expansion nearing scheduled mid-year construction completion and remains on-track Construction at Rochester is scheduled to be completed mid-year 2023. At the end of 2022, the project was 74 complete. The new Stage VI leach pad is now operational, with first ore placed on February 1, 2023. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 605 million of the estimated capital had been committed, of which 494 million of the estimated capital cost had been incurred. Total estimated project capital remains unchanged at 650 - 670 million 
 Exploration investment drives approximately 12 and 3 year-over-year increases in gold and silver reserves, respectively Gold reserves at Kensington grew roughly 56 year-over-year, adding approximately a year and a half to its mine life. Successful exploration at Silvertip contributed to year-over-year increases in measured and indicated resources of 73 , 69 and 81 in silver, zinc and lead, respectively, excluding reclassified ounces. Over the last five years, the Company has invested approximately 245 million in exploration, leading to increases of approximately 21 and 49 in Company-wide gold and silver reserves, respectively over the five-year period 
 Liquidity further bolstered to support remaining elevated levels of growth investments The sale of the Crown Sterling holdings was completed on November 4, 2022 for upfront cash consideration of 150 million. On January 17, 2023, Coeur announced the sale of its remaining shares of Victoria Gold Corporation Victoria Gold for net cash proceeds of approximately 40 million. Coeur ended the quarter with total liquidity of approximately 342 million, including 62 million of cash and 280 million of available capacity under its 390 million revolving credit facility RCF and is further supported by robust hedges covering approximately 52 and 29 of 2023 estimated gold and silver production, respectively. As adjusted to reflect the receipt of proceeds from Victoria Gold, Coeur s total liquidity stood at 382 million at December 31, 2022 
 2023 guidance ranges consistent with 2022 investor day outlook The Company expects 2023 gold and silver production of 320,000 - 370,000 ounces and 10.0 - 12.0 million ounces, respectively, driven by strong expected second half silver and gold production increases consistent with the planned ramp-up at Rochester following completion of the POA 11 expansion project and by higher expected production from the Wharf gold operation

Consolidated Financial Results 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021 
 Revenue 
 We sold 329,968 gold ounces and 9.8 million silver ounces, compared to 350,347 gold ounces and 10.1 million silver ounces. Revenue decreased by 47.2 million, or 6 , as a result of a 6 and 4 decrease in gold and silver ounces sold, respectively, and a 13 decrease in average realized silver prices, partially offset by a 5 increase in average realized gold prices driven by the favorable impact of realized gains from gold hedges. The decrease in gold and silver ounces sold was primarily due to lower grades at Palmarejo, Kensington and Wharf. Gold and silver represented 73 and 27 of 2022 sales revenue, respectively. This compares to gold and silver representing 70 and 30 of 2021 sales revenue, respectively.

 Costs Applicable to Sales 
 Costs applicable to sales increased 95.0 million, or 19 , primarily due to higher operating costs partially impacted by continued inflationary pressures relating to consumable costs, most notably higher diesel prices, and increased lower of cost or net realizable value LCM adjustments at Rochester. For a complete discussion of costs applicable to sales, see Results of Operations below. 
 Amortization 
 Amortization decreased 16.7 million primarily due to lower gold and silver ounces sold and longer assumed mine lives at Palmarejo, Kensington and Wharf. 
 Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses decreased 0.9 million, or 2 , primarily due to lower stock-based compensation expense. 
 Exploration expense decreased 24.5 million, or 48 driven by lower planned investment across the portfolio. 
 Pre-development, reclamation, and other expenses decreased 7.4 million, or 15 , stemming from lower costs incurred in connection with the Company s COVID-19 health and safety protocols and lower ongoing carrying costs at Silvertip, partially offset by higher asset retirement accretion. The following table summarizes pre-development, reclamation, and other expenses:

 Other Income and Expenses 
 During the first quarter of 2021, the Company incurred a 9.2 million loss in connection with the tender and redemption of the 5.875 Senior Notes due 2024 (the 2024 Senior Notes concurrent with the offering of the 2029 Senior Notes. 
 Fair value adjustments, net, decreased to a loss of 66.7 million compared to a 0.5 million loss as a result of a reduction in value of the Company s equity investments. For additional details on the Company s equity investments see Note 6 -- Investments. 
 Interest expense (net of capitalized interest of 11.2 million) increased to 23.9 million from 16.5 million due to higher interest paid under the RCF, partially offset by higher capitalized interest. 
 Other, net increased to a gain of 67.0 million compared to a loss of 22.9 million in 2021, as a result of the 62.2 million gain recognized in connection with the sale of the Sterling/Crown exploration properties and a write-down of a 26.0 million Mexican VAT receivable in 2021 due to uncertain collectability. For additional details on the VAT receivable write-down see Note 19 -- Commitments and Contingencies.

Income and Mining Taxes 
 The Company s Income and mining tax (expense) benefit consisted of: 
 Year Ended December 31, In thousands 2022 2021 Income and mining tax (expense) benefit at statutory rate 13,249 (764) State tax provision from continuing operations 2,871 2,009 Change in valuation allowance (36,670) (28,615) Percentage depletion 3,538 4,968 Uncertain tax positions 655 920 U.S. and foreign permanent differences 365 4,105 Foreign exchange rates (145) (384) Foreign inflation and indexing 2,897 (1,087) Foreign tax rate differences (4,994) (4,901) Mining, foreign withholding, and other taxes (11,070) (12,599) Sale of non-core assets 15,447 Other, net (801) 1,390 Income and mining tax (expense) benefit (14,658) (34,958) 
 Income and mining tax expense of approximately 14.7 million resulted in an effective tax rate of 23.1 for 2022. This compares to income tax expense of 35.0 million for an effective tax rate of 961.4 for 2021.The comparability of the Company s income and mining tax (expense) benefit and effective tax rate for the reported periods was impacted by multiple factors, primarily: (i) variations in our income before income taxes; (ii) geographic distribution of that income; (iii) the sale of non-core assets; (iv) mining taxes; (v) percentage depletion; (vi) foreign exchange rates; (vii) the impact of uncertain tax positions; and (viii) the non-recognition of tax assets. Therefore, the effective tax rate will fluctuate, sometimes significantly, period to period. 
 The following table summarizes the components of the Company s income (loss) before tax and income and mining tax (expense) benefit: 
 Year ended December 31, 2022 2021 In thousands Income (loss) before tax Tax (expense) benefit Income (loss) before tax Tax (expense) benefit United States (107,477) 2,516 (34,196) (6,142) Canada (32,249) (51) (52,299) 1,224 Mexico 77,316 (17,123) 87,233 (30,040) Other jurisdictions (1,039) 2,898 (63,449) (14,658) 3,636 (34,958) 
 A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized. The Company analyzes its deferred tax assets and, if it is determined that the Company will not realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets, it will record or increase a valuation allowance. Conversely, if it is determined that the Company will ultimately be more likely than not able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided, all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced. There are a number of factors that impact the Company s ability to realize its deferred tax assets. For additional information, please see Item 1A - Risk Factors . 
 Net Loss 
 Net loss was 78.1 million, or 0.28 per diluted share, compared to 31.3 million, or 0.13 per diluted share. The increase in net loss was driven by a 6 and 4 decrease in gold and silver ounces sold, respectively, a 13 decrease in average realized silver prices, higher operating costs, including increased LCM adjustments at Rochester, unfavorable changes in the fair value of the Company s equity investments, and a realized loss of 15.6 million in connection with the sale of Victoria Gold common shares. This was partially offset by a 5 increase in average realized gold prices driven by realized gains from gold hedging, a 62.2 million gain on the sale of the Sterling/Crown exploration properties, lower exploration costs and income and mining taxes, absence of a 9.2 million loss on debt extinguishment and the VAT write-down of 26.0 million in 2021. 
 38 

Adjusted net loss was 89.1 million, or 0.32 per diluted share, compared to 1.4 million, or 0.01 per diluted share (see Non-GAAP Financial Performance Measures ). 
 Year Ended December 31, 2021 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020 
 Revenue 
 We sold 350,347 gold ounces and 10.1 million silver ounces, compared to 356,251 gold ounces, 9.6 million silver ounces, 3.2 million zinc pounds and 2.5 million lead pounds in the prior year. Revenue increased by 47.4 million, or 6 , as a result of a 1 and 21 increase in average realized gold and silver prices, respectively, and higher silver ounces sold (5 ), partially offset by lower gold ounces sold (2 ). The increase in silver ounces sold was primarily due to higher mill throughput at Palmarejo. Gold and silver accounted for 70 and 30 of 2021 sales revenue, respectively. This compares to gold and silver accounting for 74 and 25 of 2020 sales revenue, respectively, with zinc and lead accounting for the remaining 2020 sales revenue.

 Costs Applicable to Sales 
 Costs applicable to sales increased 71.2 million, or 16 , primarily due to inflationary pressures related to employee-related, maintenance and consumable costs at all operating sites, higher silver ounces sold primarily at Palmarejo, the Rochester fourth quarter LCM adjustment of 7.3 million, partially offset by a 13.8 million favorable impact from foreign currency hedges. 
 Amortization 
 Amortization decreased 3.1 million, or 2 , primarily due to longer assumed mine life based on year-end 2020 mineral reserve growth, partially offset by higher silver ounces sold. 
 Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses increased 6.7 million, or 20 , primarily due to higher compensation, travel and outside service costs. 
 Exploration expense increased 8.5 million, or 20 , as the Company maintained its commitment to a higher-level of exploration investment in 2021. 
 Pre-development, reclamation, and other expenses decreased 7.0 million, or 13 , stemming from lower costs incurred in connection with the Company s COVID-19 health and safety protocols, partially offset by full-year ongoing carrying costs and absence of one-time 2020 costs associated with the suspension of mining and processing activities at Silvertip.

 During the first quarter of 2021, the Company incurred a 9.2 million loss in connection with the tender and redemption of the 2024 Senior Notes concurrent with the completed offering of the 2029 Senior Notes. 
 Fair value adjustments, net, decreased to a loss of 0.5 million compared to a gain of 7.6 million as a result of a reduction in value of the Company s equity investments. The estimated fair values of the Company s equity investments in Victoria Gold and Integra Resources Corp. Integra Resources were 124.2 million and 8.0 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021. 
 Interest expense (net of capitalized interest of 11.1 million) decreased to 16.5 million from 20.7 million due to higher capitalized interest associated with the POA 11 project at Rochester, and lower interest paid under the RCF, partially offset by higher interest paid under the 2029 Senior Notes compared to the 2024 Senior Notes and higher interest paid under finance lease obligations. 
 Other, net increased to a loss of 22.9 million compared to a loss of 5.9 million due to a write-down of the 26.0 million VAT receivable, partially offset by an increase in gains on the sale of assets in 2021 and a one-time fee of 3.8 million related to the novation of certain of the Company s gold zero cost collars incurred in 2020.

Income and Mining Taxes 
 The Company s Income and mining tax (expense) benefit consisted of: 
 Year Ended December 31, In thousands 2021 2020 Income and mining tax (expense) benefit at statutory rate (764) (13,161) State tax provision from continuing operations 2,009 (152) Change in valuation allowance (28,615) (17,522) Percentage depletion 4,968 5,056 Uncertain tax positions 920 2,321 U.S. and foreign permanent differences 4,105 3,844 Foreign exchange rates (384) 1,390 Foreign inflation and indexing (1,087) 684 Foreign tax rate differences (4,901) (3,971) Mining, foreign withholding, and other taxes (12,599) (17,457) Other, net 1,390 1,923 Income and mining tax (expense) benefit (34,958) (37,045) 
 Income and mining tax expense of approximately 35.0 million resulted in an effective tax rate of 961.4 for 2021. This compares to income tax expense of 37.0 million or effective tax rate of 59.1 for 2020. The comparability of the Company s income and mining tax (expense) benefit and effective tax rate for the reported periods was impacted by multiple factors, primarily: (i) variations in our income before income taxes; (ii) geographic distribution of that income; (iii) mining taxes; (iv) foreign exchange rates; (v) percentage depletion (vi) the impact of uncertain tax positions; and (vii) the non-recognition of tax assets. Therefore, the effective tax rate will fluctuate, sometimes significantly, period to period.

Net Loss 
 Net loss was 31.3 million, or 0.13 per diluted share, compared to net income of 25.6 million, or 0.11 per diluted share. The decrease in net income was driven by higher operating costs, the 26.0 million VAT write-down , higher exploration expense, a 9.2 million loss on debt extinguishment and higher income and mining taxes. This was partially offset by a 1 and 21 increase in average realized gold and silver prices, respectively and higher silver ounces sold (5 ). Adjusted net loss was 1.4 million, or 0.01 per diluted share, compared to an adjusted net income of 59.0 million, or 0.24 per diluted share (see Non-GAAP Financial Performance Measures ). 
 2023 Guidance Framework 
 Gold and silver production is expected to increase compared to 2022, driven by the planned construction completion of POA 11 at Rochester mid-year as well as higher expected grades at Wharf due to mine sequencing and resource model enhancements. Overall cost guidance has increased compared to 2022 primarily driven by expected continued inflationary pressures on operating costs. 
 Additionally, with the completion of the POA 11 expansion construction expected in mid-2023, Coeur has elected to defer providing cost guidance at Rochester until mid-year, following the transitional period anticipated in the first half of 2023. The Company expects to have an LCM adjustment at Rochester of roughly 10 - 15 million each quarter in 2023.

Metal sales were 303.4 million, or 38 of Coeur s metal sales, compared with 320.3 million, or 38 of Coeur s metal sales. Revenue decreased by 16.8 million or 5 , of which 12.0 million was due to lower average realized silver prices and 4.8 million resulting from lower gold and silver production. Costs applicable to sales per gold and silver ounce increased 33 and 9 , respectively, due to the mix of gold and silver sales, lower production, higher employee-related and consumable costs primarily due to inflationary pressures, and the absence of the favorable impact of foreign currency hedges 13.8 million) included in the prior year. Amortization decreased by 0.7 million to 35.4 million due to lower sales and longer assumed mine life. Capital expenditures increased to 42.6 million from 36.5 million due to higher underground development, infill drilling activities and flotation and thickener equipment purchases. 
 Year Ended December 31, 2021 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020 
 Gold production decreased 1 as a result of lower gold grade, partially offset by higher mill throughput and recoveries.

 Silvertip suspended mining and processing activities, unrelated to COVID-19, in February 2020. Ongoing carrying and suspension costs are included in Pre-development, reclamation, and other. 
 Coeur conducted an order of magnitude assessment on multiple throughput scenarios to narrow the range of options for a preferred path forward for Silvertip. Continued resource growth as well as optimization of operating and capital costs are expected to further enhance project economics. Near-term, the Company is focused on exploration and managing care and maintenance costs as the Company continues to develop plans for a potential expansion and restart of the Silvertip. 
 Ongoing carrying costs at Silvertip totaled 21.0 million in 2022, compared to 24.9 million in the prior year. Capital expenditures in 2022 totaled 24.8 million compared to 70.1 million in the prior year due to continued infill drilling and underground development. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 At December 31, 2022, the Company had 63.2 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and 280.4 million available under the RCF. Future borrowing under the RCF may be subject to certain financial covenants. Cash and cash equivalents increased 4.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, due to 150.2 million from the sale of the Sterling/Crown exploration properties in the fourth quarter of 2022, net proceeds of 147.4 million from the sale of 36.8 million shares of its common stock under two at the market equity offering programs completed in 2022 described below, 40.5 million received in July 2022 from the sale of a portion of the Victoria Gold common shares, 15.3 million received from the sale of the La Preciosa project and 25.6 million of net cash flows provided from operations impacted by a 4 and 10 decrease in gold and silver ounces sold, respectively and a 16 decrease in average realized silver prices and higher operating costs primarily due to inflationary pressures partially offset by 352.4 million of capital expenditures primarily related to the POA 11 expansion project at Rochester. 
 In March 2022, the Company completed a 100.0 million at the market offering of its common stock, par value 0.01 per share (the March Equity Offering ). The Company sold a total of 22.1 million shares of common stock in the March Equity Offering at an average price of 4.53 per share, raising net proceeds (after sales commissions) of 98.0 million. 
 On May 2, 2022, the Company entered into an amendment (the Amendment to the RCF to, among other things, increase the maximum principal amount of the RCF by 90.0 million in incremental loans and commitments to an aggregate of 390.0 million. On November 9, 2022, the Company entered into an amendment (the November Amendment to the RCF. The November Amendment, among other things, (1) modified the financial covenants to provide greater flexibility under the 
 46 

consolidated net leverage ratio requirement through the December 31, 2023 test date, with the ratio returning to the original level as outlined in the RCF starting with the March 31, 2024 test date (the Amendment Period ), (2) allowed up to 50 million for integration costs or costs associated with establishing new facilities and certain costs associated with LCM adjustments at Rochester to be excluded from the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA for purposes of the RCF, (3) increased the interest rate on certain borrowings through early 2023, (4) required the Company to repay outstanding amounts under the RCF if cash-on-hand exceeds 60 million during the Amendment Period, and (5) restricted certain payments and the incurrence of certain liens during the Amendment Period. At December 31, 2022, the Company had 80.0 million drawn and 29.6 million in outstanding letters of credit under the RCF. 
 On June 28, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement to sell 5.0 million shares of common stock of Victoria Gold at a price of 8.34 per Victoria Gold Common Share, for net proceeds of 40.5 million received in July 2022. At December 31, 2022, the Company held 44.2 million of equity securities including a 9.4 interest in Victoria Gold. In January 2023, the Company sold its remaining 6.0 million Victoria Gold common shares, at a price of 6.70 per share, for net proceeds of 39.8 million. 
 On September 18, 2022, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement Crown Sterling Agreement with AngloGold Ashanti (U.S.A.) Holdings Inc. and its affiliate Buyer for the sale of 100 of the issued and outstanding shares of Coeur Sterling, Inc., a subsidiary of Coeur that holds the Sterling/Crown exploration properties near Beatty, Nevada, in exchange for: (A) a cash payment of 150.2 million at the closing of the transaction, subject to a customary purchase price adjustment and (B) the right to an additional payment of 50.0 million should Buyer, its affiliates or its successors report gold resources in the Sterling/Crown exploration properties (including any in-situ ounces mined after the closing of the Transaction) equal to or greater than 3,500,000 gold ounces, subject to certain additional terms and conditions detailed in the Crown Sterling Agreement. The transaction was consummated on November 4, 2022. 
 In December 2022, the Company completed a 50.0 million at the market offering of its common stock, par value 0.01 per share (the December Equity Offering ). The Company sold a total of 14.8 million shares of common stock in the December Equity Offering at an average price of 3.39 per share, raising net proceeds (after sales commissions) of 49.2 million. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company had outstanding forward contracts on 130,500 ounces of gold at December 31, 2022 that settle monthly through December 2023. The Company is targeting to hedge up to 70 of expected gold production and 50 of expected silver production for 2023 in order to protect cash flow during a period of elevated capital expenditures, and may in the future layer on additional hedges as circumstances warrant. In early 2023, the Company added 49,998 ounces of gold forward contracts and 3.2 million ounces of silver forward contracts that settle monthly through December 2023. Taking into account the additional gold and silver hedges added in early 2023 the weighted average fixed price on the forward contracts is 1,961 per ounce of gold and 24.55 per ounce of silver. 
 We currently believe we have sufficient sources of funding to meet our business requirements for the next 12 months and longer-term. We expect to use a combination of cash provided by operating activities under-pinned by our gold and silver hedging programs, sale of non-core investments, borrowings under our RCF and additional equity financings depending on future commodity prices to fund near term capital requirements, including those described in this Report for the POA 11 expansion project at Rochester and in our 2023 capital expenditure guidance. Our longer-term plans contemplate the expansion and restart of Silvertip, as well as the continued exploration and potential development of our other projects, such as the Lincoln Hill area adjacent to Rochester. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company committed approximately 605 million of capital since inception of the project and approximately 494 million of the estimated project cost had been incurred. Total estimated project capital remains 650 - 670 million. At the end of 2022, the project was 74 complete. 
 We also have additional obligations as part of our ordinary course of business, beyond those committed for capital expenditures and other purchase obligations and commitments for purchases of goods and services. 
 If and to the extent liquidity resources are insufficient to support short- and long-term expenditures, we may need to incur additional indebtedness or issue additional equity securities, among other financing options, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. This could have a material adverse impact on the Company, as discussed in more detail under Item 1A Risk Factors. 
 Cash Provided by Operating Activities

Year Ended December 31, In thousands 2022 2021 2020 Cash flow before changes in operating assets and liabilities 71,862 145,615 162,434 Changes in operating assets and liabilities: Receivables 4,452 (983) (9,463) Prepaid expenses and other 240 489 (2,621) Inventories (51,448) (27,628) (34,538) Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 510 (7,011) 32,897 Cash provided by (used in) operating activities 25,616 110,482 148,709 
 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased 84.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to a 6 and 4 decrease in lower gold and silver ounces sold, respectively, a 13 decrease in average realized silver prices, and higher operating costs, partially offset by a 5 increase in average realized gold prices driven by the favorable impact of realized gains from gold hedges, lower exploration costs, timing of VAT collections at Palmarejo, and lower Silvertip ongoing carrying costs. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased by 47.2 million, of which 43.3 million was due to a lower volume of gold and silver sales and 3.9 million was due to lower average realized silver prices. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased 38.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to lower gold ounces sold (2 ), higher operating costs, exploration costs, and mining and income taxes at Palmarejo, partially offset by a 1 and 21 increase in average realized gold and silver prices, respectively, and higher silver ounces sold (5 ). Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by 47.4 million, of which 44.5 million was the result of higher average realized gold and silver prices and 2.9 million was due to the higher volume of silver sales. 
 Cash Used in Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2022 was 146.2 million compared to 304.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. Cash used in investing activities decreased primarily due to receipt of net proceeds of 150.2 million and 15.3 million from the sale of the Sterling/Crown exploration properties and La Preciosa project, respectively, and net proceeds of 40.5 million in July 2022 from the sale of a portion of the Victoria Gold common shares, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures. The Company incurred capital expenditures of 352.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 compared with 309.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. Capital expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2022 were primarily related to POA 11 construction activities at Rochester and underground development at Palmarejo and Kensington. Capital expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2021 were primarily related to POA 11 construction activities at Rochester, potential expansion expenditures at Silvertip and underground development at Palmarejo and Kensington. 
 The Company is experiencing inflationary pressures, specifically with respect to building materials and fuel as well as overall tightness in the construction market related to capital projects, most notably at the POA 11 project at Rochester, and to operating costs company-wide. 
 Net cash used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2021 was 304.1 million compared to 65.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Cash used in investing activities increased primarily due to construction activities related to POA 11 at Rochester and the potential expansion at Silvertip in the current period and the impact of the net proceeds of 19.4 million from the sale of Metalla Royalty Streaming Ltd. common shares in the comparable period of 2020. The Company incurred capital expenditures of 309.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared with 99.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Capital expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2021 were primarily related to POA 11 construction activities at Rochester, potential expansion expenditures at Silvertip and underground development at Palmarejo and Kensington. Capital expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2020 were primarily related to POA 11 at Rochester, which commenced construction activities during the third quarter, and underground development at Palmarejo and Kensington.

Critical Accounting Policies and Accounting Developments 
 Listed below are the accounting policies that we believe are critical to our financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates and assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset, liability, revenue, and expense being reported. For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 -- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 The Company produces dor and concentrate that is shipped to third-party refiners and smelters, respectively, for processing. The Company enters into contracts to sell its metal to various third-party customers which may include the refiners and smelters that process the dor and concentrate. The Company s performance obligation in these transactions is generally the transfer of metal to the customer. 
 In the case of dor shipments, the Company generally sells refined metal at market prices agreed upon by both parties. The Company also has the right, but not the obligation, to sell a portion of the anticipated refined metal in advance of being fully refined. When the Company sells refined metal or advanced metal, the performance obligation is satisfied when the metal is delivered to the customer. Revenue and Costs Applicable to Sales are recorded on a gross basis under these contracts at the time the performance obligation is satisfied. 
 Under the Company s concentrate sales contracts with third-party smelters, metal prices are set on a specified future quotational period, typically one to three months, after the shipment date based on market prices. When the Company sells gold concentrate to the third-party smelters, the performance obligation is satisfied when risk of loss is transferred to the customer. The contracts, in general, provide for provisional payment based upon provisional assays and historical metal prices. Final settlement is based on the applicable price for the specified future quotational period and generally occurs three to six months after shipment. The Company s provisionally priced sales contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable from the sale of concentrates measured at the forward price at the time of sale. The embedded derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting and is adjusted to fair value through revenue each period until the date of final metal settlement. 
 The Company also sells concentrate under off-take agreements to third-party customers that are responsible for arranging the smelting of the concentrate. Prices can either be fixed or based on a quotational period. The quotational period varies by contract, but is generally a one-month period following the shipment of the concentrate. The performance obligation is satisfied when risk of loss is transferred to the customer. 
 The Company recognizes revenue from concentrate sales, net of treatment and refining charges, when it satisfies the performance obligation of transferring control of the concentrate to the customer. 
 For dor and off-take sales, the Company may incur a finance charge related to advance sales that is not considered significant and, as such, is not considered a separate performance obligation. In addition, the Company has elected to treat freight costs as a fulfillment cost under ASC 606 and not as a separate performance obligation. 
 The Company s gold stream agreement with Franco-Nevada provided for a 20.0 million deposit paid by Franco-Nevada in exchange for the right and obligation, commencing in 2016, to purchase 50 of a portion of Palmarejo gold production at the lesser of 800 or market price per ounce. Because there is no minimum obligation associated with the deposit, it is not considered financing, and each shipment is considered to be a separate performance obligation. The stream agreement represents a contract liability under ASC 606, which requires the Company to ratably recognize a portion of the deposit as revenue for each gold ounce delivered to Franco-Nevada. 
 49 

Estimates 
 The preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of its financial statements, the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period, and mined reserves. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. There are a number of uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of reserves, including many factors beyond the Company s control. Mineral reserve estimates are based upon engineering evaluations of samplings of drill holes and other openings. These estimates involve assumptions regarding future silver and gold prices, mine geology, mining methods and the related costs to develop and mine the reserves. Changes in these assumptions could result in material adjustments to the Company s reserve estimates. The Company uses reserve estimates in determining the units-of-production amortization and evaluating mine assets for potential impairment. For a discussion of estimates and assumptions used by management that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of its financial statements, the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period, and mined reserves, see Note 2 -- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Amortization 
 The Company amortizes its property, plant, and equipment, mining properties, and mine development using the units-of-production method over the estimated life of the ore body generally based on its proven and probable reserves or the straight-line method over the useful life, whichever is shorter. The accounting estimates related to amortization are critical accounting estimates because (1) the determination of reserves involves uncertainties with respect to the ultimate geology of its reserves and the assumptions used in determining the economic feasibility of mining those reserves and (2) changes in estimated proven and probable reserves and asset useful lives can have a material impact on net income. 
 Impairment of Long-lived Assets 
 We review and evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Asset impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated undiscounted pretax future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset. In estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future cash flows from other asset groups. An impairment loss is measured by discounted estimated future cash flows, and recorded by reducing the asset's carrying amount to fair value. Future cash flows are estimated based on estimated quantities of recoverable minerals, expected gold and silver prices (considering current and historical prices, trends and related factors), production levels, operating costs, capital requirements and reclamation costs, all based on life-of-mine plans. 
 Existing proven and probable reserves and value beyond proven and probable reserves, including mineralization other than proven and probable reserves are included when determining the fair value of mine site asset groups at acquisition and, subsequently, in determining whether the assets are impaired. The term recoverable minerals refers to the estimated amount of gold and silver that will be obtained after taking into account losses during ore processing and treatment. Estimates of recoverable minerals from exploration stage mineral interests are risk adjusted based on management s relative confidence in such materials. The ability to achieve the estimated quantities of recoverable minerals from exploration stage mineral interests involves further risks in addition to those risk factors applicable to mineral interests where proven and probable reserves have been identified, due to the lower level of confidence that the identified mineral reserves and resources could ultimately be mined economically. Assets classified as exploration potential have the highest level of risk that the carrying value of the asset can be ultimately realized, due to the still lower level of geological confidence and economic modeling. 
 Gold and silver prices are volatile and affected by many factors beyond the Company s control, including prevailing interest rates and returns on other asset classes, expectations regarding inflation, speculation, currency values, governmental decisions regarding precious metals stockpiles, global and regional demand and production, political and economic conditions and other factors may affect the key assumptions used in the Company s impairment testing. Various factors could impact our ability to achieve forecasted production levels from proven and probable reserves. Additionally, production, capital and reclamation costs could differ from the assumptions used in the cash flow models used to assess impairment. Actual results may vary from the Company s estimates and result in additional Impairment of Long-lived Assets . 
 Ore on Leach Pads 
 The heap leach process extracts silver and gold by placing ore on an impermeable pad and applying a diluted cyanide solution that dissolves a portion of the contained silver and gold, which are then recovered in metallurgical processes. 
 The Company uses several integrated steps to scientifically measure the metal content of ore placed on the leach pads. As the ore body is drilled in preparation for the blasting process, samples are taken of the drill residue which are assayed to determine estimated quantities of contained metal. The Company then processes the ore through crushing facilities where the 
 50 

output is again weighed and sampled for assaying. A metallurgical reconciliation with the data collected from the mining operation is completed with appropriate adjustments made to previous estimates. The crushed ore is then transported to the leach pad for application of the leaching solution. As the leach solution is collected from the leach pads, it is continuously sampled for assaying. The quantity of leach solution is measured by flow meters throughout the leaching and precipitation process. After precipitation, the product is converted to dor at the Rochester mine and a form of gold concentrate at the Wharf mine, representing the final product produced by each mine. The inventory is stated at lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost being determined using a weighted average cost method. 
 The historical cost of metal expected to be extracted within 12 months is classified as current and the historical cost of metals contained within the broken ore expected to be extracted beyond 12 months is classified as non-current. Ore on leach pads is valued based on actual production costs incurred to produce and place ore on the leach pad, less costs allocated to minerals recovered through the leach process. 
 The estimate of both the ultimate recovery expected over time and the quantity of metal that may be extracted relative to the time the leach process occurs requires the use of estimates, which are inherently inaccurate due to the nature of the leaching process. The quantities of metal contained in the ore are based upon actual weights and assay analysis. The rate at which the leach process extracts gold and silver from the crushed ore is based upon laboratory testing and actual experience of more than 20 years of leach pad operations at the Rochester mine and 30 years of leach pad operations at the Wharf mine. The assumptions used by the Company to measure metal content during each stage of the inventory conversion process includes estimated recovery rates based on laboratory testing and assaying. The Company periodically reviews its estimates compared to actual experience and revises its estimates when appropriate. The ultimate recovery will not be known until leaching operations cease. Variations between actual and estimated quantities resulting from changes in assumptions and estimates that do not result in write-downs to net realizable value are accounted for on a prospective basis. As of December 31, 2022, the Company s estimated recoverable ounces of gold and silver on the leach pads were 40,083 and 4.7 million, respectively. 
 Reclamation 
 The Company recognizes obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. The fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation will be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. An accretion cost, representing the increase over time in the present value of the liability, is recorded each period in Pre-development, Reclamation, and Other . As reclamation work is performed or liabilities are otherwise settled, the recorded amount of the liability is reduced. Future remediation costs for inactive mines are accrued based on management s best estimate at the end of each period of the discounted costs expected to be incurred at the site. Such cost estimates include, where applicable, ongoing care and maintenance and monitoring costs. Changes in estimates are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised. See Note 11 -- Reclamation in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 Derivatives 
 The Company is exposed to various market risks, including the effect of changes in metal prices and interest rates, and uses derivatives to manage financial exposures that occur in the normal course of business. The Company may elect to designate certain derivatives as hedging instruments under U.S. GAAP. 
 The Company, from time to time, uses derivative contracts to protect the Company s exposure to fluctuations in metal prices. The Company has elected to designate these instruments as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions at their inception. Assuming normal market conditions, the change in the market value of such derivative contracts has historically been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. For derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, the Company recognizes derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measures those instruments at fair value. Changes in the value of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are recorded each period in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss) in Fair value adjustments, net or Revenue . Management applies judgment in estimating the fair value of instruments that are highly sensitive to assumptions regarding commodity prices, market volatilities, and foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Income and Mining Taxes 
 The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the guidance of ASC 740. The Company s annual tax rate 
 is based on income, statutory tax rates in effect and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Significant judgment is required in determining the annual tax expense, current tax assets and liabilities, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and our future taxable income, both as a whole and in various tax jurisdictions, for purposes of assessing our ability to realize future benefit from our deferred tax assets. Actual income taxes could vary from 
 51 

these estimates due to future changes in income tax law, significant changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate or unpredicted results from the final determination of each year s liability by taxing authorities. 
 The Company s deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts measured by tax laws and regulations. In evaluating the realizability of the deferred tax assets, management considers both positive and negative evidence that may exist, such as earnings history, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies in each tax jurisdiction. A valuation allowance may be established to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is considered more likely than not to be realized through the generation of future taxable income and other tax planning strategies. 
 The Company has asserted indefinite reinvestment of earnings from its Mexican operations as determined by management s judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the Company. The Company does not record a U.S. deferred tax liability for foreign earnings that meet the indefinite reversal criteria. Refer to Note 12 -- Income and Mining Taxes for further discussion on our assertion. 
 The Company s operations may involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution could result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period which they are determined. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. 
 
 Other Liquidity Matters 
 We believe that our liquidity and capital resources in the U.S. are adequate to fund our U.S. operations and corporate activities. The Company has asserted indefinite reinvestment of earnings from its Mexican operations as determined by management s judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the Company. The Company does not believe that the amounts reinvested will have a material impact on liquidity. 
 In order to reduce indebtedness, fund future cash interest payments and/or amounts due at maturity or upon redemption and for general working capital purposes, from time-to-time we may (1) issue equity securities for cash in public or private offerings or (2) repurchase certain of our debt securities for cash or in exchange for other securities, which may include secured or unsecured notes or equity, in each case in open market or privately negotiated transactions. We evaluate any such transactions in light of prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. The amounts involved may be significant and any debt repurchase transactions may occur at a substantial discount to the debt securities face amount. 

Non-GAAP Financial Performance Measures 
 Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standard meaning prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). Unless otherwise noted, we present the Non-GAAP financial measures in the tables below. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 Adjusted Net Income (Loss) 
 Management uses Adjusted net income (loss) to evaluate the Company s operating performance, and to plan and forecast its operations. The Company believes the use of Adjusted net income (loss) reflects the underlying operating performance of our core mining business and allows investors and analysts to compare results of the Company to similar results of other mining companies. Management s determination of the components of Adjusted net income (loss are evaluated periodically and is based, in part, on a review of non-GAAP financial measures used by mining industry analysts. The tax effect of adjustments are based on statutory tax rates and the Company s tax attributes, including the impact through the Company s valuation allowance. The combined effective rate of tax adjustments may not be consistent with the statutory tax rates or the Company s effective tax rate due to jurisdictional tax attributes and related valuation allowance impacts which may minimize the tax effect of certain adjustments and may not apply to gains and losses equally. Adjusted net income (loss) is reconciled to Net income (loss) in the following table:

 (1) For the year ended December 31, 2022, tax effect of adjustments of 15.3 million (-558 is primarily related to the to the fair value adjustments on the Company s equity investments and the derecognition of deferred tax liabilities related to the sale of La Preciosa and the Sterling /Crown exploration properties . For the year ended December 31, 2021, tax effect of adjustments of 10.3 million (-27 is primarily related to the VAT write-off. 
 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
 Management uses EBITDA to evaluate the Company s operating performance, to plan and forecast its operations, and assess leverage levels and liquidity measures. The Company believes the use of EBITDA reflects the underlying operating performance of our core mining business and allows investors and analysts to compare results of the Company to similar results of other mining companies. Adjusted EBITDA is a measure used in the indenture governing the 2029 Senior Notes and the RCF to determine our ability to make certain payments and incur additional indebtedness. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent, and should not be considered an alternative to, Net income (Loss) or Cash Flow from Operations as determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently and those calculations may not be comparable to our presentation. Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled to Net income (loss) in the following table: 
 53 

Year Ended December 31, In thousands except per share amounts 2022 2021 2020 Net income (loss) (78,107) (31,322) 25,627 Interest expense, net of capitalized interest 23,861 16,451 20,708 Income tax provision (benefit) 14,658 34,958 37,045 Amortization 111,626 128,315 131,387 EBITDA 72,038 148,402 214,767 Fair value adjustments, net 66,668 543 (7,601) Foreign exchange (gain) loss 850 2,779 2,445 Asset retirement obligation accretion 14,232 11,988 11,754 Inventory adjustments and write-downs 49,085 14,738 1,144 (Gain) loss on sale of assets and securities (64,429) (4,111) 2,484 RMC bankruptcy distribution (1,651) VAT litigation 1,142 VAT write-off 25,982 Loss on debt extinguishment 9,173 Silvertip inventory write-down 13,717 Silvertip suspension costs 7,164 Silvertip lease modification (4,051) Silvertip gain on contingent consideration (955) COVID-19 costs 1,739 6,618 15,555 Novation 3,819 Wharf inventory write-down 3,323 Interest income on notes receivables (720) Adjusted EBITDA (1) 
 138,954 216,112 263,565 
 (1) At September 30, 2022, the Company modified its method of calculating Adjusted EBITDA to include the cumulative impact of the LCM adjustments, if applicable, year over year. Previously, annual Adjusted EBITDA only included the current quarter LCM adjustment. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the modification increased the Adjusted EBITDA measure by 38.0 million and 5.3 million, respectively. This modification to the Adjusted EBITDA measure was made to be consistent with the treatment of LCM adjustments in the Company s amended RCF facility, which was completed on November 9, 2022. 
 
 Free Cash Flow 
 Management uses Free Cash Flow as a non-GAAP measure to analyze cash flows generated from operations. Free Cash Flow is Cash Provided By (used in) Operating Activities less Capital expenditures as presented on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company believes Free Cash Flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing the Company s performance with its competitors. Although Free Cash Flow and similar measures are frequently used as measures of cash flows generated from operations by other companies, the Company s calculation of Free Cash Flow is not necessarily comparable to such other similarly titled captions of other companies. 
 The following table sets forth a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to Cash Provided By (used in) Operating Activities , which the Company believes to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to Free Cash Flow. 
 Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 2020 Cash flow from operations 25,616 110,482 148,709 Capital expenditures 352,354 309,781 99,279 Free cash flow (326,738) (199,299) 49,430

Operating Cash Flow Before Changes in Working Capital 
 Management uses Operating Cash Flow Before Changes in Working Capital as a non-GAAP measure to analyze cash flows generated from operations. Operating Cash Flow Before Changes in Working Capital is Cash Provided By (used in) Operating Activities excluding the change in Receivables , Prepaid expenses and other , Inventories and Accounts payable and accrued liabilities as presented on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company believes Operating Cash Flow Before Changes in Working Capital is also useful as one of the bases for comparing the Company s performance with its competitors. Although Operating Cash Flow Before Changes in Working Capital and similar measures are frequently used as measures of cash flows generated from operations by other companies, the Company s calculation of Operating Cash Flow Before Changes in Working Capital is not necessarily comparable to such other similarly titled captions of other companies. 
 The following table sets forth a reconciliation of Operating Cash Flow Before Changes in Working Capital, a non-GAAP financial measure, to Cash Provided By (used in) Operating Activities , which the Company believes to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to Operating Cash Flow Before Changes in Working Capital. 
 Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 2019 Cash provided by (used in) operating activities 25,616 110,482 148,709 Changes in operating assets and liabilities: Receivables (4,452) 983 9,463 Prepaid expenses and other (240) (489) 2,621 Inventories 51,448 27,628 34,538 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities (510) 7,011 (32,897) Operating cash flow before changes in working capital 71,862 145,615 162,434 
 
 Costs Applicable to Sales 
 Management uses CAS to evaluate the Company s current operating performance and life of mine performance from discovery through reclamation. We believe these measures assist analysts, investors and other stakeholders in understanding the costs associated with producing gold, silver, zinc and lead, assessing our operating performance and ability to generate free cash flow from operations and sustaining production. These measures may not be indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Management believes that allocating CAS to gold, silver, zinc and lead based on gold, silver, zinc and lead metal sales relative to total metal sales best allows management, analysts, investors and other stakeholders to evaluate the operating performance of the Company. Other companies may calculate CAS differently as a result of reflecting the benefit from selling non-silver metals as a by-product credit, converting to silver equivalent ounces, and differences in underlying accounting principles and accounting frameworks such as in International Financial Reporting Standards.

 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 The Company is exposed to various market risks as a part of its operations and engages in risk management strategies to mitigate these risks. The Company continually evaluates the potential benefits of engaging in these strategies based on current market conditions. The Company does not actively engage in the practice of trading derivative instruments for profit. Additional information about the Company s derivative financial instruments may be found in Note 15 -- Derivative Financial Instruments in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This discussion of the Company s market risk assessments contains forward looking statements . For additional information regarding forward-looking statements and risks and uncertainties that could impact the Company, please refer to Item 2 of this Report - Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements. Actual results and actions could differ materially from those discussed below. 
 Gold and Silver Prices 
 Gold and silver prices may fluctuate widely due to numerous factors, such as U.S. dollar strength or weakness, demand, investor sentiment, inflation or deflation, and global mine production. The Company s profitability and cash flow may be significantly impacted by changes in the market price of gold and silver. 
 Decreases in the market price of gold and silver can also significantly affect the value of our metal inventory, stockpiles and leach pads, and it may be necessary to record a write-down to the net realizable value, as well as significantly impact our carrying value of long-lived assets. 
 Net realizable value represents the estimated future sales price based on short-term and long-term metals prices, less estimated costs to complete production and bring the product to sale. The primary factors that influence the need to record write-downs of our stockpiles, leach pads and product inventory include short-term and long-term metals prices and costs for production inputs such as labor, fuel and energy, materials and supplies as well as realized ore grades and recovery rates. The significant assumptions in determining the stockpile, leach pad and metal inventory adjustments at December 31, 2022 included production cost and capitalized expenditure assumptions unique to each operation, a short-term and long-term gold price of 1,726 and 1,715 per ounce, respectively, and a short-term and long-term silver price of 21.17 and 21.36 per ounce, respectively. 
 The net realizable value measurement involves the use of estimates and assumptions unique to each mining operation regarding current and future operating and capital costs, metal recoveries, production levels, commodity prices, proven and probable reserve quantities, engineering data and other factors. A high degree of judgment is involved in determining such assumptions and estimates and no assurance can be given that actual results will not differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions. 
 57 

Hedging 
 To mitigate the risks associated with metal price fluctuations, the Company may enter into option contracts to hedge future production. The Company had outstanding forward contracts on 130,500 ounces of gold at December 31, 2022 that settle monthly through December 2023. The Company is targeting to hedge up to 70 of expected gold production and 50 of expected silver production for 2023 in order to protect cash flow during a period of elevated capital expenditures, and may in the future layer on additional hedges as circumstances warrant. In early 2023, the Company added 49,998 ounces of gold forward contracts and 3.2 million ounces of silver forward contracts that settle monthly through December 2023. Taking into account the additional gold and silver hedges added in early 2023, the weighted average fixed price on the forward contracts is 1,961 per ounce of gold and 24.55 per ounce of silver. The contracts are generally net cash settled and, if the spot price of gold at the time of expiration is lower than the fixed price or higher than the fixed prices, it would result in a realized gain or loss, respectively. The forward contracts expose us to (i) credit risk in the form of non-performance by counterparties for contracts in which the contract price is below the spot price of a commodity, and (ii) price risk to the extent that the spot price exceeds the contract price for quantities of our production covered under contract positions. To reduce counter-party credit exposure, the Company enters into contracts with institutions management deems credit-worthy and limits credit exposure to each institution. The Company does not anticipate non-performance by any of its counterparties. For additional information, please see the section titled Risk Factors in the 2022 10-K and part II, Item 1A of this report. 
 At December 31, 2022, the fair value of the gold forward contracts was an asset of 12.3 million. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized a gain of 28.5 million related to expired contracts in Revenue and the remaining outstanding forwards contracts were included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) . A 10 increase and decrease in the price of gold at December 31, 2022 would result in a net realized loss and gain of 4.8 million and 44.3 million, respectively. The December 31, 2022 closing price of gold was 1,814 per ounce. As of February 22, 2023, the closing price of gold was 1,836 per ounce. 
 Provisional Metal Sales 
 The Company enters into sales contracts with third-party smelters and refiners which, in some cases, provide for a provisional payment based upon preliminary assays and quoted metal prices. The provisionally priced sales contracts contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract. Depending on the difference between the price at the time of sale and the final settlement price, embedded derivatives are recorded as either a derivative asset or liability. The embedded derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and, as a result, are marked to the market gold and silver price at the end of each period from the provisional sale date to the date of final settlement. The mark-to-market gains and losses are recorded in earnings. At December 31, 2022, the Company had outstanding provisionally priced sales of 14,556 ounces of gold at an average price of 1,786. Changes in gold prices resulted in provisional pricing mark-to-market gain of 0.37 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. A 10 change in realized gold prices would cause revenue to vary by 2.6 million. 
 Foreign Currency 
 The Company operates, or has mineral interests, in several foreign countries including Canada, Mexico, and New Zealand, which exposes it to foreign currency exchange rate risks. Foreign currency exchange rates are influenced by world market factors beyond the Company s control such as supply and demand for U.S. and foreign currencies and related monetary and fiscal policies. Fluctuations in local currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar may significantly impact profitability and cash flow. 
 Foreign Exchange Hedging 
 To manage foreign currency risk, the Company may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts. In 2020, the Company entered into foreign currency forward contracts to manage this risk and designated these instruments as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign denominated transactions. The Company had no outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts at December 31, 2022. 
 Interest Rates 
 Interest Rate Hedging 
 The Company may use financial instruments to manage exposures to changes in interest rates on loans, which exposes it to credit risk and market risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty owes the Company, which creates credit risk for the Company. When the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, the Company owes the counterparty and, therefore, it does not pose credit risk. The Company seeks to minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions 
 58 

with what it believes are high-quality counterparties. Market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change in interest rates. The Company had no outstanding interest rate swaps at December 31, 2022. 
 Investment Risk 
 Equity Price Risk 
 The Company is exposed to changes in the fair value of our investments in equity securities. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized unrealized losses of 47.9 million in Fair value adjustments, net due to decreases in the stock price of those equity securities. At December 31, 2022, the fair value of the equity securities was 44.2 million. A 10 change in realized equity prices would result in an unrealized gain or loss of 4.4 million.

 Opinion on the financial statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Coeur Mining, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ), and our report dated February 22, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion. 
 Basis for opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical audit matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 Ore on Leach Pads Rochester mine 
 As described further in Notes 2 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements , the Company s ore on leach pads balance of 134 million which includes the Rochester mine for a total of 109 million as of December 31, 2022. This is a current balance of 58 million and a non-current balance of 51 million. The measurement and valuation of the ore on leach pads balance involves significant management estimates and assumptions related to the measure of metal content of ore placed on the leach pads, including recovery rates and ore grades. The balance is determined based on actual production costs incurred to produce and place ore on the leach pads, less costs allocated to minerals recovered through the leach process. The historical cost of metal expected to be extracted within twelve months is classified as current on the balance sheet. We identified the measurement and valuation for the ore on leach pads for the Rochester mine as a critical audit matter. 
 The principal considerations for our determination that Rochester s ore on leach pads is a critical audit matter are that certain management assumption are complex and have a higher degree of estimation uncertainty that changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the balance. In turn, auditing Rochester s ore on leach pads requires significant auditor judgement. 
 60 

Our audit procedures related to Rochester s ore on leach pads included the following, among others. 
 We obtained and tested Rochester s 2022 roll forward of the estimated ounces and costs added to, recovered from, and the resulting ending amounts of ounces and costs of the ore on leach pads balance, including testing of certain assumptions, such as recovery rates, ore grades and the related lower of cost or market analysis. 
 For the roll forward of estimated ounces, we assessed the completeness and accuracy of mining production information, including tests of daily tonnage processed. 
 We evaluated management s laboratory procedures related to assay testing used to estimate ore grade. 
 We evaluated the Company s use of specialists and their qualifications and experience related to their input on the recovery rates and ore grades estimates used by management in its calculation of ore on leach pads. 
 We assessed the estimated timing of recoveries, which management uses in classifying current and non-current portions of the ore on leach pads balance. 
 We tested the effectiveness of management s controls over mining production information, estimating the recovery rates, ore grades, and inventory roll forward related to recording Rochester s balance of ore on leach pads.

 Opinion on internal control over financial reporting 
 We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Coeur Mining, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by COSO. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, and our report dated February 22, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. 
 Basis for opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

million and million, respectively. The ultimate timing of the release of the collateralized amounts is dependent on the timing and closure of each mine and repayment of the facility. In order to release the collateral, the Company must seek approval from certain government agencies responsible for monitoring the mine closure status. Collateral could also be released to the extent the Company is able to secure alternative financial assurance satisfactory to the regulatory agencies. The Company believes there is a reasonable probability that the collateral will remain in place beyond a twelve-month period and has therefore classified these investments as long-term.

 A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized. The Company analyzes its deferred tax assets and, if it is determined that the Company will not realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets, it will record or increase a valuation allowance. Conversely, if it is determined that the Company will ultimately be more likely than not able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided, all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced. There are a number of factors that impact the Company s ability to realize its deferred tax assets.

 At December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, thousand, million, and million, respectively, of these gross unrecognized benefits would, if recognized, decrease the Company s effective tax rate. 
 The Company operates in numerous countries around the world and is subject to, and pays annual income taxes under, the various income tax regimes in the countries in which it operates. The Company has historically filed, and continues to file, all required income tax returns and paid the taxes reasonably determined to be due. The tax rules and regulations in many countries are highly complex and subject to interpretation. From time to time, the Company is subject to a review of its historic income tax filings and, in connection with such reviews, disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation or application of certain rules to the Company s business conducted within the country involved. 
 The Company files income tax returns in various U.S. federal and state jurisdictions, in all identified foreign jurisdictions, and various others. The statute of limitations remains open from 2019 for the US federal jurisdiction and from 2016 for certain other foreign jurisdictions. As a result of statutes of limitations that will begin to expire within the next 12 months in various jurisdictions and possible settlement of audit-related issues with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions with respect to which none of these issues are individually significant, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the total amount of its unrecognized income tax liability will decrease less than million in the next 12 months. 
 The Company classifies interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense and recognized interest and penalties of , million, and million at December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.

 Performance shares granted under the Company s incentive plans are accounted for as equity awards at fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model. Performance shares granted during and subsequent to 2019 will vest at the end of a three-year service period if internal performance metrics are met, with the number of shares vesting impacted by the inclusion of a modifier based upon a relative stockholder return metric. The relative stockholder return metric is included in the determination of the grant date fair value of the performance shares; however, the recognition of compensation cost for performance share awards is based on the results of the internal performance metrics. Performance shares granted prior to 2019 vested at the end of the three-year service period if relative stockholder return and internal performance metrics were met. The existence of a market condition required recognition of compensation cost for the performance share awards over the requisite period regardless of whether the relative stockholder return metric was met.

 Stock options and stock appreciation rights (SARs) granted under the Company s incentive plans generally vest over three years and are exercisable over a period not to exceed ten years from the grant date. The exercise price of stock options is equal to the fair market value of the shares on the date of the grant. The value of each stock option award is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Stock options are accounted for as equity awards and SARs are accounted for as liability awards and remeasured at each reporting date. SARs, when vested, provide the participant the right to receive cash equal to the excess of the market price of the shares over the exercise price when exercised.

 Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedging Strategies 
 To protect the Company s exposure to fluctuations in metal prices the Company enters into forward contracts. The contracts are net settled monthly and if the actual price of gold at the time of expiration is lower than the fixed price or higher than the fixed prices, it would result in a realized gain or loss, respectively. The Company has elected to designate these instruments as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions at their inception. 
 Notional ounces 
 The effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of metal sales revenue are recognized as a component of Revenue in the same period as the related sale is recognized. 
 At inception, the Company performed an assessment of the forecasted transactions and the hedging instruments and determined that the hedging relationships are considered perfectly effective. Future assessments are performed to verify that critical terms of the hedging instruments and the forecasted transactions continue to match, and the forecasted transactions remain probable, as well as an assessment of any adverse developments regarding the risk of the counterparties defaulting on their commitments. There have been no such changes in critical terms or adverse developments. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company had million of net after-tax gain in AOCI related to gains from cash flow hedge transactions, of which million of net after-tax gains is expected to be recognized in its Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss) during the next 12 months. Actual amounts ultimately reclassified to net income are dependent on the price of gold for metal contracts.

 million in principal is due from the Mexican government associated with VAT that was paid under Coeur Mexicana, S.A. de C.V. s Coeur Mexicana s prior royalty agreement with a subsidiary of Franco-Nevada Corporation, which was terminated in 2016. Coeur Mexicana applied for and initially received VAT refunds associated with the royalty payments in the normal course; however, in 2011 the Mexican tax authorities began denying Coeur Mexicana s VAT refunds based on the argument that VAT was not legally due on the royalty payments. Accordingly, Coeur Mexicana began to request refunds of the VAT as undue payments, which the Mexican tax authorities also denied. The Company has since been engaged in ongoing efforts to recover the VAT from the Mexican government (including through litigation and potential arbitration as well as refiling VAT refund requests). Despite a favorable ruling from Mexican tax courts in this matter in 2018, litigation has continued at the administrative, appeals court and supreme court levels, most of which has been determined unfavorably to Coeur based on interpretations of applicable law and prior court decisions which the Company and its counsel believe are contrary to legal precedent, conflicting and erroneous. While the Company believes that it remains legally entitled to be refunded the full amount of the VAT receivable and intends to rigorously continue its VAT recovery efforts, based on the continued failure to recover the VAT receivable and unfavorable Mexican court decisions, the Company determined to write down the carrying value of the VAT receivable at September 30, 2021. Coeur Mexicana has elected initiate an arbitration proceeding under Chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, to resolve the matter. Outcomes in NAFTA arbitration and the process for recovering funds even if there is a successful outcome in NAFTA arbitration can be lengthy and unpredictable. 
 In addition, ongoing litigation with the Mexican government associated with enforcement of water rights in Mexico, if unsuccessful, may impact Coeur Mexicana s ability to access new sources of water to provide sufficient supply for its operations at Palmarejo and, if material, may have a material adverse impact on the Company s operations and financial results.

 Kensington Prepayment 
 In June 2019, Coeur amended its existing sales and purchase contract with a metal sales counterparty for gold concentrate from its Kensington mine (the Amended Sales Contract ). From time to time thereafter, the Amended Sales Contract has been further amended to allow for additional prepayments, including in June 2021, to provide options for Coeur to receive up to two additional prepayments of up to million each. The Company exercised these options and received million both in June 2021 (the "June 2021 Prepayment") and in December 2021 (the "December 2021 Prepayment"). The June 2021 Prepayment was repaid in full before the December 2021 Prepayment was received. In March 2022, the Amended Sales Contract was further amended to allow for an additional million prepayment which was made in March 2022 (the March 2022 Prepayment ). The Amended Sales Contract was further amended in June 2022 to consolidate the December 2021 Prepayment and the March 2022 Prepayment into a single consolidated prepayment (the June 2022 Consolidated Prepayment ), to extend the repayment period for the June 2022 Consolidated Prepayment, and to provide for future prepayments of up to million on a semi-annual basis through the end of 2024, provided all prior outstanding prepayment amounts are paid before such future prepayments are made. In December 2022, the Company exercised an option to receive a million prepayment (the December 2022 Prepayment concurrent with the repayment of the June 2022 Consolidated Prepayment in full. The remaining deliveries of the December 2022 Prepayment are recognized as a deferred revenue liability and are presented in Accrued liabilities and other on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure 
 Not applicable. 

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 
 (a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by it in its periodic reports filed with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on an evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures conducted by the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, such officers concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective and operating at a reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2022. 
 (b) Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 defines internal control over financial reporting in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: 
 i. Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; 
 ii. Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and 
 iii. Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 The Company s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, the Company s management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Based upon its assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective. 
 The effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by Grant Thornton LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein. 
 (c) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.
