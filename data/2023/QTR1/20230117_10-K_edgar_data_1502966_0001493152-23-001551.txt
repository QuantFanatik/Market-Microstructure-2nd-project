ITEM
1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

Overview 

Digipath,
Inc. was incorporated in Nevada on October 5, 2010. Digipath, Inc. and its subsidiaries Digipath, the Company, 
 we, our or us is a service-oriented independent testing laboratory and data analytics company
focused on the developing cannabis and hemp markets, and supports the cannabis industry s best practices for reliable testing.
Our mission is to provide pharmaceutical-grade analysis and testing to the cannabis industry, under ISO-17025:2017 guidelines, to ensure
consumers and patients know exactly what is in the cannabis they ingest and to help maximize the quality of our clients products
through research, development, and standardization. Digipath has been operating a cannabis-testing lab in Nevada since 2015 and has plans
to open labs in other states that have legalized the sale of cannabis, beginning with California. 

Business 

Our
cannabis testing business is operated through our wholly owned subsidiary, Digipath Labs, Inc., which performs all cannabis related testing
using FDA-compliant laboratory equipment and processes. We opened our first testing lab in Las Vegas, Nevada in May of 2015 to serve
the new State approved and licensed medical marijuana industry. We have plans to open labs in other legal states, assuming resources
permit. 

We
seek to be the nation s highest standard, full-service testing lab for cannabis, hemp and ancillary cannabis and hemp infused products.
We are a third party independent testing laboratory facility for cannabis, cannabis infused products, hemp and other botanical nutraceuticals
to serve growers, dispensaries, caregivers, producers, patients and eventually all end users of cannabis and botanical products. 

Our
mission is to provide pharmaceutical-grade analysis and testing to the cannabis and hemp industry, under ISO-17025:2017 guidelines, to
ensure consumers and patients know exactly what is in the cannabis and hemp they ingest and to help maximize the quality of our client s
products through research, development and standardization. 

1 

As
a premier cannabis and hemp testing laboratory with ISO-17025:2017 accreditation, we take a careful, strategic approach to all of our
cannabis and hemp testing. A diverse array of tests combined with our lab equipment and analytical instrumentation enable us to accurately
test cannabis and hemp for potency, the presence of pesticides, microbial contamination, metals and heavy metals, which include, but
are not limited to, substances like arsenic, cadmium, lead, or mercury. Not only is testing for potency and Cannabidiol CBD and tetrahydrocannabinol THC content important, we recognize that more profound testing is needed particularly as a true
national standard is developed. Digipath Labs is committed to follow Food and Drug Administration FDA ), Drug Enforcement
Agency DEA ), Environmental Protection Agency EPA ), US Department of Agriculture USDA guidelines,
proprietary standard operating procedures SOP ), and Good Lab Practices GLP that are in line with current
Federal and State governing bodies. We utilize a variety of tests to safely and effectively share enhanced understanding of the cannabis
plant with caregivers, dispensaries and patients. We are committed to the advancement of science by offering a method of standardization
for cannabis that is intricate and accurate. This approach and our investment in state-of-the-art testing equipment are of the utmost
importance. 

Digipath
Labs screens medicinal and recreational cannabis for potentially harmful contaminants, including: 

-
Residual Solvents (for extracts) 

 -
Moisture 

 -
Water Activity 

 -
Visual Inspection 

 -
Pesticides 

 -
Heavy metals, including mercury, arsenic, lead, cadmium, chromium and nickel 

 -
Biological toxins, such as aflatoxin and ocratoxins 

 -
Microbial contaminants including E. coli, salmonella, coliforms, aspergillus, gram negative bacteria, total aerobic bacteria and mold
and yeast 

Digipath
Labs also tests cannabis and hemp for its quality, potency, and cannabinoid and terpene profiles, which determine the suitability of
specific chemoprofiles for the treatment of specific ailments. 

We
utilize one of our two Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatographs UPLC ), which accurately separates and measures the
cannabinoid content of any sample of flower, edible, concentrate or other cannabis products. Our Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer ICP-MS is utilized for heavy metals testing, and provides accurate readings for harmful metals ensuring that the Parts
Per Billion PPB are substantially below the regulated and accepted trace amounts. Our laboratory testing equipment is
calibrated using third party reference standards to ensure precision measurements throughout the testing process and has been certified
by ISO-17025:2017 standards. 

With
accurate science becoming a major part of the cannabis and hemp industry, the major question is one of standards; we hold ourselves accountable
and provide efficient and accurate research and results to our clients. Our test results are meant to help dispensaries, caregivers and
patients know the concentration and quality of their cannabis without having to question the credibility of the data. 

Market
Overview 

According
to New Frontier Data, a cannabis researcher based in Washington, D.C., the hemp CBD business worldwide will grow from 4.4 billion in
2018 to over 14.7 billion by 2026, and the worldwide cannabis industry in 2019 generated 15 Billion. In 2024 that will increase to
 44.8 Billion. Total legal sales of cannabis in current legal states are projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of
14 over the next six years, reaching nearly 30 billion by 2025. This figure takes into account the likely projection that more states
will legalize. Currently, thirty-nine states and the District of Columbia have passed some kind of medical and/or adult use marijuana
laws. 

Annual
 sales of medical cannabis are projected to grow at a 17 CAGR through 2025, to an estimated 13.1 billion by 2025; adult-use sales
 are projected to grow at a 16 CAGR, to 16.6 billion. 

An
 estimated 38.4 million U.S. adults consume cannabis at least once annually, from either a legal or illicit source. 

36 
 of cannabis consumers report using cannabis daily, and 59 use cannabis at least once a week. 

With
increased legalization nationwide, the lab-testing sector is expected to experience substantial growth. According to The Insight Partners,
the cannabis testing market is expected to reach approximately 2.5 billion in 2025, with an estimated CAGR of 11.9 from 2017-2025.
The data troves collected through the testing process are already creating value and could become an increasingly valuable asset and
generate substantial revenue for the most accomplished laboratories. This data could also be used to determine specific genetic attributes
of targeted cannabinoids and assist with maximizing medicinal benefits and individualized medicine in the future. 

2 

Competition 

The
cannabis industry in the United States is highly fragmented, rapidly expanding and evolving. The industry is characterized by new and
potentially disruptive or conflicting legislation promulgated on a state-by-state basis. Our competitors include local enterprises, some
of which may have financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources greater than ours. These companies also compete with us
in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel and consultants. 

Our
competitive position depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientists and other personnel, develop effective proprietary
products and solutions, the personal relationships of our executive officers and directors, and our ability to secure adequate capital
resources. We compete to attract and retain customers of our services. We compete in this area on the basis of price, regulatory compliance,
vendor relationships, usefulness, availability, excellent customer service and ease of use of our services. 

Government
Regulation 

Marijuana
is categorized as a Schedule-I controlled substance by the Drug Enforcement Agency and the United States Department of Justice and is
illegal to grow, possess and consume under Federal law. A Schedule-I controlled substance is defined as a substance that has no currently
accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The Department
of Justice defines Schedule 1 controlled substances as the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe
psychological or physical dependence. However, since 1995, thirty-nine states and the District of Columbia have passed some kind
of medical and/or adult use marijuana laws. This has created an unpredictable business-environment for dispensaries and collectives that
legally operate under state-laws but in violation of Federal law. On August 29, 2013, United States Deputy Attorney General James Cole
issued the Cole Memo to United States Attorneys guiding them to prioritize enforcement of Federal law away from the cannabis industry
operating as permitted under state law, so long as: 

cannabis
 is not being distributed to minors and dispensaries are not located around schools and public buildings; 

the
 proceeds from sales are not going to gangs, cartels or criminal enterprises; 

cannabis
 grown in states where it is legal is not being diverted to other states; 

cannabis-related
 businesses are not being used as a cover for sales of other illegal drugs or illegal activity; 

there
 is not any violence or use of fire-arms in the cultivation and sale of marijuana; 

there
 is strict enforcement of drugged-driving laws and adequate prevention of adverse health consequences; and 

cannabis
 is not grown, used, or possessed on Federal properties. 

The
Cole Memo was meant only as a guide, not a rule of law, for United States Attorneys and did not alter in any way the Department of Justice s
Federal authority to enforce Federal law, including Federal laws relating to cannabis, regardless of state law. Moreover, the Cole Memorandum
also provided that it could not be used as a defense to any criminal prosecution. 

On
January 4, 2018, United States Attorney General Jefferson Sessions issued a Memorandum to United States Attorneys rescinding the Cole
Memorandum, stating that prosecutors should follow well-established principles in effect prior to the issuance of the Cole Memorandum
that govern all federal prosecutions in deciding which activities to prosecute under existing federal laws. Federal legislation has been
proposed over the years to reschedule or de-schedule cannabis, as well as to transform the Cole Memorandum into a rule of law. 

Customers 

We
provide cannabis and hemp lab testing services in Las Vegas to Nevada licensed Medical Marijuana Enterprises MMEs ), and
have expanded to recreational use facilities with the recently passed legislation that allows for the recreational use of marijuana in
Nevada. We sell our services to these enterprises on a fixed fee per test or panel of tests, and offer a discounted price for customers
based on volume. On June 17, 2014, Clark County initially approved a total of 117 special use permits for cultivation and 87 production
applicants. Since the inception of legalized adult-use marijuana, Nevada has issued 288 cannabis-related licenses, including those for
retail stores, cultivation, production, and testing labs, according to the state taxation department. We have worked with over 90 cultivators
and producers in and around Clark and Nye County. As new harvests come to market, we anticipate further customer growth, especially with
the relatively recent legalization of recreational cannabis in the State of Nevada in 2017. 

3 

Marketing,
Sales and Support 

We
use a range of communication platforms to reach our target customers. The goal of the marketing strategy is to position us as the leading
testing company in the botanical, nutraceutical, and cannabis industries in the country. Our marketing efforts include digital/online,
industry conferences and affiliations, media outreach, direct response and public relations. We believe that these efforts have the ability
to deliver our brand message in a powerful way to maximize audience reach. 

Seasonality 

Our
business is not subject to seasonality. 

Insurance 

We
maintain property, business interruption and casualty insurance. 

Employees 

As
of September 30, 2022, we had seventeen employees. None of our employees are members of a trade union. We believe that we maintain good
relationships with our employees and have not experienced any strikes or shutdowns and have not been involved in any labor disputes. 

Corporate

ITEM
1A. Risk Factors 

The
following important factors, and the important factors described elsewhere in this report or in our other filings with the SEC, could
affect (and in some cases have affected) our results and could cause our results to be materially different from estimates or expectations.
Other risks and uncertainties may also affect our results or operations adversely. The following and these other risks could materially
and adversely affect our business, operations, results or financial condition. 

An
investment in the Company is highly speculative in nature and involves an extremely high degree of risk. 

Our
auditor has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We may be unable to obtain additional capital
required to implement our business plan. As a result of recurring net losses and insufficient cash reserves, our independent
certified public accountant has added a paragraph to its report on our financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2022 questioning
our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional
capital and to achieve sustainable revenues and profitable operations. Since inception, we have raised funds primarily through the sale
of equity securities. We will need and are currently seeking additional funds to operate our business. No assurance can be given that
any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to us. Even if we are able to
obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders.
If we are unable to obtain additional funds, our ability to carry out and implement our planned business objectives and strategies will
be significantly delayed, limited or may not occur. We cannot guarantee that we will become profitable. Even if we achieve profitability,
given the competitive and evolving nature of the industry in which we operate, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability
and our failure to do so would adversely affect our business, including our ability to raise additional funds. 

We
have a limited operating history and if we are not successful in continuing to grow our business, then we may have to scale back or even
cease our ongoing business operations. We have a limited operating history. Our operations are subject to all the risks inherent
in the establishment of a developing enterprise and the uncertainties arising from the absence of a significant operating history. If
our business plan is not successful, and we are not able to operate profitably, investors may lose some or all of their investment in
our company. 

4 

Our
plans are dependent upon key individuals and the ability to attract qualified personnel . In order to execute our business plan,
we will be dependent on upon our executive officers and directors, as well as other key personnel. The loss of any of the foregoing individuals
could have a material adverse effect upon our business prospects. Moreover, our success continues to depend to a significant extent on
our ability to identify, attract, hire, train and retain qualified professional, creative, technical and managerial personnel. Competition
for such personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, attracting, hiring, training,
and retaining such personnel in the future. If we are unable to hire, assimilate and retain such qualified personnel in the future, our
business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. We may also depend on third party contractors
and other partners, to assist with the execution of our business plan. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in either
attracting and retaining qualified personnel, or creating arrangements with such third parties. The failure to succeed in these endeavors
would have a material adverse effect on our ability to consummate our business plans. 

Risks
Related To Cannabis Related Businesses 

Our
business is dependent on state laws pertaining to the cannabis industry. As of November, 2022, thirty-eight states and the District
of Columbia allow its citizens to use medical cannabis. Additionally, twenty-one states and the District of Columbia have legalized cannabis
for adult recreational use, and additional recreational measures are expected to be pursued by other states in the future. Continued
development of the cannabis industry is dependent upon continued legislative authorization of cannabis at the state level. Any number
of factors could slow or halt progress in this area. Further, progress in the cannabis industry, while encouraging, is not assured. While
there may be ample public support for legislative action, numerous factors impact the legislative process. Any one of these factors could
slow or halt use of cannabis, which would negatively impact our business. 

Cannabis
remains illegal under federal law and a change in federal enforcement practices could significantly and negatively affect our business.
 Despite the development of a cannabis industry legal under state laws, state laws legalizing medicinal and adult cannabis use
are in conflict with the Federal Controlled Substances Act, which classifies cannabis as a Schedule-I controlled substance and makes
cannabis use and possession illegal on a national level. The United States Supreme Court has ruled that it is the Federal government
that has the right to regulate and criminalize cannabis, even for medical purposes, and thus Federal law criminalizing the use of cannabis
preempts state laws that legalize its use. While the Obama Administration s Department of Justice adopted a policy (known as the
Cole Memorandum) that effectively stated that it was not an efficient use of resources to direct Federal law enforcement agencies to
prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical cannabis, on January 4, 2018,
the United States Attorney General rescinded the Cole Memorandum. The Federal government s enforcement of Federal laws could cause
significant financial damage to us and our shareholders. 

The
loss or temporary suspension of one or more of our licenses could significantly reduce our revenues. Our ability to operate our
cannabis testing lab is dependent upon maintaining licenses issued by state and local regulators in Nevada. Our cannabis testing and
business licenses were briefly suspended by Nevada regulators on January 19, 2018 and were reinstated on January 31, 2018. This significantly
affected our financial results for the second and third fiscal quarters of 2018. In order to retain our licenses, we are required to
comply with ongoing compliance and reporting requirements and ongoing regulation and oversight by governmental authorities. Any failure
to comply with any such regulatory requirements or any failure to maintain any required licenses would have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition, results of operation and, in the extreme case, require us to discontinue operations. 

5 

As
the possession and use of cannabis is illegal under the Federal Controlled Substances Act, we may be deemed to be aiding and abetting
illegal activities through the services that we provide. As a result, we may be subject to enforcement actions by law enforcement authorities,
which would materially and adversely affect our business. Under Federal law, and more specifically the Federal Controlled Substances
Act, the possession, use, cultivation, and transfer of cannabis is illegal. Our business provides services to customers that are engaged
in the business of possession, use, cultivation, and/or transfer of cannabis. As a result, law enforcement authorities, in their attempt
to regulate the illegal use of cannabis, may seek to bring an action or actions against us, including, but not limited, to a claim of
aiding and abetting another s criminal activities. The Federal aiding and abetting statute provides that anyone who commits
an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal. 
18 U.S.C. 2(a). As a result of such an action, we may be forced to cease operations and our investors could lose their entire investment.
Such an action would have a material negative effect on our business and operations. 

Laws
and regulations affecting the cannabis and marijuana industries are constantly changing, which could detrimentally affect our business,
and we cannot predict the impact that future regulations may have on us. Local, state and federal cannabis laws and regulations
are constantly changing and they are subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated
with compliance or to alter one or more of our service offerings. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations,
could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our revenues, profitability, and financial condition. We cannot
predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental
regulations or administrative policies and procedures, when and if promulgated, could have on our business. Any change in law or interpretation
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Federal
enforcement practices could change with respect to services providers to participants in the cannabis industry, which could adversely
impact us. If the federal government were to change its practices, or were to expand its resources attacking providers in the cannabis
industry, such action could have a materially adverse effect on our operations, our customers, or the sales of our products. It
is possible that additional Federal or state legislation could be enacted in the future that would prohibit our customers from selling
cannabis, and if such legislation were enacted, such customers may discontinue the use of our services. We cannot predict the nature
of any future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations
or administrative policies and procedures, when and if promulgated, could have on our business. 

Expansion
by well-established laboratory testing companies into the cannabis industry could prevent us from realizing anticipated growth in customers
and revenues. Traditional laboratory testing companies may expand their businesses into cannabis testing. If they decided to
expand into cannabis testing, this could hurt the growth of our business and cause our revenues to be lower than we expect. 

Due
to our involvement in the cannabis industry, we may have a difficult time obtaining the various insurances that are desired to operate
our business, which may expose us to additional risk and financial liabilities. Insurance that is otherwise readily available,
such as workers compensation, general liability, and directors and officers insurance, is more difficult for us to find, and more
expensive, because we are service providers to companies in the cannabis industry. We currently have adequate coverage, however, there
are no guarantees that we will be able to find such insurances in the future, or that the cost will be affordable to us. If we are forced
to go without such insurances, it may prevent us from entering into certain business sectors, may inhibit our growth, and may expose
us to additional risk and financial liabilities. 

Participants
in the cannabis industry have difficulty accessing the service of banks, which makes it difficult for us to operate. Despite
rules issued by the United States Department of the Treasury mitigating the risk to banks that do business with cannabis companies permitted
under state law, as well as guidance from the United States Department of Justice, banks remain wary to accept funds from businesses
in the cannabis industry. Our prior bank at which we maintained deposit accounts forced us to close our accounts. While after much difficulty
we were recently able find a replacement banking institution, there can be no assurance that we will able to maintain this banking relationship.
Since the use of cannabis remains illegal under Federal law, there remains a compelling argument that banks may be in violation of Federal
law when accepting for deposit, funds derived from the sale or distribution of cannabis. Consequently, businesses involved in the cannabis
industry, including us, continue to have trouble establishing and maintain banking relationships. An inability to open and maintain bank
accounts may make it difficult for us and our customers to do business. In addition, our inability to maintain a bank account previously
resulted in our holding large sums of cash. Although we store our cash in a secure safe, holding large sums of cash exposes us to a greater
risk of theft. 

The
outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus has negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact our business and the global economy.
In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively impact our ability to obtain financing when required. 

The
COVID-19 coronavirus has spread across the globe and is impacting worldwide economic activity. A pandemic, including COVID-19 or other
public health epidemic, poses the risk that we or our employees, customers, and other commercial partners may be prevented from conducting
business activities for an indefinite period of time, including due to the spread of the disease or shutdowns requested or mandated by
governmental authorities. During portions of our year ended September 30, 2022, the Company s cannabis testing operations significantly
declined due to the decline in the Nevada cannabis markets, which resulted in turn from the substantial decline in Nevada tourism due
to COVID-19. While our operations have recently improved due to the reopening of Nevada casinos and increased tourism compared to its
recent depressed levels, there can be no assurance that this trend will continue. COVID-19 has also had an adverse impact on global economic
conditions, which could impair our ability to raise capital when needed.

Risks
Related To Our Common Stock 

Our
operating results may fluctuate causing volatility in our stock price. Our operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number
of factors, many of which are outside of our control. The following factors may affect our operating results causing volatility in our
stock price: 

Our
 ability to execute our business plan, compete effectively and attract customers; 

Our
 ability to respond effectively to a rapidly evolving regulatory and competitive landscape; 

The
 amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations
 and infrastructure; 

Our
 ability to obtain working capital financing; 

Our
 ability to attract, motivate and retain top-quality employees; 

Investors 
 general perception of us; and 

General
 economic conditions and those economic conditions specific to cannabis industry. 

Trading
in our common stock has been limited, there is no significant trading market for our common stock, and purchasers of our common stock
may be unable to sell their shares. Our common stock is currently eligible for quotation on the OTCQB and OTCBB, however trading
to date has been limited. If activity in the market for shares of our common stock does not increase, purchasers of our shares may find
it difficult to sell their shares. We currently do not meet the initial listing criteria for any registered securities exchange, including
the Nasdaq Stock Market. The OTCQB and OTCBB are often characterized by low trading volume and significant price fluctuations. These
and other factors may further impair our stockholders ability to sell their shares when they want to and/or could depress our
stock price. As a result, stockholders may find it difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate quotations of the price of our securities
because smaller quantities of shares could be bought and sold, transactions could be delayed and security analyst and news coverage of
our Company may be limited. These factors could result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our shares of
common stock. 

Applicable
sec rules governing the trading of penny stocks may limit the trading and liquidity of our common stock which may affect
the trading price our common stock. Our common stock is a penny stock as defined under Rule 3a51-1 of the Exchange
Act, and is accordingly subject to SEC rules and regulations that impose limitations upon the manner in which our common stock can be
publicly traded. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a per share price of less than 5.00 (other than securities registered
on some national securities exchanges or quoted on NASDAQ). The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in
a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about
penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current
bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and, if the
broker-dealer is the sole market maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer s presumed control over
the market, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer s account. In addition,
broker-dealers who sell these securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors must make
a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written
agreement to the transaction. Consequently, these requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity, if any,
of our common stock and reducing the liquidity of an investment in our common stock. 

We
have outstanding shares of preferred stock with rights and preferences superior to those of our common stock. The issued and
outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock grant the holders of such preferred stock liquidation
rights that are superior to those held by the holders of our common stock. 

We
have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the future. Any return on investment may be limited to the
value of our common stock . We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable
future. The payment of dividends on our common stock depends on earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors
affecting us at such time as our board of directors may consider relevant.

2012
Incentive Plan 

Effective
Date and Expiration. The 2012 Incentive Plan, as amended, became effective on March 5, 2012, and terminated on March 5, 2022. No
award may be made under the Incentive Plan after its expiration date, but awards made prior thereto may extend beyond that date. 

Share
Authorization. The maximum aggregate number of Shares which may be issued pursuant to awards granted under the 2012 Incentive Plan
is Eleven Million Five Hundred Thousand (11,500,000) shares. Prior to its amendment in June 2016, Three Million shares had been authorized
for issuance under the 2012 Plan. 

General;
Types of Awards . The 2012 Incentive Plan provides for the grant of options to purchase shares of common stock, restricted stock,
stock appreciation rights SARs and restricted stock units (rights to receive, in cash or stock, the market value of one
share of our commons stock). Incentive stock options ISOs may be granted only to employees. Nonstatutory stock options
and other stock-based awards may be granted to officers, employees, non-employee directors and consultants. 

Administration .
The 2012 Incentive Plan will be administered by our board of directors or a committee of our board of directors (the Administrator as provided in the 2012 Incentive Plan. The Administrator will have the authority to select the eligible participants to whom awards
will be granted, to determine the types of awards and the number of shares covered and to set the terms, conditions and provisions of
such awards, to cancel or suspend awards under certain conditions, and to accelerate the exercisability of awards. The Administrator
will be authorized to interpret the 2012 Incentive Plan, to establish, amend, and rescind any rules and regulations relating to the 2012
Incentive Plan, to determine the terms of agreements entered into with recipients under the 2012 Incentive Plan, and to make all other
determinations that may be necessary or advisable for the administration of the 2012 Incentive Plan. 

Eligibility .
Options and other awards may be granted under the 2012 Incentive Plan to directors, officers, employees and consultants of our company
and any of our subsidiaries, provided that the services of such consultants are not in connection with the offer or sale of securities
in a capital-raising transaction and do not directly or indirectly promote or maintain a market for our securities. At the date of this
prospectus, all of our officers, directors and employees would have been eligible to receive awards under the 2012 Incentive Plan. 

Stock
Options . The exercise price per share of our common stock purchasable upon exercise of any stock option or SAR will be determined
by the Administrator, but cannot in any event be less than 100 of the fair market value of our common stock on the date the award is
granted. The Administrator will determine the term of each stock option or SAR (subject to a maximum term of 10 years) and each option
or SAR will be exercisable pursuant to a vesting schedule determined by the Administrator. The grants and the terms of ISOs will be restricted
to the extent required for qualification as ISOs by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Subject to approval of the Administrator,
options or SARs may be exercised by payment of the exercise price in cash, shares of common stock or pursuant to a cashless exercise 
through a broker-dealer under an arrangement approved by the Administrator. The Administrator may require the grantee to pay to us any
applicable withholding taxes that we are required to withhold with respect to the grant or exercise of any option. The withholding tax
may be paid in cash or, subject to applicable law, the Administrator may permit the grantee to satisfy these obligations by the withholding
or delivery of shares of our common stock. We may withhold from any shares of our common stock that may be issued pursuant to an option
or from any cash amounts otherwise due from us to the recipient of the option an amount equal to such taxes. 

Restricted
Stock . Restricted shares may be sold or awarded for consideration determined by the Administrator, including cash, full-recourse
promissory notes, as well as past and future services. Any award of restricted shares will be subject to a vesting schedule determined
by the Administrator. Any restricted shares that are not vested will be subject to rights of repurchase, rights of first refusal or other
restrictions as determined by the Administrator. In general, holders of restricted shares will have the same voting, dividend and other
rights as our other stockholders. 

Adjustments
upon Changes in Capitalization . In the event of any change affecting shares of our common stock by reason of any stock dividend or
split, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, spin-off, combination or exchange of shares or other similar corporate change, or any

of shares that may be distributed under the 2012 Incentive Plan, and in the number and types of shares subject to, and the exercise prices
under, outstanding awards granted under the 2012 Incentive Plan, in accordance with Section 10 and other provisions of the 2012 Incentive
Plan. 

Assignment .
Unless otherwise permitted by the 2012 Incentive Plan and approved by the Administrator as permitted by the 2012 Incentive Plan, no award
will be assignable or otherwise transferable by the grantee other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution and, during the
grantee s lifetime, an award may be exercised only by the grantee. 

Amendment .
Our board of directors may amend the 2012 Incentive Plan in any and all respects without stockholder approval, except as such stockholder
approval may be required under applicable law or pursuant to the listing requirements of any national market system or securities exchange
on which our equity securities may be listed or quoted.

7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

This
discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows of the Company
and its subsidiaries for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. The discussion and analysis that follows should be read
together with the section entitled Forward Looking Statements and our consolidated financial statements and the notes to
the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. 

Except
for historical information, the matters discussed in this section are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties
and are based upon judgments concerning various factors that are beyond the Company s control. Consequently, and because forward-looking
statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results
and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made
by us in this report. 

Overview 

Digipath,
Inc. was incorporated in Nevada on October 5, 2010. Digipath, Inc. and its subsidiaries Digipath, the Company, 
 we, our or us supports the cannabis industry s best practices for reliable testing,
cannabis education and training, and brings unbiased cannabis news coverage to the cannabis industry. Our mission is to provide pharmaceutical-grade
analysis and testing to the cannabis industry, under ISO-17025:2017 guidelines, to ensure consumers and patients know exactly what is
in the cannabis they ingest and to help maximize the quality of our clients products through research, development, and standardization.
Digipath has been operating a cannabis-testing lab in Nevada since 2015 and has plans to open labs in other states and countries that
have legalized the sale of cannabis, beginning with California. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
establishment and consistent application of accounting policies is a vital component of accurately and fairly presenting our financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP ), as well as ensuring
compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing financial reporting. While there are rarely alternative methods or rules from
which to select in establishing accounting and financial reporting policies, proper application often involves significant judgment regarding
a given set of facts and circumstances and a complex series of decisions. 

Basis
of Accounting 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
All references to GAAP are in accordance with The FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC and the Hierarchy of Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles. 

Segment
Reporting 

ASC
Topic 280, Segment Reporting, requires use of the management approach model for segment reporting. The management
approach model is based on the way a company s management organizes segments within the company for making operating decisions
and assessing performance. The Company operates as a single segment and will evaluate additional segment disclosure requirements as it
expands its operations. 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments 

The
Company adopted ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820). ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a three-level valuation
hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The three levels are
defined as follows: 

- 
 Level
 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 

- 
 Level
 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that
 are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. 

- 
 Level
 3 inputs to valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair measurement. 

11 

The
carrying value of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payables and accrued expenses are estimated by management to approximate fair value
primarily due to the short term nature of the instruments. 

Fixed
Assets 

Fixed
assets are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net recoverable amount. The cost of property, plant and equipment is depreciated
using the straight-line method based on the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease term based on the following
life expectancy: 

Software 
 3 years 
 
 Office equipment 
 5 years 
 
 Furniture and fixtures 
 5 years 
 
 Lab equipment 
 7 years 
 
 Leasehold improvements 
 Term of lease 

Repairs
and maintenance expenditures are charged to operations as incurred. Major improvements and replacements, which extend the useful life
of an asset, are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset. When assets are retired or sold,
the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are eliminated and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations. 

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets 

Long-lived
assets held and used by the Company are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount
of an asset may not be recoverable or is impaired. Recoverability is assessed using undiscounted cash flows based upon historical results
and current projections of earnings before interest and taxes. Impairment is measured using discounted cash flows of future operating
results based upon a rate that corresponds to the cost of capital. Impairments are recognized in operating results to the extent that
carrying value exceeds discounted cash flows of future operations. 

Our
intellectual property is comprised of indefinite-lived brand names acquired and have been assigned an indefinite life as we currently
anticipate that these brand names will contribute cash flows to the Company perpetually. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible
assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate
the asset may be impaired. 

Revenue
Recognition 

Effective
October 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Under ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue
from the commercial sales of products, licensing agreements and contracts to perform pilot studies by applying the following steps: (1)
identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price;
(4) allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when each performance obligation
is satisfied. For the comparative periods, revenue has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under ASC 605 - Revenue Recognition.
Under ASC 605, revenue was recognized when the following criteria had been met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2)
the performance of service has been rendered to a customer or delivery has occurred; (3) the amount of fee to be paid by a customer is
fixed and determinable; and (4) the collectability of the fee is reasonably assured. 

Our
revenue is primarily generated through our subsidiary, Digipath Labs, Inc., which recognizes revenue from the analytical testing of cannabis
products for licensed producers and cultivators within the state of Nevada on a determinable fixed fee per test, or panel of tests basis.
Revenue from the performance of those services is recognized upon completion of the tests, at which time test results are delivered to
the customer, provided collectability of the fee is reasonably assured. We typically require payment within thirty days of the delivery
of results. Management estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of its receivables. 

Advertising
Costs 

The
Company expenses the cost of advertising and promotions as incurred. Advertising and promotions expense was 58,739 and 28,066 for the
years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

12 

Basic
and Diluted Loss Per Share 

The
basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted
net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss adjusted on an as if converted basis, by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding plus potential dilutive securities. For the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, potential dilutive
securities had an anti-dilutive effect and were not included in the calculation of diluted net loss per common share. 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

The
Company accounts for equity instruments issued to employees in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718 Stock Compensation (ASC 718)
and Equity-Based Payments to Non-employees pursuant to ASC 2018-07 (ASC 2018-07). All transactions in which the consideration provided
in exchange for the purchase of goods or services consists of the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair
value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The measurement
date of the fair value of the equity instrument issued is the earlier of the date on which the counterparty s performance is complete
or the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached because of sufficiently
large disincentives for nonperformance. 

The
Company accounts for equity-based transactions with non-employees under the provisions of ASC Topic No. 505-50, Equity-Based Payments
to Non-Employees Topic No. 505-50 ). Topic No. 505-50 establishes that equity-based payment transactions with non-employees
shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more
reliably measurable. 

Income
Taxes 

The
Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and
liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered.
The Company provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which it does not consider realization of such assets to be more
likely than not. 

Uncertain
Tax Positions 

In
accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes ASC 740 ), the Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain
tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be capable of withstanding examination by the taxing authorities
based on the technical merits of the position. These standards prescribe a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial
statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. These standards also provide guidance
on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. 

Various
taxing authorities periodically audit the Company s income tax returns. These audits include questions regarding the Company s
tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating
the exposures connected with these various tax filing positions, including state and local taxes, the Company records allowances for
probable exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which an allowance has been established, is audited
and fully resolved. The Company has not yet undergone an examination by any taxing authorities. 

The
assessment of the Company s tax position relies on the judgment of management to estimate the exposures associated with the Company s
various filing positions.

of 154,663, or 9 . Cost of sales consists primarily of labor, depreciation and maintenance on lab equipment, and supplies consumed in
our testing operations. The decreased cost of sales in the current period was primarily due to our decrease in outsourcing to other labs.

Net
Cash Used in Operating Activities 

The
increase in funds used in operating activities for the year ended September 30, 2022, compared to the year ended September 30, 2021,
was primarily attributable to our increased net loss, offset by the change in allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses. 

Net
Cash Used in Investing Activities 

The
increase in funds used in investing activities for the year ended September 30, 2022, compared to the year ended September 30, 2021,
was due primarily to loans we made in connection with a potential acquisition that we did not close, offset by proceeds received from
the sale of equipment held as collateral securing that loan. 

Net
Cash Provided by Financing Activities 

The
decrease in funds provided by financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2022, compared to the year ended September 30, 2021,
was primarily due to increased payments we made on our outstanding convertible notes in the year ended September 30, 2022. 

Satisfaction
of our Cash Obligations for the Next 12 Months 

As
of September 30, 2022, our balance of cash on hand was 56,168. We do not currently have sufficient funds to fund our operations at their
current levels for the next twelve months. As we continue to develop our lab testing business and attempt to expand operational activities,
we expect to continue to experience net negative cash flows from operations in amounts not now determinable, and will be required to
obtain additional financing to fund operations. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional
capital and to achieve sustainable revenues and profitable operations. Since inception, we have raised funds primarily through the sale
of equity securities. We will need and are currently seeking additional funds to operate our business. No assurance can be given that
any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to us. Even if we are able to
obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders.
If we are unable to obtain additional funds, our ability to carry out and implement our planned business objectives and strategies will
be significantly delayed, limited or may not occur. We cannot guarantee that we will become profitable. Even if we achieve profitability,
given the competitive and evolving nature of the industry in which we operate, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability
and our failure to do so would adversely affect our business, including our ability to raise additional funds. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no outstanding off-balance sheet guarantees, interest rate swap transactions or foreign currency contracts. We do not engage in
trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Board of Directors and 

 Stockholders
of Digipath, Inc. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Digipath, Inc. the Company as of September 30, 2022 and
2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the
years in the two-year period ended September 30, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial
statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the
two-year period ended September 30, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As
discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has recurring losses from operations and insufficient
working capital, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans regarding
those matters also are described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matter 

The
critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter
does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Black
Scholes Calculations 

As
discussed in Note 10 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company utilizes Black Scholes calculations to determine fair value
of the Company s stock compensation. 

Auditing
management s calculations of fair value of stock options involves significant judgements and estimates to determine the proper
value. Volatility and term are the major assumptions used by management in determining the value of the stock options. 

To
evaluate the appropriateness of the fair value calculation, we evaluated management s significant judgements and estimates in what
inputs were utilized within the Black Scholes calculations.

Volatility 

The
Black-Scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short-term traded options that have no vesting
restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including
expected stock price volatility. Because the Company s common stock options have characteristics significantly different from those
of traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management s
opinion the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its common stock options. During
the years ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, there were options granted with an exercise price below the fair value
of the underlying stock at the grant date. 

The
weighted average fair value of options granted with exercise prices at the current fair value of the underlying stock during the year
ended September 30, 2022 was approximately per option.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and our Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2022 (the Evaluation Date ). The term disclosure controls
and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management,
including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance
of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible
controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2022, our Principal Executive
Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at
the reasonable assurance level. 

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management
has conducted, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and our Principal Accounting Officer, an assessment, including
testing of the effectiveness, of our internal control over financial reporting as of Evaluation Date. Management s assessment of
internal control over financial reporting was conducted using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected
on a timely basis. In connection with management s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting as required under
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we have identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial
reporting as of the Evaluation Date. 

- 
 Lack of segregation of duties in financial reporting,
 as our financial reporting and all accounting functions are performed by our Officers. 

- 
 Lack of a formal review process that includes multiple
 levels of review, as all accounting and financial reporting functions are performed by our Officers and the work is not reviewed
 by anyone. 

We
have thus concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of the Evaluation Date. 

18 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to an exemption
for smaller reporting companies under Section 989G of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
Act) or in other factors that occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

stock and other equity securities of the Company. Directors, executive officers and greater than 10 stockholders are required by SEC
regulation to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file. To our knowledge, based solely on the review of
the copies of these forms furnished to us and representations that no other reports were required, the Company believes that all forms
required to be filed under Section 16 of the Exchange Act for the year ended September 30, 2022 were filed timely.

DIGIPATH,
INC. 

DESCRIPTION
OF SECURITIES REGISTERED UNDER SECTION 12 OF THE EXCHANGE ACT 

The
following is a brief description of shares of capital stock of Digipath, Inc. (the Company, we, us, 
or our ). The brief description is based upon our Articles of Incorporation, including the Certificate of Amendment to our
Articles of Incorporation, (as amended, our Articles of Incorporation ), our Bylaws (our Bylaws ), and provisions
of applicable Nevada law. This summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full
text of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, each of which is incorporated by reference as an exhibit to our Annual Report on Form
10-K. 

General 

Our
Articles of Incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 260,000,000 shares of capital stock, consisting of 250,000,000 shares of common
stock, par value 0.001 per share common stock ), and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value 0.001 per share,
of which 6,000,000 have been designated as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock Series A Preferred ), 1,500,000 have been
designated as Series B Convertible Preferred Stock Series B Preferred ), and 1,000 have been designated as Series C Preferred
Stock Series C Preferred ), with the remaining 2,499,000 shares available for designation from time to time by our Board
of Directors (our Board as set forth below. As of September 30, 2022, we had outstanding 1,047,942 shares of Series A
Preferred, 333,600 shares of Series B Preferred and 1,000 shares of Series C Preferred. Our Articles of Incorporation authorizes our
Board to determine any number of series into which the undesignated shares of preferred stock may be divided and to determine, at any
time and from time to time, the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to any series of such preferred stock, as described
below. 

Common
Stock 

Dividend
Rights 

Subject
to preferences that may apply to shares of preferred stock outstanding at the time, the holders of outstanding shares of our Common Stock
are entitled to receive dividends out of funds legally available at the times and in the amounts that our board of directors may determine. 

Voting
Rights 

Each
holder of our Common Stock is entitled to one vote for each share of our Common Stock held on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders.
Cumulative voting for the election of directors is not provided for in our articles of incorporation, as amended, which means that the
holders of a majority of the voting shares voted can elect all of the directors then standing for election. 

No
Preemptive or Similar Rights 

Holders
of our Common Stock do not have preemptive rights, and our Common Stock is not convertible or redeemable. 

Right
to Receive Liquidation Distributions 

Upon
our dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, the assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders are distributable ratably
among the holders of our Common Stock, subject to the preferential rights and payment of liquidation preferences, if any, on any outstanding
shares of preferred stock. 

Preferred
Stock 

Series
A Preferred Stock 

Each
share of Series A Preferred is currently convertible into five shares of common stock. The conversion price is adjustable in the event
of stock splits and other adjustments in the Company s capitalization, and in the event of certain negative actions undertaken
by the Company. At the current conversion price, the 1,047,942 shares of Series A Preferred outstanding at September 30, 2022 are convertible
into 5,239,710 shares of the common stock of the Company. No holder is permitted to convert its shares of Series A Preferred if such
conversion would cause the holder to beneficially own more than 4.99 of the issued and outstanding common stock immediately after such
conversion, unless waived by such holder by providing at least sixty-five days notice. 

1 

Additional
terms of the Series A Preferred include the following: 

The
shares of Series A Preferred are entitled to dividends when, as and if declared by the Board as to the shares of the common stock of
the Company into which such Series A Preferred may then be converted, subject to the 4.99 beneficial ownership limitation described
above. 

Upon
the liquidation or dissolution of the Company, or any merger or sale of all or substantially all of the assets, the shares of Series
A Preferred are entitled to receive, prior to any distribution to the holders of common stock, 100 of the purchase price per share of
Series A Preferred plus all accrued but unpaid dividends. 

The
Series A Preferred plus all declared but unpaid dividends thereon automatically will be converted into common stock, at the then applicable
conversion rate, upon the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred. 

Each
share of Series A Preferred will carry a number of votes equal to the number of shares of common stock into which such Series A Preferred
may then be converted, subject to the 4.99 beneficial ownership limitation described above. The Series A Preferred generally will vote
together with the common stock and not as a separate class, except as provided below. 

Consent
of the holders of the outstanding Series A Preferred is required in order for the Company to: (i) amend or change the rights, preferences,
privileges or powers of, or the restrictions provided for the benefit of, the Series A Preferred; (ii) authorize, create or issue shares
of any class of stock having rights, preferences, privileges or powers superior to the Series A Preferred; (iii) reclassify any outstanding
shares into shares having rights, preferences, privileges or powers superior to the Series A Preferred; or (iv) amend the Company s
Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws in a manner that adversely affects the rights of the Series A Preferred. 

Series
B Preferred 

Each
share of Series B Preferred has a Stated Value of 1.00 and is currently convertible into common stock at a conversion price equal to
 0.04. The conversion price of the Series B Preferred is subject to equitable adjustment in the event of a stock split, stock dividend
or similar event with respect to the common stock, and in the event of the issuance of common stock by the Company below the conversion
price, subject to customary exceptions. At the current conversion price, the 333,600 shares of Series B Preferred outstanding at September
30, 2022 are convertible into 8,340,000 shares of the common stock of the Company. No holder is permitted to convert its shares of Series
B Preferred if such conversion would cause the holder to beneficially own more than 4.99 of the issued and outstanding common stock
of the Company immediately after such conversion, unless waived by such holder by providing at least sixty-five days notice. 

Additional
terms of the Series B Preferred include the following: 

The
shares of Series B Preferred are not entitled to dividends, provided that if dividends are paid on the shares of common stock of the
Company, the Series B Preferred will be entitled to dividends based on the number shares of common stock which the Series B Preferred
may then be converted. 

Upon
the liquidation or dissolution of the Company, or any merger or sale of all or substantially all of the assets, or upon a change in control
whereby a stockholder gains control of 50 or more of the outstanding shares of common stock, the shares of Series B Preferred are entitled
to receive, prior to any distribution to the holders of common stock, 100 of the purchase price per share of Series B Preferred plus
all accrued but unpaid dividends. 

Each
share of Series B Preferred carries a number of votes equal to the number of shares of common stock into which such Series B Preferred
may then be converted. 

Series
C Preferred 

The
principal feature of the Series C Preferred is that it provides the holder thereof, so long as he or she is an executive officer of the
Company, with the ability to vote with the holders of the Company s common stock on all matters presented to the holders of common
stock, whether at a special or annual meeting, by written action in lieu of a meeting or otherwise, on the basis of 200,000 votes for
each share of Series C Preferred. The shares of Series C Preferred are not convertible into common stock, are not entitled to dividends,
are not subject to redemption, and have a stated value of 0.10 per share payable on any liquidation of the Company in preference to
any payment payable to the holders of common stock. Todd Denkin, the Company s President, is the holder of all 1,000 shares of
the Series C Preferred. 

2 

Blank
Check Preferred Stock 

The
remaining 2,499,000 shares of our undesignated shares of preferred stock may be issued in series, and shall have such voting powers,
full or limited, or no voting powers, and such designations, preferences and relative participating, optional or other special rights,
and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, as shall be stated and expressed in the resolution or resolutions providing
for the issuance of such stock adopted from time to time by the Board. The Board is expressly vested with the authority to determine
and fix in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issuances of preferred stock the voting powers, designations, preferences
and rights, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, of each such series to the full extent now or hereafter permitted
by the laws of the State of Nevada. 

Anti-takeover
Provisions 

Certain
provisions of our articles of incorporation, as amended, and Nevada law may have the effect of delaying, deferring or discouraging another
person from acquiring control of our company. 

Nevada
Law 

In
addition, Nevada has enacted the following legislation that may deter or frustrate takeovers of Nevada corporations: 

Authorized
but Unissued Stock The authorized but unissued shares of our Common Stock are available for future issuance without stockholder
approval. These additional shares may be used for a variety of corporate purposes, including future public offerings to raise additional
capital, corporate acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of common stock may enable
our board of directors to issue shares of stock to persons friendly to existing management. 

Evaluation
of Acquisition Proposals The Nevada Revised Statutes expressly permit our board of directors, when evaluating any proposed
tender or exchange offer, any merger, consolidation or sale of substantially all of our assets, or any similar extraordinary transaction,
to consider all relevant factors including, without limitation, the social, legal, and economic effects on our employees, customers,
suppliers, and other relevant interest holders, and on the communities and geographical areas in which they operate. Our board of directors
may also consider the amount of consideration being offered in relation to the then current market price of our outstanding shares of
capital stock and our then current value in a freely negotiated transaction. 

Control
Share Acquisitions Nevada has adopted a control share acquisitions statute designed to afford stockholders of public corporations
in Nevada protection against acquisitions in which a person, entity or group seeks to gain voting control. With enumerated exceptions,
the statute provides that shares acquired within certain specific ranges will not possess voting rights in the election of directors
unless the voting rights are approved by a majority vote of the public corporation s disinterested stockholders. Disinterested
shares are shares other than those owned by the acquiring person or by a member of a group with respect to a control share acquisition,
or by any officer of the corporation or any employee of the corporation who is also a director. The specific acquisition ranges that
trigger the statute are: acquisitions of shares possessing one-fifth or more but less than one-third of all voting power; acquisitions
of shares possessing one-third or more but less than a majority of all voting power; or acquisitions of shares possessing a majority
or more of all voting power. Under certain circumstances, the statute permits the acquiring person to call a special stockholders 
meeting for the purpose of considering the grant of voting rights to the holder of the control shares. The statute also enables a corporation
to provide for the redemption of control shares with no voting rights under certain circumstances.
