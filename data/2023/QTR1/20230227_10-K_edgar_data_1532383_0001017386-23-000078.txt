 ITEM
1: DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

 Vanjia
Corporation was incorporated in Texas on August 19, 2011. Our aim to build affordable housing in the city of Houston's designated HOPE
and Workforce neighborhoods. Our future homes will have a variety of floor plans, be energy efficient, and conveniently located. We have
already acquired a vacant lot in the Workforce neighborhoods. By providing affordable housing options, our future homes will enrich the
communities of Houston and revitalize the local economy. 

 PRODUCTS
and SERVICES 

 Our product
is to build affordable homes in Houston s designated Houston Hope and Work Force Neighborhoods. The Houston Hope and Work force
neighborhoods were created by the Houston Housing and Community Development Department (HHCD). The Houston HOPE Program strives to build
strong and stable communities. Houston HOPE provides financial assistance to potential home buyers who are in designated Houston HOPE
areas. We believe our future homes would be available for down payment assistance to our potential clients who meet the specific criteria
outlined by the HHCD. 

 1 

In
order to qualify for the program, applicants must demonstrate the ability to obtain a mortgage loan, demonstrate credit worthiness. The
family's combined income must be at or below 80 of the area's median income. Approved applicants must also complete eight hours of home
buyer education from a HUD-approved Housing Counseling Agency. The applicant must buy a new or existing home from a list of approved structures,
invest at least 500 into the home-buying transaction, and live in the home for 10 years to satisfy the program eligibility criteria.
Mortgage financing options through various selected lenders make it easier for new home buyers to get the assistance they need. Families
are eligible for up to 30,000 in down payment assistance if they are not currently a property owner. 

 We
will conduct affordable housing seminars to educate and draw publicity to our future homes build in those designated neighborhoods. We
intend to draw the attention of first-time buyers to buy homes in the Hope of Workforce neighborhoods. The regular seminars will focus
on home buyer education and related topics. Home Buyer Education classes will strive to provide first time and repeat home buyers the
information they need to make decisions when buying a home. 

 CITY
OF HOUSTON'S DOWNPAYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS 

 The
Housing and Community Development Department (HCDD) Down Payment Assistance Programs is currently accepting applications for the Houston
Homebuyer Assistance, Houston HOPE and Workforce Housing. In order to be considered for funding, all potential clients are required to
contact and obtain mortgage financing through one of the mortgage companies listed on our Approved Lending Partners List. Under each mortgage
company, only the listed loan officer(s) are allowed to originate loan(s) and submit grant request(s) on behalf of the client(s). The
application process is open to the public and assistance will be granted on a first come, first serve basis.

HOUSTON
HOPE PROGRAM 

 City
of Houston (City) Housing and Community Development Department (HCDD) has designed the Houston HOPE to provide financial assistance to
low-to-moderate income homebuyers who are in the Houston HOPE areas or any area/neighborhood designated by the Mayor of Houston for revitalization. HCDD
staff will administer Houston HOPE according to the policy and procedures set forth in the administrative guidelines. Funding for Houston
HOPE will be available through the HOME Investment Partnerships (HOME) Program and the American Dream Down Payment Initiative (ADDI) Houston
HOPE will provide direct financial assistance to offset portions of the down payment, closing costs, pre-paid items and principal required
for home purchase. 

 MARKETING
AND PROMOTION 

 One
marketing strategy will be on the grassroots level through farming in the targeted neighborhoods. The term farming 
implies growing something. That's what you do when you farm your local neighborhoods. You plant the seeds of future business with potential
purchasers of our home homes in these targeted neighborhoods. The term targeted neighborhoods will be used to describe neighborhoods
in which the average income of the residences matches the eligibility requirements for the Houston HOPE program. Approximately, 300-500
fliers will be printed, outlining the special features of these designated neighborhoods. We believe that the fliers will not only convey
the quality of our homes, but also briefly outline the financial options available to eligible participants. We believe that the fliers
will draw the attention of possible buyers, if ten percent of these filers will be posted in community hubs such as local coffee shops,
school yards and church lobbies. 

 Our
staff will distribute the remaining fliers on foot, spending several afternoons knocking on the doors of residences in targeted neighborhoods,
as well as residences already in designated HOPE and Workforce areas. Speaking with potential buyers directly is the best way to inform
and engage the communities. When speaking to residents, we will explain the Houston HOPE and Workforce programs, specifically mentioning
how these programs can benefit them as future owners of Vanjia Corporation. We will then outline in further detail the government assistance
option available to them. The government can offer up to 30,000 for down payments and unlike renting, home ownership allows one to build
up home equity. We understand that many of these low-income families are aging and facing mounting financial pressures. By highlighting
statistics like this, not only can we inform, but also inform potential buyers about the home-ownership opportunities available to them. 

 We
also plan to leverage the influence of community leaders in the area. Churches present an excellent venue for reaching potential buyers
as pastors have a large network and have concern for the well-being of their constituents. In low-income communities, life often centers
around the church. Pastors are usually aware of those members of their congregation who need of government-subsidized housing. By educating
the Pastor about the opportunities presented by Vanjia Corporation, we can easily reach and influence many potential buyers. 

 3 

Another
strategy will be to identify veterans who have already received down payment assistance from the Veteran Administration. VA home loans
are available to veterans who meet specific eligibility requirements. Qualified veterans will have served at least 90 days of active duties
and have not been dishonorably discharged. If a veteran has served less than 90 days, but was discharged for a service-related disability
they may still qualify. Those surviving spouses who have not remarried and spouses of POW or MIA service personnel are qualified. In addition
to regular VA loans, there are VA loans available for qualifying disabled veterans are eligible for additional assistance f qualified
veterans. Veterans who are currently receiving VA home loans make excellent candidates for Vanjia Corporation as they receive up to 30,000
down payment on top of their current veteran eligibility benefits. Once aware of the financial opportunities available to them, veterans
will realize that home ownership in Houston Hope and Workforce neighborhoods is in their best interest. 

 Another
strategy will be on the working relationship between home builders and real estate agents. There is a strong incentive for real estate
agents to refer qualified buyers to our homes. Real estate agents will typically receive up to 3 commission once the transaction is completed.
By working together, we can expand our exposure and client base, while giving real estate agents a chance to increase their sales. 

 Our
final strategy for marketing and promoting our homes will be through regular visits to the Section 8 offices in Houston. The purpose of
the visits will be to educate Section 8 tenants about their housing options. Currently, Section 8 rental vouchers are for low to moderate-income
families, persons with disabilities, and senior citizens. Under the Section 8 program, the tenant usually pays around 30 of their rent
and the U.S. government subsidizes the rest in the form of a voucher. In some cases, however, tenants may be eligible for the government
to pay their entire monthly rent. Many Section 8 residents are unaware that they are able to convert their Sect. 8 rental vouchers into
a Sect. 8 home-ownership voucher. For more details about eligibility requirements and the conversion process, current Section 8 residents
can schedule a meeting with their local Section 8 housing counselors. 

 HOME DESIGN
AND DESIGN CENTERS 

 We
are dedicated to provide quality, well-designed homes meeting the demands of today s home buyers. The product line offered depends
upon many factors, including the supply of existing housing and the demand for new housing in the general area. In order to ensure that
we meet the demand in the marketplace, we will conduct qualitative and quantitative market research, including consumer focus groups after
the effectiveness of this registration statement. This research will enable us to improve the linkage between the design of our homes
and the community development and meet the specific lifestyle demands of our targeted home buyer. Our sources of raw building materials
will mainly from local building material suppliers such as Home Depots, Lowe's. Home Depots and Lowe's are both publicly traded companies.
Home Depots and Lowe's do not set a minimum purchase requirement for building materials and home appliances for homebuilders. We do not
have any material contracts or exclusive agreements with Home Depots nor Lowe's. 

 Our product
is designed to appeal to the potential home buyers. We will use external consultants that we believe are experts in their field to help
perfect our homes, often utilizing experts with knowledge in regional architecture, exterior finishes and selections, or floor plan solutions
that give our product an added edge. We take a focus and design products not only specific to the city in which they will be built, but
to the individual neighborhood. Our aim is to provide each home with features that make it appeal to a specific lifestyle segment, while
giving the plan flexibility through options and/or elevation variety that will appeal to our home buyers. This will allow our home buyers
to feel as if we designed the house just for them.

COMPETITION 

 The
home building industry is competitive. We compete with numerous home builders of varying sizes, ranging from local to national in scope,
some of which have better financial resources than we have. We anticipate building homes in several community redevelopment neighborhoods
with federal, state and cities incentives to lessen the competition from other builders. Most custom builders do not want to build in
targeted neighborhoods that have ceilings on selling prices such as the Houston HOPE neighborhoods. We anticipate to build new single-family
homes that sell for 98,000 or more and duplexes that sell for 165,000 in these community redevelopment neighborhoods. We also face competition
from existing resale homes and, to a lesser extent, condominium and rental housing. Competitions among local homebuilders are based on
interrelated factors, including location, reputation, amenities, design, quality and price. Builders of new homes compete not only for
homebuyers, but also for quality of construction and workmanship, locations, financing, raw material and skilled subcontractors. 

 REGULATION
AND ENVIRONMENT MATTERS 

 We
are subject to various local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, building design, construction
and similar matters, including local regulations which impose restrictive zoning and density requirements. City of Houston does not have
zoning laws but it enforces deed restrictions in certain neighborhoods. We anticipate to complying with applicable building codes and
zoning laws in our remodeling and building activities. As of December 31, 2014, compliance with such ordinances and related matters has
not materially affected our operations, although it may do so in the future.

We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities, private placement offerings,
employee stock options plans, and advanced funds from our officer and director. Any deficiencies in general and administrative expenses
will be covered from funds by our director and officer. Our officer and director, Tian Su Hua, has agreed to provide 5,000,000 line-of-credit
at 0 interest per annum. The management believes that 5,000,000 line-of-credit agreement from our officer and director will be sufficient
to cover our operational expense for the next twelve months. The residential lot we currently own is large enough to accommodate up to
two duplexes. We believe that our future expenditures will be covered by revenues generate from sell of new homes, leasing activities,
and additional offerings for equity or debt securities, private placement offerings, employee options plans and funds from our officer
and director. In addition, we regularly conduct real estate training and consulting services for start-up companies for IPO, these services
will generate revenues and regular cash-flows for the year 2023.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards
of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform,
an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

The Company faces all the risks common to most start-up companies, including capitalization and uncertainty of funding sources, high initial
expenditure levels, uncertain revenue streams, and difficulties in managing growth. The Company's financial statements do not reflect
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The Company believes its current plans, Line of Credit will enable
it to continue as a going concern.

future year's taxable income. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these financial
statements, as their realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for

 ITEM 9A.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

 A review and evaluation were performed by the Company's management,
including the Company's Chief Executive Officer (the CEO and Chief Financial Officer (the CFO ), of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.
Based on that review and evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that as of December 31, 2022 disclosure controls and procedures, were
effective at ensuring that the material information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported as required in the application of SEC rules and forms. 

 Management s
Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

 Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a set of processes designed by,
or under the supervision of, a company s principal executive and principal financial officers, to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes
those policies and procedures that: 

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets; 

Provide reasonable assurance our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and 

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statement. 
 
 Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. It should be noted that
any system of internal control, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the
objectives of the system will be met. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate. 
 9 

Our
CEO and CFO have evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as described in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) as of the end of the period covered by this report based upon criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). As
a result of this evaluation, we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December
31, 2022. 

 This
Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over
financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant
to the rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management s report in this annual report. 

 Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

 There
have been no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting.
