 The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: 

inflation and changes in the interest rate environment that reduce our margins and yields, or reduce the fair value of financial instruments or reduce the origination levels in our lending business, or increase the level of defaults, losses and prepayments on loans we have made and make whether held in portfolio or sold in the secondary markets; 
 
 general economic conditions, either nationally or in our market areas, that are worse than expected; 
 
 our ability to access cost-effective funding; 
 our ability to meet applicable capital and liquidity requirements; 
 our ability to manage market risk, credit risk and operational risk in the current economic conditions; 
 
 changes in consumer demand, borrowing and savings habits; 
 
 demand for loans and deposits in our market area; 
 
 changes in the level and direction of loan delinquencies and write-offs and changes in estimates of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses; 
 
 fluctuations in real estate values and both residential and commercial real estate market conditions; 
 
 significant increases in our loan losses; 
 
 our ability to implement changes in our business strategies; 
 
 competition among depository and other financial institutions;

 technological changes; 
 
 cyber-attacks, computer viruses and other technological risks that may breach the security of our websites or other systems to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information and destroy data or disable our systems; 

4 

technological changes that may be more difficult or expensive than expected; 
 
 the ability of third-party providers to perform their obligations to us; 
 
 the ability of the U.S. Government to manage federal debt limits; 
 
 changes in the financial condition, results of operations or future prospects of issuers of securities that we own; 
 
 our ability to successfully integrate any assets, liabilities, clients, systems and management personnel we have acquired or may acquire into our operations and our ability to realize related revenue synergies and cost savings within expected time frames and any goodwill charges related thereto; 
 
 other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory and operational factors affecting our operations, pricing products and services described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and 
 
 the disruption to local, regional, national and global economic activity caused by infectious disease outbreaks such as COVID-19, and the significant impact that such pandemics may have on our growth, operations, earnings and asset quality.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 
 Blue Foundry Bancorp 
 
 Blue Foundry Bancorp (the Company is a Delaware corporation which became the holding company for Blue Foundry Bank (the Bank on July 15, 2021, following the completion of the mutual-to-stock conversion of Blue Foundry, MHC. In connection with the conversion, the Company sold 27,772,500 shares of common stock, par value 0.01 per share, at a price of 10 per share, for gross proceeds of 277.7 million. The Company also contributed 750,000 shares of common stock and 1.5 million in cash to Blue Foundry Charitable Foundation, Inc. Shares of the Company s common stock began trading on July 16, 2021 on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the trading symbol BLFY. 
 
 The Company owns all of the outstanding common stock of the Bank, and as such, is a bank holding company subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve Board. 
 
 Blue Foundry Bank 
 
 The Bank is a New Jersey-chartered stock savings bank that was organized in 1939 as Boiling Springs Savings Loan Association by the combination of the Rutherford Mutual Loan and Building Association and the East Rutherford Savings, Loan and Building Association. In 1992, Boiling Springs Savings Loan Association converted to a New Jersey-chartered mutual savings bank and became known as Boiling Springs Savings Bank. Boiling Springs Savings Bank s name was changed to Blue Foundry Bank in 2019. At December 31, 2022, the Bank had assets of 2.04 billion, net loans of 1.53 billion and deposits of 1.39 billion. 
 
 Blue Foundry Bank s principal business consists of originating one-to-four family residential, multi-family, and non-residential real estate mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, construction, and commercial and industrial loans in our principal market and surrounding areas. In addition, we often lend outside of our branch network in more densely populated and metropolitan areas, adding diversification to our loan portfolio. We attract retail deposits from the general public in the areas surrounding our banking offices, through our borrowers, and through our online presence, offering a wide variety of deposit products. We also invest in securities. Our revenues are derived primarily from interest on loans and, to a lesser extent, interest on mortgage-backed and other investment securities. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans, securities, and borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York FHLB ). 
 
 Blue Foundry Bank is subject to comprehensive regulation and examination by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance NJDOBI and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC ). Our website address is www.bluefoundrybank.com . Information on this website is not and should not be considered a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Market Area 
 
 Our market area is primarily northern New Jersey. As of December 31, 2022, the Bank operates 18 full service banking offices in New Jersey. The administrative offices of the Company and Bank are located at 7 Sylvan Way, Suite 200, Parsippany, New Jersey 07054. Our telephone number is (201) 939-5000. 
 
 The economy in our primary market area benefits from being varied and diverse, with a broad economic base. New Jersey, counted among the wealthiest states in the nation with an estimated population of 9.26 million, is considered one of the most attractive banking markets in the United States. Within our primary market areas, the Bank had less than 1 of bank deposit market share as of June 30, 2022, the latest date for which statistics are available. 
 
 We believe that we have developed products and services that meet the financial needs of our current and future customer base; however, we plan, and believe it is necessary to continuously evaluate our products and 
 
 6 

service offerings in light of evolving expectations and make the appropriate enhancements to ensure we remain competitive in our market area. Our marketing strategies focus on the strength of our knowledge of local consumer and small business markets, as well as expanding relationships with current customers and reaching out to develop new, profitable business relationships. 
 
 Competition 
 
 We face significant competition for deposits and loans. Our most direct competition for deposits has come historically from the numerous financial institutions operating in our market area (including other community banks and credit unions), many of which are significantly larger than we are and have greater resources. We also face competition for depositor funds from other sources such as financial technology companies, online banks, brokerage firms, money market funds and mutual funds, as well as from securities offered by the Federal Government, such as Treasury bills. Additionally, money center banks, such as Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citi, and large regional banks, such as TD Bank, M T Bank and PNC Bank, have a significant presence in our market area. 
 
 Our competition for loans comes primarily from the competitors referenced above and from other financial service providers, such as mortgage companies and mortgage brokers. Competition for loans also comes from the increasing number of non-depository financial service companies participating in the mortgage market, such as insurance companies, securities firms, financial technology companies, specialty finance firms and technology companies. 
 
 We expect competition to remain intense in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend toward consolidation of the financial services industry. Technological advances, for example, have lowered barriers to entry, allowed banks to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the internet and made it possible for non-depository institutions, including financial technology companies, to offer products and services that traditionally have been provided by banks. 
 
 During 2022, the Federal Reserve took unprecedented action to contain inflation. The Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate seven times ranging from 25 basis points to 75 basis points totaling 425 basis points or 4.25 percent. This showed its resolve to return inflation to its 2 percent target. 
 
 Further expected interest rate increases, persistently high inflation and geopolitical tensions have increased uncertainty and elevated the risk of recession in the US economy. 
 
 Historically, our lending activities have emphasized one-to-four family residential real estate loans and multifamily housing loans, and such loans continue to comprise the largest portion of our loan portfolio. Other areas of lending include non-residential mortgage loans and, to a lesser extent, construction loans, commercial and industrial loans, and junior liens and consumer loans, the latter of which consist primarily of home equity loans and lines of credit. Commercial and industrial C I loans include C I revolvers, term loans, and SBA 7a loans. Subject to market conditions and our asset-liability analysis, we expect to continue to focus on commercial real estate, multi-family and traditional C I lending as part of our effort to diversify the loan portfolio and increase the overall yield earned on our loans. We compete for loans by offering high quality personalized service, providing convenience and flexibility, timely responses on loan applications, and by offering competitive pricing.

The amounts shown below include unearned loan origination fees and costs, and unamortized premium and discounts, net. 
 
 Fixed Rates Floating or Adjustable Rates Total (In thousands) Residential one-to-four family 383,566 212,894 596,460 Multifamily 123,526 546,519 670,045 Non-residential 101,062 114,837 215,899 Construction and land 12,186 2,062 14,248 Junior liens 5,648 12,962 18,610 Commercial and Industrial 4,533 4,533 Consumer and other 27 27 Total 630,548 889,274 1,519,822 
 
 Residential Real Estate Loans. Our one-to-four family residential loan portfolio consists of mortgage loans that enable borrowers to purchase or refinance existing homes, most of which serve as the primary residence of the borrower. At December 31, 2022, one-to-four family residential real estate loans totaled 594.5 million, or 38.6 of our total loan portfolio, and consisted of 382.9 million of fixed-rate loans and 211.6 million of adjustable-rate loans. 
 
 We offer fixed-rate and adjustable-rate residential real estate loans with maturities up to 30 years. The one-to-four family residential mortgage loans we are currently originating are generally underwritten according to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guidelines, and we refer to loans that conform to such guidelines as conforming loans. We generally originate both fixed and adjustable-rate mortgage loans in amounts up to the maximum conforming loan limits. We currently originate loans above the conforming limits up to a maximum amount of 3.0 million, which are referred to as jumbo loans. We generally underwrite jumbo loans, whether originated or purchased, in a manner similar to conforming loans. At December 31, 2022, our largest one-to-four family residential loan totaled 4.0 million, is secured by a series of one-to-four family apartment units and was performing in accordance with its original terms. 
 
 Our adjustable-rate residential real estate loans have interest rates that are fixed for an initial period ranging from three to ten years. After the initial fixed period, the interest rate on adjustable-rate residential real estate loans is generally reset periodically based on a contractual spread or margin above the average yield on U.S. Treasury securities. Our adjustable-rate residential real estate loans have initial and periodic caps of up to 2.0 on interest rate changes, with a current cap on total increases of 6.0 over the life of the loan. 
 
 We originate one-to-four family residential mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios of generally up to 80 to 90 of the appraised value, depending on the size of the loan. We may originate loans with loan-to-value ratios that exceed 90 depending upon the product type. Mortgage insurance is required for all mortgage loans that have a loan-to-value ratio greater than 80 . The required insurance coverage amount varies based on the loan-to-value ratio and term of the loan. We only permit borrowers to purchase mortgage insurance from companies that have been approved by Blue Foundry Bank. 
 
 We generally do not offer interest only mortgage loans on one-to-four family residential properties or loans that provide for negative amortization of principal, such as Option ARM loans, where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on the loan, resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan. Additionally, we do not offer subprime loans (loans that are made with low down-payments to borrowers with weakened credit histories typically characterized by payment delinquencies, previous charge-offs, judgments, bankruptcies, or borrowers with questionable repayment capacity as evidenced by low credit scores or high debt-burden ratios) or Alt-A loans (defined as loans having less than full documentation). 
 
 9 

Multi-Family Real Estate Loans . At December 31, 2022, we had 690.3 million in multi-family real estate loans, representing 44.8 of our total loan portfolio. Our multi-family real estate loans are secured primarily by apartment buildings having five or more units, most of which are located in our primary market area. 
 
 We generally originate multi-family real estate loans with maximum terms of 10 years based on amortization periods between 25 and 30 years. We generally limit loan-to-value ratios to less than 80 of the appraised value of the property for multi-family real estate loans. Our multi-family real estate loans are offered with fixed and adjustable rate interest terms. All multi-family real estate loans are subject to our underwriting procedures and guidelines. At December 31, 2022, our largest multi-family real estate loan totaled 23.3 million and was performing in accordance with its original terms. 
 
 We consider a number of factors in originating multi-family and non-residential real estate loans. We evaluate the qualifications and financial condition of the borrower (including credit history), profitability and expertise, as well as the value and condition of the mortgaged property securing the loan. When evaluating the qualifications of the borrower, we consider the financial resources of the borrower, the borrower s experience in owning or managing similar property and the borrower s payment history with us and other financial institutions. In evaluating the property securing the loan, we consider a number of factors, including the net operating income of the mortgaged property before debt service and depreciation, the debt service coverage ratio (the ratio of net operating income to debt service) to ensure that it is at least 1.25x, subject to certain exceptions, and the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value of the mortgaged property. All loans are appraised by outside independent and qualified appraisers that are duly approved in accordance with Blue Foundry Bank policy. Loans are monitored on an ongoing basis, based on policy requirements, often requiring updated financials statements. 
 
 Non-Residential Real Estate Loans . At December 31, 2022, we had 216.4 million in non-residential real estate loans, representing 14.0 of our total loan portfolio. Our non-residential real estate loans are secured primarily by industrial facilities, retail facilities and other commercial properties, most of which are located in our primary market area. 
 
 Non-residential real estate loans are underwritten to asset specific guidelines in accordance to policy with the loan-to-value ratio limit generally being 75 of the appraised value of the property. At December 31, 2022, our largest non-residential real estate loan totaled 24.7 million and was secured by a grocery-anchored shopping center. At December 31, 2022, this loan was performing in accordance with its original terms. 
 
 Construction Loans. We make construction loans, primarily to contractors and builders of single-family homes and other commercial and industrial real estate projects as well as to individuals for the construction of their primary residences. At December 31, 2022, our construction loans totaled 18.0 million, representing 1.2 of our total loan portfolio. At December 31, 2022, our largest construction loan totaled 9.8 million and was secured by a first mortgage lien for the construction of a mixed-used building. At December 31, 2022, this loan was performing in accordance with its original terms. 
 
 Construction loan-to-value ratios for one-to-four family residential properties generally will not exceed 80 of the appraised value of the property on a completed basis. Once the construction project is satisfactorily completed, we look to provide permanent financing. 
 
 Junior Liens and Consumer Loans . We offer consumer loans to customers residing in New Jersey. Our consumer loans and junior liens consist primarily of home equity loans and lines of credit. At December 31, 2022, consumer loans totaled 18.5 million, or 1.2 of our total loan portfolio. 
 
 Home equity loans and lines of credit are multi-purpose loans used to finance various home or personal needs, where a one-to-four family primary or secondary residence serves as collateral. We generally originate home equity loans and lines of credit of up to 500,000 with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 80 (75 if the loan is for a condo) and terms of up to 20 years. Home equity lines of credit have adjustable rates of interest that are based on the prime rate, as published in The Wall Street Journal. Home equity lines of credit are secured by residential real estate in a first or second lien position. 
 
 10 

The procedures for underwriting consumer loans include assessing the applicant s payment history on other indebtedness, the applicant s ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan, and the loan-to-value ratio of the collateral property. Although the applicant s creditworthiness is a primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral, if any, to the proposed loan amount. 
 
 Commercial and Industrial Loans. We typically originate commercial business loans on the basis of the borrower s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower s business, the experience and stability of the borrower s management team, earnings projections, and the value and marketability of any collateral securing the loan. Business loans and lines of credit inherently have more risk of loss than real estate secured loans, in part because business loans may be more complex to underwrite than mortgages, and some of the loans or portions thereof may be unsecured. These loans are more likely to be reliant on the cashflow and solvency of the business. The value of collateral may not be adequate to cover the value of the loan and may be severely impacted by the performance of the business. If a decline in economic conditions or other issues cause difficulties for our business borrowers or we fail to evaluate the credit of the loan accurately when we underwrite the loan, it could result in delinquencies or defaults and a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Commercial and industrial loans are generally secured by a variety of collateral, primarily accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial and industrial loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself and the general economic environment in our market area. Therefore, commercial and industrial loans that we originate have greater credit risk than one-to-four family residential real estate loans or, generally, consumer loans. In addition, commercial and industrial loans generally require substantially greater evaluation and oversight efforts. 
 
 The Bank is a certified Small Business Administration SBA lender and is a participant in SBA lending programs which provide guarantees of up to 75 of the principal on the underlying loans. We provide loans under the 7(a) Loan Program, the SBA s most common loan program. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, we had 4.7 million of commercial and industrial loans. Commercial and industrial loans represent 0.3 of our total loan portfolio. We offer term loans, lines of credit and revolving lines of credit with varying maturity terms to small businesses in our market area to finance short-term working capital needs such as accounts receivable and inventory. Our commercial lines of credit are typically structured with variable rates. We generally obtain personal guarantees with respect to all commercial and industrial loans. At December 31, 2022, the average loan size of our commercial and industrial loans was 291 thousand, and our largest outstanding commercial and industrial loan balance was a 2.0 million SBA loan to an ecommerce company. This loan was performing in accordance with its repayment terms at December 31, 2022. 
 
 During 2020 and early 2021, the Company participated in the PPP. The PPP authorized financial institutions to make federally-guaranteed loans to qualifying small businesses and non-profit organizations. These loans carry an interest rate of 1 per annum and a maturity of five years if originated on or after June 5, 2020. The PPP provided that such loans may be forgiven if the borrowers meet certain requirements with respect to maintaining employee headcount and payroll and the use of the loan proceeds after the loan is originated. If not forgiven, these loans may be guaranteed by the SBA. All PPP loans are categorized as Commercial and Industrial Loans within the Company s financial statements. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, PPP loans totaled 477 thousand and 16.8 million, respectively, net of unearned deferred fees. 

Originations, Purchases and Participations of Loans 
 
 Lending activities are conducted by our loan personnel operating at our offices. We also obtain referrals from existing and former customers and from accountants, real estate brokers, builders and attorneys. All loans that we originate or purchase are underwritten pursuant to our policies and procedures, which, for residential loans, generally incorporate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac underwriting guidelines to the extent applicable. We originate both adjustable-rate and fixed-rate loans. Our ability to originate fixed or adjustable-rate loans depends upon the relative customer demand for such loans, which is affected by current market interest rates as well as anticipated future market interest rates. Our loan origination and purchase activity may be adversely affected by a rising interest rate environment, which typically results in decreased loan demand. 
 
 11 

During 2021, the Bank began a residential loan purchase program to utilize excess liquidity and to supplement originations. All loans purchased were within New Jersey and were underwritten to FNMA standards, a comparable underwriting standard as internally originated loans. 
 
 During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, loan originations totaled 488.2 million and 321.7 million, respectively, all of which were retained by us. Loan purchases totaled 104.0 million and 91.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 We purchase whole loans and participate in loans originated by other institutions. Generally, our analysis for purchase and participation transactions follows underwriting policies as if we originated the loan directly. However, for loans that we participate in, we are subject to the lead financial institution s policies and practices related to items such as, monitoring, collection and default. 
 
 At December 31, 2022 the outstanding balances of our loan participations where we are not the lead lender totaled 111.9 million, or 7.3 of our loan portfolio, all of which were commercial real estate loans. All such loans were performing in accordance with their original repayment terms at December 31, 2022. 
 
 Credit Policy and Procedures 
 
 Loan Approval Procedures and Authority . Our lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory, underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by management and approved by our Board of Directors. The Board of Directors has granted loan approval authority to certain officers up to prescribed limits, depending on the officer s title, experience, and the type of loan. 
 
 Loan approval authorities are dictated by factors such as the loan type, loan size, cumulative credit exposure (to a particular relationship) and the presence of any policy exceptions. All loans are independently underwritten. Commercial loans are further reviewed and acknowledged by the Chief Credit Officer or designee. Loans are then presented for approval to the appropriate authority. Under our current policy, no loan may be approved by a single officer. At a minimum, two officers are required to approve a loan typically consisting of the loan product manager and a member of the management Loan Committee. Depending upon certain factors, such as the size of the loan request, escalating loan approval authorities may be required. In such cases, approval by the Loan Committee or Loan Oversight Committee may be required. For commercial loans, a minimum of three approvals are required (two of which must include the Chief Lending Officer and Chief Credit Officer), with a third approval from any voting member of the Loan Committee. 
 
 Loans to One Borrower. Pursuant to New Jersey law, the aggregate amount of loans that the Bank is permitted to make to any one borrower or a group of related borrowers is generally limited to 15 of the Bank s capital, surplus fund and undivided profits (25 if the amount in excess of 15 is secured by readily marketable collateral ). At December 31, 2022 based on the 15 limitation, the Bank s loans-to-one-borrower limit was approximately 47.0 million, our internal policy limit was 42.3 million, representing 90 of the 15 limit. On the same date, the Bank had no borrowers with outstanding balances in excess of this amount. At December 31, 2022, our largest loan relationship with a single borrower was for 35.0 million, which consisted of two loans secured by non-residential real estate and six loans secured by multifamily real estate, each of which was performing in accordance with its terms. 
 
 Delinquencies and Asset Quality 
 
 Delinquency Procedures. When a borrower fails to make a required monthly loan payment by the last day of the month, and upon expiration of any applicable grace period, a late notice is generated stating the payment and late charges due. Until such time as payment is made collection efforts continue with additional phone calls and escalating collection notices. Loan delinquencies more than 30 days past due are reported to the Board of Directors monthly. 

12 

If repayment is doubtful or not possible, a notice of intent to foreclose will be issued for residential loans, or an acceleration notice will be issued for commercial loans, and the account will be administered by our Asset Recovery Department with oversight and guidance from our counsel. Once issued for residential loans, the notice of intent to foreclose typically allows the borrower a period to cure the default. Once issued for commercial loans, a grace period may be granted in accordance with the loan s terms. If payment is made and the loan is brought current, foreclosure proceedings are discontinued, and the borrower is permitted to continue to make payments. If the borrower does not respond, we will initiate foreclosure proceedings. 
 
 Loans Past Due and Non-Performing Assets. Loans are reviewed on a regular basis. Management determines that a loan is impaired or non-performing when it is probable at least a portion of the loan will not be collected in accordance with the original terms due to a deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower or the value of the underlying collateral if the loan is collateral-dependent. When a loan is determined to be impaired, the measurement of the loan in the allowance for loan losses is based on present value of expected future cash flows, except that all collateral-dependent loans are measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral less selling costs. Non-accrual loans are loans for which collectability is questionable and, therefore, interest on such loans will no longer be recognized on an accrual basis. All loans that become 90 days or more delinquent are placed on non-accrual status unless the loan is guaranteed or well secured and in the process of collection. When loans are placed on non-accrual status, unpaid accrued interest is fully reversed, and further income is recognized only to the extent received on a cash basis or cost recovery method. 
 
 When we acquire real estate as a result of foreclosure or a deed-in-lieu transaction, the real estate is classified as real estate owned. The real estate owned is recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Soon after acquisition, we order a new appraisal to determine the current market value of the property. Any excess of the recorded value of the loan over the market value of the property is charged against the allowance for loan losses, or, if the existing allowance is inadequate, charged to expense of the current period. After acquisition, all costs incurred in maintaining the property are expensed. Costs relating to the development and improvement of the property, however, are capitalized to the extent of estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell. 
 
 A loan is classified as a troubled debt restructuring if, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower s financial difficulties, we grant a concession to the borrower that we would not otherwise consider. This usually includes a modification of loan terms, such as a reduction of the interest rate to below market terms, capitalizing past due interest or extending the maturity date and possibly a partial forgiveness of the principal amount due. Interest income on restructured loans is accrued after the borrower demonstrates the ability to pay under the restructured terms through a sustained period of repayment performance, which is generally six consecutive months. 
 
 Delinquent Loans. The following table sets forth our loan delinquencies, including non-accrual loans, by type and amount at the dates indicated.

 (1) PPP loans 90 days past due and accruing totaled 61 thousand and 116 thousand at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Such loans are not reported in non-performing loans as they carry the federal guarantee of the SBA.

Classified Assets . Federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets, such as debt and equity securities considered to be of lesser quality, as substandard, doubtful or loss. An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss allowance is not warranted. Assets which do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated as special mention by our management. 
 
 When an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it may establish general allowances in an amount deemed prudent by management to cover probable accrued losses. General allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to cover probable accrued losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as loss, it is required to charge-off such amount. An institution s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the regulatory authorities, which may require the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances. 
 
 In connection with the filing of our periodic reports with the FDIC and in accordance with our classification of assets policy, we regularly review the problem loans in our portfolio to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. 
 
 The following table sets forth our amounts of special mention and classified loans as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 
 At December 31, 2022 2021 
 (In thousands) Special mention 2,224 5,213 Substandard 8,469 13,178 Doubtful Loss Total 10,693 18,391 
 
 At December 31, 2022, special mention loans included one residential one-to-four family totaling 247 thousand, one multi-family real estate loan totaling 897 thousand and two non-residential real estate loan totaling 1.1 million. At December 31, 2022, substandard loans represent 20 loans totaling 8.5 million. At December 31, 2021, special mention loans included one non-residential real estate loan totaling 144 thousand and one multi-family real estate loan totaling 5.1 million. At December 31, 2021, substandard loans represent 33 loans totaling 13.2 million.

Allowance for Loan Losses 
 
 The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which, in management s judgment, is adequate to absorb probable and incurred credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The amount of the allowance is based on management s evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio, including the nature of the portfolio, credit concentrations, trends in historical loss experience, specific impaired loans, and economic conditions. Allowances for loans that are individually classified as impaired are generally determined based on collateral values or the present value of estimated cash flows. The allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses, which is charged to expense and reduced by full and partial charge-offs, net of recoveries. Changes in the allowance relating to impaired loans are charged or credited to the provision for loan losses. Management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on various factors, including historical loss experience, current economic conditions, delinquency statistics, geographic and industry concentrations, the adequacy of the underlying collateral, the financial strength of borrowers, results of internal loan reviews and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses. 
 
 In addition, the NJDOBI and the FDIC periodically review our allowance for loan losses and as a result of such reviews, they may require us to adjust our allowance for loan losses or recognize loan charge-offs. 
 
 The following table sets forth activity in our allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated.

Investment Activities 
 
 General. The goals of our investment policy are generally to provide liquidity, mitigate interest rate risk, ensure the safety of principal, provide earnings and meet pledging requirements. Subject to loan demand and our interest rate risk analysis, we may increase the balance of our securities portfolio . 
 
 Our investment policy was adopted and is reviewed annually by the Board of Directors. All investment decisions are made by senior management in accordance with board-approved policies. The Treasurer provides an investment schedule detailing the investment portfolio, which is regularly reviewed by the Board of Directors. 
 
 Our current investment policy permits, with certain limitations, investments in: U.S. Treasury securities; securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies or government sponsored enterprises including mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations issued by Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae and Freddie Mac; corporate and municipal bonds; private label mortgage-backed securities and privately issued asset-backed securities; certificates of deposit in other financial institutions; federal funds and money market funds. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, our securities portfolio consisted of debt securities issued by the U.S. Government, agencies of the U.S. Government or U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises, mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations issued and guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. Securities also included corporate bonds, municipal bonds, asset-backed securities, federal funds and deposits in other institutions. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, other investments primarily consisted of membership and activity-based shares in FHLB stock. As a member of FHLB, we are required to purchase stock in the FHLB, which stock is carried at cost and classified as other investment securities. Other investments also consists of, to a much lesser extent, an investment in a financial technology fund carried at net asset value NAV and shares in a cooperative that provides community banking core technology solutions, carried at cost. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, our securities portfolio consisted of approximately 60 high-quality liquid assets, with the remaining 40 consisting of corporate bonds, municipal bonds, privately issued asset-backed securities and other investment securities. Approximately 90 of our securities portfolio was classified as available for sale, with the remaining 10 classified as held to maturity.

Portfolio Maturities and Yields. The following table sets forth the stated maturities and weighted average yields of investment securities at December 31, 2022. Weighted average yields on tax-exempt securities presented exclude the tax equivalent yield due to the valuation allowance. Certain mortgage-backed securities have adjustable interest rates and will reprice at least annually within the various maturity ranges. These repricing schedules are not reflected in the table below. Weighted average yield calculations on investment securities available for sale do not give effect to changes in fair value that are reflected as a component of equity.

Sources of Funds 
 
 General. Deposits have traditionally been our primary source of funds for our lending and investment activities. We also use borrowings, primarily FHLB advances, to supplement cash flows, as needed. In addition, funds are derived from scheduled loan payments, securities maturities, loan prepayments, retained earnings and income on earning assets. While scheduled loan payments and income on earning assets are relatively stable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates, market conditions and competition. 
 
 Deposit Accounts. The substantial majority of our deposits are from depositors who reside in our primary market area. We access deposit customers by offering a broad selection of deposit instruments for individuals and businesses. 
 
 Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time period that funds must remain on deposit, and the interest rate, among other factors. In determining the terms of our deposit accounts, we consider the rates offered by our competition, our liquidity needs, profitability, and customer preferences. We generally review our deposit pricing on a monthly basis and continually review our deposit mix. Our deposit pricing strategy has been to offer competitive rates, but generally not the highest rates offered in the market, and to periodically offer special rates to attract deposits of a specific type or with a specific term. Deposit pricing is reviewed regularly as warranted by market conditions. 
 
 We may supplement customer deposits with listed and brokered deposits. Listed deposits totaled 40.4 million and 65.3 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. At December 31, 2022, brokered deposits totaled 75.0 million. There were no brokered deposits at December 31, 2021. 
 
 The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in money market and other prevailing interest rates and competition. The variety of deposit accounts offered allows us to be competitive in obtaining funds and responding to changes in consumer demand. Based on experience, we believe that our deposits are relatively stable. However, the ability to attract and maintain deposits and the rates paid on these deposits, has been and will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions. 
 
 The following table sets forth the distribution of total deposits by account type at the dates indicated.

 Employees and Human Capital Resources 
 
 At December 31, 2022 we employed 198 employees, nearly all of whom are full-time and of which approximately 63 are women. At December 31, 2021, we employed 175 employees. As a financial institution, approximately 40 of our employees are employed at our branch offices, and another 4 are employed at our customer care call center. The success of our business is highly dependent on our employees, who provide value to our customers and communities through their dedication to our mission, helping customers achieve financial security. Our workplace culture is grounded in a set of core values a concern for others, trust, respect, hard work, and a dedication to our customers. We seek to hire well-qualified employees who are also a good fit for our value system. Our selection and promotion processes are without bias and include the active recruitment of minorities, women, individuals with disabilities and veterans, without regard to race, color, religion, sex, LGBTQ+, national origin, disability or protected veteran status. 
 
 We encourage and support the growth and development of our employees and, wherever possible, seek to fill positions by promotion and transfer from within the organization. Continual training and career development is advanced through regular performance discussions between employees and their managers, internally developed training programs, customized corporate training engagements and educational reimbursement programs. Reimbursement is available to employees enrolled in pre-approved degree or certification programs at accredited institutions that teach skills or knowledge relevant to our business. The Bank pays for seminars, conferences, and other training events employees attend in connection with their job duties. In addition to the investment in employee professional development, the Bank s benefit and compensation programs are designed to ensure we recruit and retain top talent. 
 
 21 

The Bank offers employees a comprehensive health benefits package and structures its bonus program to create meaningful performance-based incentives. To encourage retirement savings, the Bank provides a 401(k) match of up to 6 of an employee s salary. Eligible employees are automatically enrolled in the plan and 3 of the employee s total taxable compensation is withheld with annual 1 escalations up to 6 . Employees may opt out at any time. Our employees share in our financial success while preparing for retirement through the Employee Stock Ownership Plan ESOP ).

 Supervision and Regulation 
 
 The Company and the Bank operate in the highly regulated banking industry. This regulation establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which a bank holding company and New Jersey savings bank may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the Deposit Insurance Fund and depositors. 
 
 Set forth below is a brief description of certain material regulatory requirements that are applicable to the Bank and the Company. The description is not intended to be a complete list or description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on the Bank and the Company. 
 
 Blue Foundry Bank 
 
 As a New Jersey-chartered savings bank, the Bank is subject to comprehensive regulation by the NJDOBI, as its chartering authority and, as a federally insured nonmember institution, by the FDIC. The Bank is a member of the FHLB and its deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC. The Bank is required to file reports with, and is periodically examined by, the FDIC and the NJDOBI concerning its activities and financial condition and must obtain regulatory approvals before entering into certain transactions, including mergers with or acquisitions of other financial institutions. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies regarding classifying assets and establishing an adequate allowance for loan losses for regulatory purposes. 
 
 New Jersey Banking Laws and Supervision 
 
 Activity Powers. The Bank derives its lending, investment and other activity powers primarily from the New Jersey Banking Act and its related regulations. Under these laws and regulations, savings banks, including Blue Foundry Bank, generally may invest in: 
 
 real estate mortgages; 
 consumer and commercial loans; 
 specific types of debt securities, including certain corporate debt securities and obligations of federal, state and local governments and agencies; 
 certain types of corporate equity securities; and 
 certain other assets. 
 
 22 

A savings bank may also make other investments pursuant to leeway authority that permits investments not otherwise permitted by the New Jersey Banking Act. Leeway investments must comply with a number of limitations on the individual and aggregate amounts of leeway investments. A savings bank may also exercise trust powers upon approval of the NJDOBI. New Jersey savings banks also may exercise those powers, rights, benefits or privileges authorized for national banks or out-of-state banks or for federal or out-of-state savings banks or savings associations, provided that before exercising any such power, right, benefit or privilege, prior approval by the NJDOBI by regulation or by specific authorization is required. The exercise of these lending, investment and activity powers is limited by federal law and regulations. See Federal Bank Regulation Activities and Investments below. Certain corporate transactions by a savings bank, such as establishing branches and acquiring other banks, require the prior approval of the NJDOBI. 
 
 Loan-to-One-Borrower Limitations. With certain specified exceptions, a New Jersey-chartered savings bank may not make loans or extend credit to a single borrower or to entities related to the borrower in an aggregate amount that would exceed 15 of the bank s capital funds. A savings bank may lend an additional 10 of the bank s capital funds if secured by collateral meeting the requirements of the New Jersey Banking Act. The Bank currently complies with applicable loan-to-one-borrower limitations. 
 
 Dividends. Under the New Jersey Banking Act, a stock savings bank may declare and pay a dividend on its capital stock only to the extent that the payment of the dividend would not impair the capital stock of the savings bank. In addition, a savings bank may not pay a dividend unless the savings bank would have a surplus of not less than 50 of its capital stock after the payment of the dividend or, alternatively, the payment of the dividend would not reduce the surplus. Federal law may also limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the Bank. See Federal Bank Regulation Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action below. 
 
 Minimum Capital Requirements. Regulations of the NJDOBI impose on New Jersey-chartered depository institutions, including the Bank, minimum capital requirements generally similar to those imposed by the FDIC on insured state banks. See Federal Bank Regulation Capital Requirements. 
 
 Examination and Enforcement. The NJDOBI may examine the Bank as it deems advisable. It typically examines the Bank at least every two years, typically alternating exams with the FDIC such that the Bank is subject to regulatory examination every year. Regulated institutions are assessed for expenses incurred by the NJDOBI. 
 
 The NJDOBI has authority to enforce applicable law and prevent practices that may cause harm to an institution, including the issuance of cease and desist orders and civil money penalties and removal of directors, officers and employees. The NJDOBI also has authority to appoint a conservator or receiver for a savings bank under certain circumstances such as insolvency or unsafe or unsound condition to transact business. 
 
 Federal Bank Regulation 
 
 Supervision and Enforcement Authority . The Bank is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the FDIC as its primary federal prudential regulator and the insurer of its deposits. The regulatory structure gives the FDIC extensive discretion in connection with its supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of an adequate allowance for loan losses for regulatory purposes. 
 
 The Bank must file reports with the FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition. It must also obtain prior FDIC approval before entering into certain corporate transactions such as establishing new branches and mergers with, or acquisitions of, other financial institutions. There are periodic examinations by the FDIC to evaluate the Bank s safety and soundness and compliance with various regulatory requirements. 
 
 The FDIC maintains substantial enforcement authority over regulated institutions. That includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease and desist orders and remove directors and officers. In general, enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations, breaches of fiduciary duty and unsafe or unsound practices. The FDIC may also appoint itself as conservator or receiver for an insured bank under specified circumstances, including: (1) insolvency; (2) substantial dissipation of assets or earnings 
 
 23 

through violations of law or unsafe or unsound practices; (3) the existence of an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business; (4) insufficient capital; or (5) the incurrence of losses that will deplete substantially all of the institution s capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment without federal assistance. 
 
 Capital Requirements. Under FDIC regulations, the Bank must meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a total capital to risk-based assets, and a Tier 1 capital to average total assets leverage ratio. The capital requirements are based on recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ). 
 
 The capital standards require the maintenance of common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5 , 6 and 8 , respectively, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4 of average total assets. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common shareholders equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and Additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital generally includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus Additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25 of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income AOCI ), up to 45 of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). The Bank exercised the opt-out election regarding the treatment of AOCI. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. 
 
 In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, a bank s assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests), are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on perceived risks inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0 is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50 is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one-to-four family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100 is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150 is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0 to 600 is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors. 
 
 In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if an institution does not hold a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 , effectively resulting in the following minimum ratios: (1) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0 , (2) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5 , and (3) a total capital ratio of 10.5 . 
 
 Federal legislation enacted in 2018 required the federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, to adopt a rule implementing a simplified community bank leverage ratio alternative for institutions with assets of less than 10 billion that meet other specified criteria. Pursuant to federal legislation enacted in 2020, the community bank leverage ratio was set at 9 for 2022 and thereafter. A qualifying community bank that exercises the election and has capital equal to or exceeding the applicable percentage is considered compliant with all applicable regulatory capital requirements. Qualifying institutions may elect to utilize the community bank leverage ratio in lieu of the generally applicable risk-based capital requirements. 
 
 A qualifying institution may opt in and out of the community bank leverage ratio framework on its quarterly call report. As of December 31, 2022, the Bank has not opted into the community bank leverage ratio framework. 

24 

The FDIC also has authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon determination that an institution s capital level is, or is likely to become, inadequate in light of the particular circumstances. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, the Bank exceeded each of its capital requirements. 
 
 Standards for Safety and Soundness. As required by statute, the federal banking agencies have adopted final regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. The guidelines address internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, credit underwriting, loan documentation, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. The agencies have also established standards for safeguarding customer information. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. 
 
 Activities and Investments. Federal law provides that a state-chartered bank insured by the FDIC generally may not engage as a principal in any activity not permissible for a national bank to conduct or make any equity investment of a type or in an amount not authorized for national banks, notwithstanding state law, subject to certain exceptions. For example, state-chartered banks may, with FDIC approval, continue to exercise state authority to invest in common or preferred stocks listed on a national securities exchange or the Nasdaq Market and to invest in shares of investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The maximum permissible investment is 100 of Tier 1 Capital, as specified by the FDIC s regulations, or the maximum amount permitted by New Jersey law, whichever is less. Such grandfathered authority terminates upon a change in the institution s charter or a change in control. 
 
 In addition, the FDIC is authorized to permit a state-chartered bank or savings bank to engage in state-authorized activities or investments not permissible for national banks (other than non-subsidiary equity investments) if it meets all applicable capital requirements and it is determined that the activities or investments involved do not pose a significant risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund. The FDIC has adopted procedures for institutions seeking approval to engage in such activities or investments. In addition, a nonmember bank may control a subsidiary that engages in activities as principal that would only be permitted for a national bank to conduct in a financial subsidiary if a bank meets specified conditions and deducts its investment in the subsidiary for regulatory capital purposes. 
 
 Interstate Banking and Branching. Federal law permits well capitalized and well managed bank holding companies to acquire banks in any state, subject to Federal Reserve Board approval, certain concentration limits and other specified conditions. Interstate mergers of banks are also authorized, subject to regulatory approval and other specified conditions. In addition, banks may establish de novo branches on an interstate basis at any location where a bank chartered under the laws of the branch location host state may establish a branch. 
 
 Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action. Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulatory authorities take prompt corrective action with respect to banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the law establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. 
 
 The FDIC has adopted regulations to implement the prompt corrective action legislation. An institution is considered well capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0 or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0 or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5 or greater. An institution is adequately capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0 or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0 or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5 or greater. An institution is undercapitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0 , a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 , a leverage ratio of less than 4.0 or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5 . An institution is significantly undercapitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 , a 
 
 25 

Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0 , a leverage ratio of less than 3.0 or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0 . An institution is critically undercapitalized if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets equal to or less than 2.0 . At December 31, 2022, the Bank was classified as a well capitalized institution. 
 
 At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to additional operating restrictions, including limits on growth and a prohibition on the payment of dividends and other capital distributions. Furthermore, if an insured depository institution is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the appropriate federal banking agency. An undercapitalized bank s compliance with a capital restoration plan must be guaranteed by any company that controls the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of 5.0 of the institution s total assets when deemed undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the status of adequately capitalized. If an undercapitalized bank fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. Significantly undercapitalized banks must comply with one or more of a number of possible additional restrictions, including an order by the FDIC to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, reduce total assets, cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks, dismiss directors or officers, or limit interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers or capital distributions by the parent holding company. Critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to additional measures including, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver or conservator within 270 days after it is determined to be critically undercapitalized. 
 
 A bank that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the FDIC, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such treatment. 
 
 Transaction with Affiliates and Regulation W of the Federal Reserve Regulations/Loans to Insiders. Transactions between banks and their affiliates are governed by federal law. Generally, Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve Board s Regulation W prohibit a bank and its subsidiaries from engaging in a covered transaction with an affiliate if the aggregate amount of covered transactions outstanding with that affiliate, including the proposed transaction, would exceed an amount equal to 10.0 of the bank s capital stock and surplus. The aggregate amount of covered transactions outstanding with all affiliates is limited to 20.0 of the bank s capital stock and surplus. Section 23B applies to covered transactions, as well as to certain other transactions, and requires that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the institution or subsidiary as prevailing market terms for transactions with or involving a non-affiliate. The term covered transaction includes making loans to, purchasing assets from, and issuing guarantees to an affiliate, and other similar transactions. Section 23B transactions also include the bank s providing services and selling assets to an affiliate. In addition, loans or other extensions of credit by a bank to an affiliate are required to be collateralized according to the requirements set forth in Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. 
 
 A bank s loans to its executive officers, directors, any owner of 10 or more of its stock (each, an insider) and any of certain entities affiliated with any such person (an insider s related interest) as well as loans to insiders of affiliates and such insiders related interests are subject to the conditions and limitations imposed by Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and its implementing regulations. Under these restrictions, the aggregate amount of the loans to any insider and the insider s related interests may not exceed the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to national banks, which is comparable to the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to the Bank s loans. See New Jersey Banking Laws and Supervision Loan-to-One Borrower Limitations. All loans by a bank to all insiders and insiders related interests in the aggregate may not exceed the bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. Loans to an executive officer, other than loans for the education of the officer s children and certain loans secured by the officer s residence, may not exceed the lesser of (1) 100,000 or (2) the greater of 25,000 or 2.5 of the bank s unimpaired capital and surplus. The regulations require that any proposed loan to an insider, or a related interest of that insider, be approved in advance by a majority of the Board of Directors of the bank, with any interested directors not participating in the voting, if that loan, combined with previous loans by the bank to the insider and his or her related interests, exceeds specified amounts. Generally, such loans must be made on substantially the same terms as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those that 
 
 26 

are prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons. As of December 31, 2022 the Bank does not have a material balance of such loans. 
 
 The regulations contain a general exception for extensions of credit made pursuant to a benefit or compensation plan of a bank that is widely available to employees of the bank and that does not give any preference to insiders of the bank over other employees. 
 
 In addition, federal law prohibits extensions of credit to a bank s insiders and their related interests by any other institution that has a correspondent banking relationship with the bank, unless such extension of credit is on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and does not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. 
 
 The New Jersey Banking Act imposes conditions and limitations on the liabilities to a savings bank of its directors and executive officers and of corporations and partnerships controlled by such persons, that are comparable in many respects to the conditions and limitations imposed on the loans and extensions of credit to insiders and their related interests under federal law, as discussed above. The New Jersey Banking Act also provides that a savings bank that is in compliance with federal law is deemed to be in compliance with such provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act. 
 
 Federal Insurance of Deposit Accounts. The Bank is a member of the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is administered by the FDIC. Deposit accounts in the Bank are insured up to a maximum of 250,000 for each separately insured depositor. 
 
 The FDIC assesses all insured depository institutions. An institution s assessment rate depends upon the perceived risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund of that institution, with less risky institutions paying lower rates. Currently, assessments for institutions of less than 10 billion of total assets are based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical models estimating the probability of failure within three years. Assessment rates (inclusive of possible adjustments) ranged from 1.5 to 30 basis points of each institution s total assets less tangible capital effective December 31, 2022. 
 
 The FDIC has authority to increase the range of assessments and adopted a final rule in October 2022 to increase initial base deposit assessment rates by two basis points beginning in the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. As a result, effective January 1, 2023, assessment rates for institutions of the Bank s size will range from 2.5 to 32 basis points. 
 
 Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or regulatory condition imposed in writing. We do not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of the Bank s deposit insurance. 
 
 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act FDICIA ). The Bank, having over 500 million in total assets, is subject to requirements of Section 112 of FDICIA FDICIA 112 ). The primary purpose of FDICIA 112 is to provide a framework for early risk identification in financial management through an effective system of internal controls. Annual reporting requirements under FDICIA are as follows: (1) annual audited financial statements; (2) management report stating management's responsibility for preparing the institution's annual financial statements, establishing and maintaining an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting and for complying with laws and regulations, and assessment by management of the institution's compliance with such laws and regulations; and (3) for insured depository institutions with consolidated total assets over 1.0 billion or more, such as the Bank, the independent public accountant who audits the institution's financial statements shall examine, attest to, and report separately on the assertion of management concerning the effectiveness of the institution's internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. 
 
 Privacy Regulations. Federal law generally requires that the Bank disclose its privacy policy, including identifying with whom it shares a customer s non-public personal information, to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship. In addition, financial institutions are generally required to furnish their 
 
 27 

customers a privacy notice annually. However, a provision of the Fixing America s Surface Transportation Act enacted in 2015 provides an exception from the annual notice requirement if a financial institution does not share non-public personal information with non-affiliated third parties (other than as permitted under certain exceptions) and its policies and practices regarding disclosure of non-public personal information have not changed since the last distribution of its policies and practices to its customers. In addition, the Bank is required to provide its customers with the ability to opt-out of having their personal information shared with unaffiliated third parties and to not disclose account numbers or access codes to non-affiliated third parties for marketing purposes. 
 
 Community Reinvestment Act. Under the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA, as implemented by the FDIC, a state nonmember bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with its safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. The CRA requires the FDIC, in connection with its examination of each state non-member bank, to assess the institution s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution, including applications to establish branches and acquire other financial institutions. The CRA requires the FDIC to provide a written evaluation of an institution s CRA performance utilizing a four-tiered descriptive rating system. The Bank s most recent FDIC CRA rating in March 2021 was Satisfactory. 
 
 Consumer Protection and Fair Lending Regulations. The Bank is subject to a variety of federal and New Jersey statutes and regulations that are intended to protect consumers and prohibit discrimination in the granting of credit. These statutes and regulations provide for a range of sanctions for non-compliance with their terms, including imposition of administrative fines and remedial orders, and referral to the Attorney General for prosecution of a civil action for actual and punitive damages and injunctive relief. Certain of these statutes, including Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair and deceptive acts and practices against consumers, authorize private individual and class action lawsuits and the award of actual, statutory and punitive damages and attorneys fees for certain types of violations. Federal laws also prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices against consumers, which can be enforced by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the FDIC and state attorneys general. 
 
 Federal Home Loan Bank System 
 
 The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Banks provide a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. The Bank, as a member of the FHLB, is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB. The Bank was in compliance with this requirement at December 31, 2022. 
 
 Holding Company Regulation 
 
 Federal Holding Company Regulation . The Company is a bank holding company registered with the Federal Reserve Board and is subject to regulations, examination, supervision and reporting requirements applicable to bank holding companies. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board will have enforcement authority over the Company and its non-savings bank subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary savings bank. 
 
 A bank holding company is generally prohibited from engaging in non-banking activities, or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5 of the voting securities of any company engaged in non-banking activities. One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities the Federal Reserve Board had determined to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Some of the principal activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation to be so closely related to banking are: (1) making or servicing loans; (2) performing certain data processing services; (3) providing discount brokerage services; (4) acting as fiduciary, investment or financial advisor; (5) leasing personal or real property; (6) making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare; and (7) acquiring a 
 
 28 

savings and loan association whose direct and indirect activities are limited to those permitted for bank holding companies. 
 
 The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 authorizes a bank holding company that meets specified conditions, including that its depository institution subsidiaries are well capitalized and well managed, to opt to become a financial holding company. A financial holding company may engage in a broader range of financial activities than a bank holding company. Such activities may include insurance underwriting and investment banking. Blue Foundry Bancorp has no plans to elect financial holding company status at this time. 
 
 Capital. Federal legislation required the Federal Reserve Board to establish minimum consolidated capital requirements for bank and savings and loan holding companies that are as stringent as those applicable to their insured depository subsidiaries. However, subsequent federal legislation exempted from the applicability of the consolidated capital requirements holding companies with less than 3.0 billion in consolidated assets, such as the Company, unless otherwise advised by the Federal Reserve Board. 
 
 Source of Strength. Federal law provides that bank and savings and loan holding companies must act as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institution. The expectation is that the holding company will provide capital, liquidity and other support for the institution in times of financial stress. 
 
 Stock Repurchases and Dividends. A bank holding company is generally required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10 or more of the company s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board. There is an exception to this approval requirement for well-capitalized bank holding companies that meet certain other conditions. 
 
 Additionally, under the prompt corrective action laws, the ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. 
 
 Notwithstanding the above, the Federal Reserve Board has issued a supervisory bulletin regarding the payment of dividends and repurchase or redemption of outstanding shares of stock by bank and holding companies. In general, the Federal Reserve Board s policy is that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The supervisory bulletin provides for prior consultation with and review of proposed dividends by the Federal Reserve Board in certain cases, such as where a proposed dividend exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend would be paid (e.g., calendar quarter) or where the company s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund a proposed dividend. 
 
 The supervisory bulletin also indicates that a holding company should notify the Federal Reserve Board, under certain circumstances, prior to redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock. The specified circumstances include where a holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or where the repurchase or redemption would result in a net reduction, as of the end of a quarter, in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. Even outside of these circumstances, the Federal Reserve Board expects as a matter of practice to have notice and opportunity for non-objection before such an action is taken. The supervisory bulletin indicates that such notification is for purposes of allowing Federal Reserve Board supervisory review of, and possible objection to, the proposed repurchases or redemption. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of Blue Foundry Bancorp to pay dividends, engage in stock repurchases or otherwise engage in capital distributions. 
 
 Acquisition. The Change in Bank Control Act provides that no person may acquire control of a bank holding company, such as the Company, without the prior non-objection or approval of the Federal Reserve Board. Control, 
 
 29 

as defined under the Change in Bank Control Act, means ownership, control of or the power, to vote 25 or more of any class of voting securities of the company. Acquisition of 10 or more of any class of a bank holding company s voting securities constitutes a rebuttable presumption of control under certain circumstances, including where, as is the case with the Company, the issuer has registered securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. 
 
 In addition, the Bank Holding Company Act provides that no company may acquire control of a bank or bank holding company within the meaning of that statute without having first obtained the approval of the Federal Reserve Board. A company that acquires control of a bank or bank holding company for purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act becomes a bank holding company subject to registration, examination and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board. 
 
 New Jersey law establishes similar filing and prior approval requirements as to the NJDOBI for direct or indirect acquisitions of New Jersey chartered institutions. 
 
 Federal Securities Laws 
 
 The Company s common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Blue Foundry Bancorp is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Exchange Act. 
 
 Emerging Growth Company Status. We are an emerging growth company. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we have elected to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As an emerging growth company, we also will not be subject to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which would require that our independent auditors review and attest as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We have also elected to use the extended transition period to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. If the Company were to subsequently elect not to use this extended transition period, such election would be irrevocable. Due to our use of the extended transition period, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. 
 
 A company loses emerging growth company status on the earlier of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year of the company during which it had total annual gross revenues of 1.07 billion or more; (2) the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of the company pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act; (3) the date on which such company has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; or (4) the date on which such company is deemed to be a large accelerated filer under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations (generally, a large accelerated filer is defined as a corporation with at least 700 million of voting and non-voting equity held by non-affiliates). 
 
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was enacted to improve corporate responsibility, provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. The Company has policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations.

TAXATION 
 
 Federal Taxation 
 
 General. The Company and the Bank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize material federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Company and the Bank. 
 
 Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, the Company currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31 for filing its federal income tax returns. 
 
 Net Operating Loss Carryovers. Effective with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, net operating loss carrybacks are no longer permitted, and net operating losses are allowed to be carried forward indefinitely. Net operating loss carryforwards arising from tax years beginning after January 1, 2018 are limited to offset a maximum of 80 of a future year s taxable income. At December 31, 2022, the Company had 25.8 million in net operating loss carryovers. The Company contributed 9.0 million to the Blue Foundry Charitable Foundation, and the deferred benefit has a 5 year carryforward limitation. 
 
 Capital Loss Carryovers. Generally, a financial institution may carry back capital losses to the preceding three taxable years and forward to the succeeding five taxable years. Any capital loss carryback or carryover is treated as a short-term capital loss for the year to which it is carried. As such, it is grouped with any other capital losses for the year to which carried and is used to offset any capital gains. Any loss remaining after the five-year carryover period that has not been deducted is no longer deductible. At December 31, 2022, the Company had no capital loss carryovers. 
 
 Corporate Dividends. We may generally exclude from our income 100 of dividends received from the Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations. 
 
 Audit of Tax Returns. The Company s federal income tax returns have not been audited in the last three years. 
 
 State Taxation 
 
 New Jersey State Taxation. In 2014, tax legislation was enacted that changed the manner in which financial institutions and their affiliates are taxed in New Jersey. Taxable income is apportioned to New Jersey based on the location of the taxpayer s customers, with special rules for income from certain financial transactions. The location of the taxpayer s offices and branches are not relevant to the determination of income apportioned to New Jersey. The state of New Jersey applies a surtax based on the tax base within the state, applying a 6.5 , 7.5 or 9 rate. Given the Company has available net operating losses for the period, the statutory rate that would apply to the tax base in 2022 is 6.5 . An alternative tax on apportioned capital, capped at 5.0 million for a tax year, is imposed to the extent that it exceeds the tax on apportioned income. The New Jersey alternative tax rate was 0.05 for 2019, 0.025 for 2020 and was completely phased out as of January 1, 2021. Qualified community banks and thrift institutions that maintain a qualified loan portfolio are entitled to a specially computed modification that reduces the income taxable to New Jersey. The Company had New Jersey net operating loss carryforwards totaling 26.4 million, the majority of which will expire in 19.0 years years. 
 
 The Company s New Jersey State income tax returns were subject to an audit for the years 2015 through 2018, which concluded in January 2022 without findings. 
 
 New York State Taxation . The Company files New York State tax returns on a calendar year basis. New York State imposes a corporate income tax, based on net income allocable to New York State at a rate of 6.5 . In April 2021, legislation increased the corporate franchise tax rate to 7.25 for tax years beginning on or after January 
 
 31 

1, 2021 and before January 1, 2024 for taxpayers with a business income base greater than 5 million. In addition, the scheduled phase-out of the capital base tax was delayed. The rate of the capital base was to have been 0 starting in 2021. The legislation imposed a tax rate of 0.1875 for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2021 and before January 1, 2024, with the 0 rate to take effect in 2024. New York State also imposes the Metropolitan Transportation Authority MTA Tax Surcharge allocable to business activities carried on in the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation District. The MTA surcharge rate for 2021 was 30.0 , and will remain at 30.0 for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2022, and before January 1, 2023. 
 
 New York City Taxation . The Company is also subject to the New York City Financial Corporation Tax calculated, subject to a New York City income and expense allocation, on a similar basis as the New York State Tax, at a rate of 8.85 . 
 
 Pennsylvania State Taxation . The Bank is subject to Pennsylvania Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax imposed at the rate of 11.5 on net taxable income of mutual thrift institutions in Pennsylvania, including savings banks without capital stock, building and loan associations, savings and loan associations, and savings institutions having capital stock. 
 
 Delaware State Taxation . As a Delaware business corporation not earning income in Delaware, the Company is exempt from Delaware corporate income tax but is required to file an annual report with and pay franchise taxes to the state of Delaware. 
 
 Connecticut State Taxation . The Company is subject to Corporate Income Tax in Connecticut at a rate of 7.5 and is expected to be taxpaying in this jurisdiction. 

Deferred Tax Valuation Allowance 
 
 Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing deferred tax assets. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred over the three-year period ended December 31, 2022. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as our projections for future growth. 
 
 On the basis of this evaluation, a valuation allowance was established at December 31, 2021 for both federal and state net deferred tax assets. For the year ended December 31, 2022, a valuation allowance of 22.6 million has been maintained for deferred tax. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income increased or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth.

ITEM 1.A RISK FACTORS 
 
 Risks Related to Interest Rate Risk 
 
 Future changes in interest rates may reduce any future profits. 
 
 Like most financial institutions, whether we are profitable or not depends to a large extent upon our net interest income, which is the difference between our interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and our interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowed funds. Accordingly, our results of operations depend largely on movements in market interest rates and our ability to manage our interest-rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to these movements. Factors such as inflation, recession and instability in financial markets, among other factors beyond our control, may affect interest rates. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had net income of 2.4 million. 
 
 Our financial condition and results of operations are significantly affected by changes in market interest rates, and the degree to which these changes disparately impact short-term and long-term interest rates and influence the behavior of our customer base. Our results of operations substantially depend on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets and the interest expense we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. A flattening yield curve, or one that inverts, could negatively impact our net interest margin and earnings. 
 
 As the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates, our interest-bearing liabilities may be subject to repricing or maturing more quickly than our interest-earning assets. If short-term rates increase rapidly, we may have to increase the rates we pay on our deposits and borrowed funds more quickly than we can increase the interest rates we earn on our loans and investments, resulting in a negative effect on interest spreads and net interest income. In addition, the effect of rising rates could be compounded if deposit customers move funds into higher yielding accounts or are lost to competitors offering higher rates on their deposit products. Conversely, should market interest rates fall below current levels, our net interest income could also be negatively affected if competitive pressures prevent us from reducing rates on our deposits, while the yields on our assets decrease through loan prepayments and interest rate adjustments. 
 
 Changes in interest rates also affect the value of our interest-earning assets and in particular our securities portfolio. Generally, the value of securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2022, our available for sale debt securities portfolio totaled 314.2 million with net unrealized losses of 36.2 million and are reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Therefore, decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale resulting from increases in interest rates could have an adverse effect on stockholders' equity. At December 31, 2022, our held-to-maturity debt securities portfolio totaled 33.7 million with net unrecognized losses of 4.6 million. The net unrecognized losses on our held-to-maturity securities are not reported in the financial statements until realized upon sale. The Company does not intend to sell held-to-maturity securities, nor does it foresee being required to sell them before the anticipated recovery (maturity). 
 
 Volatility and uncertainty related to inflation and the effects of inflation, which may lead to increased costs for businesses and consumers and potentially contribute to poor business and economic conditions generally, may also enhance or contribute to some of the risks discussed herein. For example, higher inflation, or volatility and uncertainty related to inflation, could reduce demand for the Company's products, adversely affect the creditworthiness of the Company's borrowers or result in lower values for the Company's investment securities and other interest-earning assets. 
 
 Any substantial change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. While we pursue an asset/liability strategy designed to mitigate our risk from changes in interest rates, such changes can still have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2022, our net portfolio value would decrease by 84.8 million if there was an instantaneous 200 basis point increase in market interest rates. For further discussion of how changes in 
 
 33 

interest rates could impact us, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Market Risk. 
 
 Risks Related to Lending Activities 
 
 Because we intend to increase our commercial real estate and commercial loan originations, our lending risk will increase. 
 
 Commercial real estate and commercial loans generally have more risk than residential mortgage loans. Because the repayment of commercial real estate and commercial loans depends on the successful management and operation of the borrower s properties or related businesses, repayment of such loans can be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the local economy. Commercial real estate and commercial loans may also involve relatively large loan balances to individual borrowers or groups of related borrowers. A downturn in the real estate market or the local economy could adversely impact the value of properties securing the loan or the revenues from the borrower s business thereby increasing the risk of non-performing loans. Also, many of our multi-family and commercial real estate and commercial business borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a residential mortgage loan. Further, unlike residential mortgages or multi-family and commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans may be secured by collateral other than real estate, such as inventory and accounts receivable, the value of which may be more difficult to appraise, may be more susceptible to fluctuation in value at default, and may be more difficult to realize upon enforcement of our remedies. As our commercial real estate and commercial loan portfolios increase, the corresponding risks and potential for losses from these loans may also increase. 
 
 The implementation of the Current Expected Credit Loss accounting standard could require us to increase our allowance for credit losses and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments became effective for the Company on January 1, 2023. ASU No. 2016-13 replaced the incurred loss model with an expected loss model, which is referred to as the current expected credit loss model, or CECL. Under the CECL model, banks are required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held for investment and held-to-maturity debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is to be based on information about past events, including historical experience, and current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This standard requires earlier recognition of expected credit losses on loans and certain other instruments. This measurement will take place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet and periodically thereafter. This differs significantly from the incurred loss model required under current generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ), which delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. The adoption of CECL can result in greater volatility in the level of the allowance for credit losses, depending on various factors and assumptions applied in the models, such as the forecasted economic conditions over the reasonable and supportable forecast period and loan payment behaviors. Any increase in the allowance for credit losses, or expenses incurred to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses, can have an adverse effect on the Company s financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Based on several analyses performed, as well as an implementation analysis utilizing existing exposures and forecasts of macroeconomic conditions at December 31, 2022, the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will result in a minimal change in our total allowance for loan losses and reserves for unfunded commitments, and an immaterial allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity debt securities. Upon adoption, any impact to the allowance for credit losses on loans and held-to-maturity debt securities as of January 1, 2023, will be reflected as an adjustment, net of tax, to retained earnings. 

34 

If our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings and capital could decrease. 
 
 Lending is inherently risky and we are exposed to the risk that our borrowers may default on their obligations. A borrower s default on its obligations may result in lost principal and interest income and increased operating expenses as a result of the allocation of management s time and resources to the collection and work-out of the loan. In certain situations, where collection efforts are unsuccessful or acceptable work-out arrangements cannot be reached, we may have to charge-off the loan in whole or in part, or sell it at a discount. In such situations, we may acquire real estate or other assets, if any, that secure the loan through foreclosure or other similar available remedies, the amount owed under the defaulted loan may exceed the value of the assets acquired, and post-default remedies may be unavailable or unfeasible. 
 
 We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience, and we evaluate other factors including, among other things, current economic conditions. If our assumptions are incorrect, or if delinquencies or non-performing loans increase, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover probable and incurred losses inherent in our loan portfolio, which would require additions to our allowance, which could materially decrease our net income. Our allowance for loan losses was 0.87 of total loans and 172.52 of non-performing loans at December 31, 2022. 
 
 In addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and, based on their judgments and information available to them at the time of their review, may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. An increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities may reduce our net income and our capital, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 If our non-performing assets increase, our earnings will be adversely affected. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, our non-performing assets, which consist of non-performing loans and other real estate owned, were 7.8 million, or 0.38 of total assets. Our non-performing assets adversely affect our net income in various ways: 

we record interest income only on the cash basis or cost-recovery method for non-accrual loans and we do not record interest income for other real estate owned; 
 we must provide for expected loan losses through a current period charge to the provision for loan losses; 
 non-interest expense increases when we write down the value of properties in our other real estate owned portfolio to reflect changing market values; 
 there are legal fees associated with the resolution of problem assets, as well as carrying costs, such as taxes, insurance, and maintenance fees; and 
 the resolution of non-performing assets requires the active involvement of management, which can distract them from more profitable activity. 
 
 If additional borrowers become delinquent and do not pay their loans and we are unable to successfully manage our non-performing assets, our losses and troubled assets could increase significantly, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We are required to transition from the use of LIBOR. 
 
 We have material contracts that are indexed to the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR ). In 2017, the United Kingdom s Financial Conduct Authority, a regulator of financial services firms and financial markets in the United Kingdom, announced that the publication of LIBOR would not be guaranteed after 2021. LIBOR will be discontinued after June 30, 2023 and will impact loans that have not yet matured or been refinanced by that date. 
 
 35 

This announcement, and, more generally, financial benchmark reforms and changes in the interbank lending markets, have resulted in uncertainty about the interest rate benchmarks that will be used in the future. In the United States, efforts to identify a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rates have been ongoing, and the Alternative Reference Rate Committee formally recommended the use of a Secured Overnight Funding Rate SOFR ). The March 2022 enactment of the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act and the Federal Reserve s proposed implementing regulations are intended to address the discontinuation of LIBOR and establish a replacement benchmark, based on SOFR, that will automatically apply to agreements that rely on LIBOR and do not have an alternative contractual fallback benchmark. SOFR-based replacement benchmarks may also apply to contracts with fallback provisions that authorize a particular person to determine the replacement benchmark. 
 
 While the LIBOR Act and implementing regulations will help to transition legacy LIBOR contracts to a new benchmark rate, the substitution of SOFR for LIBOR may have potentially significant economic impacts on parties to affected contracts. SOFR is different from LIBOR in that it is a retrospective-looking secured rate rather than a forward-looking unsecured rate. These differences could lead to a greater disconnect between our and the Bank s costs to raise funds for SOFR as compared to LIBOR. In addition to the discontinuance of LIBOR, there may be future changes in the rules or methodologies used to calculate SOFR or other benchmarks, which may have a material adverse effect on the value of or return on our financial assets and liabilities that are based on or are linked to LIBOR and other benchmarks. Once LIBOR rates are no longer available, and we are required to implement replacement reference rates for the calculation of interest rates under our loan agreements with borrowers, we may incur significant expense in effecting the transition and we may be subject to disputes or litigation with our borrowers over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the replacement reference rates. The uncertainty related to these changes may have an unpredictable impact on the financial markets and could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Risks Related to Loan Underwriting 
 
 Adjustable-Rate Loans. While we anticipate that adjustable-rate loans will better offset the adverse effects of an increase in interest rates as compared to fixed-rate loans, an increased monthly payment required of adjustable-rate loan borrowers in a rising interest rate environment could cause an increase in delinquencies and defaults. The marketability of the underlying property also may be adversely affected in a high interest rate environment. In addition, although adjustable-rate loans make our asset base more responsive to changes in interest rates, the extent of this interest sensitivity is somewhat limited by the annual and lifetime interest rate adjustment limits on adjustable-rate residential real estate loans. To help minimize the risks associated with rising interest rates, and the subsequent risk of default, we often perform a stress analysis during underwriting. 
 
 Multi-Family and Non-Residential Real Estate Loans. Loans secured by non-residential and multi-family real estate generally have larger balances and involve a greater degree of risk than one-to-four family residential real estate loans. Of primary concern in non-residential real estate and multi-family lending is the borrower s creditworthiness and the feasibility and cash flow potential of the asset. Payments on loans secured by income producing properties often depend on the successful operation and management of the properties. As a result, repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy to a greater extent than residential real estate loans. To monitor cash flows on income properties, we generally require borrowers and loan guarantors, if any, to provide annual financial statements on commercial real estate and multi-family loans. In reaching a decision whether to make a non-residential real estate or multi-family loan, we consider the net operating income of the property, the borrower s expertise, credit history and profitability and the value of the underlying property. At times, we may also perform a global cash flow analysis of the borrower. We generally have required that the properties securing these real estate loans have debt service coverage ratios (the ratio of net operating income to debt service) of at least 1.25x. We require a Phase One environmental report on all commercial real estate loans in excess of 1.0 million or when we believe there is a possibility that hazardous materials may have existed on the site, or the site may have been impacted by adjoining properties that handled hazardous materials. Further in situations where environmental risks may be present, we utilize the services of an independent and qualified environmental consultant to assess any underlying risks. 

36 

Construction Loans. Our construction loans are based upon our estimates of costs to complete a project and the value of the completed project. Typically, said reviews are conducted by third party s approved by the bank. Underwriting is focused on the borrowers financial strength, credit history and demonstrated ability to produce a quality product and effectively market and manage its operations. 
 
 Construction lending involves additional risks when compared to permanent residential lending because funds are advanced upon the collateral of the project, which is of uncertain value before its completion. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, it is difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan-to-value ratio. In addition, generally during the term of a construction loan, interest may be funded by the borrower or disbursed from an interest reserve set aside from the construction loan budget. These loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property or obtain permanent take-out financing, rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest. If the appraised value of a completed project proves to be overstated, we may have inadequate collateral for the repayment of the loan upon completion of construction of the project and may incur a loss. We use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the value of any construction project of five or more units. Our ability to continue to originate a significant amount of construction loans is dependent on the strength of the general real estate market in our market areas. 
 
 Junior Liens and Consumer Loans. Consumer loans may entail greater risk than residential mortgage loans, as they can be unsecured, subordinately secured or secured by assets that depreciate rapidly. Repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan and a resulting deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. Consumer loan collections depend on the borrower s continuing financial stability, and therefore are likely to be adversely affected by various factors, including job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans. 
 
 Commercial and Industrial Loans. Unlike residential real estate loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower s ability to make repayment from his or her employment or other income, and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more readily ascertainable, commercial and industrial loans are of higher risk and typically are made on the basis of the borrower s ability to make repayment from the cash flows of the borrower s business and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Our commercial and industrial loans are originated primarily based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Most often, collateral for commercial and industrial loans consists of accounts receivable, inventory and/or equipment. Credit support provided by the borrower for most of these loans is based on the liquidation of the pledged collateral and enforcement of a personal guarantee. Furthermore, collateral securing such loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial and industrial loans may depend substantially on the success of the business itself. 
 
 Risks Related to Economic Conditions 
 
 Declines in value may adversely impact our investment portfolio . 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately 348.0 million in its investment portfolio, with 314.2 million designated as available for sale and 33.7 million designated as held to maturity. For securities available for sale, ASU 2016-13 requires entities to determine if impairment is related to credit loss or non-credit loss. If an assessment of the security indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security, and if the present value of cash flows is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance is created, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Held to maturity securities are evaluated under the allowance for credit losses model. Held to maturity securities are charged off against the allowance when deemed to be uncollectible and adjustments to the allowance are reported as a component of credit loss expense. If the credit loss 
 
 37 

expense is significant enough it could affect the ability of Blue Foundry Bank to upstream dividends to the Company, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to pay dividends to shareholders and could also negatively impact our regulatory capital ratios. 
 
 The geographic concentration of our loan portfolio and lending activities makes us vulnerable to a downturn in our local market area. 
 
 Our loan portfolio is concentrated primarily in New Jersey. This makes us vulnerable to a downturn in the local economy and real estate markets. Adverse conditions in the local economy such as unemployment, inflation, recession, a catastrophic event or other factors beyond our control could impact the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, which could impact our net interest income. Decreases in local real estate values caused by economic conditions, recent changes in tax laws or other events could adversely affect the value of the property used as collateral for our loans, which could cause us to realize a loss in the event of a foreclosure. Further, deterioration in local economic conditions could drive the level of loan losses beyond the level we have provided for in our allowance for loan losses, which in turn could necessitate an increase in our provision for loan losses and a resulting reduction to our earnings and capital. 
 
 A worsening of economic conditions in our market area could reduce demand for our products and services and/or result in increases in our level of non-performing loans, which could adversely affect our operations, financial condition and earnings 
 
 Local economic conditions have a significant impact on the ability of our borrowers to repay loans and the value of the collateral securing loans. A deterioration in economic conditions, especially local conditions, as a result of COVID-19 or otherwise, could have the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, and could more negatively affect us compared to a financial institution that operates with more geographic diversity: 

demand for our products and services may decline; 
 loan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures may increase; 
 collateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, thereby reducing customers future borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with existing loans; and 
 the net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us. 
 
 Moreover, a significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism, civil unrest, an outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic calamities, an epidemic or pandemic, unemployment or other factors beyond our control could further impact these local economic conditions and could further negatively affect the financial results of our banking operations. 
 
 Risks Related to Growth 
 
 A lack of liquidity could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Liquidity is essential to our business. We rely on our ability to gather deposits, make investments and effectively manage the repayment and maturity schedules of loans to ensure that there is adequate liquidity to fund our operations and pay our obligations. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale and maturities of loans and securities and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on liquidity. Our most important source of funds is deposits. Deposit balances can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments as providing a better risk/return tradeoff, which are strongly influenced by external factors such as changes in interest rates, local and national economic conditions, the availability and attractiveness of alternative investments, and perceptions of the stability of the financial services industry generally and of our institution specifically. Further, the demand for deposits may be reduced due to a variety of factors such as demographic patterns, changes in customer preferences, reductions in consumers disposable income, the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve, or regulatory actions that decrease customer access to particular products. If customers move 
 
 38 

money out of bank deposits and into other investments such as money market funds, we would lose a relatively low-cost source of funds, which would increase our funding costs and reduce net interest income. Any changes made to the rates offered on deposits to remain competitive with other financial institutions may also adversely affect profitability and liquidity. 
 
 Other primary sources of funds consist of cash flows from operations, maturities and sales of investment securities and borrowings from the FHLB of New York. We also have borrowing capacity through three correspondent banks and have the ability to participate in the Federal Reserve s new Bank Term Funding Program as needed. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our activities, or on terms that are acceptable, could be impaired by factors that affect us directly or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as disruptions in the financial markets, changes in the value of investment securities, negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry, a decrease in our business activity as a result of a downturn in markets, or adverse regulatory actions against us. 
 
 Any decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet expenses, or to fulfill obligations such as repaying borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Our business strategy includes growth, and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively. 
 
 Our business strategy includes growth in assets, deposits and the scale of our operations. Achieving our growth targets will require us to attract customers that currently bank at other financial institutions in our market, thereby increasing our share of the market, and to expand the size of our market area. Our ability to successfully grow will depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to attract and retain experienced bankers, the continued availability of desirable business opportunities, the competitive responses from other financial institutions in our market area and our ability to manage our growth. Growth opportunities may not be available or we may not be able to manage our growth successfully. If we do not manage our growth effectively, our financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected. 
 
 Building market share through de novo branching may cause our expenses to increase faster than revenues. 
 
 We are building market share by opening de novo branches in contiguous markets. There are considerable costs involved in de novo branching as new branches generally require time to generate sufficient revenues to offset their initial start-up costs, especially in areas in which we do not have an established presence. Accordingly, any new branch can be expected to negatively impact our earnings until the branch attracts a sufficient number of deposits and loans to offset expenses. We cannot assure you that new branches opened will be successful even after they have been established. 
 
 New lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks. 
 
 From time to time, we may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. In addition, we will continue to invest in research, development, and marketing for new products and services. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the development and introduction of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. Furthermore, if customers do not perceive our new offerings as providing significant value, they may fail to accept our new products and services. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, the burden on management and our information technology in introducing any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully 
 
 39 

manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Severe weather, acts of terrorism, geopolitical and other external events could impact our ability to conduct business. 
 
 Weather-related events have adversely impacted our market area in recent years, especially areas located near coastal waters and flood prone areas. Such events that may cause significant flooding and other storm-related damage may become more common events in the future. Financial institutions have been, and continue to be, targets of terrorist threats aimed at compromising operating and communication systems and the metropolitan New York area, including New Jersey, remain central targets for potential acts of terrorism. Such events could cause significant damage, impact the stability of our facilities and result in additional expenses, impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, reduce the value of collateral securing repayment of our loans, and result in the loss of revenue. While we have established and regularly test disaster recovery procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. Additionally, financial markets may be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of military conflict, including the Russia and Ukraine war, terrorism or other geopolitical events. 
 
 Risks Related to Competition 
 
 Strong competition within our market area may limit our growth and profitability. 
 
 Competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. In our market area, we compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. Some of our competitors have greater name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business, and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. Our smaller asset size also makes it more difficult to compete, as many of our competitors are larger and can more easily afford to invest in the marketing and technologies needed to attract and retain customers. In addition, larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we do, which could affect our ability to grow and remain profitable on a long-term basis. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area. If we must raise interest rates paid on deposits or lower interest rates charged on our loans, our net interest margin and profitability could be adversely affected. For additional information see Business of Blue Foundry Bank Competition. 
 
 The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of continuing legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued industry consolidation. Banks, securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking. Also, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services than we can as well as better pricing for those products and services. 
 
 Risks Related to Operations and Security 
 
 Public health emergencies, like the COVID-19 outbreak, may adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and capital levels. 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant economic dislocation in the United States and had a significant economic impact on the communities in which we operate, our borrowers and depositors, and the national economy generally, including curtailment of business activity, increased levels of unemployment, and supply chain disruptions in the markets in which we operate. Given the dynamic nature of the pandemic, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business. As a result of a public health emergency, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and the related adverse local and national consequences, and as a result of governmental, 
 
 40 

consumer and business responses to any outbreak, we may be subject to the following risks, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations: demand for our products and services may decline; if consumer and business activities are restricted, loan delinquencies, problem assets, and foreclosures may increase, resulting in increased charges and reduced income; collateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, which could increase loan losses; our allowance for credit losses may have to be increased if borrowers experience financial difficulties; a material decrease in net income or a net loss over several quarters could affect our ability to pay cash dividends; cyber security risks may be increased as the result of an increase in the number of employees working remotely; critical services provided by third-party vendors may become unavailable; government actions and vaccine mandates in response to the pandemic may affect our workforce, human capital resources and infrastructure; and we may experience staffing shortages and unanticipated unavailability or loss of key employees, harming our ability to execute our business strategy. 
 
 We face significant operational risks because the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions. 
 
 We operate in diverse markets and rely on the ability of our employees and systems to process a high number of transactions. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside our company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of our internal control systems and compliance requirements. Insurance coverage may not be available for such losses, or where available, such losses may exceed insurance limits. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of operational deficiencies or as a result of non-compliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, or customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. In the event of a breakdown in our internal control systems, improper operation of systems or improper employee actions, we could suffer financial loss, face regulatory action, and/or suffer damage to our reputation. 
 
 Cyber-attacks or other security breaches could adversely affect our operations, net income or reputation. 
 
 We regularly collect, process, transmit and store significant amounts of confidential information regarding our customers, employees and others and concerning our own business, operations, plans and strategies. In some cases, this confidential or proprietary information is collected, compiled, processed, transmitted or stored by third parties on our behalf. 
 
 Information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial and other transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber-attacks and mobile phishing. Mobile phishing, a means for identity thieves to obtain sensitive personal information through fraudulent e-mail, text or voice mail, is an emerging threat targeting the customers of financial entities. A failure in or breach of our operational or information security systems, or those of our third-party service providers, as a result of cyber-attacks or information security breaches or due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions could adversely affect our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and/or cause losses. 
 
 If this confidential or proprietary information were to be mishandled, misused or lost, we could be exposed to significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage, civil litigation and financial loss. 
 
 Although we employ a variety of physical, procedural and technological safeguards to protect this confidential and proprietary information from mishandling, misuse or loss, these safeguards do not provide absolute assurance that mishandling, misuse or loss of the information will not occur, and that if mishandling, misuse or loss of information does occur, those events will be promptly detected and addressed. Similarly, when confidential or proprietary information is collected, compiled, processed, transmitted or stored by third parties on our behalf, our policies and procedures require that the third party agree to maintain the confidentiality of the information, establish and maintain policies and procedures designed to preserve the confidentiality of the information, and permit us to 
 
 41 

confirm the third party s compliance with the terms of the agreement. As information security risks and cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. 
 
 Risks associated with system failures, interruptions, or breaches of security could negatively affect our earnings. 
 
 Information technology systems are critical to our business. We use various technology systems to manage our customer relationships, general ledger, securities, deposits, and loans. We have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of system failures, interruptions, and security breaches, but such events may still occur and may not be adequately addressed if they do occur. In addition, any compromise of our systems could deter customers from using our products and services. Although we rely on security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect the secure transmission of data, these precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of security. 
 
 In addition, we outsource a majority of our data processing to third-party providers. If these third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely affected. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel. 
 
 The occurrence of any system failures, interruptions, or breaches of security could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to litigation and possible financial liability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 The inability to stay current with technological change could adversely affect our business model. 
 
 Financial institutions continually are required to maintain and upgrade technology in order to provide the most current products and services to their customers, as well as create operational efficiencies. This technology requires personnel resources, as well as significant costs to implement. Failure to successfully implement technological change could adversely affect the Company s business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Our operations rely on certain third party vendors. 
 
 We rely on certain external vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain our day-to-day operations. These third party vendors are sources of operational and informational security risk to us, including risks associated with operational errors, information system interruptions or breaches and unauthorized disclosures of sensitive or confidential client or customer information. If these vendors encounter any of these issues, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, we could be exposed to disruption of operations, loss of service or connectivity to customers, reputational damage, and litigation risk that could have a material adverse effect on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 In addition, our operations are exposed to risk that these vendors will not perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements. While we have selected these external vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. The failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements, because of changes in the vendor s organizational structure, financial condition, support for existing products and services or strategic focus or for any other reason, could be disruptive to our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations. Replacing these external vendors could also entail significant delay and expense. 

42 

We depend on our management team, many of whom are new to the Bank, to implement our business strategy and execute successful operations and we could be harmed by the loss of their services. 
 
 We depend upon the services of the members of our senior management team to implement our business strategy and execute our operations. Over the last several years we have hired certain senior level management to implement the Bank s new focus and direction. Our future success will depend, to a significant extent, on the ability of our new management team to operate effectively, both individually and as a group. We must successfully manage issues that may result from the integration of the new members of our executive management. Members of our senior management team and lending personnel who have expertise and key business relationships in our markets could be difficult to replace. The loss of these persons or our inability to hire additional qualified personnel, could impact our ability to implement our business strategy and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our ability to compete. 
 
 Our cost of operations is high relative to our revenues. 
 
 Our non-interest expense totaled 52.8 million and 74.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We continue to analyze our expenses and achieve efficiencies where available. Although we strive to generate increases in both net interest income and non-interest income, our efficiency ratio remains high. For the year ended December 31, 2021, one-time expenses include an 11.2 million loss related to the withdrawal from the multi-employer defined-benefit pension plan and a 9.0 million contribution to the Blue Foundry Charitable Foundation. Our efficiency ratio was 96.82 and 164.37 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 The cost of additional finance and accounting systems, procedures and controls in order to satisfy our new public company reporting requirements will increase our expenses. 
 
 As a result of the completion of the stock offering, we became a public reporting company. We expect that the obligations of being a public company, including the substantial public reporting obligations, will require significant expenditures and place additional demands on our management team. We have made, and will continue to make, changes to our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and accounting systems to meet our reporting obligations as a public company. However, the measures we take may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations as a public company. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, starting with the second annual report that we would expect to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Any failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we may need to hire additional compliance, accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical knowledge, and we may not be able to do so in a timely fashion. As a result, we may need to rely on outside consultants to provide these services for us until qualified personnel are hired. These obligations will increase our operating expenses and could divert our management s attention from our operations. 
 
 We are a community bank and our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance. 
 
 We are a community bank and our reputation is one of the most valuable assets of our business. A key component of our business strategy is to rely on our reputation for customer service and knowledge of local markets to expand our presence by capturing new business opportunities from existing and prospective customers in our market area and contiguous areas. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, delivering superior service to our customers and caring about our customers. If our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees, by our inability to conduct our operations in a manner that is appealing to current or prospective customers, or otherwise, our business and operating results may be materially adversely affected. 

43 

Our risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and reducing the potential for significant losses. 
 
 Our risk management framework is designed to minimize risk and loss to us. We seek to identify, measure, monitor, report and control our exposure to risk, including strategic, market, liquidity, compliance and operational risks. While we use broad and diversified risk monitoring and mitigation techniques, these techniques are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or future development of currently unanticipated or unknown risks. Recent economic conditions and heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny of the financial services industry, among other developments, have increased our level of risk. Accordingly, we could suffer losses if we fail to properly anticipate and manage these risks. 
 
 Risks Related to Regulatory Matters 
 
 Changes in laws and regulations and the cost of regulatory compliance with new laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and/or increase our costs of operations. 
 
 We are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by our banking regulators. Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which a financial institution and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of insurance funds and the depositors and borrowers of Blue Foundry Bank rather than for the protection of our shareholders. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the ability to impose restrictions on our operations, classify our assets and determine the level of our allowance for credit losses. These regulations, along with the currently existing tax, accounting, securities, deposit insurance and monetary laws, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations, control the methods by which financial institutions conduct business, implement strategic initiatives, and govern financial reporting and disclosures. As a smaller institution, we are disproportionately affected by the ongoing increased costs of compliance with banking and other regulations. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, new regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations. Further, changes in accounting standards can be both difficult to predict and involve judgment and discretion in their interpretation by us and our independent accounting firm. These changes could materially impact, potentially retroactively, how we report our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We are subject to stringent capital requirements, which may adversely impact our return on equity, require us to raise additional capital, or restrict us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares. 
 
 Federal regulations establish minimum capital requirements for insured depository institutions, including minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios and define what constitutes capital for calculating these ratios. The regulations also establish a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 , effectively resulting in the following minimum ratios: (1) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0 , (2) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5 , and (3) a total capital ratio of 10.5 . An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, repurchasing its shares, and paying discretionary bonuses, if its capital levels fall below the buffer amount. 
 
 Increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders with respect to our environmental, social and governance practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks. 
 
 Companies are facing increasing scrutiny from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders related to their environmental, social and governance ESG practices and disclosure. Investor advocacy groups, investment funds and influential investors are also increasingly focused on these practices, especially as they relate to the environment, health and safety, diversity, labor conditions and human rights. Increased ESG-related compliance costs could result in increases to our overall operational costs. Failure to adapt to or comply with regulatory requirements or investor or stakeholder expectations and standards could negatively impact our reputation, ability to do business with certain partners, and our stock price. New government regulations could also result in new or more stringent forms of ESG oversight and expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence, and disclosure. 

44 

Non-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions. 
 
 The USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions, including restrictions on conducting acquisitions or establishing new branches. During the last year, several banking institutions have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. The policies and procedures we have adopted that are designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations may not be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations. 
 
 Changes in management s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and our financial condition or operating results. 
 
 In preparing the periodic reports we file under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), including our consolidated financial statements, our management is required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of specified dates. These estimates and assumptions are based on management s best estimates and experience at such times and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include our evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses, the determination of our deferred income taxes, and our fair value measurements. 
 
 Various factors may make takeover attempts more difficult to achieve. 
 
 Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and state and federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of Blue Foundry Bancorp without our Board of Directors' approval. Under regulations applicable to the conversion, for a period of three years following completion of our stock offering and related transactions in July 2021 , no person may acquire beneficial ownership of more than 10 of our common stock without prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. Under federal law, subject to certain exemptions, a person, entity or group must notify the Federal Reserve Board before acquiring control of a bank holding company. There also are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may be used to delay or block a takeover attempt, including a provision that prohibits any person from voting more than 10 of our outstanding shares of common stock. Furthermore, shares of restricted stock and stock options that we may grant to employees and directors, stock ownership by our management and directors, shares held by the employee stock ownership plan and other factors may make it more difficult for companies or persons to acquire control of Blue Foundry Bancorp without the consent of our Board of Directors. Taken as a whole, these statutory provisions and provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could result in our being less attractive to a potential acquirer and thus could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

 COVID Update 
 The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on the Company, its clients and the communities it serves. Given its dynamic nature, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. 
 
 Business Strategy 
 The Company s goal is to position ourselves to prosper in an evolving financial services landscape and enhance our position as one of the leading community banking institutions in our market. We intend to continue to provide a broad array of banking and other financial services to retail, commercial and small business customers while growing our presence in our markets and expanding our franchise. In recent years, we have focused on, and invested heavily in, our technology and infrastructure to improve our delivery channels and create competitive products and services, a strong workforce and an enhanced awareness of our banking brand in our market area. 
 
 As a result, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities available in our market by focusing on the following core strategies. 
 
 Repositioning our Business Mix: Focus on building commercial and small-business relationships. We focus on understanding our customers and potential customers financial needs and providing a wide variety of high-quality products and solutions through a collaborative approach that intends to create long-term relationships. Our goal is to continue to evolve from a traditional savings bank focusing on residential lending to a full-service commercial bank with an emphasis on providing products and services to commercial and small businesses in our market area. We believe pursuing this strategy will allow us to both grow and diversify our business mix while providing us with the best opportunities to drive strong financial returns. We intend to pursue these commercial relationships through the lending, retail branch, and the retail business development personnel that we have recruited and continue to recruit, who have the experience and relationships necessary to build this business as well as through cultural changes that have been made across the organization that emphasize our goal of pursuing this strategy. Further, our investment in technology is intended to facilitate the delivery of consumer and business solutions without the need for traditional sales channels. 
 
 We are approved by the SBA to provide loans under the 7(a) Loan Program, the SBA s most common loan program. We believe providing 7(a) loans as well as traditional commercial and industrial loans and lines of credit will allow us to provide needed funding to our business communities, which will increase deposits. These borrowers often also keep deposits at their loan providers. 
 
 Growing our Business: Developing new customer relationships and deepening existing relationships. We seek to expand our market share in existing and contiguous markets by leveraging our distinctive brand and delivering high-quality solutions through a collaborative, relationship-based approach. Our relationship-based approach has enabled us to achieve disciplined organic growth, and we expect this trend to continue. Building our customer relationships around low and no cost products is part of our relationship expansion strategy. Our Blue products, including Blue Axis Checking, Blue Axis Connect , Blue Axis Savings, Blue Axis Edge Savings, Blue Axis Club Savings, Blue Carbon Business Checking. Blue Carbon Edge Business Checking, Blue Carbon Business Money Market, and Blue Carbon Business Savings, are designed to be low cost to the consumer or business, while providing us with lower interest rate deposits. Our consumer deposit products are designed to be easy to open in person or online. Our commercial deposit products include many features without fees that would customarily be charged. 

48 

Leverage technology to enhance customer experience and drive operating efficiencies. We have made significant investments in our technology infrastructure to deliver high-quality, innovative products and services to our customers. For example, we continue to enhance our mobile banking platform for both consumer and commercial customers. New services, such as Early Pay, same day ACH, and sweep functionality, continue to be introduced to increase convenience and meet evolving customer financial needs. In addition, we have invested in our new commercial lending origination system and platform, and we intend to continue to improve our consumer lending origination platform. We are committed to continue investing in technology and data analytics. We believe these investments will differentiate us with our target customers, which will generate significant operating leverage as we grow. 
 
 Continuing to invest and optimize our facilities and expand our branch network through selective de novo branching. We have been enhancing and optimizing both our facilities and branch network. We have optimized our branch footprint though the utilization of a new forward-thinking branch model and intend to continue this strategy in 2023 to broaden our existing branch network by expanding into new markets and extending our geographic footprint. In 2022, we opened a new branch in Hoboken, continuing our strategy of operating in high density areas with vibrant commercial corridors and main streets. Additionally, we renovated three existing locations, modernizing their appearance and upgrading their functionalities. New branches feature modern design elements focused on open and efficient use of space. 
 
 Branch efficiency has been built into our locations. All branches currently employ new multifunction automated teller machines that are designed to be compatible with new services as they become available. Further, all branches utilize teller cash recycling machines to further enhance efficiency. 
 
 Pursue opportunistic acquisitions and partnerships. We intend to prudently pursue opportunities to acquire banks in our existing and contiguous markets that create attractive financial returns. Our focus will primarily be on franchises that enhance our funding profile, product capabilities or geographic density, while maintaining an acceptable risk profile. We believe the vital need to make increasingly significant technological investments has greatly amplified the importance of scale in banking. In addition, we believe that the current economic climate will increase the rate of consolidation in the banking industry. We will evaluate potential partnerships with FinTech companies or other fee income generating businesses that align with our business strategy and are consistent with our desire to stay ahead of technological developments that we believe will continue to cause the banking industry to evolve. 

Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 Certain of our accounting policies are important to the presentation of our financial condition, since they require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances. Facts and circumstances that could affect these judgments include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rates, changes in the performance of the economy and changes in the financial condition of borrowers. The Company has identified the allowance for loan losses and income taxes to be a critical accounting policy. These accounting policies and our significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8.

Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 
 
 General . Net income was 2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to a net loss of 36.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was driven by an increase of 8.9 million in net interest income and by the absence in the 2022 period of non-recurring expenses incurred in 2021 consisting of the establishment of a 16.7 million valuation allowance on the Company s deferred tax assets, an 11.2 million loss related to the withdrawal from the multi-employer defined-benefit pension plan, a 9.0 million contribution of cash and common stock of the Company to the Blue Foundry Charitable Foundation, and 2.2 million in debt extinguishment costs. 
 
 Interest Income. Interest income increased 6.4 million, or 11.3 , to 62.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 56.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was due to an increase of 3.6 million in interest income from loans and an increase of 2.9 million in interest income from cash and securities. The average balance of securities and loans increased 89.1 million and 132.6 million, respectively, while the average balance of cash decreased 267.8 million. Interest income and average balances of loans for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the 2021 period increased due to growth in the multifamily and non-residential mortgage portfolios. The yield on average interest-earning assets increased 40 basis points to 3.28 for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 2.88 for the year ended December 31, 2021. PPP fees recognized in interest income totaled 568 thousand and 2.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 Interest Expense . Interest expense decreased 2.5 million, or 19.3 , to 10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 13.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in interest expense was driven by a decrease of 2.1 million in interest expense on deposits, coupled with a decrease of 388 thousand in interest expense on borrowings. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits and FHLB advances decreased 61.6 million and 45.4 million, respectively. A decrease of 197.4 million in the average balance of higher cost time deposits partially offset by an increase of 135.8 million in the average balance of interest-bearing core deposits (checking, savings and money market accounts) drove a 12 basis point decrease in the cost of total deposits and a 8 basis point decrease in the cost of funds. The cost of average interest-bearing liabilities decreased 12 basis points to 0.72 for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 0.84 for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 
 Net Interest Income and Margin. For the year ended December 31, 2022 net interest income was 51.8 million, an increase of 8.9 million or 20.7 , compared to 42.9 million for same period in 2021. 
 
 Net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by 53 basis points to 2.73 from 2.20 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The yield on average interest earning assets increased by 40 basis points as cash was invested into higher yielding loans and securities during the year ended December 31, 2022 while the overall cost of average interest bearing liabilities decreased 12 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 
 Provision for Loan Losses . Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations to establish an allowance for loan losses at a level necessary to absorb potential losses inherent in our loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonably estimable at the date of the consolidated financial statements. In evaluating the level of the allowance for loan losses, management analyzes several qualitative loan portfolio risk factors including, but not limited to, management s ongoing review and grading of loans, facts and issues related to specific loans, historical loan loss and delinquency experience, trends in past due and non-accrual loans, existing risk characteristics of specific loans or loan pools, the fair value of underlying collateral, current economic conditions and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses. 
 
 After an evaluation of these factors, the Company recorded a release of provision for loan losses of 1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to a release of 2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The release for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to shifts in the loan portfolio driven 
 
 50 

by declines in balances within the construction portfolio partially offset by growth in the multifamily and non-residential portfolios and a generally improving economic environment, as well as improved credit metrics and low net charge-offs. 
 
 2022 and 2021 saw continued strengthening of credit quality, as seen in the declining delinquency rates and balances of non-performing loans. Total non-performing loans decreased by 4.2 million to 7.8 million at December 31, 2022 compared to 12.0 million at December 31, 2021. 
 
 Non-interest Income . Non-interest income of 2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 represented an increase of 184 thousand, or 7.4 , from 2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The fluctuations in non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2022 were primarily related to loan prepayment fee activity. Prepayment fees increased 239 thousand to 982 thousand from 743 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2022. Additionally, fees earned from point of sale transactions totaled 502 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 476 thousand for the 2021 period, income from bank owned life insurance totaled 490 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 476 thousand for the 2021 period, and overdraft fees recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022 totaled 255 thousand compared to 234 thousand for the 2021 period. Beginning in November 2022, the Company ended its practice of charging overdraft fees to customers. 
 
 Non-interest Expense . Non-interest expense was 52.8 million, a decrease of 21.9 million driven by the absence in 2022 of non-recurring expenses of: a 11.2 million loss on pension withdrawal, a 9.0 million charitable contribution, and 2.2 million in debt extinguishment costs. Excluding these non-recurring items, non-interest expense increased 464 thousand. An increase of 3.5 million in compensation and benefits costs was driven by salary increases, hiring of additional staff, an increase in cash incentive compensation expense, and costs associated with equity grants made under the shareholder-approved equity incentive plan. In addition, the costs associated with being a public company increased 1.0 million in 2022. These increases were partially offset by a reduction of 1.3 million in advertising and 1.2 million in data processing, and a lower provision for commitments and letters of credit of 1.0 million. 
 
 Income Tax Expense . For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded income tax expense of 338 thousand compared to 9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The effective tax rate of 12.4 reflects the reversal of the valuation allowance from the usage of the federal and state net operating loss deferred tax assets to the extent permissible. The Company had previously established and continues to maintain a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets. Although the Company had a loss before income tax in the prior year, the tax expense recorded in that year reflects the impact of the initial recognition of the full valuation allowance on the Company s deferred tax assets.

Analysis of Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income represents the difference between income on interest-earning assets and expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income depends on the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the rates of interest earned on such assets and paid on such liabilities. 
 
 Average Balances and Yields. The following table presents information regarding average balances of assets and liabilities, the total dollar amounts of interest income and dividends from average interest-earning assets, the total dollar amounts of interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities, and the resulting annualized average yields and costs. The yields and costs for the periods indicated are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balances of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods presented. Average balances have been calculated using daily balances. Non-accrual loans are included in average balances only. Loan origination fees are included in interest income on loans and are not material.

 (1) Average loan balances are net of deferred loan fees and costs, premiums and discounts, and includes non-accrual loans. 
 (2) Net interest rate spread represents the difference between the yield on interest-earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. 
 (3) Net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets.

Rate/Volume Table 
 
 The following table sets forth the effects of changing rates and volumes on net interest income. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The net column represents the sum of the prior columns. Changes attributable to changes in both rate and volume that cannot be segregated have been allocated proportionally based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume. There were no out-of-period items or adjustments excluded from this table. 

Years Ended December 31, 2022 vs. 2021

Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 
 
 Total Assets. Total assets increased 129.1 million to 2.04 billion at December 31, 2022 from 1.91 billion at December 31, 2021. During 2022, the Company utilized liquidity raised in the 2021 public offering to continue growing its balance sheet through loan production. 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents . Cash and cash equivalents decreased 152.3 million, or 78.7 , to 41.2 million at December 31, 2022 from 193.4 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was due to the deployment of cash primarily into higher yielding loans and securities. 
 
 Securities Available-For-Sale . Securities available-for-sale decreased 10.6 million, or 3.3 , to 314.2 million at December 31, 2022 from 324.9 million at December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2022, purchases of securities were more than offset by the fair value decline in the portfolio, as well as amortization and calls. The rising rate environment in the second half of 2022 contributed to a 37.3 million decline in the net unrealized position of the portfolio. No securities were sold during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 
 Securities Held-To-Maturity . Securities held-to-maturity increased 10.4 million, or 44.8 , to 33.7 million at December 31, 2022 from 23.3 million at December 31, 2021. The increase is due to purchases of corporate bonds in 2022. 

53 

Other investments. Other investments increased 5.9 million, or 57.8 , to 16.1 million at December 31, 2022 from 10.2 million at December 31, 2021. The increase is related to the purchases of Federal Home Loan Bank of New York stock made in conjunction with borrowings in the second half of 2022. 
 
 Gross Loans . Gross loans held for investment increased 261.1 million, or 20.37 , to 1.542 billion at December 31, 2022 from 1.281 billion at December 31, 2021. The most significant drivers were net increases in multifamily and non-residential loans. Multifamily loans increased 175.0 million, non-residential real estate loans increased 74.8 million, and residential loans increased 33.5 million. Originations totaled 488.2 million, including originations of 285.4 million in multifamily loans, 128.7 million in non-residential real estate loans, and 44.1 million in construction loans. In addition, 106.1 million of conforming residential mortgages in New Jersey were purchased during the period. 
 
 The following table presents loans allocated by loan category: 
 
 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (In thousands) Residential one-to-four family 594,521 560,976 Multifamily 690,278 515,240 Non-residential 216,394 141,561 Construction and land 17,990 23,419 Junior liens 18,477 18,464 Commercial and industrial (1) 4,682 21,563 Consumer and other 38 87 Total gross loans 1,542,380 1,281,310 Deferred fees, costs and premiums and discounts, net 2,747 6,299 Total loans 1,545,127 1,287,609 Allowance for loan losses (13,400) (14,425) Loans receivable, net 1,531,727 1,273,184 
 (1) At December 31, 2022 and 2021, PPP loans totaled 477 thousand and 16.8 million, respectively, net of unearned deferred fees. 
 
 The table below presents the balance of non-performing assets on the dates indicated: 
 
 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (In thousands) Residential one-to-four family 7,498 10,805 Multifamily 182 139 Non-residential 857 Construction and land Junior liens 52 182 Commercial and industrial (1) 35 Total 7,767 11,983 Other real estate owned Total non-performing assets 7,767 11,983 
 (1) PPP loans 90 days past due and accruing totaled 61 thousand and 116 thousand at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These PPP loans were not reported in non-performing loans as they carry the federal guarantee of the SBA. 

54 

Other Assets. Other assets increased 13.6 million, or 158.0 , to 22.2 million at December 31, 2022 from 8.6 million at December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily driven by the increase in fair value of the Company s interest rate swap agreements. See Note 10, Derivatives, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8- Financial Statements. 
 
 Total Deposits. Total deposits increased 41.8 million or 3.4 to 1.29 billion at December 31, 2022 compared to 1.25 billion at December 31, 2021 as the Company executed its strategy to allow high-cost time deposits to mature. Time deposits decreased 57.5 million, or 12.1 , to 416.3 million with a weighted average rate of 1.79 at December 31, 2022 from 473.8 million with a weighted average rate of 0.58 at December 31, 2021. The decrease in time deposits was partially offset by an increase in checking, savings, and money market accounts. These accounts increased 99.4 million, or 12.85 , to 872.6 million at December 31, 2022 from 773.2 million at December 31, 2021. This shift resulted in the ratio of core deposits to total deposits increasing from 62.0 at December 31, 2021 to 67.7 at December 31, 2022. 
 
 The following table presents the totals of deposit accounts by account type, at the dates shown below: 
 
 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (In thousands) Non-interest bearing deposits 37,907 44,894 NOW and demand accounts (1) 
 410,937 363,419 Savings (1) 
 423,758 364,932 Time deposits 416,260 473,795 Total Deposits 1,288,862 1,247,040 
 (1) Money market accounts are included within the NOW and demand accounts and Savings captions. 
 
 Borrowings. The Company had 310.5 million of borrowings at December 31, 2022, an increase of 125.0 million, or 67.4 , from 185.5 million at December 31, 2021. The increase is related to the execution of short-term borrowings during the second half of 2022 to support loan growth. Our borrowings consisted solely of Federal Home Loan Bank of New York advances. 109.0 million of which are associated with longer-dated swap agreements. See Note 10, Derivatives, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8- Financial Statements. 
 
 Total Shareholders Equity. Total shareholders equity decreased by 35.8 million, or 8.3 , to 393.7 million at December 31, 2022 compared to 429.5 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily driven by a 24.3 million reduction in accumulated other comprehensive income reflecting the net impact that the interest rate environment had on the Company s available-for-sale securities and the swap agreements used in its cash flow hedges. The Company also repurchased 1,298,762 of its shares at a cost of 15.6 million. 299,481 of the shares repurchased were used to fund the shareholder-approved restricted stock grants. These decreases were partially offset by net income of 2.4 million. 

55 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short-term and long-term nature. Our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows, loan repayments, maturities and sales of securities, borrowings from the FHLB and securities sold under agreements to repurchase. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows, calls of investment securities and borrowed funds and prepayments on loans are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. Additionally, deposit flows are impacted by general deposit behavior. Our primary use of funds is for the origination and purchase of loans and the purchase of securities. 
 
 Management regularly adjusts our investments in liquid assets based upon an assessment of (1) expected loan demand, (2) expected deposit flows, (3) yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities, and (4) the objectives of our interest-rate risk and investment policies. 
 
 The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the NJDOBI and the FDIC. At December 31, 2022, the Bank exceeded all applicable regulatory capital requirements, and was considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines. See Item 1. Business Supervision and Regulation Federal Banking Regulation Capital Requirements and Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 The Bank has entered into derivative financial instruments to reduce risk associated with interest rate volatility by matching repricing terms of assets and liabilities. These derivatives had an aggregate notional amount of 109.0 million as of December 31, 2022. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, we had outstanding commitments to originate loans of 8.0 million and unused lines of credit of 80.0 million. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet our current loan origination commitments. Certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from December 31, 2022 totaled 294.9 million. Management expects, based on historical experience, that a substantial portion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits is not retained, we may utilize FHLB advances or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense. Available borrowing capacity at December 31, 2022 was 328.1 million with FHLB. We also had a 30.0 million available line of credit with a correspondent bank and a 2.5 million available line of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at December 31, 2022. Additionally, almost all of the Bank s investment securities are unencumbered and could be used as collateral for additional borrowing capacity. 
 
 We are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to originate loans, unused lines of credit and standby letters of credit, which involve elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. Our exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of the instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments that we do for on-balance sheet instruments. Management believes that our current sources of liquidity are more than sufficient to fulfill our obligations as of December 31, 2022 pursuant to off-balance-sheet arrangements and contractual obligations. 
 
 Blue Foundry Bancorp is a separate legal entity from Blue Foundry Bank and must provide for its own liquidity to fund dividend payments, stock repurchases, and other corporate risk factors. The Company s primary source of liquidity is issuance of stock and the receipt of dividend payments from the Bank in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2022, Blue Foundry Bancorp (unconsolidated) had liquid assets of 98.5 million.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Qualitative Analysis . Our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk because, as a financial institution, the majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Therefore, a principal part of our operations is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of our financial condition and results of operations to changes in market interest rates. Our ALCO/Investment Committee, which consists of members of management, is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate, given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the policy and guidelines approved by our Board of Directors. We currently utilize a third-party modeling program, prepared on a quarterly basis, to evaluate our sensitivity to changing interest rates, given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. 
 
 We have sought to manage our interest rate risk in order to minimize the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates. We have implemented the following strategies to manage our interest rate risk: growing target deposit accounts; utilizing our investment securities portfolio and interest rate swaps as part of our balance sheet asset and liability and interest rate risk management strategy to reduce the impact of movements in interest rates on net interest income and economic value of equity, which can create temporary valuation adjustments to equity in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income; continuing the diversification of our loan portfolio by adding more commercial loans, which typically have shorter maturities and/or balloon payments. 
 
 By following these strategies, we believe that we are better positioned to react to increases and decreases in market interest rates. 
 
 Other than cash flow hedging on interest expense, we generally do not engage in hedging activities such as engaging in futures or options, or investing in high-risk mortgage derivatives such as collateralized mortgage obligation residual interests, real estate mortgage investment conduit residual interests or stripped mortgage-backed securities. 
 
 The Bank has entered into derivative financial instruments to reduce risk associated with interest rate volatility by matching repricing terms of assets and and liabilities. These derivatives had an aggregate notional amount of 109.0 million as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. Most tenors of LIBOR will cease being published on June 30, 2023, although some tenors ceased at the end of 2021. The Bank has not been materially impacted by the partial LIBOR cessations on December 31, 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee has proposed that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to USD-LIBOR for use in financial contracts that are currently indexed to USD-LIBOR. The Company has approximately 11.1 million in loans, 24.6 million in investments and 109.0 million notional of derivatives which are indexed to USD-LIBOR for which it is monitoring the activity and assessing the related risks. The Company is monitoring and developing transition plans to address potential revisions to documentation, as well as customer management and communication, internal training, financial, operational and risk management implications, and legal and contract management. When LIBOR rates are no longer available and we are required to implement substitute indices for the calculation of interest rates, we may incur expenses in effecting the transition, we may suffer a loss in the conversion to a new rate because the new rate may not be equal to what we were being paid on the LIBOR rate, and may be subject to disputes or litigation with customers and security holders over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute indices, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 
 Quantitative Analysis. We compute amounts by which the net present value of our cash flow from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates. The net present value NPV analysis estimates the change in the NPV of assets and liabilities and off- 
 
 57 

balance sheet contracts over a range of immediate rate shock interest rate scenarios. This model uses a discounted cash flow analysis and an option-based pricing approach to measure the interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value. The model estimates the economic value of each type of asset, liability and off-balance sheet contract under the assumption that the United States Treasury yield curve increases or decreases instantaneously by 100 to 200 basis points in 100 basis point increments. A basis point equals one-hundredth of one percent, and 100 basis points equals one percent. An increase in interest rates from 3 to 4 would mean, for example, a 100-basis point increase in the Basis Point Change in Interest Rates column below. 
 
 The following table sets forth, at December 31, 2022, the calculation of the estimated changes to the Bank s net interest income, at the Bank level, that would result from the specified immediate changes in the United States Treasury yield curve. For purposes of this table, 100 basis points equals 1 .

 The table above indicates that at December 31, 2022, in the event of an instantaneous 100 basis point increase in interest rates, we would experience a 33 decrease in NPV. In the event of an instantaneous 100 basis point decrease in interest rates, we would experience a 30 increase in NPV. 
 
 Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. The above tables assume that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the date indicated remains constant uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the table provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, the data does not reflect any actions we may take in response to changes in interest rates. In addition, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our NPV and will differ from actual results.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.

Leases and Lease Obligations 
 years, some of which include renewal or termination options to extend the lease for up to years. The Company s leases do not include residual value guarantees or covenants. The Company includes lease extension and termination options in the lease term if, after considering relevant economic factors, it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise the option. In addition, the Company has elected to account for any non-lease components in its real estate leases as part of the associated lease component. The Company has also elected not to recognize leases with original lease terms of 12 months or less (short-term leases) on the Company s balance sheet. 
 
 Leases are classified as operating or finance leases at the lease commencement date. Lease expense for operating leases and short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets ROU and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of lease payments over the lease term. 
 
 The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement to calculate the present value of lease payments when the rate implicit in a lease is not known. The Company s incremental borrowing rate is based on the FHLB advance rate, adjusted for the lease term and other factors. 
 
 Bank Owned Life Insurance 

Income Taxes 
 million. 
 
 The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance for the amount of the deferred tax asset that is more likely than not to be realized. 
 
 A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test, no tax benefit is recorded.

The increase in the number of securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2022 was due to higher current market interest rates compared to rates at December 31, 2021. Of the available for sale securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2022, are comprised of U.S. Government agency obligations, Treasury notes, and mortgage-backed securities.

There were also municipal bonds, investment grade corporate bonds and asset-backed securities in an unrealized loss position. The Company does not consider these securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired due to the decline in fair value being attributable to changes in interest rates and liquidity, not credit quality. The Company also does not intend to sell these securities, nor does it foresee being required to sell them before the anticipated recovery (maturity).

 The portfolio classes in the above table have unique risk characteristics with respect to credit quality: 
 
 Payment on multifamily and non-residential mortgages is driven principally by operating results of the managed properties or underlying business and secondarily by the sale or refinance of such properties. Both primary and secondary sources of repayment, and value of the properties in liquidation, may be affected to a greater extent by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy in general. 
 Properties underlying construction loans often do not generate sufficient cash flows to service debt and thus repayment is subject to ability of the borrower and, if applicable, guarantors, to complete development or construction of the property and carry the project, often for extended periods of time. As a result, the performance of these loans is contingent upon future events whose probability at the time of origination is uncertain. 
 Commercial and industrial C I loans include C I revolvers, term loans, SBA 7a loans and to a lesser extent, PPP loans. Payment on C I loans are driven principally by the cash flow of the business and secondarily by the sale or refinance of any collateral securing the loan. Both the cash flow and value of the collateral in liquidation may be affected by adverse general economic conditions. 
 The ability of borrowers to service debt in the residential one-to-four family, junior liens and consumer loan portfolios is generally subject to personal income which may be impacted by general economic conditions, such as increased unemployment levels. These loans are predominately collateralized by first and second liens on single family properties. If a borrower cannot maintain the loan, the Company s ability to recover against the collateral in sufficient amount and in a timely manner may be significantly influenced by market, legal and regulatory conditions.

The Company is not committed to lend any additional amounts to customers with outstanding loans that are classified as TDRs as of December 31, 2022.

 401(k) Plan 
 The Company has a savings plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, which covers substantially all employees upon employment who have attained the age of 18. Under the plan, employee contributions are partially matched by the Company at its sole discretion. Company contributions for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were thousand and thousand, respectively. 
 
 SERPs, Directors Plan and Other Postretirement Benefits Plan 
 The Company maintains an Executive Supplemental Income Retirement Plan SERP for certain employees and a Director Retirement Plan DRP ). As the SERP and DRP plans are unfunded, there are no plan assets associated with these plans. During 2022, the DRP plan was amended to curtail the plan to the current participants and to establish fixed payments to the participant in the plan. 
 
 The Company provides certain health insurance benefits for retired employees and directors meeting plan eligibility requirements. Effective January 1, 2019, the employee postretirement health benefit plan was curtailed, leaving only retired participants and beneficiaries remaining in the plan. Active participants who met certain requirements received payments in lieu of future benefits. The plans are unfunded as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the obligation is included in other liabilities as an accrued postretirement benefit cost.

Shares are released for allocation to participants as loan payments are made. Loan payments are principally funded by discretionary cash contributions by the Bank, as well as dividends, if any, paid to the ESOP on unallocated shares. When loan payments are made, ESOP shares are allocated to participants at the end of the plan year (December 31) based on relative compensation, subject to federal tax law limits. Participants receive the shares at the end of employment. Dividends on allocated shares, if any, increase participants accounts. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, the principal balance on the ESOP loan is million. Contributions to the ESOP during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, totaled thousand and million, respectively.

 Restricted shares granted under the Equity Plan generally vest in equal installments, over a service period between five and beginning from the date of grant. Additionally, certain restricted shares awarded can be performance vesting awards, which may or may not vest depending upon the attainment of certain corporate financial targets. The vesting of the awards accelerate upon death, disability or an involuntary termination at or following a change in control. The product of the number of shares granted and the grant date closing market price of the Company s common stock determine the fair value of restricted shares under the Equity Plan. Management recognizes compensation expense for the fair value of restricted shares on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. 
 
 Stock options granted under the Equity Plan generally vest in equal installments, over a service period between five and beginning from the date of grant. The vesting of the options accelerate upon death, disability or an involuntary termination at or following a change in control. Stock options were granted at an exercise price equal to the fair value of the Company s common stock on the grant date based on the closing market price and have an expiration period of years. 
 
 The fair value of stock options granted are estimated utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The weighted average assumptions used for the options granted during the year ended December 31, 2022 are: expected life of years years, risk-free rate of , volatility of and a dividend yield of . Due to the limited historical information of the Company s stock, management considered the weighted historical volatility of the Company and similar entities for an appropriate period in determining the volatility rate used in the estimation of fair value. The expected life of the stock option was estimated using the simplified method. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The Company recognizes compensation expense for the fair values of these awards, which have graded vesting, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards. Upon exercise of vested options, management expects to draw on treasury stock as the source for shares.

 Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing deferred tax assets. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred over the three-year period ended December 31, 2022. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as our projections for future growth. 
 
 On the basis of this evaluation, for the year ended December 31, 2022, a valuation allowance of million has been maintained. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income increased or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth. Net deferred tax assets are included in other assets.

The Company also had New Jersey net operating loss carryforwards of million, the majority of which expire in years. We believe it is more likely than not the benefit from both the federal and state NOL carryforwards will not be realized. In recognition of this risk, we have provided a valuation allowance of million on the deferred tax assets related to the NOL carryforwards. The Company contributed million to the Blue Foundry Charitable Foundation in 2021, and the deferred benefit has a year carryforward limitation. 
 
 Retained earnings at December 31, 2022 and 2021, includes approximately million, for which no provision for income tax has been made. This amount represents an allocation of income to bad debt deductions for tax purposes only. Events that would result in taxation of these reserves include the failure to qualify as a bank for tax purposes, distributions in complete or partial liquidation, stock redemptions and excess distributions to stockholders. 
 
 The Company and its subsidiary are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as state income taxes, primarily New Jersey. The Company is no longer subject to examination by Federal taxing authorities for tax years before January 1, 2019, and State taxing authorities for tax years before January 1, 2018. Currently, the Company is not under examination by any taxing authority. The Company's New Jersey state tax returns for the tax years ended December 31, 2015 through 2018 were audited during 2021. The completion of this examination did not have a material impact on the Company's effective tax rates and financials. 

On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was signed into legislation. The Act includes provisions that extend the expanded Affordable Care Act health plan premium assistance program through 2025, impose an excise tax on stock buybacks, increase funding for IRS tax enforcement, expand energy incentives, and impose a corporate minimum tax. The Corporation has evaluated such provisions and determined that the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 on the income tax provision and deferred tax assets of 12/31/2022 was not material.

Other Fair Value Disclosures 
 
 Fair value estimates, methods and assumptions for the Company s financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis are set forth below. 
 
 Securities held-to-maturity : The Company s debt securities held-to-maturity portfolio is carried at amortized cost. The fair values of debt securities held-to-maturity are provided by a third-party pricing service. The pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or a variety of other forms of analysis, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates, prepayment speeds and non-binding broker quotes. 
 
 Loans, net : Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics. Loans are segregated by type such as residential mortgage and consumer. Each loan category is further segmented into fixed and adjustable rate interest terms and by performing and non-performing categories. Estimated fair value of loans is determined using a discounted cash flow model that employs an exit discount rate that reflects the current market pricing for loans with similar characteristics and remaining maturity, adjusted for estimated credit losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date. 
 
 Time Deposits : The fair value of time deposits is based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows. The discount rate is estimated using rates for currently offered deposits of similar remaining maturities.

 These instruments involve elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The Company uses the same credit policies and collateral requirements in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet loans. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since the commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company has no exposure to credit loss if the customer does not exercise its rights to borrow under the commitment. The Company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower. 
 
 The Company issues financial standby letters of credit that are within the scope of ASC 460, Guarantees . These are irrevocable undertakings of the Company to guarantee payment of a specified financial obligation. Most of the Company s standby letters of credit arise in connection with lending relationships and generally have terms of one year or less, or are issued in lieu of security deposits. The maximum potential future payments the Company could be required to make equals the contract amount of the standby letters of credit.

 Service Charges on Deposit Accounts : The Company earns fees from its deposit customers for transaction-based, account maintenance, and overdraft services. Transaction based fees, which include services such as ATM use fees, stop payment charges, statement rendering, and ACH fees, are recognized at the time the transaction is executed as that is the point in the time the Company fulfills the customer s request. Account maintenance fees, which relate primarily to monthly maintenance, are earned over the course of a month, representing the period over which the Company satisfies the performance obligation. Overdraft fees were recognized at the point in time the overdraft occurred. Beginning in November 2022, the Company ended its practice of charging overdraft fees to customers. Service charges on deposits are withdrawn from the customer s account balance. 
 
 Interchange Income : The Company earns interchange fees from debit/credit cardholder transactions conducted through a payment network. Interchange fees from cardholder transactions represent a percentage of the underlying transaction value and are recognized daily, concurrently with the transaction processing services provided to the cardholder. 
 
 Gain/loss on sale of Real Estate Owned REO : The Company records a gain or loss from the sale of REO when control of the property transfers to the buyer, which generally occurs at the time of an executed deed. When the Company finances the sale of REO to the buyer, the Company assesses whether the buyer is committed to perform its obligations under the contract and whether collectability of the transaction price is probable. Once these criteria are met, the REO asset is derecognized and the gain or loss on sale is recorded upon the transfer of control of the property to the buyer. In determining the gain or loss on the sale, the Company may adjust the transaction price and related gain (loss) on sale if a significant financing component is present.

Exhibit 10.5 

 11. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS 
 The Bank shall require any successor or assignee, whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise, to all or substantially all the business or assets of the Bank, expressly and unconditionally to assume and agree to perform the Bank s obligations under this Agreement, in the same manner and to the same extent that the Bank would be required to perform if no such succession or assignment had taken place. 
 12. TAX WITHHOLDING. 
 The Bank may withhold from any amounts payable to the Executive hereunder all federal, state, local or other taxes that the Bank may reasonably determine are required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation (it being understood that the Executive is responsible for payment of all taxes in respect of the payments and benefits provided herein). 
 
 13. APPLICABLE LAW 
 (a) In no event will the Bank (or any affiliate) be obligated to make any payment pursuant to this Agreement that is prohibited by Section 18(k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (codified at 12 U.S.C. sec. 1828(k)), 12 C.F.R. Part 359, or any other applicable law. 
 (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that a payment or benefit described in this Agreement constitutes non-qualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code, and to the extent that the payment or benefit is payable upon the Executive s termination of employment, then the payments or benefits will be payable only upon the Executive s Separation from Service. For purposes of this Agreement, a Separation from Service will have occurred if the Bank and the Executive reasonably anticipate that either no further services will be performed by the Executive after the Date of Termination (whether as an employee or as an independent contractor) or the level of further services performed is less than 50 percent of the average level of bona fide services in the 36 months immediately preceding the termination. For all purposes hereunder, the definition of Separation from Service shall be interpreted consistent with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h)(ii). 
 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Executive is a Specified Employee (i.e., a key employee of a publicly traded company within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations issued thereunder) and any payment under this Agreement is triggered due to the Executive s Separation from Service, then solely to the extent necessary to avoid penalties under Section 409A of the Code, no payment shall be made during the first six (6) months following the Executive s Separation from Service. Rather, any payment that would otherwise be paid to the Executive during that six-month period will be accumulated and paid to the Executive in a lump sum on the first day of the seventh month following the Executive s Separation from Service. All subsequent payments shall be paid in the manner specified in this Agreement. 
 (d) Each payment pursuant to this Agreement is intended to constitute a separate payment for purposes Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2).
