New tires are sold under highly competitive conditions throughout the world. On a worldwide basis, we have two major competitors: Bridgestone (based in Japan) and Michelin (based in France). Other significant competitors include Continental, Hankook, Kumho, Nexen, Pirelli, Sumitomo, Toyo, Yokohama and various regional tire manufacturers. 
 We compete with other tire manufacturers on the basis of product design, performance, price and terms, reputation, warranty terms, customer service and consumer convenience. Goodyear, Cooper and Dunlop branded tires enjoy a high recognition factor and have a reputation for performance and product design. The Kelly, Mastercraft, Roadmaster, Debica, Sava and Fulda brands and various house brand tire lines offered by us, and tires manufactured and sold by us to private brand customers, compete primarily on the basis of value and price. 
 We do not consider our tire businesses to be seasonal to any significant degree.

 Our products sold in the United States are subject to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards FMVSS promulgated and enforced by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA ), which has established various standards and regulations applicable to tires sold in the United States and tires sold in a foreign country that are identical or substantially similar to tires sold in the United States. NHTSA has the authority to order the recall of automotive products, including tires, having a defect related to motor vehicle safety or that do not comply with a motor vehicle safety standard. In addition, the Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability, and Documentation Act (the TREAD Act imposes numerous reporting requirements with respect to the early warning reporting of warranty claims, property damage claims, and bodily injury and fatality claims. The FMVSS also require tire manufacturers to comply with rigorous tire testing standards. Compliance with these regulations has increased the cost of producing and distributing tires in the United States.

 GENERAL BUSINESS INFORMATION 
 Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 
 The principal raw materials used by Goodyear are synthetic and natural rubber. Synthetic rubber accounted for approximately 50 of all rubber consumed by us in 2022. Our plants located in Beaumont and Houston, Texas supply a major portion of our global synthetic rubber requirements. We purchase all of our requirements for natural rubber in the world market. 
 Other important raw materials and components we use are carbon black, steel cord, fabrics and petrochemical-based commodities. Substantially all of these raw materials and components are purchased from independent suppliers, except for certain chemicals we manufacture. We purchase most raw materials and components in significant quantities from several suppliers, except in those instances where only one or a few qualified sources are available. Increased demand for consumer products and supply chain disruptions as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and other global events, including the conflict in Ukraine, has led to inflationary cost pressures, including higher costs for certain raw materials, higher transportation costs and higher energy costs. We anticipate the continued availability of raw materials and components we will require during 2023, subject to spot shortages and unexpected disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters, such as hurricanes, or other events. 
 Substantial quantities of fuel and other petrochemical-based commodities are used in the production of tires, synthetic rubber and other products. Supplies of such fuels and commodities have been and are expected to continue to be available to us in quantities sufficient to satisfy our anticipated requirements, subject to spot shortages. 
 Human Capital Management 
 At December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 74,000 full-time and temporary associates throughout the world, including approximately 42,000 associates covered under collective bargaining agreements. Approximately 5,700 of our associates in the 
 5 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 United States are covered by a new master collective bargaining agreement between Goodyear and the United Steelworkers USW ), which was ratified in the second half of 2022 and expires in July 2026. Approximately 2,300 of our associates at our Texarkana and Findlay plants in the United States are covered by separate collective bargaining agreements with the USW, which expire in June 2024 and February 2024, respectively. In addition, approximately 800 of our associates in the United States are covered by other contracts with the USW and various other unions. Approximately 21,000 of our associates outside of the United States are covered by union contracts that currently have expired or that will expire in 2023, primarily in Germany, Poland, China, Mexico, Slovenia, France and Turkey. Unions represent a major portion of our associates in the United States and Europe. 
 We continue to experience increased labor-related costs and manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the ongoing tight labor supply, particularly in the U.S. To address this issue, we have accelerated hiring as necessary, increased training capacity and started to adjust future investment plans to consider not just the cost, but also the availability of qualified workers. 
 Engaging and enabling our associates to realize their full potential is one of our core strategies. This starts with attracting top diverse talent and is followed by fostering inclusion, promoting equity through global inclusive leader training, offering opportunities for skill and career development, supporting health and wellness, providing a safe and healthy workplace, making a positive impact in our communities, and expecting our associates to know and comply with our compliance and ethics policies. 
 Talent Management Our associates are the driving force behind our success. They underpin every aspect of our strategy and help us deliver value to our customers, shareholders and communities. We provide integrated talent management and learning solutions aimed at enabling our associates to reach their full personal and professional potential at Goodyear. We are guided by our talent strategy which focuses on talent attraction, talent development and talent engagement and retention. An example of how we attract talent is through campus recruiting into our intern and job rotational programs utilized by several of our functional teams. We offer a number of tools for talent development including the Goodyear Learning Center, which is our in-house collection of online courses available to all associates. In our manufacturing plants, one of the pillars of our plant optimization efforts is Continuous Skills Development, which focuses on developing problem-solving and decision-making skills. 
 Diversity and Inclusion A diverse workforce is critical to our long-term success. Embracing and valuing differences allows us to attract top talent, improve associate satisfaction and engagement, foster innovation, and meld varying experiences and perspectives to drive enhanced customer service, business creativity and decision-making. Our goal is to create a work environment where people have a real sense of belonging and are able to thrive. Our commitment is reflected in the policies that govern our workforce, such as our Business Conduct Manual and Global Zero Tolerance policy and is evidenced in our recruiting strategies, succession planning, diversity and inclusion training and Employee Resource Groups ERGs ), which are key to our inclusion efforts. Our ERGs provide associates access to coaching, mentoring and professional development, and include ADAPT (Abled and Disabled Associates Partnering Together), Goodyear Asia India Middle East (AIM), Goodyear Black Network, Goodyear Veterans Association, Goodyear Women s Network, Goodyear Pride Network, HOLA (Hispanic/Latino) and Next Generation Leaders. 
 Health and Wellness Our wellness initiatives take a holistic view of associate health, including physical, emotional, financial and social health, to enable our associates to thrive and bring their best selves to work each day. Goodyear strives to be at the forefront of corporate wellness, and that goal is the driver behind our GoodLife wellness program, which fosters a culture of wellness for all Goodyear associates and their families. To meet the needs of our diverse workforce and their dependents, we offer varying robust benefits packages for our full-time and part-time associates globally. 
 Workforce Safety and Wellness Our vision is to have the safest operations in the world. We have established a goal of eliminating all serious injuries and fatalities in our workplace. To reduce the risk of serious injuries we invest in systems that enable us to receive reliable and structured data to enable decision making. We also work to improve our industrial hygiene to prevent work-related illness from noise and the substances used in the manufacturing process and we focus on ergonomics using a six-step problem-solving process to reduce injuries and maximize workplace performance. 
 Community Engagement Collaborating with community organizations energizes our associates and helps us build a better future. Our global strategy and efforts are an extension of our business and are aimed at safe mobility, inspiring students to reach their full potential and reducing our environmental impacts. We encourage our associates to participate in our Global Week of Volunteering. 
 Compliance and Ethics To Act with Integrity is a core component of our global strategy. Each associate is responsible for acting with honesty, integrity and respect every day and everywhere we do business. Our Business Conduct Manual guides our Board of Directors, executive team and all associates globally. We require our global salaried associates to complete training annually on our Business Conduct Manual and periodically on subjects such as workplace respect (including discrimination and harassment), financial integrity, privacy and data protection, competition law, anti-corruption and anti-bribery, and being a compliance leader.

 Patents and Trademarks 
 We own approximately 1,800 product, process and equipment patents issued by the United States Patent Office and approximately 4,900 patents issued or granted in other countries around the world. We have approximately 500 applications for United States patents pending and approximately 800 patent applications on file in other countries around the world. While such patents and patent applications as a group are important, we do not consider any patent or patent application to be of such importance that the loss or expiration thereof would materially affect Goodyear or any business segment. 
 We own, control or use approximately 1,600 different trademarks, including several using the word Goodyear, the word Dunlop or the word Cooper. Approximately 9,300 registrations and 300 pending applications worldwide protect these trademarks. While such trademarks as a group are important, the only trademarks we consider material to our business, or to the business of any of our segments, are those using the word Goodyear or the word Cooper, and with respect to certain of our international business segments, those using the word Dunlop. We believe our trademarks are valid and most are of unlimited duration as long as they are adequately protected and appropriately used. 
 Compliance with Government Regulations 
 We are subject to extensive regulation under environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations worldwide. These laws and regulations relate to, among other things, air emissions, discharges to surface and underground waters, the generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste materials and hazardous substances, and workplace safety and health. We have several continuing programs designed to ensure compliance with foreign, federal, state and local environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations. We expect capital expenditures for pollution control facilities and occupational safety and health projects to be approximately 60 million in both 2023 and 2024. 
 We also incur ongoing expenses to maintain and operate our pollution control facilities and conduct our other environmental activities, including the control and disposal of hazardous substances. These expenditures are expected to be sufficient to comply with existing environmental laws and regulations and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive position. In the future, we may incur increased costs and additional charges associated with environmental compliance and cleanup projects necessitated by the identification of new waste sites, the impact of new environmental laws and regulatory standards, or the availability of new technologies. Compliance with foreign, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations in the future may require a material increase in our capital expenditures and could adversely affect our earnings and competitive position. 
 In addition, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include import and export laws, anti-competition laws, anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, data privacy laws such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation GDPR ), tax laws, and accounting, internal control and disclosure requirements. 
 Refer to Description of Goodyear s Business Americas and Description of Goodyear s Business Europe, Middle East and Africa included in this Item 1, Business for information regarding compliance with government regulations in each of those segments.

 Climate Change and Sustainability 
 In 2021, we announced our climate ambition, which includes our goal to reach net-zero scope 1 and 2 and certain scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, aligned with the Science-Based Targets initiative SBTi and its Net-Zero Standard. We also announced our commitment to achieve near-term science-based targets by 2030, including reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 46 and certain scope 3 emissions by 28 , as compared to 2019. Our climate ambition includes several other important long-term sustainability goals, including our commitments to use all renewable energy in our manufacturing facilities and processes by 2040, replace all petroleum-derived oils in our products by 2040 and develop a tire made of 100 sustainable materials by 2030. 
 Climate considerations are driving change in the transportation sector. Advanced forms of mobility, such as electric vehicles, ride sharing and fleets, autonomous vehicles and connected vehicles, have the potential to reduce vehicle emissions and energy use. Companies in the transportation sector are setting ambitious climate goals that require the support of the entire supply chain to achieve. 
 We have established a robust process that uses internal and external insights to identify, assess and report climate-related risks and opportunities. 
 The move to a low-carbon economy creates growth opportunities within the tire industry that we are well positioned to leverage through our continued innovation. We have a proven track record of producing tires for electric and autonomous vehicles, developing tires and rubber compounds that contribute to reduced greenhouse gas emissions by lowering rolling resistance and reducing tire weight, and providing fleet solution services that promote fuel efficiency. We maintain strong relationships with our supply chain partners which, coupled with our global scale, can be leveraged to either avoid or minimize climate-related supply chain disruptions. 
 Climate change poses risks that could adversely impact our operations, including risks related to our plans to continue to develop and supply the types of products, services and technologies requested by consumers. Such risks also include an increase in severe weather events that could temporarily disrupt our operations or supply chain or the operations of our customers and the cost of compliance associated with increased climate-related regulations globally, including increased disclosure obligations or being subject to carbon taxes or similar mechanisms in the European Union or the emergence of such programs in other countries. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of these and our other risk factors. 
 Federal, state, local and foreign governments and regulatory agencies continue to consider various options and measures to control greenhouse gas emissions in response to climate change. We strive to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, carefully monitor our energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions, and set company-wide and facility-specific goals to reduce our operational impacts. As part of our commitment to reduce our operational impact, we continue to focus on reducing energy consumption and emissions in our factories and utilizing renewable energy sources. We achieved our previously announced goal to procure 100 renewable electricity across all of our facilities in Europe and Turkey by the end of 2022. 
 We continue to focus on the resiliency of our supply chain by developing alternative, more sustainable material sources and increasing our use of more sustainable materials that deliver either the same or enhanced product quality and performance. We also select suppliers that uphold fair working conditions, use sustainable harvesting practices and share our values. Our technology teams work to investigate and incorporate new technologies and materials, including renewable and recycled materials, that reduce our value chain greenhouse gas emissions. An example is our use of rice husk ash as an alternative to traditional silica. 
 In early 2023, we announced the release of a demonstration tire with 90 sustainable materials that is approved for road use. The development of this tire signals great progress toward our goal of developing a 100 sustainable-material tire by 2030.

 ITEM 1A. R ISK FACTORS. 
 You should carefully consider the risks described below and other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K when considering an investment decision with respect to our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also impair our business operations. Any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur. If they do, our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity could be materially adversely affected. In such an instance, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you might lose all or part of your investment. 
 Risks Related to the Cooper Tire Acquisition 
 We may not achieve all of the intended benefits of the acquisition of Cooper Tire and our integration efforts may disrupt our current plans or operations. 
 Although we are on track to achieve the expected synergies from the Cooper Tire acquisition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully complete the integration of Cooper Tire s operations and assets or otherwise realize the remaining expected benefits of the acquisition (including additional operating and other cost synergies). We expect to continue our efforts to integrate Cooper Tire during the first half of 2023. Difficulties in integrating Cooper Tire and Goodyear may result in Goodyear performing differently than expected, in operational challenges, in the failure to realize or sustain anticipated run-rate cost synergies and efficiencies in the expected timeframe or at all, or in the difficulty or failure of utilizing our available U.S. tax attributes, in which case the Cooper Tire acquisition may not be accretive to earnings per share, may not improve our balance sheet position, may not enhance our ability to delever, and may not generate additional free cash flow due to reduced cash tax payments. The continued integration of the two companies may result in material challenges, including the diversion of management s attention from ongoing business concerns; retaining key management and other employees; retaining or attracting business and operational relationships; the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process and associated expenses; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations; coordinating geographically separate organizations; unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems; as well as potential unknown liabilities or unforeseen expenses or delays relating to integration. 
 Risks Related to Operations 
 Our results of operations and financial condition have been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or similar public health crises, and that impact may be material. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and continues to cause, volatility in the global economy, the tire industry and our business. In response to the pandemic, international, federal, state and local public health and governmental authorities took extraordinary actions to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 throughout most regions of the world, including travel bans, quarantines, stay-at-home orders and similar mandates that caused many individuals to substantially restrict their daily activities and many businesses to curtail or cease normal operations, and they may take additional or further actions in the future. 
 The tire industry has been negatively impacted by this evolving situation. In 2020, there was a sudden and sharp decline in replacement tire demand and original equipment manufacturers suspended or severely limited automobile production globally. Recovery in automobile production globally has been constrained by supply chain disruptions, including an insufficient availability of semiconductor chips, caused by COVID-19 and a variety of global factors. 
 The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or similar public health crises, may result in decisions to change future production levels based on an evaluation of market demand signals, inventory and supply levels, as well as our ability to continue to safeguard the health of our associates. We have experienced, and may experience in the future, unexpected delays or obstacles, such as disruptions in our and our customers' supply chains or government mandates, that may hamper our ability to achieve planned production levels. Due to national and local efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 and its related variants in certain countries, such as China, renewed stay-at-home orders and other restrictions on mobility required us to temporarily shut down or limit production at some of our facilities, including our facilities in Pulandian and Kunshan, China, at various times throughout 2022. Any suspension of production at our manufacturing facilities, or difficulties or inefficiencies in resuming or increasing production, is likely to adversely impact our future results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and that impact may be material. In addition, our ability to continue implementing important strategic initiatives and capital expenditures may be reduced as we devote time and other resources to responding to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic or similar public health crises.

 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operating and financing activities. Our cash flows from operating activities are driven primarily by our operating results and changes in our working capital requirements and our cash flows from financing activities are dependent upon our ability to access credit or other capital. If the COVID-19 pandemic becomes more pronounced in markets where we operate, our liquidity position may deteriorate. While we actively monitor our liquidity and took a number of actions aimed at mitigating the negative consequences of the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our cash flows and liquidity, our cash flows may decline if global economic activity declines or we are unable to have sufficient access to credit or other capital. For example, the borrowing base under our first lien revolving credit facility is dependent, in significant part, on our eligible accounts receivable and inventory, which would decline if our sales and production levels declined. Additionally, our European revolving credit facility contains a leverage ratio covenant applicable to Goodyear Europe B.V. and its subsidiaries. While we are currently in compliance with this covenant, if we were unable to satisfy this covenant in the future or obtain a waiver from our lenders, we would no longer be able to access our 800 million European revolving credit facility or our pan-European accounts receivable securitization facility. 
 The situation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic remains fluid. The full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity will depend on future developments, such as the ultimate duration and scope of the pandemic, resurgence in COVID-19 cases, travel restrictions, government mandated restrictions and regulations, business and workforce disruptions, the impact on demand for our products, the effectiveness of actions taken to contain and treat the disease, including the efficacy of and ability to widely distribute vaccinations and therapeutics, and whether the pandemic leads to recessionary conditions in any of our key markets. Accordingly, the ultimate impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity cannot be determined at this time. To the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, it may also have the effect of significantly heightening many of the other risks associated with our business, operations and indebtedness. 
 If we do not successfully implement our strategic initiatives, our operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected. 
 We are pursuing important strategic initiatives, such as our innovation excellence, sales and marketing excellence and operational excellence initiatives. Our innovation excellence initiatives are designed to create leading technologies, products and services that anticipate the mobility and sustainability needs of consumers and fleets. Our sales and marketing excellence initiatives are intended to capture the value of our brands and grow our market share, helping our customers win in their markets and ensuring we are the preferred choice of consumers. Our operational excellence initiatives are aimed at improving our safety, quality and efficiency and creating an advantaged supply chain that delivers the right tire, to the right place, at the right time, at the right cost. If we fail to execute these initiatives successfully or if the assumptions used in developing the initiatives vary significantly from actual conditions, we may fail to achieve our financial goals. 
 We believe that our manufacturing footprint is less cost-competitive than that of our principal competitors. To begin to address this competitive disadvantage, we are curtailing production of tires for declining, less profitable segments of the tire market (including closure of our Melksham, United Kingdom tire manufacturing facility) and undertaking significant capital investments in building, expanding and modernizing certain manufacturing facilities around the world to strengthen the competitiveness of our manufacturing footprint and increase production of premium, large-rim diameter consumer tires. The failure to implement successfully this or our other important strategic initiatives may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. 
 Our performance is also dependent on our ability to improve the volume and mix of higher margin tires we sell in our targeted market segments. In order to do so, we must be successful in developing, producing, marketing and selling products that consumers desire and that offer higher margins to us. Shifts in consumer demand away from higher margin tires could materially adversely affect our business. We have been capacity constrained from time to time with respect to the production of certain higher margin tires, particularly in the United States. When faced with these constraints, we try to alleviate them by utilizing our global manufacturing footprint to meet the demand for our tires and by adding manufacturing capacity. However, in spite of these initiatives, we may not be able to meet all of the demand for certain of our higher margin tires, which could harm our competitive position and limit our growth. 
 We cannot assure you that our strategic initiatives will be successful. If not, we may not be able to achieve or sustain future profitability, which would impair our ability to meet our debt and other obligations and would otherwise negatively affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. 
 We face significant global competition and our market share could decline. 
 New tires are sold under highly competitive conditions throughout the world. We compete with other tire manufacturers on the basis of product design, performance, price and terms, reputation, warranty terms, customer service and consumer convenience. On a worldwide basis, we have two major competitors, Bridgestone (based in Japan) and Michelin (based in France), that have 
 12 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 large shares of the markets of the countries in which they are based and are aggressively seeking to maintain or improve their worldwide market share. Other significant competitors include Continental, Hankook, Kumho, Nexen, Pirelli, Sumitomo, Toyo, Yokohama and various regional tire manufacturers. Our competitors produce significant numbers of tires in low-cost countries, and have announced plans to further increase their production capacity in countries around the globe. Increasingly, our competitors are making decisions on where to produce tires based not only on production cost, but in combination with total delivery cost, supply chain reliability and sustainability considerations. These increases in production capacity may result in even greater competition in the United States and elsewhere. 
 Our ability to compete successfully will depend, in significant part, on our ability to continue to innovate and manufacture the types of tires demanded by consumers, and to reduce costs by such means as reducing excess and high-cost capacity, leveraging global purchasing, improving productivity, eliminating redundancies and increasing production at low-cost supply sources. If we are unable to compete successfully, our market share may decline, materially adversely affecting our results of operations and financial condition. 
 In addition, the automotive industry may experience significant changes due to the introduction of new technologies, such as electric and autonomous vehicles, or new services, business models or methods of travel, such as ride sharing. As the automotive industry evolves, we may need to provide a wider range of products and services to remain competitive, including products that we do not currently have the capability to manufacture or services that we do not currently offer. The demand for our products may also decline if automotive production declines and/or total vehicle miles traveled declines, including as a result of increasing fuel costs. If we do not accurately predict, prepare for and respond to market developments, technological innovations and changing customer and consumer needs and preferences, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 
 Our capital expenditures may not be adequate to maintain our competitive position and may not be implemented in a timely or cost-effective manner. 
 Our capital expenditures are limited by our liquidity and capital resources and by the need to pay our other expenses and to maintain adequate cash reserves and borrowing capacity to meet unexpected demands that may arise. We believe that our ratio of capital expenditures to sales is lower than the comparable ratio for our principal competitors. 
 Productivity improvements and manufacturing cost improvements may be required to offset potential increases in labor and raw material costs, including inflationary increases, and competitive price pressures. In addition, as part of our strategy to reduce high-cost and excess manufacturing capacity and to increase our capacity to produce higher margin tires, we may need to modernize or expand our facilities. We may also need to make additional capital expenditures in order to achieve our global climate ambition and related goals. We are currently undertaking significant construction, expansion and modernization projects globally. 
 We may not have sufficient resources to implement planned capital expenditures with minimal disruption to our existing manufacturing operations, or within desired time frames and budgets. Any disruption to our operations, delay in implementing capital improvements or unexpected costs may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 If we are unable to make sufficient capital expenditures, or to maximize the efficiency of the capital expenditures we do make, we may be unable to achieve productivity improvements, which may harm our competitive position, to manufacture the products necessary to compete successfully in our targeted market segments, or to achieve our global climate ambition and related goals. In addition, plant construction and modernization may temporarily disrupt our manufacturing operations and lead to temporary increases in our costs. 
 A prolonged economic downturn or economic uncertainty could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 Deterioration of global or regional economic conditions, including recession, financial instability, inflation, labor shortages or energy availability and costs (including fuel surcharges), could negatively impact our business and our results of operations. A prolonged economic downturn can adversely affect OE production levels and consumer spending habits on replacement tires, resulting in lower-than-expected net sales. Inflation, which has risen significantly, has and may continue to increase our operational costs, including labor, transportation and energy costs, and continued increases in interest rates in response to concerns about inflation may have the effect of further increasing economic uncertainty or creating recessionary economic conditions. As a result, instability and weakness of the U.S. and global economies, including due to recession, inflation, high unemployment, disruptions to financial markets, geopolitical events and other effects caused directly or indirectly by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the corresponding negative effects on consumer spending, may materially negatively affect our business and results of operations.

 Raw material, energy and transportation costs may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. 
 Raw material, energy and transportation costs can be volatile. Inflationary cost pressures, among other factors, may cause increases in the prices of natural and synthetic rubber, carbon black and petrochemical-based commodities. Market conditions, including actions by competitors, or contractual obligations may prevent us from passing any such increased costs on to our customers through timely price increases. Additionally, increased demand for consumer products and supply chain disruptions as a result of the pandemic and other global events, including port congestion and container shortages, has led to inflationary cost pressures on transportation. Higher raw material, energy and transportation costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure. High demand for and/or limited availability of raw materials and other energy sources could result in declining margins and operating results and adversely affect our financial condition. The volatility of raw material costs may cause our margins, operating results and liquidity to fluctuate. In addition, lower raw material costs may put downward pressure on the price of tires, which could ultimately reduce our margins and adversely affect our results of operations. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate sources of raw materials, energy or transportation, its operations could be interrupted. In addition, fluctuations in the price of gasoline for consumers can affect driving and purchasing habits and impact demand for tires. 
 If we fail to extend or renegotiate significant collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions as they expire from time to time, or if our unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption, our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. 
 We are a party to collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions, which represent a significant number of our employees, including our collective bargaining agreements with the USW. The new Goodyear agreement with the USW, which covers approximately 5,700 of our associates in the United States at December 31, 2022, was ratified in the second half of 2022 and expires in July 2026. Approximately 2,300 of our associates at our Texarkana and Findlay plants in the United States at December 31, 2022 are covered by separate collective bargaining agreements with the USW, which expire in June 2024 and February 2024, respectively. In addition, approximately 21,000 of our associates outside of the United States are covered by union contracts that have expired or are expiring in 2023, primarily in Germany, Poland, China, Mexico, Slovenia, France and Turkey. Although we believe that our relations with our associates are satisfactory, no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements as they expire from time to time. If we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements, if disputes with our unions arise, or if our unionized workers engage in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption, we could experience a significant disruption of, or inefficiencies in, our operations or incur higher labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 
 Our international operations have certain risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. 
 We have manufacturing and distribution facilities throughout the world. Our international operations are subject to certain inherent risks, including: 
 exposure to local economic conditions; 

adverse foreign currency fluctuations; 

adverse currency exchange controls; 

withholding taxes and restrictions on the withdrawal of foreign investment and earnings; 

tax policies and regulations; 

labor regulations; 

tariffs; 

government price and profit margin controls; 

expropriations of property; 

adverse changes in the diplomatic relations of foreign countries with the United States; 

the potential instability of foreign governments; 

hostility from local populations and insurrections or armed conflicts; 

risks of renegotiation or modification of existing agreements with governmental authorities; 

export and import restrictions; and 

14 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 other changes in laws or government policies. 

The likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable. Certain regions, including Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, are inherently more economically and politically volatile and, as a result, our business units that operate in these regions could be subject to significant fluctuations in sales and operating income from quarter to quarter. Because a significant percentage of our operating income in recent years has come from these regions, adverse fluctuations in the operating results in these regions could have a significant impact on our results of operations in future periods. 
 In addition, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include import and export laws, anti-competition laws, anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, data privacy laws such as the GDPR, labor laws, tax laws, and accounting, internal control and disclosure requirements. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal fines, penalties and sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our reputation, business and results of operations. In certain foreign jurisdictions, there is a higher risk of fraud or corruption and greater difficulty in maintaining effective internal controls and compliance programs. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies or applicable laws and regulations. 
 Russia s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting government sanctions could result in significant macroeconomic consequences, including increased inflationary pressures, market volatility, economic restrictions and business disruptions, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 While it remains challenging to operate our business in Ukraine, we were able to resume shipments of tires into the country on a limited basis during the second quarter of 2022 and to expand our shipments during the second half of the year. In addition, we previously suspended all shipments of tires to Russia during the first quarter of 2022 and approved the discontinuation of our Russian operations in January 2023. These actions have not had and are not expected to have a direct material impact on our financial results. Nonetheless, the ongoing conflict has aggravated already challenging macroeconomic trends, including global supply chain disruptions, higher costs for certain raw materials and higher energy and transportation costs. The conflict has led to increases in the cost of energy and the potential for energy shortages, especially in Europe. We have taken steps to offset the increased cost, but we cannot predict the degree to or the time period over which energy costs will increase. 
 In response to Russia s invasion in Ukraine, a number of countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom and members of the European Union, have implemented economic sanctions on Russia and certain Russian enterprises and individuals. The conflict could result in further sanctions and embargoes, regional instability and potential retaliatory action by the Russian government, including cyber-attacks. While we continue to take actions to ensure the safety of our associates and the continuity of our business operations, the extent of the conflict s impact on the global economy cannot be predicted. 
 Financial difficulties, work stoppages, supply disruptions or economic conditions affecting our major customers, dealers or suppliers could harm our business. 
 The tire industry has been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 2020 was characterized by a sudden and sharp decline in replacement tire demand and original equipment manufacturers suspending or severely limiting automobile production globally; the industry is still recovering. In addition, supply chain issues impacted new vehicle production throughout 2021 and 2022. As a result of these factors, automotive vehicle production and global tire industry demand continues to be difficult to predict. 
 Although sales to our OE customers accounted for approximately 15 of our net sales in 2022, demand for our products by OE customers and production levels at our facilities are impacted by automotive vehicle production. Automotive production and sales are highly cyclical and sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors, such as credit availability, interest rates, fuel prices, and consumer preference and confidence. Economic declines that result in a significant reduction in automotive production would have an adverse effect on our sales to OE customers. We may experience future declines in sales volume due to declines in new vehicle production and sales, the performance, discontinuation or sale of certain OE brands, platforms or programs, increased competition, or weakness in the demand for replacement tires, which could result in us incurring under-absorbed fixed costs at our production facilities or slowing the rate at which we are able to recover those costs. At various times, some regions around the world may be more particularly impacted by these factors than other regions. 
 Automotive production can also be affected by the ongoing pandemic, labor relation issues or shortages, financial difficulties or supply disruptions. Our OE customers could experience production disruptions resulting from their own or supplier labor, 
 15 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 financial or supply difficulties, or from government actions to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of COVID-19. Such events may cause an OE customer to reduce or suspend vehicle production. Other customers, such as dealers, retailers or distributors, may experience similar disruptions to their operations. As a result, a customer could halt or significantly reduce purchases of our products, which would harm our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We cannot predict when customers will decide to increase or decrease inventory levels or whether new inventory levels will approximate historical inventory levels. Uncertainty and other unexpected fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. 
 Our suppliers could also experience production disruptions due to the ongoing pandemic or labor, financial, supply or transportation difficulties, or new environmental laws or stricter enforcement of existing environmental laws. Any such production disruptions may result in the unexpected closure of our suppliers' facilities or increases in the cost of our raw materials, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 In addition, the bankruptcy, restructuring or consolidation of one or more of our major customers, dealers or suppliers could result in the write-off of accounts receivable, a reduction in purchases of our products or a supply disruption to our facilities, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 
 If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially adversely affected. 
 Our business substantially depends on the continued service of key members of our management. The loss of the services of a significant number of members of our management could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, such as engineering, marketing and senior management professionals. Competition for these employees is intense, and we could experience difficulty from time to time in hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support our business. Our ability to attract and retain employees may also be hampered by downturns in the automotive and tire industries, which could result in reduced payments under our incentive compensation plans, as well as by greater competition due to the increase in use of remote working environments. If we do not succeed in retaining our current employees and attracting new high quality employees, our business could be materially adversely affected. 
 Increasing competition for highly skilled and talented workers, as well as labor shortages, could adversely affect our business. 
 A number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us or increase labor costs, including high employment levels and government regulations. Although we have not experienced any material labor shortages to date, we have observed an increasingly competitive labor market. The increasing competition for highly skilled and talented employees has resulted, and could in the future result, in higher compensation costs and could result in difficulties in maintaining a capable workforce. If we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of performing at a high-level, or if mitigation measures we may take to respond to a decrease in labor availability, such as overtime and third-party outsourcing, have unintended negative effects, our business could be adversely affected. A sustained labor shortage, lack of skilled labor, increased turnover or labor cost inflation, caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or as a result of general macroeconomic factors, could lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees, which could negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our manufacturing and distribution facilities and overall business and have other adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 We have substantial fixed costs and, as a result, our operating income fluctuates disproportionately with changes in our net sales. 
 We operate with significant operating and financial leverage. Significant portions of our manufacturing, selling, administrative and general expenses are fixed costs that neither increase nor decrease proportionately with sales. In addition, a significant portion of our interest expense is fixed. There can be no assurance that we would be able to reduce our fixed costs proportionately in response to a decline in our net sales and therefore our competitiveness could be significantly impacted. As a result, a decline in our net sales could result in a higher percentage decline in our income from operations and net income. 
 Environmental issues, including climate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address environmental issues, may negatively affect our business and operations and cause us to incur significant costs. 
 Our manufacturing and distribution facilities are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations designed to protect the environment, including increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change, and we expect that additional requirements with respect to environmental matters, including reporting requirements, will be imposed on us in the future. In addition, we have contractual 
 16 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 indemnification obligations for environmental remediation costs and liabilities that may arise relating to certain divested operations. 
 There is also growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that issues related to such climate change have a negative effect on our business, we may be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain raw materials, including natural rubber. Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may also disrupt the productivity of our facilities, our supply chain or the operations of our customers. If the frequency or severity of extreme weather and natural disasters increases over time, we may experience a greater number of losses at certain of our facilities. Such losses could lead to an increase in the deductibles or cost of insurance for those facilities, or to the unavailability of insurance on terms that are acceptable to us. 
 Our manufacturing facilities may become subject to further limitations on the emission of greenhouse gases due to public policy concerns regarding climate change issues or other environmental or health and safety concerns. While the form of any additional regulations cannot be predicted, a cap-and-trade system similar to the one adopted in the European Union could be adopted in the United States. Any such cap-and-trade system (including the system currently in place in the European Union) or other limitations imposed on the emission of greenhouse gases could require us to increase our capital expenditures, use our cash to acquire emission credits or restructure our manufacturing operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. 
 Material future expenditures may be necessary if compliance standards change, if material unknown conditions that require remediation are discovered, or if required remediation of known conditions becomes more extensive than expected. If we fail to comply with present and future environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of production, which could harm our business or results of operations. Environmental laws could also restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses in connection with our manufacturing processes. 
 Risks Related to Our Capital Structure 
 Our long-term ability to meet our obligations, to repay maturing indebtedness or to implement strategic initiatives may be dependent on our ability to access capital markets in the future and to improve our operating results. 
 The adequacy of our liquidity depends on our ability to achieve an appropriate combination of operating improvements, financing from third parties and access to capital markets. We may need to undertake additional financing actions in the capital markets in order to ensure that our future liquidity requirements are addressed or to implement strategic initiatives. These actions may include the issuance of additional debt or equity, or the factoring of our accounts receivable. 
 Our access to the capital markets cannot be assured and is dependent on, among other things, the ability and willingness of financial institutions to extend credit on terms that are acceptable to us or our suppliers, or to honor future draws on our existing lines of credit, and the degree of success we have in implementing our strategic initiatives. We have continued our use of supplier financing programs and the factoring of our accounts receivable in order to improve our working capital efficiency and reduce our costs. If these programs become unavailable or less attractive to us or our suppliers, our liquidity could be adversely affected. 
 Future liquidity requirements, or our inability to access cash deposits or make draws on our lines of credit, also may make it necessary for us to incur additional debt. A substantial portion of our assets is subject to liens securing our indebtedness. As a result, we are limited in our ability to pledge our remaining assets as security for additional secured indebtedness. 
 Our inability to access the capital markets or incur additional debt in the future could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations, and could require us to consider further measures, including deferring planned capital expenditures, reducing discretionary spending, selling additional assets and restructuring existing debt. 
 We have a substantial amount of debt, which could restrict our growth, place us at a competitive disadvantage or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial health. 
 We have a substantial amount of debt. As of December 31, 2022, our debt (including finance leases) on a consolidated basis was approximately 7.9 billion. Our substantial amount of debt and other obligations could have important consequences. For example, it could: 
 make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations; 

impair our ability to obtain financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development, acquisitions or general corporate requirements; 

17 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; 

limit our ability to use cash flows from operating activities in other areas of our business or to return cash to shareholders because we would need to dedicate a substantial portion of these funds for payments on our indebtedness; 

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and 

place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors. 

The agreements governing our debt, including our credit agreements, limit, but do not prohibit, us from incurring additional debt and we may incur a significant amount of additional debt in the future, including additional secured debt. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, our ability to satisfy our debt obligations may become more limited. 
 Our ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance, our debt and other obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which, in turn, is subject to our ability to implement our strategic initiatives, prevailing economic conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay expansion plans and capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt. We cannot assure you that our operating performance, cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient to pay our debt obligations when they become due. We cannot assure you that we would be able to dispose of material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt or other obligations if necessary or, even if we were able to take such actions, that we could do so on terms that are acceptable to us. 
 Any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our debt instruments, or a material reduction in the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations. 
 The agreements governing our secured credit facilities, senior unsecured notes and our other outstanding indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. These restrictions limit our ability to, among other things: 
 incur additional debt or issue redeemable preferred stock; 

pay dividends, repurchase shares or make certain other restricted payments or investments; 

incur liens; 

sell assets; 

incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments to us; 

enter into affiliate transactions; 

engage in sale/leaseback transactions; and 

engage in certain mergers or consolidations or transfers of substantially all of our assets. 

Availability under our first lien revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory, the value of our principal trademarks, the value of eligible machinery and equipment, and certain cash in an amount not to exceed 275 million. To the extent that our eligible accounts receivable and inventory and other components of the borrowing base decline in value, our borrowing base will decrease and the availability under that facility may decrease below its stated amount. In addition, if at any time the amount of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under that facility exceeds the borrowing base, we are required to prepay borrowings and/or cash collateralize letters of credit sufficient to eliminate the excess. 
 Our ability to comply with these covenants or to maintain our borrowing base may be affected by events beyond our control, including deteriorating economic conditions, and these events could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants or alternative sources of financing or to reduce expenditures. We cannot assure you that such waivers, amendments or alternative financing could be obtained, or if obtained, would be on terms acceptable to us. 
 A breach of any of the covenants or restrictions contained in any of our existing or future financing agreements, including the financial covenants in our secured credit facilities, could result in an event of default under those agreements. Such a default could allow the lenders under our financing agreements, if the agreements so provide, to discontinue lending, to accelerate the related debt as well as any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies, and/or to declare all borrowings outstanding thereunder to be due and payable. In addition, the lenders could terminate any commitments they have to provide us with further funds. If any of these events occur, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds available 
 18 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 to pay in full the total amount of obligations that become due as a result of any such acceleration, or that we will be able to find additional or alternative financing to refinance any such accelerated obligations. Even if we obtain additional or alternative financing, we cannot assure you that it would be on terms that would be acceptable to us. 
 We cannot assure you that we will be able to remain in compliance with the covenants to which we are subject in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from our lenders or amend the covenants. 
 Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly. 
 Certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, which would require us to use more of our available cash to service our indebtedness. There can also be no assurance that we will be able to enter into swap agreements or other hedging arrangements in the future if we desire to do so, or that any existing or future hedging arrangements will offset increases in interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 1.7 billion of variable rate debt outstanding. 
 Risks Related to Information Technology and Intellectual Property 
 We may be adversely affected by any disruption in, or failure of, our information technology systems. 
 We rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology IT systems across all of our major business functions, including our research and development, manufacturing, retail, financial and administrative functions. We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing upgrades when necessary, as well as the integration of Cooper Tire s IT systems with Goodyear s IT systems. Our security measures are focused on the prevention, detection and remediation of damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, cyber-attack, natural disasters and other similar disruptions. We may incur significant costs in order to implement the security measures that we feel are necessary to protect our IT systems. However, our IT systems may remain vulnerable to damage despite our implementation of security measures that we deem to be appropriate. In addition, we are also dependent on third parties to provide important IT services relating to, among other things, human resources, electronic communications and certain finance functions. 
 We collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and the proprietary business information of our customers and suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and associates, in data centers and on information technology networks. 
 Additionally, we are subject to privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations Data Protection Laws in the United States and in jurisdictions around the globe that restrict the use, disclosure, transfer and processing of personal data. For example, we are subject to the GDPR, the California Consumer Privacy Act CCPA ), and the Brazilian Lei Geral de Prote o de Dados. Costs to comply with these Data Protection Laws are significant and the failure to comply with these laws could result in material legal exposure and business impact. The GDPR, for example, imposes onerous accountability obligations on companies, with penalties for non-compliance of up to the greater of 20 million or four percent of annual global revenue. The GDPR, and other Data Protection Laws, also grant corrective powers to supervisory authorities, including the ability to impose a limit on processing personal data or to order companies to cease operations. 
 The Data Protection Laws are part of an evolving global data protection landscape in which the number, complexity, requirements and consequences of non-compliance with these laws are increasing. This landscape includes legislative proposals recently adopted or currently pending in the United States, at both the federal and state levels, as well as in other jurisdictions, implementing new or additional requirements for data protection that could further increase compliance costs, the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services, and significantly affect our business. 
 Any system failure, accident or security breach involving our or our third party's IT systems could result in disruptions to our operations. A breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets, negatively impact our manufacturing or retail operations, or result in the compromise of personal information of our employees, customers or suppliers. While we have, from time to time, experienced system failures, accidents and security and privacy breaches involving our IT systems, these incidents have not had a material impact on our operations, and we are not aware of any resulting theft, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, material data or confidential information. To the extent that any system failure, accident or security or privacy breach results in material disruptions to our operations or the theft, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, material data or confidential information, our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

 We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights adequately. 
 Our success depends in part upon our ability to use and protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property, which generally covers various aspects of the design and manufacture of our products and processes. We own and use tradenames and trademarks worldwide. We rely upon a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality policies, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and patent, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. The steps we take in this regard may not be adequate to protect our intellectual property or to prevent or deter challenges or infringement or other violations of our intellectual property, and we may not be able to detect unauthorized use or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights. 
 In addition, the laws of some countries may not protect and enforce our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Further, while we believe we have rights to use all of the intellectual property we use, if we are found to infringe on the rights of others, we could be adversely impacted. 
 Damage to our brand and reputation could have an adverse effect on our business. 
 Our well-known and trusted brand names are a key competitive advantage. We believe that our future success depends, in part, on preserving, enhancing, and leveraging the value of our brands and executing our brand strategies, discussed above, which are designed to drive end-user demand for our products. A decline in the reputation of one or more of our brands as a result of deficiencies or defects in the design or manufacture of our products, or from legal proceedings, product recalls or warranty claims resulting from such deficiencies or defects, may harm our reputation, reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our business. 
 Risks Related to Litigation, Laws and Regulations 
 We could be negatively impacted by changes in tariffs, trade agreements or other trade restrictions on imported tires, raw materials and other goods or equipment. 
 The imposition of new tariffs, changes in existing tariff rates, changes in or the repeal of trade agreements or other trade restrictions may reduce our flexibility to utilize our global manufacturing footprint to meet demand for our tires around the world. In addition, the imposition of tariffs in the United States may result in the tires subject to such tariffs being diverted to other regions of the world, such as Europe, Latin America or Asia, or in retaliatory tariffs or other actions by affected countries. Broad-based tariffs and other trade restrictions could also increase costs for our suppliers who may increase prices to us. Finally, tariffs and other trade restrictions may weaken the economies of key markets for us, such as China, resulting in lower economic growth rates and weakened demand for our products and services. These factors, individually or together, could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 
 We may incur significant costs in connection with our contingent liabilities and tax matters. 
 We have significant reserves for contingent liabilities and tax matters. The major categories of our contingent liabilities include workers' compensation and other employment-related claims, product liability and other tort claims, including asbestos claims, and environmental matters. Our recorded liabilities and estimates of reasonably possible losses for our contingent liabilities are based on our assessment of potential liability using the information available to us at the time and, where applicable, any past experience and recent and current trends with respect to similar matters. Our contingent liabilities are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable judicial or administrative decisions could occur that we did not anticipate. Such an unfavorable decision could include monetary damages, fines or other penalties or an injunction prohibiting us from taking certain actions or selling certain products. If such an unfavorable decision were to occur, it could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations in the period in which the decision occurs, or in future periods. 
 The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations, including with respect to transfer pricing. While we apply consistent transfer pricing policies and practices globally, support transfer prices through economic studies, seek advance pricing agreements and joint audits to the extent possible and believe our transfer prices to be appropriate, such transfer prices, and related interpretations of tax laws, are occasionally challenged by various taxing authorities globally. We have received various tax assessments challenging our interpretations of applicable tax laws in various jurisdictions. Although we believe we have complied with applicable tax laws, have strong positions and defenses and have historically been successful in defending such claims, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in the case we are unsuccessful in the defense of existing or future claims. 
 If we wish to appeal any future adverse judgment in any of these proceedings, we may be required to post an appeal bond with the relevant court. If we were subject to a significant adverse judgment or experienced an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity, we may be required to provide letters of credit or post cash collateral, which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. 
 20 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 We have significant deferred tax assets, including foreign tax credits. We must generate sufficient earnings of the appropriate character in order to utilize our deferred tax assets prior to any applicable expiration dates. If our earnings remain flat or decline over an extended period of time, we may not be able to utilize certain of our deferred tax assets prior to their expiration and we may need to record a valuation allowance against them that could materially adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which the valuation allowance is recorded. 
 For further information regarding our contingent liabilities and tax matters, refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 20, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, and No. 7, Income Taxes. For further information regarding our accounting policies with respect to certain of our contingent liabilities and uncertain income tax positions, refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies. 
 We are subject to extensive government regulations that may materially adversely affect our operating results. 
 We are subject to regulation by the Department of Transportation through NHTSA, which has established various standards and regulations applicable to tires sold in the United States and tires sold in a foreign country that are identical or substantially similar to tires sold in the United States. NHTSA has the authority to order the recall of automotive products, including tires, having safety-related defects or that do not comply with a motor vehicle safety standard, and, in some cases, to assess penalties. 
 The TREAD Act imposes numerous requirements with respect to the early warning reporting of warranty claims, property damage claims, and bodily injury and fatality claims and also requires tire manufacturers, among other things, to comply with revised and more rigorous tire testing standards. Compliance with the TREAD Act regulations has increased the cost of producing and distributing tires in the United States. We have been subject to recalls in the past and it is possible that a recall of our tires, including under the TREAD Act or in other countries under similar regulations, could occur in the future. A substantial recall or related penalties could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results and financial condition. 
 In addition, pursuant to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, NHTSA may establish a national tire fuel efficiency consumer information program. If a related rule-making process is completed, certain tires sold in the United States would be required to be rated for rolling resistance, traction and tread wear. While the federal law preempts state tire fuel efficiency laws adopted after January 1, 2006, we may become subject to additional tire fuel efficiency legislation, either in the United States or other countries. 
 Our European operations are subject to regulation by the European Union. Two regulations, the Tire Safety Regulation and the Tire Labeling Regulation, applicable to tires sold in the European Union have been adopted. The Tire Safety Regulation sets performance standards that tires for cars and light and commercial trucks need to meet for rolling resistance, wet grip braking (passenger car tires only) and noise in order to be sold in the European Union. The Tire Labeling Regulation applies to all passenger car, light truck and commercial truck tires and requires that consumers be informed about the tire's fuel efficiency, wet grip and noise characteristics. Other countries, such as Brazil, have also adopted tire labeling regulations, and additional countries may also introduce similar regulations in the future. 
 Tires produced or sold in Europe also have to comply with various other standards, including environmental laws such as REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemical Substances), which regulates the use of chemicals in the European Union. For example, REACH prohibits the use of highly aromatic oils in tires, which were used as compounding components to improve certain performance characteristics. 
 These U.S. and European regulations, rules adopted to implement these regulations, or other similar regulations that may be adopted in the United States, Europe or elsewhere in the future may require us to alter or increase our capital spending and research and development plans or cease the production of certain tires, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. 
 Laws and regulations governing environmental and occupational safety and health are complicated, change frequently and have tended to become stricter over time. As a manufacturing company, we are subject to these laws and regulations both inside and outside the United States. We may not be in complete compliance with such laws and regulations at all times. Our costs or liabilities relating to them may be more than the amount we have reserved, and that difference may be material. 
 Compliance with the laws and regulations described above or any of the myriad of applicable foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations currently in effect or that may be adopted in the future could materially adversely affect our competitive position, operating results, financial condition and liquidity.

 General Risk Factors 
 We have foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. 
 The financial position and results of operations of many of our international subsidiaries are initially recorded in various foreign currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in our financial statements. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies ordinarily has a negative impact on our reported sales and operating margin (and conversely, the weakening of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies has a positive impact). For the year ended December 31, 2022, foreign currency translation unfavorably affected sales by 1,114 million and unfavorably affected segment operating income by 16 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The volatility of currency exchange rates may materially adversely affect our operating results. 
 We may be impacted by economic and supply disruptions associated with events beyond our control, such as war, including the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters. 
 We manage businesses and facilities worldwide. Our facilities and operations, and the facilities and operations of our suppliers and customers, could be disrupted by events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes, or severe weather conditions or natural disasters. In addition, our operations could be adversely affected as a result of other disruptions at our facilities due to fire, electrical blackouts, power losses, telecommunications failures or other similar effects. Any such disruption could cause delays in the production and distribution of our products and the loss of sales and customers. We may not be insured against all such potential losses and, if insured, the insurance proceeds that we receive may not adequately compensate us for all of our losses.

 ITEM 2. PROPERTIES. 
 We manufacture our products in 57 manufacturing facilities located around the world including 18 plants in the United States. 
 AMERICAS MANUFACTURING FACILITIES. Americas owns or leases and operates 29 manufacturing facilities in 7 countries, including: 
 16 tire plants, 

4 chemical plants, 

3 tire manufacturing equipment plants, 

2 tire retread plants, 

3 aviation retread plants, and 

1 mix plant. 

EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA MANUFACTURING FACILITIES. EMEA owns or leases and operates 18 manufacturing facilities in 10 countries, including: 
 16 tire plants, 

1 tire retread plant, and 

1 aviation retread plant. 

ASIA PACIFIC MANUFACTURING FACILITIES. Asia Pacific owns and operates 10 manufacturing facilities in 6 countries, including 9 tire plants and 1 aviation retread plant. 
 PLANT UTILIZATION. Our worldwide tire capacity utilization rate was approximately 89 during 2022 compared to approximately 87 in 2021 and 68 in 2020. The utilization rate in 2022 was reflective of our continued recovery from the pandemic-related factory shutdowns in 2020. The reported capacity utilization is an overall average for the Company. Our utilization rate can vary significantly between product lines, depending on the complexity of the tires, and between consumer and commercial tires, and can also vary between business segments. 
 OTHER FACILITIES. We also own and operate five research and development facilities and technical centers, three development centers, one innovation lab, and seven tire proving grounds. We lease our Corporate and Americas headquarters and our research and development facility and technical center in Akron, Ohio. We operate approximately 950 retail outlets for the sale of our tires to consumer and commercial customers, approximately 40 tire retreading facilities and approximately 300 warehouse distribution facilities. Substantially all of these facilities are leased. We do not consider any one of these leased properties to be material to our operations.

 ITEM 3. LEGA L PROCEEDINGS. 
 Asbestos Litigation 
 We are currently one of numerous defendants in legal proceedings in certain state and federal courts involving approximately 37,200 claimants at December 31, 2022 relating to their alleged exposure to materials containing asbestos in products allegedly manufactured by us or asbestos materials present at our facilities. We manufactured, among other things, rubber coated asbestos sheet gasket materials from 1914 through 1973 and aircraft brake assemblies containing asbestos materials prior to 1987. Some of the claimants are independent contractors or their employees who allege exposure to asbestos while working at certain of our facilities. It is expected that in a substantial portion of these cases there will be no evidence of exposure to a Goodyear manufactured product containing asbestos or asbestos in our facilities. The amount expended by us and our insurers on defense and claim resolution was 16 million during 2022. The plaintiffs in the pending cases allege that they were exposed to asbestos and, as a result of such exposure, suffer from various respiratory diseases, including in some cases mesothelioma and lung cancer. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified actual and punitive damages and other relief. For additional information on asbestos litigation, refer to Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 20, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities. 
 Shareholder Derivative Litigation 
 On October 24, 2018, a purported shareholder of the Company filed a derivative action on behalf of the Company in the Court of Common Pleas for Summit County, Ohio against certain of our directors, our chief executive officer, and certain former officers and directors. The complaint also names the Company as a nominal defendant. The lawsuit alleges, among other things, breach of fiduciary duties, waste of corporate assets and fraudulent concealment in connection with certain G159 tires manufactured by us from 1996 until 2003. The lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary damages, an award of attorney s fees and expenses, and other legal and equitable relief. On September 25, 2020, the Court of Common Pleas dismissed the derivative action and the purported shareholder appealed that dismissal. On June 30, 2021, the Ohio Court of Appeals for the Ninth Judicial District reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings. 
 Other Matters 
 In addition to the legal proceedings described above, various other legal actions, indirect tax assessments, claims and governmental investigations and proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending against us, including claims and proceedings relating to several waste disposal sites that have been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and similar agencies of various states for remedial investigation and cleanup, which sites were allegedly used by us in the past for the disposal of industrial waste materials. Based on available information, we do not consider any such action, assessment, claim, investigation or proceeding to be material, within the meaning of that term as used in Item 103 of Regulation S-K and the instructions thereto. For additional information regarding our legal proceedings, refer to Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 20, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.

 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 All per share amounts are diluted and refer to Goodyear net income. 
 OVERVIEW 
 The Goodyear Tire Rubber Company is one of the world s leading manufacturers of tires, with one of the most recognizable brand names in the world and operations in most regions of the world. We have a broad global footprint with 57 manufacturing facilities in 23 countries, including the United States. We operate our business through three operating segments representing our regional tire businesses: Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa; and Asia Pacific. 
 This management's discussion and analysis provides comparisons of material changes in the consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. For a comparison of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 In January 2023, we approved a rationalization plan and workforce reorganization that will result in an approximately 5 reduction in salaried staff globally, or about 500 positions, in response to a challenging industry environment and cost pressure driven by inflation. In certain foreign countries, relevant portions of the rationalization plan remain subject to consultation with employee representative bodies. We expect to substantially complete the rationalization plan during the first and second quarters of 2023 and estimate total pre-tax charges associated with this action to be approximately 55 million, of which approximately 39 million are expected to be cash charges primarily for associate-related and other exit costs, with the remainder representing non-cash charges primarily for accelerated depreciation and other asset-related charges. We recorded 37 million of pre-tax charges in the fourth quarter of 2022 and expect to record a majority of the remaining charges in the first quarter of 2023. A majority of the cash outflows associated with this plan relate to cash severance payments that are expected to be paid during the first half of 2023. The rationalization and reorganization will result in quarterly run-rate savings of approximately 15 million, beginning in the second quarter of 2023. Savings in the first quarter of 2023 are expected to be 5 million. 
 In October 2022, we approved a plan to close the Melksham, United Kingdom tire manufacturing facility Melksham ), which was acquired in conjunction with the merger between the Company and Cooper Tire. The plan is intended to address long-standing competitiveness issues at Melksham. The plan also (i) consolidates our premium motorcycle tire production in Europe into a single center of excellence based in our Montlucon, France tire manufacturing facility, (ii) discontinues Cooper Tire s European motorsport program and (iii) transfers light truck tire production from the Montlucon facility to other tire manufacturing facilities in Europe. The plan includes approximately 320 job reductions at Melksham. The plan remains subject to consultation with relevant employee representative bodies. We expect to substantially complete this rationalization plan by the end of 2023 and estimate total pre-tax charges associated with this plan to be between 80 million and 90 million, of which 60 million to 70 million are expected to be cash charges primarily for associate-related and other exit costs, with the remainder representing non-cash charges primarily for accelerated depreciation and other asset-related charges. We recorded 34 million of pre-tax charges in 2022 related to this plan. The majority of the remaining charges and cash outflows associated with this plan are expected to occur in 2023. 
 During the third quarter of 2022, members of the United Steelworkers ratified a new four-year master collective bargaining agreement with us. The new contract, which expires in July 2026, addresses compensation costs while providing operational improvements that increase manufacturing flexibility and productivity for our U.S. plants covered by the agreement. 
 Results of Operations 
 On June 7, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Cooper Tire. Since the Closing Date, Cooper Tire's operating results have been incorporated into our consolidated results of operations. For periods that are not fully comparable, we discuss the impact of Cooper Tire's operating results separately up to the point within those periods when consolidated results became comparable. 
 During 2022, our operating results reflected a difficult macroeconomic environment, including the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most foreign currencies. Our results also reflect higher input costs mostly offset by price and product mix and the benefits of our acquisition of Cooper Tire. Challenging market conditions persist, driven by the direct and indirect macroeconomic effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the conflict in Ukraine and other global events, that continue to negatively influence our results. 
 Our global businesses are experiencing varying stages of recovery from the pandemic. National and local efforts during the year in certain countries, such as China, to contain the spread of COVID-19 and its related variants, such as renewed stay-at-home orders and other restrictions on mobility, continued to negatively impact economic conditions and our operations. For instance, some of our facilities, including our facilities in Pulandian and Kunshan, China, had to temporarily shut down or limit production at various times throughout the year because of these restrictions.

 Increased demand for consumer products, supply chain disruptions and other factors have led to continuing inflationary cost pressures on our results, including higher costs for certain raw materials, higher transportation costs and higher energy costs. Energy cost increases have been more pronounced in Europe driven by the indirect impacts of the conflict in Ukraine. Furthermore, shortages of certain automobile parts, such as semiconductors, continue to affect OE manufacturers ability to produce consumer and commercial vehicles consistently, although the industry, and our volume, experienced some recovery during the second half of 2022. 
 We also continue to experience increased labor-related costs and manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the ongoing tight labor supply, particularly in the U.S. To address this issue, we have accelerated hiring as necessary, increased training capacity and started to adjust future investment plans to consider not just the cost, but also the availability of qualified workers. 
 While most of our global tire manufacturing facilities operated at or near full capacity during 2022, in order to address softening industry demand and prevent the buildup of excess inventory, we reduced production in the fourth quarter of 2022 at most of our tire manufacturing facilities, resulting in a reduction of approximately 3.5 million units compared to production in the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily in Americas and EMEA. Decisions to change production levels in the future will be based on an evaluation of market demand signals and inventory and supply levels, as well as the availability of sufficient qualified labor and our ability to continue to safeguard the health of our associates. 
 While it remains challenging to operate our business in Ukraine, we were able to resume shipments of tires into the country on a limited basis during the second quarter of 2022 and to expand our shipments during the second half of the year. In addition, we previously suspended all shipments of tires to Russia during the first quarter of 2022 and approved the discontinuation of our Russian operations in January 2023. Goodyear s sales in Ukraine and Russia represented 0.3 and 1.2 , respectively, of our total 2021 net sales of 17.5 billion. We do not have manufacturing operations in either Ukraine or Russia, and we continue to take numerous actions to ensure continuity of supply for raw materials used in manufacturing, some of which are sourced from the impacted area. These actions include increasing our safety stocks when possible, identifying substitutes where appropriate and building alternate supplier relationships where necessary. Nonetheless, the ongoing conflict continues to aggravate the already challenging macroeconomic trends described above, including global supply chain disruptions, higher costs for certain raw materials and higher transportation and energy costs. The situation continues to be very dynamic and we are continually assessing all potential impacts on our associates and business. 
 Our results for 2022 include a 9.0 increase in tire unit shipments compared to 2021, reflecting the addition of Cooper Tire's operations for the full year, as well as some recovery in OE, including share gains from new OE fitments, despite ongoing supply chain disruptions and shortages. In addition to higher raw material costs, we incurred approximately 890 million of year-over-year incremental costs during 2022 related to inflation and other cost pressures, primarily higher transportation and energy costs, compared to 209 million in 2021. 
 Net sales were 20,805 million in 2022, compared to 17,478 million in 2021. Net sales increased in 2022 primarily due to global improvements in price and product mix, the addition of incremental net sales from Cooper Tire during the first six months of 2022, higher sales in other tire related businesses, driven by increased third-party chemical sales in Americas, growth in EMEA's Fleet Solutions, higher aviation sales in Americas and EMEA, and increased retail sales in Americas, and higher tire volume in Asia Pacific and EMEA, partially offset by lower tire volume in Americas. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation, primarily in EMEA and Asia Pacific, driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. 
 Goodyear net income in 2022 was 202 million, or 0.71 per share, compared to net income of 764 million, or 2.89 per share, in 2021. The decrease in Goodyear net income was primarily due to higher U.S. and Foreign Tax Expense, higher interest expense and higher rationalization charges. Income taxes in 2021 included discrete tax benefits of 340 million related to a reduction in valuation allowances on certain U.S. deferred tax assets primarily for foreign tax credits and 39 million to adjust our deferred tax assets in England for an enacted change in tax rate. 
 Our total segment operating income for 2022 was 1,276 million, compared to 1,288 million in 2021. The 12 million decrease was primarily due to increased conversion costs of 462 million, higher transportation and import duty costs of 292 million, primarily in Americas and EMEA, and higher Selling, Administrative and General Expense SAG of 96 million, all driven by the inflationary cost trends described above, as well as a favorable indirect tax ruling in Brazil of 69 million in 2021, a favorable settlement of 20 million in 2021 due to a reduction in certain U.S. duty rates on various Cooper Tire commercial tires from China imported into the U.S. during 2019, and unfavorable foreign currency translation of 16 million, primarily in Asia Pacific, driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. These decreases were mostly offset by global improvements in price and product mix of 2,532 million, which more than offset higher raw material costs of 1,885 million, 72 million of amortization expense during the second half of 2021 related to a Cooper Tire fair value step-up in inventory acquired by Goodyear, and higher earnings in other tire-related businesses of 21 million, primarily due to higher aviation sales and retread sales in Americas and EMEA. The remainder of the change was driven by the addition of incremental Cooper Tire operating results during the first six months of 2022. Refer to Results of Operations Segment Information for additional information.

 Liquidity 
 At December 31, 2022, we had 1,227 million of Cash and Cash Equivalents as well as 4,035 million of unused availability under our various credit agreements, compared to 1,088 million and 4,345 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021. The increase in cash and cash equivalents of 139 million was primarily due to net borrowings of 582 million, cash provided by operating activities of 521 million and cash proceeds of 108 million received from a sale and leaseback transaction in Americas in the second quarter of 2022, partially offset by capital expenditures of 1,061 million. Cash provided by operating activities reflects net income for the period of 209 million, which includes non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization of 964 million, non-cash rationalization charges of 129 million, non-cash net pension curtailment and settlement charges of 124 million, and a non-cash gain of 95 million related to the sale and leaseback transaction in Americas, partially offset by cash used for working capital of 689 million, rationalization payments of 95 million and pension contributions and direct payments of 60 million, as well as the impact of other changes to various assets and liabilities on the Balance Sheet. Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information. 
 Outlook 
 The global economy continues to face uncertain macroeconomic conditions, including the ongoing effects of inflation, which have led to higher interest rates and lower consumer confidence. Uncertainties around the availability of energy in Europe have more profoundly affected consumer spending in that region. COVID-19 infections in China are expected to continue to negatively impact consumer spending in that country through the early part of 2023. Although the situation continues to improve, OE manufacturers continue to be affected by shortages of materials and components, limiting vehicle production. The combination of these and other factors have lowered tire industry volumes globally in the fourth quarter of 2022. We expect these soft industry conditions to persist in the first quarter of 2023, especially in Europe, which are expected to reduce our total volume by approximately 5 compared to the first quarter of 2022. Because of this industry softness in Europe, we anticipate segment operating income in EMEA will approach breakeven in the first quarter of 2023 but will return to levels of recent historical performance by the middle of the year. 
 We expect our raw material costs to increase approximately 200 million in 2023 compared to 2022, including the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar and higher transportation and supplier costs. This net increase includes higher raw material costs of approximately 300 million and 100 million in the first and second quarters of 2023, respectively, and lower raw material costs of approximately 200 million in the second half of the year. We anticipate price and product mix improvements to more than offset raw material cost increases in the first quarter of 2023 by approximately 100 million. Natural and synthetic rubber prices and other commodity prices historically have been volatile, and our raw material costs could change based on future cost fluctuations and changes in foreign exchange rates. We continue to focus on price and product mix, to substitute lower cost materials where possible, to work to identify additional substitution opportunities, to reduce the amount of material required in each tire, and to pursue alternative raw materials to minimize the impact of higher raw material costs. 
 In addition to higher raw material costs, we expect the impact of other inflationary cost pressures to persist, particularly with respect to transportation, labor and energy costs. We expect the negative impact from non-raw material inflation in the first quarter of 2023 will be approximately 175 million compared with the first quarter of 2022. We continue to focus on actions to offset costs other than raw materials through cost savings initiatives, including rationalization actions, further price actions and improvements in product mix. We also anticipate our first quarter 2023 results will be negatively impacted by our reduced production levels in the fourth quarter of 2022 of approximately 3.5 million tire units. We also plan to reduce our production levels in the first quarter of 2023 by the same number of units as the fourth quarter of 2022, which will impact our second quarter of 2023 results. 
 For the full year of 2023, we expect working capital to be a source of operating cash flows of approximately 100 million. We anticipate our capital expenditures will be approximately 1.0 billion. Our capital expenditures in 2023 will be focused on projects to modernize certain of our manufacturing facilities and expand others to address anticipated future demand, in addition to capital expenditures to sustain our facilities. We anticipate our cash flows will include rationalization payments of approximately 100 million, as we continue to address our cost structure.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATED 
 Goodyear net income in 2022 was 202 million, or 0.71 per share, compared to net income of 764 million, or 2.89 per share, in 2021. The decrease in Goodyear net income was primarily due to higher U.S. and Foreign Tax Expense, higher interest expense and higher rationalization charges. Income taxes in 2021 included discrete tax benefits of 340 million related to the reduction in valuation allowances on certain U.S. deferred tax assets primarily for foreign tax credits and 39 million to adjust our deferred tax assets in England for an enacted change in the tax rate. Additionally, our 2021 earnings included the impact of a severe winter storm in the U.S., which was estimated to negatively impact earnings by 54 million 44 million after-tax and minority). 
 Net Sales 
 Net sales in 2022 of 20,805 million increased 3,327 million, or 19.0 , compared to 17,478 million in 2021, primarily due to global improvements in price and product mix of 2,556 million, the addition of an incremental 1,532 million of net sales from Cooper Tire during the first six months of 2022, higher sales in other tire related businesses of 316 million, driven by increased third-party chemical sales in Americas, growth in EMEA's Fleet Solutions, higher aviation sales in Americas and EMEA, and increased retail sales in Americas, and higher tire volume of 41 million in Asia Pacific and EMEA, partially offset by lower tire volume in Americas. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of 1,114 million, primarily in EMEA and Asia Pacific, driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Goodyear worldwide tire unit net sales were 17,886 million and 14,917 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Consumer and commercial net sales were 13,163 million and 4,205 million in 2022, respectively. Consumer and commercial net sales were 11,118 million and 3,702 million in 2021, respectively.

The increase in worldwide tire unit sales of 15.2 million units, or 9.0 , compared to 2021, included an increase of 9.8 million replacement tire units, or 7.3 , primarily due to the addition of Cooper Tire's units. OE tire units increased by 5.4 million units, or 15.4 , primarily due to higher vehicle production globally compared to 2021, despite ongoing supply chain disruptions and shortages, and share gains from new OE fitments. Consumer and commercial unit sales in 2022 were 169.0 million and 13.6 million, respectively. Consumer and commercial unit sales in 2021 were 154.2 million and 13.1 million, respectively. 
 Cost of Goods Sold 
 Cost of Goods Sold CGS was 16,953 million in 2022, increasing 3,261 million, or 23.8 , from 13,692 million in 2021. CGS was 81.5 of sales in 2022 compared to 78.3 of sales in 2021. CGS in 2022 increased primarily due to higher raw material costs of 1,885 million, the addition of an incremental 1,194 million of CGS from Cooper Tire during the first six months of 2022, which includes a favorable year-over-year impact of 38 million 29 million after-tax and minority) of amortization expense in 2021 related to the fair value adjustment to the Closing Date inventory of Cooper Tire that was acquired by Goodyear, higher conversion costs of 462 million driven by inflation and higher energy costs, higher costs in other tire-related businesses of 295 million driven by increased third-party chemical and retail sales in Americas and growth in EMEA's Fleet Solutions, higher transportation and import duty costs of 292 million primarily in Americas and EMEA, a favorable indirect tax ruling in Brazil of 69 million in 2021, of which 66 million 43 million after-tax and minority) related to prior years, higher tire volume of 47 million, and a favorable adjustment of 20 million 15 million after-tax and minority) in the second half of 2021 due to a reduction in certain U.S. duty rates on various Cooper Tire commercial tires from China imported into the U.S. during 2019. These increases were partially offset by foreign currency translation of 942 million, primarily in EMEA and Asia Pacific, driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, and 72 million 53 million after-tax and minority) of amortization expense during the second half of 2021 related to the fair value adjustment to the Closing Date inventory of Cooper Tire that was acquired by Goodyear.

 CGS in 2022 included pension expense of 22 million compared to 21 million in 2021. CGS in 2022 also included a gain of 14 million 11 million after-tax and minority) in the first half of 2022 due to a reduction in certain U.S. duty rates on various Cooper Tire commercial tires from China imported into the U.S. during 2020 and a gain of 7 million 6 million after-tax and minority) in Americas related to insurance recoveries. CGS in 2022 included incremental savings from rationalization plans of 2 million compared to 63 million in 2021. 
 Selling, Administrative and General Expense 
 SAG was 2,798 million in 2022, increasing 99 million, or 3.7 , from 2,699 million in 2021. SAG was 13.4 of sales in 2022 compared to 15.4 of sales in 2021. SAG increased primarily due to the addition of incremental SAG from Cooper Tire during the first six months of 2022 and 130 million of cost increases reflecting the inflationary cost trends described above. These increases were partially offset by foreign currency translation of 156 million, primarily in EMEA and Asia Pacific, driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, and lower wages and benefits of 36 million, driven by reduced incentive compensation. SAG in 2022 included pension expense of 15 million compared to 18 million in 2021. SAG in 2022 included incremental savings from rationalization plans of 12 million compared to 9 million in 2021. 
 SAG and CGS in 2022 included 28 million and 9 million, respectively, of accelerated depreciation and asset write-offs, of which 30 million 27 million after-tax and minority) in total related to rationalization activities. SAG and CGS in 2021 included a total of 6 million 4 million after-tax and minority) of transaction costs related to the Cooper Tire acquisition. 
 Rationalizations 
 We recorded net rationalization charges of 129 million 120 million after-tax and minority) in 2022. Net rationalization charges include 37 million for the plan primarily to reduce salaried staff globally, 34 million for the plan to close Melksham, 24 million for a plan to reduce duplicative global SAG headcount and close redundant warehouse locations in Americas as part of our ongoing Cooper Tire integration efforts, 16 million related to the permanent closure of our tire manufacturing facility in Gadsden, Alabama, and 14 million related to the exit of our retail operations in South Africa. 
 We recorded net rationalization charges of 93 million 82 million after-tax and minority) in 2021. Net rationalization charges include 38 million in Americas, primarily related to the permanent closure of our tire manufacturing facility in Gadsden, Alabama, 29 million related to a plan to reduce SAG headcount in EMEA, and 26 million related to a plan to modernize two of our manufacturing facilities in Germany. 
 Upon completion of new plans initiated in 2022, we estimate that annual segment operating income (primarily SAG) will improve by approximately 150 million. The savings realized in 2022 from rationalization plans totaled 14 million 12 million SAG and 2 million CGS). 
 For further information, refer to Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 4, Costs Associated with Rationalization Programs. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense was 451 million in 2022, increasing 64 million from 387 million in 2021. The increase was primarily due to a higher average debt balance of 8,266 million in 2022 compared to 7,267 million in 2021 and a higher average interest rate of 5.46 in 2022 compared to 5.33 in 2021. Interest expense in 2021 included a 6 million 5 million after-tax and minority) charge related to the redemption of our former 1.0 billion 5.125 senior notes due 2023. 
 Other (Income) Expense 
 Other (Income) Expense was 75 million and 94 million of expense in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The 19 million decrease in expense was primarily due to net gains on asset and other sales of 115 million 87 million after-tax and minority) in 2022 primarily related to the sale and leaseback transaction in Americas, 50 million 42 million after-tax and minority) of transaction and other costs related to the Cooper Tire acquisition in 2021, net pension curtailment and settlement charges of 43 million 32 million after-tax and minority) in 2021, and an out of period adjustment of 7 million 7 million after-tax and minority) of expense related to foreign currency exchange in Americas in 2021. These decreases were partially offset by net pension curtailment and settlement charges of 124 million 93 million after-tax and minority) in 2022, 48 million 44 million after-tax and minority) of interest income related to the favorable indirect tax ruling in Brazil in 2021, 15 million of expense 11 million after-tax and minority) for intellectual property-related legal claims in 2022, net gains on asset and other sales in 2021 of 12 million 8 million after-tax and minority) primarily related to the sale of land in Hanau, Germany, and a favorable insurance settlement of 10 million 8 million after-tax and minority) in 2021. The remainder of the difference is mostly attributable to higher interest income in 2022 compared to 2021, driven by higher interest rates.

 Income Taxes 
 Income tax expense in 2022 was 190 million on income before income taxes of 399 million. In 2022, income tax expense includes net discrete tax expense totaling 23 million 23 million after minority interest), including a charge of 14 million to write off deferred tax assets related to tax loss carryforwards in the UK and a charge of 11 million to establish a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets in Russia, partially offset by a net benefit of 2 million for various other items. 
 Income tax benefit in 2021 was 267 million on income before income taxes of 513 million. In 2021, income tax benefit includes net discrete tax benefits totaling 409 million 409 million after minority interest), including a reduction in our valuation allowances of 340 million for certain U.S. deferred tax assets for foreign tax credits and state tax loss carryforwards, a 39 million benefit to adjust our deferred tax assets in England for a second quarter enacted change in the tax rate, a 21 million benefit to reflect an increase in our estimated state tax rate used in calculating our U.S. net deferred tax assets as a result of a change in the overall mix of our earnings by state after including the impact of the acquisition of Cooper Tire, an 8 million benefit related to a favorable court ruling in Brazil, and a net benefit of 1 million for various other items. 
 The difference between our effective tax rate and the U.S. statutory rate of 21 for both 2022 and 2021 primarily relates to losses in certain foreign jurisdictions in which no tax benefits are recorded, income in certain foreign jurisdictions taxed at rates higher than the U.S. statutory rate, and the discrete items described above. 
 On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (the Act was signed into law in the U.S. The Act includes a new 15 corporate alternative minimum tax CAMT ). This CAMT applies to tax years beginning after December 31, 2022 for companies with average annual adjusted financial statement income over the previous three years in excess of 1 billion. For 2023, we do not anticipate this CAMT will apply to us due to the significant pandemic-driven losses we incurred in 2020. As allowed, we elected to not consider the estimated impact of potential future CAMT obligations for purposes of assessing valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets. 
 At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had approximately 1.1 billion and 1.2 billion of U.S. federal, state and local net deferred tax assets, respectively, inclusive of valuation allowances totaling 26 million in each year primarily for state tax loss carryforwards with limited lives. Approximately 700 million of these U.S. net deferred tax assets have unlimited lives and approximately 400 million have limited lives and expire between 2023 and 2042. In the U.S., we have a cumulative loss for the three-year period ended December 31, 2022. However, as the three-year cumulative loss in the U.S. is driven by business disruptions created by the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily in 2020, and only includes the favorable impact of the Cooper Tire acquisition since the Closing Date, we also considered other objectively verifiable information in assessing our ability to utilize our net deferred tax assets, including continued favorable overall volume trends in the tire industry and our tire volume compared to 2020 levels. In addition, the Cooper Tire acquisition has generated significant incremental domestic earnings since the Closing Date and provides opportunities for cost and other operating synergies to further improve our U.S. profitability. 
 At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, our U.S. net deferred tax assets described above include approximately 230 million and 340 million, respectively, of foreign tax credits with limited lives. Our earnings and forecasts of future profitability, taking into consideration recent trends, along with three significant sources of foreign income, provide us sufficient positive evidence that we will be able to utilize these net foreign tax credits which expire through 2032. Our sources of foreign income are (1) 100 of our domestic profitability can be re-characterized as foreign source income under current U.S. tax law to the extent domestic losses have offset foreign source income in prior years, (2) annual net foreign source income, exclusive of dividends, primarily from royalties, and (3) tax planning strategies, including accelerating income on cross border transactions, including sales of inventory or raw materials to our subsidiaries, reducing U.S. interest expense by, for example, reducing intercompany loans through repatriating current year earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and other financing transactions, all of which would increase our domestic profitability. 
 We consider our current forecasts of future profitability in assessing our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, including our foreign tax credits. These forecasts include the impact of recent trends, including various macroeconomic factors such as the impact of higher raw material, transportation, labor and energy costs, on our profitability, as well as the impact of tax planning strategies. These macroeconomic factors possess a high degree of volatility and can significantly impact our profitability. As such, there is a risk that future earnings will not be sufficient to fully utilize our U.S. net deferred tax assets, including our foreign tax credits. However, we believe our forecasts of future profitability along with the three significant sources of foreign income described above provide us sufficient positive, objectively verifiable evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that, at December 31, 2022, our U.S. net deferred tax assets, including our foreign tax credits, will be fully utilized. 
 At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we also had approximately 1.2 billion and 1.3 billion of foreign net deferred tax assets, respectively, and related valuation allowances of approximately 1.0 billion in each year. Our losses in various foreign taxing jurisdictions in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require us to maintain a full valuation allowance against certain of these net foreign deferred tax assets. Most notably, in Luxembourg, we maintain a valuation allowance of 873 million on all of our net deferred tax assets. Each reporting period, we assess available positive and negative

 evidence and estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize these existing deferred tax assets. We do not believe that sufficient positive evidence required to release valuation allowances having a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations will exist within the next twelve months. 
 For further information regarding income taxes and the realizability of our deferred tax assets, including our foreign tax credits, refer to Critical Accounting Policies and Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 7, Income Taxes. 
 Minority Shareholders Net Income 
 Minority shareholders net income was 7 million in 2022, compared to 16 million in 2021. The decrease in 2022 was primarily related to the impact of inflation on earnings of the minority interest in Turkey. Minority shareholders' net income in 2021 includes 3 million 3 million after-tax) related to a settlement with a minority interest in Turkey.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SEGMENT INFORMATION 
 Segment information reflects our strategic business units SBUs ), which are organized to meet customer requirements and global competition and are segmented on a regional basis. Since the Closing Date, Cooper Tire's operating results have been incorporated into each of our SBUs. For periods that are not fully comparable, we discuss the impact of Cooper Tire's operating results separately up to the point within those periods when Cooper Tire's results became comparable. 
 Results of operations are measured based on net sales to unaffiliated customers and segment operating income. Each segment exports tires to other segments. The financial results of each segment exclude sales of tires exported to other segments, but include operating income derived from such transactions. Segment operating income is computed as follows: Net Sales less CGS (excluding asset write-off and accelerated depreciation charges) and SAG (including certain allocated corporate administrative expenses). Segment operating income also includes certain royalties and equity in earnings of most affiliates. Segment operating income does not include net rationalization charges (credits), asset sales, goodwill and other asset impairment charges and certain other items. 
 Total segment operating income in 2022 was 1,276 million, a decrease of 12 million, or 0.9 , from 1,288 million in 2021. Total segment operating margin (segment operating income divided by segment sales) in 2022 was 6.1 compared to 7.4 in 2021. 
 Management believes that total segment operating income is useful because it represents the aggregate value of income created by our SBUs and excludes items not directly related to the SBUs for performance evaluation purposes. Total segment operating income is the sum of the individual SBUs segment operating income. Refer to Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 9, Business Segments, for further information and for a reconciliation of total segment operating income to Income (Loss) before Income Taxes.

Americas unit sales in 2022 increased 9.1 million units, or 10.6 , to 95.0 million units. Replacement tire volume increased 7.9 million units, or 10.8 , primarily due to the addition of incremental Cooper Tire units during the first six months of 2022, partially offset by a decrease in our consumer business in the U.S. OE tire volume increased 1.2 million units, or 9.5 , primarily due to continued recovery from the impact on vehicle production of global supply chain disruptions, including shortages of key manufacturing components, such as semiconductors, driven by our consumer business in the U.S., Canada and Brazil. 
 Net sales in 2022 were 12,766 million, increasing 2,715 million, or 27.0 , from 10,051 million in 2021. The increase in net sales was primarily due to improvements in price and product mix of 1,402 million, driven by price increases, the addition of an incremental 1,355 million of net sales from Cooper Tire during the first six months of 2022, and higher sales in other tire-related businesses of 208 million, primarily due to higher third-party chemical, retail, aviation and retread sales. These increases were partially offset by lower tire volume of 258 million. We estimate that the severe winter storm in the U.S. negatively impacted Americas net sales in 2021 by approximately 35 million. 
 Operating income in 2022 was 1,094 million, increasing 180 million, or 19.7 , from 914 million in 2021. The increase in operating income was due to improvements in price and product mix of 1,452 million, which more than offset higher raw material costs of 881 million, 61 million of amortization expense in the second half of 2021 related to the fair value adjustment to the Closing Date inventory of Cooper Tire that was acquired by Goodyear, higher earnings in other tire-related businesses of 8 million, and the net impact of out of period adjustments in 2021 totaling 6 million 6 million after-tax and minority) of expense primarily related to inventory and accrued freight charges. These increases were partially offset by higher conversion costs of 242 million and higher transportation and import duty costs of 229 million, both driven by the inflationary cost trends described above, lower tire volume of 81 million, the favorable indirect tax ruling in Brazil of 69 million in 2021, the favorable adjustment of 20 million in the second half of 2021 due to the reduction in certain U.S. duty rates on various Cooper Tire commercial tires from China imported into the U.S. during 2019, and higher SAG of 11 million. The remainder of the change was driven by the addition of Cooper Tire's incremental operating results during the first six months of 2022, which included a favorable year-over-year impact of 35 million for amortization expense in 2021 related to the fair value step-up of inventory acquired by Goodyear. SAG for 2022 includes incremental savings from rationalization plans of 7 million. We estimate that the severe winter storm in the U.S. as well as a national strike in Colombia negatively impacted Americas operating income in 2021 by approximately 42 million and 9 million 9 million after-tax and minority), respectively.

 Table of Contents 
 
 Operating income in 2022 excluded net rationalization charges of 32 million and net gains on asset sales of 122 million, primarily related to the sale and leaseback transaction in the second quarter of 2022 and the sale and exit of certain retail locations in the fourth quarter of 2022. Operating income in 2021 excluded rationalization charges of 38 million and a net gain on asset sales of 1 million. 
 Americas' results are highly dependent upon the United States, which accounted for 84 of Americas' net sales in both 2022 and 2021. Results of operations in the United States are expected to continue to have a significant impact on Americas' future performance.

Europe, Middle East and Africa unit sales in 2022 increased 2.4 million units, or 4.5 , to 55.1 million units. Replacement tire volume increased 1.3 million units, or 3.1 , primarily in our consumer business, reflecting continued recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic during the first half of the year and the impacts of our ongoing initiative to align distribution in Europe, as well as the addition of incremental Cooper Tire units during the first six months of 2022. These increases were partially offset by industry declines in the second half of the year. OE tire volume increased 1.1 million units, or 10.1 , reflecting share gains driven by new consumer fitments and increased demand from improved vehicle production. 
 Net sales in 2022 were 5,645 million, increasing 402 million, or 7.7 , from 5,243 million in 2021. Net sales increased primarily due to improvements in price and product mix of 999 million, driven by price increases, higher tire volume of 141 million, higher sales in other tire-related businesses of 115 million, primarily due to growth in Fleet Solutions and an increase in aviation, motorcycle and retread sales, and the addition of an incremental 105 million of net sales from Cooper Tire during the first six months of 2022. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of 954 million, driven by a weaker euro, Turkish lira, Polish zloty and British pound. 
 Operating income in 2022 was 61 million, decreasing 178 million, or 74.5 , from 239 million in 2021. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to higher conversion costs of 217 million and higher transportation and import duty costs of 61 million, both driven by the inflationary cost trends described above, and higher SAG of 85 million primarily due to inflation, higher advertising costs and higher costs for wages and benefits. These decreases were partially offset by improvements in price and product mix of 894 million, which more than offset higher raw material costs of 767 million, higher tire volume of 36 million, and higher earnings in other tire-related businesses of 13 million. The remainder of the change was driven by the addition of Cooper Tire's incremental operating results during the first six months of 2022. SAG and conversion costs for 2022 include incremental savings from rationalization plans of 5 million and 2 million, respectively. 
 Operating income in 2022 excluded net rationalization charges of 92 million and accelerated depreciation and asset write-offs of 20 million. Operating income in 2021 excluded net rationalization charges of 49 million, a net gain on asset sales of 13 million and accelerated depreciation and asset write-offs of 1 million. 
 EMEA s results are highly dependent upon Germany, which accounted for 15 of EMEA s net sales in both 2022 and 2021. Results of operations in Germany are expected to continue to have a significant impact on EMEA s future performance.

Asia Pacific unit sales in 2022 increased 3.7 million units, or 12.1 , to 34.4 million units. OE tire volume increased 3.1 million units, or 28.1 , primarily due to continued recovery from the impact on vehicle production of global supply chain disruptions, including shortages of key manufacturing components, such as semiconductors, the addition of incremental Cooper Tire units during the first six months of 2022, and share gains driven by new OE fitments. Replacement tire volume increased 0.6 million units, or 3.3 , primarily due to the addition of incremental Cooper Tire units during the first six months of 2022 and expansion of our distribution networks. 
 Net sales in 2022 were 2,394 million, increasing 210 million, or 9.6 , from 2,184 million in 2021. Net sales increased due to higher tire volume of 158 million, improvements in price and product mix of 155 million, driven by price increases, and the addition of an incremental 72 million of net sales from Cooper Tire during the first six months of 2022. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of 168 million, primarily related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen, Indian rupee, Chinese yuan and Australian dollar. 
 Operating income in 2022 was 121 million, decreasing 14 million, or 10.4 , from 135 million in 2021. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to higher raw material costs of 237 million and unfavorable foreign currency translation of 21 million, primarily related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen and Indian rupee. These decreases were partially offset by improvements in price and product mix of 186 million and higher tire volume of 39 million. The remainder of the change was driven by the addition of Cooper Tire's incremental operating results during the first six months of 2022. 
 Asia Pacific s results are highly dependent upon China and Australia. China accounted for 29 of Asia Pacific's net sales in both 2022 and 2021. Australia accounted for 24 of Asia Pacific s net sales in both 2022 and 2021. Results of operations in China and Australia are expected to continue to have a significant impact on Asia Pacific's future performance.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Overview 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operating and financing activities. Our cash flows from operating activities are driven primarily by our operating results and changes in our working capital requirements and our cash flows from financing activities are dependent upon our ability to access credit or other capital. 
 On September 15, 2022, we amended our 2.75 billion first lien revolving credit facility to change the base interest rate from LIBOR to SOFR. 
 On October 12, 2022, we amended and restated our European revolving credit facility. Significant changes to the European revolving credit facility include extending the maturity to January 14, 2028 and changing the base interest rate for loans denominated in U.S. dollars from LIBOR to SOFR. 
 At December 31, 2022, we had 1,227 million of Cash and Cash Equivalents, compared to 1,088 million at December 31, 2021. The increase in cash and cash equivalents of 139 million was primarily due to net borrowings of 582 million, cash provided by operating activities of 521 million and cash proceeds of 108 million received from the sale and leaseback transaction in Americas in the second quarter of 2022, partially offset by capital expenditures of 1,061 million. Cash provided by operating activities reflects net income for the period of 209 million, which includes non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization of 964 million, non-cash rationalization charges of 129 million, non-cash net pension curtailment and settlement charges of 124 million, and a non-cash gain of 95 million related to the sale and leaseback transaction in Americas, partially offset by cash used for working capital of 689 million, rationalization payments of 95 million and pension contributions and direct payments of 60 million, as well as the impact of other changes to various assets and liabilities on the Balance Sheet. 
 At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had 4,035 million and 4,345 million, respectively, of unused availability under our various credit agreements. The table below provides unused availability by our significant credit facilities as of December 31:

We expect our 2023 cash flow needs to include capital expenditures of approximately 1.0 billion. We also expect interest expense to be approximately 500 million; rationalization payments to be approximately 100 million; income tax payments to be approximately 200 million, excluding one-time items; and contributions to our funded pension plans to be 25 million to 50 million. We expect working capital to be a source of operating cash flows of approximately 100 million for the full year of 2023. 
 We actively monitor our liquidity and intend to operate our business in a way that allows us to address our cash flow needs with our existing cash and available credit if they cannot be funded by cash generated from operating or other financing activities. We believe that our liquidity position is adequate to fund our operating and investing needs and debt maturities for the next twelve months and to provide us with the ability to respond to further changes in the business environment. 
 Our ability to service debt and operational requirements is also dependent, in part, on the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions of cash to various other entities in our consolidated group, whether in the form of dividends, loans or otherwise. In certain countries where we operate, such as China, South Africa, Serbia and Argentina, transfers of funds into or out of such countries by way of dividends, loans, advances or payments to third-party or affiliated suppliers are generally or periodically subject to certain requirements, such as obtaining approval from the foreign government and/or currency exchange board before net assets can be transferred out of the country. In addition, certain of our credit agreements and other debt instruments limit the ability of foreign subsidiaries to make distributions of cash. Thus, we would have to repay and/or amend these credit agreements and other debt instruments in order to use this cash to service our consolidated debt. Because of the inherent uncertainty of satisfactorily meeting these requirements or limitations, we do not consider the net assets of our subsidiaries, including our Chinese, South African, Serbian and Argentinian subsidiaries, which are subject to such requirements or limitations to be integral to our liquidity or our ability to service our debt and operational requirements. At December 31, 2022, approximately 1.0 billion of net assets, including approximately 225 million of cash and cash equivalents, were subject to such requirements. The requirements we must comply with to transfer funds out of China, South Africa, Serbia and Argentina have not adversely impacted our ability to make transfers out of those countries.

 Cash Position 
 At December 31, 2022, significant concentrations of cash and cash equivalents held by our international subsidiaries included the following amounts: 
 361 million or 29 in EMEA, primarily France, Belgium and England 161 million or 15 at December 31, 2021), 

316 million or 26 in Americas, primarily Chile, Brazil and Mexico 320 million or 29 at December 31, 2021), and 

301 million or 25 in Asia Pacific, primarily China, India and Australia 317 million or 29 at December 31, 2021). 

We have deposited our cash and cash equivalents and entered into various credit agreements and derivative contracts with financial institutions that we considered to be substantial and creditworthy at the time of such transactions. We seek to control our exposure to these financial institutions by diversifying our deposits, credit agreements and derivative contracts across multiple financial institutions, by setting deposit and counterparty credit limits based on long term credit ratings and other indicators of credit risk such as credit default swap spreads, and by monitoring the financial strength of these financial institutions on a regular basis. We also enter into master netting agreements with counterparties when possible. By controlling and monitoring exposure to financial institutions in this manner, we believe that we effectively manage the risk of loss due to nonperformance by a financial institution. However, we cannot provide assurance that we will not experience losses or delays in accessing our deposits or lines of credit due to the nonperformance of a financial institution. Our inability to access our cash deposits or make draws on our lines of credit, or the inability of a counterparty to fulfill its contractual obligations to us, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition or results of operations in the period in which it occurs. 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 521 million in 2022, decreasing 541 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 1,062 million in 2021. 
 The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities reflects a net increase in cash used for working capital of 330 million and a 12 million decrease in operating income from our SBUs, which includes a non-cash year-over-year benefit of 110 million related to the amortization of the Cooper Tire inventory fair value step-up in 2021. These decreases were partially offset by lower rationalization payments of 102 million, lower cash payments for transaction and other costs related to the Cooper Tire acquisition of 40 million, lower pension contributions and direct payments of 31 million, and lower cash payments for income taxes of 27 million. The remainder of the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a net unfavorable change of 250 million in Balance Sheet accounts for Compensation and Benefits, Other Assets and Liabilities and Other Current Liabilities. 
 The net increase in cash used for working capital reflects a decrease in cash provided by Accounts Payable - Trade of 237 million and an increase in cash used for Inventory of 60 million and Accounts Receivable of 33 million. These changes were driven by the impact of the current year inflationary cost trends described above on our manufacturing operations and pricing. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used for investing activities was 914 million in 2022, compared to 2,793 million in 2021. The 1,879 million decrease in cash used for investing activities primarily relates to the 1,856 million cash component of the purchase price, net of cash and restricted cash acquired, for the acquisition of Cooper Tire in 2021 and cash proceeds of 108 million in 2022 related to the sale and leaseback transaction in Americas. Capital expenditures were 1,061 million in 2022, increasing 80 million, compared to 981 million in 2021, primarily due to the addition of Cooper Tire's capital expenditures for the full year. Beyond expenditures required to sustain our facilities, capital expenditures in 2022 and 2021 primarily related to the modernization and expansion of tire manufacturing facilities around the world. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 575 million in 2022, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 1,309 million in 2021. The 734 million decrease reflects lower net borrowings of 824 million, primarily due to borrowings in 2021 used to fund a portion of the Cooper Tire acquisition, partially offset by an increase in net cash provided by other financing transactions, primarily due to an increase in our liability to remit cash from factored account receivables to the purchaser of those receivables. No cash dividends were paid in 2022 or 2021. 
 Credit Sources 
 In aggregate, we had total credit arrangements of 11,806 million available at December 31, 2022, of which 4,035 million were unused, compared to 11,628 million available at December 31, 2021, of which 4,345 million were unused. At December

 Table of Contents 
 
 31, 2022, we had long term credit arrangements totaling 10,925 million, of which 3,566 million were unused, compared to 10,624 million and 3,785 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2022, we had short term committed and uncommitted credit arrangements totaling 881 million, of which 469 million were unused, compared to 1,004 million and 560 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021. The continued availability of the short term uncommitted arrangements is at the discretion of the relevant lender and may be terminated at any time. 
 Outstanding Notes 
 At December 31, 2022, we had 5,560 million of outstanding notes, compared to 5,591 million at December 31, 2021. 
 2.75 Billion Amended and Restated First Lien Revolving Credit Facility due 2026 
 On September 15, 2022, we amended our 2.75 billion first lien revolving credit facility to change the base interest rate from LIBOR to SOFR. Our first lien revolving credit facility is available in the form of loans or letters of credit. Up to 800 million in letters of credit and 50 million of swingline loans are available for issuance under the facility. Subject to the consent of the lenders whose commitments are to be increased, we may request that the facility be increased by up to 250 million. The facility matures on June 8, 2026. Based on our current liquidity, amounts drawn under this facility bear interest at SOFR plus 125 basis points. 
 Availability under the facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is based on (i) eligible accounts receivable and inventory of The Goodyear Tire Rubber Company and certain of its U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries, (ii) the value of our principal trademarks in an amount not to exceed 400 million, (iii) the value of eligible machinery and equipment, and (iv) certain cash in an amount not to exceed 275 million. To the extent that our eligible accounts receivable, inventory and other components of the borrowing base decline in value, our borrowing base will decrease and the availability under the facility may decrease below 2.75 billion. In addition, if the amount of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under the facility exceeds the borrowing base, we would be required to prepay borrowings and/or cash collateralize letters of credit sufficient to eliminate the excess. As of December 31, 2022, our borrowing base was above the facility's stated amount of 2.75 billion. 
 At December 31, 2022, we had no borrowings and 3 million of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2021, we had no borrowings and 19 million of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility. 
 800 Million Amended and Restated Senior Secured European Revolving Credit Facility due 2028 
 On October 12, 2022, we amended and restated our European revolving credit facility. Significant changes to the European revolving credit facility include extending the maturity to January 14, 2028 and changing the base interest rate for loans denominated in U.S. dollars from LIBOR to SOFR. 
 The European revolving credit facility consists of (i) a 180 million German tranche that is available only to Goodyear Germany GmbH and (ii) a 620 million all-borrower tranche that is available to Goodyear Europe B.V. GEBV ), Goodyear Germany and Goodyear Operations S.A. Up to 175 million of swingline loans and 75 million in letters of credit are available for issuance under the all-borrower tranche. Subject to the consent of the lenders whose commitments are to be increased, we may request that the facility be increased by up to 200 million. Amounts drawn under this facility will bear interest at SOFR plus 150 basis points for loans denominated in U.S. dollars, EURIBOR plus 150 basis points for loans denominated in euros, and SONIA plus 150 basis points for loans denominated in pounds sterling. Undrawn amounts under the facility are subject to an annual commitment fee of 25 basis points. 
 At December 31, 2022, there were no borrowings outstanding under the German tranche, 374 million 350 million) of borrowings outstanding under the all-borrower tranche and no letters of credit outstanding under the European revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2021, we had no borrowings and no letters of credit outstanding under the European revolving credit facility. 
 Each of our first lien revolving credit facility and our European revolving credit facility have customary representations and warranties including, as a condition to borrowing, that all such representations and warranties are true and correct, in all material respects, on the date of the borrowing, including representations as to no material adverse change in our business or financial condition since December 31, 2020 under the first lien facility and December 31, 2021 under the European facility. 
 Accounts Receivable Securitization Facilities (On-Balance Sheet) 
 GEBV and certain other of our European subsidiaries are parties to a pan-European accounts receivable securitization facility that expires in 2027. The terms of the facility provide the flexibility to designate annually the maximum amount of funding available under the facility in an amount of not less than 30 million and not more than 450 million. For the period from October 19, 2021 through October 19, 2022, the designated maximum amount of the facility was 300 million. For the period from October 20, 2022 through October 18, 2023, the designated maximum amount of the facility remains at 300 million. 
 38 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 The facility involves an ongoing daily sale of substantially all of the trade accounts receivable of certain GEBV subsidiaries. These subsidiaries retain servicing responsibilities. Utilization under this facility is based on eligible receivable balances. 
 The funding commitments under the facility will expire upon the earliest to occur of: (a) October 19, 2027, (b) the non-renewal and expiration (without substitution) of all of the back-up liquidity commitments, (c) the early termination of the facility according to its terms (generally upon an Early Amortisation Event (as defined in the facility), which includes, among other things, events similar to the events of default under our first lien revolving credit facility; certain tax law changes; or certain changes to law, regulation or accounting standards), or (d) our request for early termination of the facility. The facility s current back-up liquidity commitments will expire on October 18, 2023. 
 At December 31, 2022, the amounts available and utilized under this program totaled 267 million 250 million). At December 31, 2021, the amounts available and utilized under this program totaled 279 million 246 million). The program does not qualify for sale accounting, and accordingly, these amounts are included in Long Term Debt and Finance Leases. 
 Accounts Receivable Factoring Facilities (Off-Balance Sheet) 
 We have sold certain of our trade receivables under off-balance sheet programs. For these programs, we have concluded that there is generally no risk of loss to us from non-payment of the sold receivables. At December 31, 2022, the gross amount of receivables sold was 744 million, compared to 605 million at December 31, 2021. The increase from December 31, 2021 is primarily due to an increase in our accounts receivable as a result of higher sales prices. 
 Letters of Credit 
 At December 31, 2022, we had 229 million in letters of credit issued under bilateral letter of credit agreements and other foreign credit facilities. 
 Supplier Financing 
 We have entered into payment processing agreements with several financial institutions. Under these agreements, the financial institutions act as our paying agents with respect to accounts payable due to our suppliers. These agreements also allow our suppliers to sell their receivables to the financial institutions at the sole discretion of both the supplier and the financial institution on terms that are negotiated between them. We are not always notified when our suppliers sell receivables under these programs. Our obligations to our suppliers, including the amounts due and scheduled payment dates, are not impacted by our suppliers' decisions to sell their receivables under these programs. Agreements for such supplier financing programs totaled up to 920 million and 630 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase from December 31, 2021 is primarily due to the overall increase in our cost base as a result of the Cooper Tire acquisition. 
 Further Information 
 The ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator of LIBOR, ceased publication of U.S. dollar LIBOR USD LIBOR for the one week and two month USD LIBOR tenors on December 31, 2021 and intends to cease publication for all other USD LIBOR tenors on June 30, 2023. We previously identified and evaluated our debt obligations and other contracts that refer to LIBOR and have amended our first lien revolving credit facility and our European revolving credit facility, which constituted the most significant of our LIBOR-based debt obligations and contracts, to replace LIBOR with SOFR. We do not believe that the discontinuation of LIBOR, or its replacement with an alternative reference rate or rates, will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. 
 For a further description of the terms of our outstanding notes, first lien revolving credit facility, European revolving credit facility and pan-European accounts receivable securitization facility, refer to Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 16, Financing Arrangements and Derivative Financial Instruments. 
 Covenant Compliance 
 Our first lien revolving credit facility and some of the indentures governing our notes contain certain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional debt or issue redeemable preferred stock, pay dividends, repurchase shares or make certain other restricted payments or investments, incur liens, sell assets, incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments to us, enter into affiliate transactions, engage in sale and leaseback transactions, and consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. These covenants are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. Our first lien revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our notes also have customary defaults, including cross-defaults to material indebtedness of Goodyear and its subsidiaries. 
 We have an additional financial covenant in our first lien revolving credit facility that is currently not applicable. We become subject to that financial covenant when the aggregate amount of our Parent Company (The Goodyear Tire Rubber Company) and guarantor subsidiaries cash and cash equivalents Available Cash plus our availability under our first lien revolving credit facility is less than 275 million. If this were to occur, our ratio of EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense may not 
 39 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 be less than 2.0 to 1.0 for the most recent period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. As of December 31, 2022, our unused availability under this facility of 2,747 million plus our Available Cash of 174 million totaled 2,921 million, which is in excess of 275 million. 
 In addition, our European revolving credit facility contains non-financial covenants similar to the non-financial covenants in our first lien revolving credit facility that are described above and a financial covenant applicable only to GEBV and its subsidiaries. This financial covenant provides that we are not permitted to allow GEBV s ratio of Consolidated Net GEBV Indebtedness to Consolidated GEBV EBITDA for a period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to be greater than 3.0 to 1.0 at the end of any fiscal quarter. Consolidated Net GEBV Indebtedness is determined net of the sum of cash and cash equivalents in excess of 100 million held by GEBV and its subsidiaries, cash and cash equivalents in excess of 150 million held by the Parent Company and its U.S. subsidiaries, and availability under our first lien revolving credit facility if the ratio of EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense described above is not applicable and the conditions to borrowing under the first lien revolving credit facility are met. Consolidated Net GEBV Indebtedness also excludes loans from other consolidated Goodyear entities. This financial covenant is also included in our pan-European accounts receivable securitization facility. At December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with this financial covenant. 
 Our credit facilities also state that we may only incur additional debt or make restricted payments that are not otherwise expressly permitted if, after giving effect to the debt incurrence or the restricted payment, our ratio of EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense for the prior four fiscal quarters would exceed 2.0 to 1.0. Certain of our senior note indentures have substantially similar limitations on incurring debt and making restricted payments. Our credit facilities and indentures also permit the incurrence of additional debt through other provisions in those agreements without regard to our ability to satisfy the ratio-based incurrence test described above. We believe that these other provisions provide us with sufficient flexibility to incur additional debt necessary to meet our operating, investing and financing needs without regard to our ability to satisfy the ratio-based incurrence test. 
 Covenants could change based upon a refinancing or amendment of an existing facility, or additional covenants may be added in connection with the incurrence of new debt. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the currently applicable material covenants imposed by our principal credit facilities and indentures. 
 The terms Available Cash, EBITDA, Consolidated Interest Expense, Consolidated Net GEBV Indebtedness and Consolidated GEBV EBITDA have the meanings given them in the respective credit facilities. 
 Potential Future Financings 
 In addition to the financing activities described above, we may seek to undertake additional financing actions which could include restructuring bank debt or capital markets transactions, possibly including the issuance of additional debt or equity. Given the inherent uncertainty of market conditions, access to the capital markets cannot be assured. 
 Our future liquidity requirements may make it necessary for us to incur additional debt. However, a substantial portion of our assets are already subject to liens securing our indebtedness. As a result, we are limited in our ability to pledge our remaining assets as security for additional secured indebtedness. In addition, no assurance can be given as to our ability to raise additional unsecured debt. 
 Dividends and Common Stock Repurchase Program 
 Under our primary credit facilities and some of our note indentures, we are permitted to pay dividends on and repurchase our capital stock (which constitute restricted payments) as long as no default will have occurred and be continuing, additional indebtedness can be incurred under the credit facilities or indentures following the payment, and certain financial tests are satisfied. 
 During 2020, we paid cash dividends of 37 million on our common stock. This excludes dividends earned on stock based compensation plans of 1 million. On April 16, 2020, we announced that we suspended the quarterly dividend on our common stock. No cash dividends were paid in 2022 or 2021. 
 We may repurchase shares delivered to us by employees as payment for the exercise price of stock options and the withholding taxes due upon the exercise of stock options or the vesting or payment of stock awards. During 2022, 2021, and 2020, we did not repurchase any shares from our employees. 
 The restrictions imposed by our credit facilities and indentures are not expected to affect our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our capital stock in the future.

 Asset Dispositions 
 The restrictions on asset sales imposed by our material indebtedness have not affected our ability to divest non-core businesses, and those divestitures have not affected our ability to comply with those restrictions. 
 Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information 
 Certain of our subsidiaries, which are listed on Exhibit 22.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are generally holding or operating companies, have guaranteed our obligations under the 800 million outstanding principal amount of 9.5 senior notes due 2025, the 900 million outstanding principal amount of 5 senior notes due 2026, the 700 million outstanding principal amount of 4.875 senior notes due 2027, the 850 million outstanding principal amount of 5 senior notes due 2029, the 550 million outstanding principal amount of 5.25 senior notes due April 2031, the 600 million outstanding principal amount of 5.25 senior notes due July 2031 and the 450 million outstanding principal amount of 5.625 senior notes due 2033 (collectively, the Notes ). 
 The Notes have been issued by The Goodyear Tire Rubber Company (the Parent Company and are its senior unsecured obligations. The Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured obligations and senior to any of our future subordinated indebtedness. The Notes are effectively subordinated to our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the assets securing that indebtedness. The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by each of our wholly-owned U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries that also guarantee our obligations under our first lien revolving credit facility (such guarantees, the Guarantees and, such guaranteeing subsidiaries, the Subsidiary Guarantors ). The Guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior unsecured obligations of our Subsidiary Guarantors. The Guarantees are effectively subordinated to existing and future secured indebtedness of the Subsidiary Guarantors to the extent of the assets securing that indebtedness. 
 The Notes are structurally subordinated to all of the existing and future debt and other liabilities, including trade payables, of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes (the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries ). The Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries will have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay amounts due under the Notes or to make funds available to pay those amounts. Certain Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries are limited in their ability to remit funds to us by means of dividends, advances or loans due to required foreign government and/or currency exchange board approvals or limitations in credit agreements or other debt instruments of those subsidiaries. 
 The Subsidiary Guarantors, as primary obligors and not merely as sureties, jointly and severally irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee on a senior unsecured basis the performance and full and punctual payment when due of all obligations of the Parent Company under the Notes and the related indentures, whether for payment of principal of or interest on the Notes, expenses, indemnification or otherwise. The Guarantees of the Subsidiary Guarantors are subject to release in limited circumstances only upon the occurrence of certain customary conditions. 
 Although the Guarantees provide the holders of Notes with a direct unsecured claim against the assets of the Subsidiary Guarantors, under U.S. federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of U.S. state fraudulent transfer laws, in certain circumstances a court could cancel a Guarantee and order the return of any payments made thereunder to the Subsidiary Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of its creditors. 
 A court might take these actions if it found, among other things, that when the Subsidiary Guarantors incurred the debt evidenced by their Guarantee (i) they received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the incurrence of the debt and (ii) any one of the following conditions was satisfied: 
 the Subsidiary Guarantor was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the incurrence; 

the Subsidiary Guarantor was engaged in a business or transaction for which its remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital; or 

the Subsidiary Guarantor intended to incur, or believed (or reasonably should have believed) that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay as those debts matured. 

In applying the above factors, a court would likely find that a Subsidiary Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for its Guarantee, except to the extent that it benefited directly or indirectly from the issuance of the Notes. The determination of whether a guarantor was or was not rendered insolvent when it entered into its guarantee will vary depending on the law of the jurisdiction being applied. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if the sum of its debts (including contingent or unliquidated debts) is greater than all of its assets at a fair valuation or if the present fair salable value of its assets is less than the amount that will be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent or unliquidated debts, as they mature.

 Table of Contents 
 
 Under Canadian federal bankruptcy and insolvency laws and comparable provincial laws on preferences, fraudulent conveyances or other challengeable or voidable transactions, the Guarantees could be challenged as a preference, fraudulent conveyance, transfer at undervalue or other challengeable or voidable transaction. The test to be applied varies among the different pieces of legislation, but as a general matter these types of challenges may arise in circumstances where: 
 such action was intended to defeat, hinder, delay, defraud or prejudice creditors or others; 

such action was taken within a specified period of time prior to the commencement of proceedings under Canadian bankruptcy, insolvency or restructuring legislation in respect of a Subsidiary Guarantor, the consideration received by the Subsidiary Guarantor was conspicuously less than the fair market value of the consideration given, and the Subsidiary Guarantor was insolvent or rendered insolvent by such action and (in some circumstances, or) such action was intended to defraud, defeat or delay a creditor; 

such action was taken within a specified period of time prior to the commencement of proceedings under Canadian bankruptcy, insolvency or restructuring legislation in respect of a Subsidiary Guarantor and such action was taken, or is deemed to have been taken, with a view to giving a creditor a preference over other creditors or, in some circumstances, had the effect of giving a creditor a preference over other creditors; or 

a Subsidiary Guarantor is found to have acted in a manner that was oppressive, unfairly prejudicial to or unfairly disregarded the interests of any shareholder, creditor, director, officer or other interested party. 

In addition, in certain insolvency proceedings a Canadian court may subordinate claims in respect of the Guarantees to other claims against a Subsidiary Guarantor under the principle of equitable subordination if the court determines that (1) the holder of Notes engaged in some type of inequitable or improper conduct, (2) the inequitable or improper conduct resulted in injury to other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holder of Notes and (3) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the relevant solvency statute. 
 If a court canceled a Guarantee, the holders of Notes would no longer have a claim against that Subsidiary Guarantor or its assets. 
 Each Guarantee is limited, by its terms, to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor without rendering the Guarantee, as it relates to that Subsidiary Guarantor, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally.

(1) Debt obligations include Notes Payable and Overdrafts, and excludes the impact of deferred financing fees, unamortized discounts, and a fair value step-up related to the Cooper Tire acquisition. 

(2) The minimum lease payments for finance lease obligations are 759 million. 

(3) These amounts represent future interest payments related to our existing debt obligations and finance leases based on fixed and variable interest rates specified in the associated debt and lease agreements. The amounts provided relate only to existing debt obligations and do not assume the refinancing or replacement of such debt or future changes in variable interest rates. 

(4) Operating lease obligations have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of 11 million, 9 million, 7 million, 4 million, 2 million and 3 million in each of the periods above, respectively, for a total of 36 million. Payments, net of minimum sublease rentals, total 1,292 million. The present value of the net operating lease payments, including sublease rentals, is 991 million. The operating leases relate to, among other things, real estate, vehicles, data processing equipment and miscellaneous other assets. No asset is leased from any related party. 

(5) The obligation related to pension benefits is actuarially determined and is reflective of obligations as of December 31, 2022. Although subject to change, the amounts set forth in the table represent the mid-point of the range of our expected contributions for funded U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, plus expected cash funding of direct participant payments to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans. 

We made significant contributions to fully fund our U.S. pension plans in 2013 and 2014. We have no minimum funding requirements for our funded U.S. pension plans under current ERISA law or the provisions of our USW collective bargaining agreement, including a provision which requires us to maintain an annual ERISA funded status for the Goodyear hourly U.S. pension plan of at least 97 . 
 Future U.S. pension contributions will be affected by our ability to offset changes in future interest rates with returns from our asset portfolios and any changes to ERISA law. For further information on the U.S. pension investment strategy, refer to Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 18, Pension, Other Postretirement Benefits and Savings Plans. 
 Future non-U.S. contributions are affected by factors such as: 
 future interest rate levels, 

the amount and timing of asset returns, and 

how contributions in excess of the minimum requirements could impact the amount and timing of future contributions. 

(6) The payments presented above are expected payments for the next 10 years. The payments for other postretirement benefits reflect the estimated benefit payments of the plans using the provisions currently in effect. Under the relevant summary plan descriptions or plan documents, we have the right to modify or terminate the plans. The obligation related to other postretirement benefits is actuarially determined on an annual basis. 

(7) The payments for workers compensation obligations are based upon recent historical payment patterns on claims. The present value of anticipated claims payments for workers compensation is 187 million. 

(8) Binding commitments are for raw materials, capital expenditures, utilities, and various other types of contracts. The obligations to purchase raw materials include supply contracts at both fixed and variable prices. Those with variable prices are based on index rates for those commodities at December 31, 2022. 

44 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 (9) These amounts primarily represent expected payments with interest for uncertain income tax positions as of December 31, 2022. We have reflected them in the period in which we believe they will be ultimately settled based upon our experience with these matters. 

Additional other long term liabilities include items such as general and product liabilities, environmental liabilities and miscellaneous other long term liabilities. These other liabilities are not contractual obligations by nature. We cannot, with any degree of reliability, determine the years in which these liabilities might ultimately be settled. Accordingly, these other long term liabilities are not included in the above table. 
 In addition, pursuant to certain long term agreements, we will purchase varying amounts of certain raw materials and finished goods at agreed upon base prices that may be subject to periodic adjustments for changes in raw material costs and market price adjustments, or in quantities that may be subject to periodic adjustments for changes in our or our suppliers' production levels. These contingent contractual obligations, the amounts of which cannot be estimated, are not included in the table above. 
 We do not engage in the trading of commodity contracts or any related derivative contracts. We generally purchase raw materials and energy through short term, intermediate and long term supply contracts at fixed prices or at formula prices related to market prices or negotiated prices. We may, however, from time to time, enter into contracts to hedge our energy costs. 
 We have an agreement to provide a revolving loan commitment to TireHub, LLC of up to 100 million. At December 31, 2022, 17 million was drawn on this commitment. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 An off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has: 
 made guarantees, 

retained or held a contingent interest in transferred assets, 

undertaken an obligation under certain derivative instruments, or 

undertaken any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the company, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with the company. 

We have entered into certain arrangements under which we have provided guarantees that are off-balance sheet arrangements. Those guarantees totaled 32 million at December 31, 2022. For further information about our guarantees, refer to Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 20, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes to the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates, based on currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may alter such estimates and affect our results of operations and financial position in future periods. Our critical accounting policies relate to: 
 acquisitions, 

general and product liability and other litigation, 

workers compensation, 

goodwill and intangible assets, 

deferred tax asset valuation allowances and uncertain income tax positions, and 

pensions and other postretirement benefits. 

Acquisitions. We allocate the cost of an acquired business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess value of the purchase price for an acquired business over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. The valuation of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results. We use a variety of information sources to determine the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities including: third-party appraisers for the values and lives of property, identifiable intangibles and inventories; and actuaries and other third-party specialists for defined benefit pension plans, workers' compensation and general and product liabilities. Goodwill is assigned to reporting units as of the date of the related acquisition. If goodwill is assigned to more than one reporting unit, we utilize a method that is consistent with the manner in which the amount of goodwill in a business combination is determined. Transaction costs related to the acquisition of a business are expensed as incurred. 
 We estimate the fair value of acquired customer relationships using the multi-period excess earnings method. Fair value is estimated as the present value of the benefits anticipated from ownership of the asset, in excess of the returns required on the investment in contributory assets which are necessary to realize those benefits. The intangible asset s operating margins are determined as the residual earnings after quantifying operating margins from contributory assets. Assumptions used in these calculations are considered from a market participant perspective and include revenue growth rates, operating margins, contributory asset charges, customer attrition rates and discount rates. 
 We estimate the fair value of trade names (definite and indefinite) using the relief from royalty method, which calculates the cost savings associated with owning rather than licensing the assets. Assumed royalty rates are applied to projected revenue for the remaining useful lives of the assets to estimate the royalty savings. Assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of a trade name include revenue growth rates, including a terminal growth rate, the royalty rate and the discount rate. 
 While we use our best estimates and assumptions, fair value estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Any adjustments required after the measurement period are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. 
 Future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our acquisition valuations and intangible asset and goodwill impairment testing, including discount rates or future operating results and related cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values in the future. An increase in discount rates, a reduction in projected cash flows or a combination of the two could lead to a reduction in the estimated fair values, which may result in impairment charges that could materially affect our financial statements in any given year. 
 General and Product Liability and Other Litigation. We have recorded liabilities for both asserted and unasserted claims totaling 412 million, including related legal fees expected to be incurred, for potential product liability and other tort claims, including asbestos claims, at December 31, 2022. General and product liability and other litigation liabilities are recorded based on management s assessment that a loss arising from these matters is probable. If the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record the amount of the estimated loss. If the loss is estimated within a range and no point within the range is more probable than another, we record the minimum amount in the range. As additional information becomes available, any potential liability related to these matters is assessed and the estimates are revised, if necessary. Loss ranges are based upon the specific facts of each claim or class of claims and are determined after review by counsel. Court rulings on our cases or similar cases may impact our assessment of the probability and our estimate of the loss, which may have an impact on our reported results of operations, financial position and liquidity. We record receivables for insurance recoveries related to our litigation claims when it is probable that we will receive reimbursement from the insurer. Specifically, we are a defendant in numerous lawsuits alleging various asbestos-related personal injuries purported to result from alleged exposure to asbestos in certain products previously manufactured by us or present in certain of our facilities. Typically, these lawsuits have been brought against multiple defendants in federal and state courts.

 We periodically, and at least annually, update, using actuarial analyses, our existing reserves for pending claims, including a reasonable estimate of the liability associated with unasserted asbestos claims, and estimate our receivables from probable insurance recoveries. In determining the estimate of our asbestos liability, we evaluated claims over the next ten-year period. Due to the difficulties in making these estimates, analysis based on new data and/or changed circumstances arising in the future may result in an increase in the recorded obligation, and that increase may be significant. We had recorded gross liabilities for both asserted and unasserted asbestos claims, inclusive of defense costs, totaling 125 million at December 31, 2022. 
 We maintain certain primary and excess insurance coverage under coverage-in-place agreements, and also have additional excess liability insurance with respect to asbestos liabilities. We record a receivable with respect to such policies when we determine that recovery is probable and we can reasonably estimate the amount of a particular recovery. This determination is based on consultation with our outside legal counsel and takes into consideration agreements with certain of our insurance carriers, the financial viability and legal obligations of our insurance carriers, and other relevant factors. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we recorded a receivable related to asbestos claims of 70 million, and we expect that approximately 55 of asbestos claim related losses would be recoverable through insurance through the period covered by the estimated liability. Of this amount, 11 million was included in Current Assets as part of Accounts Receivable at December 31, 2022. The recorded receivable consists of an amount we expect to collect under coverage-in-place agreements with certain primary and excess insurance carriers as well as an amount we believe is probable of recovery from certain of our other excess insurance carriers. Although we believe these amounts are collectible under primary and certain excess policies today, future disputes with insurers could result in significant charges to operations. 
 Workers Compensation. We have recorded liabilities, on a discounted basis, of 187 million for anticipated costs related to U.S. workers compensation claims at December 31, 2022. The costs include an estimate of expected settlements on pending claims, defense costs and a provision for claims incurred but not reported. These estimates are based on our assessment of potential liability using an analysis of available information with respect to pending claims, historical experience and current cost trends. The amount of our ultimate liability in respect of these matters may differ from these estimates. We periodically, and at least annually, update our loss development factors based on actuarial analyses. The liability is discounted using the risk-free rate of return. 
 For further information on general and product liability and other litigation, and workers compensation, refer to Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 20, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities. 
 Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an indicator of impairment is present. Intangible assets subject to amortization are tested only if a triggering event would require evaluation. Goodwill and Intangible Assets totaled 1,014 million and 1,004 million, respectively, at December 31, 2022. 
 We test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on at least an annual basis, with the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary or to perform a quantitative assessment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset to its carrying amount. Under the qualitative assessment, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50 that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. If under the quantitative assessment the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, then an impairment loss will be recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value. 
 At October 31, 2022, after considering the results of our most recent quantitative annual testing for each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset, results of valuations related to the acquisition of Cooper Tire, the capital markets environment, macroeconomic conditions, tire industry competition and trends, our results of operations, and other factors, we concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets were less than their respective carrying values and, therefore, did not perform a quantitative analysis. 
 Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowances and Uncertain Income Tax Positions. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (the Act was signed into law in the U.S. The Act includes a new 15 corporate alternative minimum tax CAMT ). This CAMT applies to tax years beginning after December 31, 2022 for companies with average annual adjusted financial statement income over the previous three years in excess of 1 billion. For 2023, we do not anticipate this CAMT will apply to us due to the significant pandemic-driven losses we incurred in 2020. As allowed, we elected to not consider the estimated impact of potential future CAMT obligations for purposes of assessing valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets. 
 At both December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, our valuation allowances on certain of our U.S. federal, state and local net deferred tax assets totaled 26 million and our valuation allowances on our foreign net deferred tax assets totaled 1.0 billion.

 We record a reduction to the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized. The valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing future profitability by year, including the impact of tax planning strategies, relative to the expiration dates, if any, of the assets. 
 We consider both positive and negative evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance. The weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it may be objectively verified. Current and cumulative financial reporting results are a source of objectively verifiable evidence. We give operating results during the most recent three-year period a significant weight in our analysis. We typically only consider forecasts of future profitability when positive cumulative operating results exist in the most recent three-year period. We perform scheduling exercises to determine if sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character exists in the periods required in order to realize our deferred tax assets with limited lives (such as tax loss carryforwards and tax credits) prior to their expiration. We also consider prudent tax planning strategies (including an assessment of their feasibility) to accelerate taxable income if required to utilize expiring deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance is not required to the extent that, in our judgment, positive evidence exists with a magnitude and duration sufficient to result in a conclusion that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized. 
 At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had approximately 1.1 billion and 1.2 billion of U.S. federal, state and local net deferred tax assets, respectively, inclusive of valuation allowances totaling 26 million in each year primarily for state tax loss carryforwards with limited lives. Approximately 700 million of these U.S. net deferred tax assets have unlimited lives and approximately 400 million have limited lives and expire between 2023 and 2042. In the U.S., we have a cumulative loss for the three-year period ended December 31, 2022. However, as the three-year cumulative loss in the U.S. is driven by business disruptions created by the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily in 2020, and only includes the favorable impact of the Cooper Tire acquisition since the Closing Date, we also considered other objectively verifiable information in assessing our ability to utilize our net deferred tax assets, including continued favorable overall volume trends in the tire industry and our tire volume compared to 2020 levels. In addition, the Cooper Tire acquisition has generated significant incremental domestic earnings since the Closing Date and provides opportunities for cost and other operating synergies to further improve our U.S. profitability. 
 At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, our U.S. net deferred tax assets described above include approximately 230 million and 340 million, respectively, of foreign tax credits with limited lives. Our earnings and forecasts of future profitability, taking into consideration recent trends, along with three significant sources of foreign income, provide us sufficient positive evidence that we will be able to utilize these net foreign tax credits which expire through 2032. Our sources of foreign income are (1) 100 of our domestic profitability can be re-characterized as foreign source income under current U.S. tax law to the extent domestic losses have offset foreign source income in prior years, (2) annual net foreign source income, exclusive of dividends, primarily from royalties, and (3) tax planning strategies, including accelerating income on cross border transactions, including sales of inventory or raw materials to our subsidiaries, reducing U.S. interest expense by, for example, reducing intercompany loans through repatriating current year earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and other financing transactions, all of which would increase our domestic profitability. 
 We consider our current forecasts of future profitability in assessing our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, including our foreign tax credits. These forecasts include the impact of recent trends, including various macroeconomic factors such as the impact of higher raw material, transportation, labor and energy costs, on our profitability, as well as the impact of tax planning strategies. These macroeconomic factors possess a high degree of volatility and can significantly impact our profitability. As such, there is a risk that future earnings will not be sufficient to fully utilize our U.S. net deferred tax assets, including our foreign tax credits. However, we believe our forecasts of future profitability along with the three significant sources of foreign income described above provide us sufficient positive, objectively verifiable evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that, at December 31, 2022, our U.S. net deferred tax assets, including our foreign tax credits, will be fully utilized. 
 At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we also had approximately 1.2 billion and 1.3 billion of foreign net deferred tax assets, respectively, and related valuation allowances of approximately 1.0 billion in each year. Our losses in various foreign taxing jurisdictions in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require us to maintain a full valuation allowance against certain of these net foreign deferred tax assets. Most notably, in Luxembourg, we maintain a valuation allowance of 873 million on all of our net deferred tax assets. Each reporting period, we assess available positive and negative evidence and estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize these existing deferred tax assets. We do not believe that sufficient positive evidence required to release valuation allowances having a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations will exist within the next twelve months. 
 We recognize the effects of changes in tax rates and laws on deferred tax balances in the period in which legislation is enacted. We remeasure existing deferred tax assets and liabilities considering the tax rates at which they will be realized. We also consider the effects of enacted tax laws in our analysis of the need for valuation allowances. 
 The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations, including those for transfer pricing. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the 
 48 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary. We also recognize income tax benefits to the extent that it is more likely than not that our positions will be sustained when challenged by the taxing authorities. We derecognize income tax benefits when, based on new information, we determine that it is no longer more likely than not that our position will be sustained. To the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established, or determine we need to derecognize tax benefits recorded in prior periods, our results of operations and effective tax rate in a given period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash, and lead to recognition of expense to the extent the settlement amount exceeds recorded liabilities, resulting in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. To reduce our risk of an unfavorable transfer price settlement, the Company applies consistent transfer pricing policies and practices globally, supports pricing with economic studies and seeks advance pricing agreements and joint audits to the extent possible. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction of expense to the extent the settlement amount is lower than recorded liabilities and, in the case of an income tax settlement, would result in a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. We report interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income tax expense. 
 For additional information regarding uncertain income tax positions and tax valuation allowances, refer to Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 7, Income Taxes. 
 Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. We have recorded liabilities for pension and other postretirement benefits of 94 million and 292 million, respectively, at December 31, 2022. Our recorded liabilities and net periodic costs for pensions and other postretirement benefits are based on a number of assumptions, including: 
 life expectancies, 

retirement rates, 

discount rates, 

long term rates of return on plan assets, 

inflation rates, 

future health care costs, and 

maximum company-covered benefit costs. 

Certain of these assumptions are determined with the assistance of independent actuaries. Assumptions about life expectancies, retirement rates, future compensation levels and future health care costs are based on past experience and anticipated future trends. The discount rate for our U.S. plans is based on a yield curve derived from a portfolio of corporate bonds from issuers rated AA or higher by established rating agencies as of December 31 and is reviewed annually. Our expected benefit payment cash flows are discounted based on spot rates developed from the yield curve. The mortality assumption for our U.S. plans is based on actual historical experience or published actuarial tables, an assumed long term rate of future improvement based on published actuarial tables, and current government regulations related to lump sum payment factors. The long term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is based on estimates of future long term rates of return similar to the target allocation of substantially all fixed income securities. Actual U.S. pension fund asset allocations are reviewed on a monthly basis and the pension fund is rebalanced to target ranges on an as-needed basis. These assumptions are reviewed regularly and revised when appropriate. Changes in one or more of them may affect the amount of our recorded liabilities and net periodic costs for these benefits. Other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age and turnover are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect our experience and expectations for the future. If actual experience differs from expectations, our financial position, results of operations and liquidity in future periods may be affected. 
 The weighted average discount rate used in estimating the total liability for our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans was 5.45 and 5.51 , respectively, at December 31, 2022, compared to 2.82 and 2.87 , respectively, at December 31, 2021. The increase in the discount rate at December 31, 2022 was due primarily to higher yields on highly rated corporate bonds. Interest cost included in our U.S. net periodic pension cost was 133 million in 2022, compared to 94 million in 2021 and 126 million in 2020. Interest cost included in our worldwide net periodic other postretirement benefits cost was 12 million in 2022, compared to 9 million in 2021 and 8 million in 2020.

Changes in general interest rates and corporate (AA or better) credit spreads impact our discount rate and thereby our U.S. pension benefit obligation. Our U.S. pension plans are invested in a portfolio of substantially all fixed income securities designed to offset the impact of future discount rate movements on liabilities for these plans. If corporate (AA or better) interest rates increase or decrease in parallel (i.e., across all maturities), the investment portfolio described above is designed to mitigate a substantial portion of the expected change in our U.S. pension benefit obligation. For example, if corporate (AA or better) interest rates increased or decreased by 0.5 , the investment portfolio described above would be expected to mitigate approximately 85 of the expected change in our U.S. pension benefit obligation. 
 At December 31, 2022, our net actuarial loss included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss AOCL related to global pension plans was 2,271 million, 1,836 million of which related to our U.S. pension plans. The net actuarial loss included in AOCL related to our U.S. pension plans continues to decrease and is primarily due to declines in U.S. discount rates and plan asset losses that occurred prior to the funding and investment de-risking actions we undertook in 2013 and 2014, which were designed to mitigate further actuarial losses of a similar nature. For purposes of determining our 2022 U.S. pension total benefits cost, we recognized 225 million of the net actuarial losses in 2022. We will recognize approximately 100 million of net actuarial losses in 2023 U.S. net periodic pension cost. If our future experience is consistent with our assumptions as of December 31, 2022, actuarial loss recognition over the next few years will remain at an amount near that to be recognized in 2023 before it begins to gradually decline. In addition, if annual lump sum payments from a pension plan exceed annual service and interest cost for that plan, accelerated recognition of net actuarial losses will be required through a settlement in total benefits cost. 
 The actual rate of return on our U.S. pension fund was (17.00 ), 1.80 and 13.20 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, as compared to the expected rate of 4.23 , 3.74 and 4.22 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We use the fair value of our pension assets in the calculation of pension expense for all of our U.S. pension plans. 
 The weighted average amortization period for our U.S. pension plans is approximately 16 years. 
 Service cost of pension plans was recorded in CGS, as part of the cost of inventory sold during the period, or SAG in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, based on the specific roles (i.e., manufacturing vs. non-manufacturing) of employee groups covered by each of our pension plans. In 2022, 2021 and 2020, the amount of service cost included in CGS and SAG is approximately equal. Non-service related net periodic pension costs were recorded in Other (Income) Expense. 
 Globally, we expect our 2023 net periodic pension cost to be 120 million to 140 million, including approximately 30 million of service cost, compared to 73 million in 2022, which included 37 million of service cost. The increase in expected net periodic pension cost is primarily due to higher interest cost from increases in interest rates. 
 The net actuarial gain of 96 million included in AOCL for our worldwide other postretirement benefit plans as of December 31, 2022 is a result of recent increases in discount rates. For purposes of determining 2022 worldwide net periodic other postretirement benefits cost, we recognized 2 million of net actuarial losses in 2022. We will recognize approximately 10 million of net actuarial gains in 2023. If our future experience is consistent with our assumptions as of December 31, 2022, actuarial gain recognition over the next few years will remain at an amount near that to be recognized in 2023.

 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 We utilize derivative financial instrument contracts and nonderivative instruments to manage interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity price risks. We have established a control environment that includes policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval, reporting and monitoring of derivative financial instrument activities. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 The raw materials costs to which our operations are principally exposed include the cost of natural rubber, synthetic rubber, carbon black, fabrics, steel cord and other petrochemical-based commodities. Approximately two-thirds of our raw materials are petroleum-based, the cost of which may be affected by fluctuations in the price of oil. We currently do not hedge commodity prices. We do, however, use various strategies to partially offset cost increases for raw materials, including centralizing purchases of raw materials through our global procurement organization in an effort to leverage our purchasing power, expanding our capabilities to substitute lower cost raw materials, and reducing the amount of material required in each tire. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We continuously monitor our fixed and floating rate debt mix. Within defined limitations, we manage the mix using refinancing. At December 31, 2022, 21 of our debt was at variable interest rates averaging 5.94 compared to 15 at an average rate of 4.01 at December 31, 2021.

The sensitivity of our fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates was determined using current market pricing models. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 We enter into foreign currency contracts in order to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated results of operations and future foreign currency-denominated cash flows. These contracts reduce exposure to currency movements affecting existing foreign currency-denominated assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted transactions resulting primarily from trade purchases and sales, equipment acquisitions, intercompany loans and royalty agreements. Contracts hedging short term trade receivables and payables normally have no hedging designation.

 MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 
 Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
 Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Management conducted an assessment of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 using the framework specified in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) , published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on such assessment, management has concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 The effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGIS TERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Goodyear Tire Rubber Company 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the consolidated financial statements, including the related notes and financial statement schedule, of The Goodyear Tire Rubber Company and its subsidiaries (the Company as listed in the index appearing under Item 8 (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 Basis for Opinions 
 The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or 
 56 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Income Taxes - Valuation of U.S. Deferred Tax Assets Related to Foreign Tax Credits 
 As described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, as of December 31, 2022, the Company has approximately 1.1 billion of U.S. federal, state and local net deferred tax assets, inclusive of valuation allowances totaling 26 million primarily for state tax loss carryforwards with limited lives. Approximately 230 million of these U.S. net deferred tax assets relate to foreign tax credits with limited lives. A valuation allowance is not required to the extent that, in management s judgment, positive evidence exists with a magnitude and duration sufficient to result in a conclusion that it is more likely than not that the Company s deferred tax assets will be realized. As disclosed by management, the valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing future profitability by year, including the impact of tax planning strategies, relative to the expiration dates, if any, of the assets. In the U.S., the Company has a cumulative loss for the three-year period ended December 31, 2022. However, in assessing the Company s ability to utilize its net deferred tax assets, management also considered other objectively verifiable information, including the Company s improvement in its U.S. operating results driven by tire volume recovery compared to 2020 levels as well as the favorable impact of the Cooper Tire Rubber Company acquisition which occurred in 2021. Management determined there was sufficient positive, objectively verifiable evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that, as of December 31, 2022, the U.S. net deferred tax assets related to foreign tax credits will be fully utilized. 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of U.S. deferred tax assets related to foreign tax credits is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in determining whether the U.S. deferred tax assets related to foreign tax credits are more likely than not to be realized in the future and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to management s assessment of the realizability of U.S. deferred tax assets related to foreign tax credits. 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management s assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets related to foreign tax credits, including controls over projections of future profitability by year. These procedures also included, among others (i) evaluating the positive and negative evidence available to support management s assessment of the realizability of U.S. deferred tax assets related to foreign tax credits; (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in management s assessment; and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of management s projections of future profitability by year of the U.S. business. Evaluating the reasonableness of management s projections of future profitability by year of the U.S. business involved considering (i) the current and past performance of the U.S. business; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; (iii) whether tax planning strategies are prudent and feasible; and (iv) the consistency with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.

THE GOODYEAR TIRE RUBBER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 , we adopted an accounting standards update which requires the disclosure of certain types of government assistance that are accounted for by analogizing to a grant model. We do not have material grants to disclose under this new accounting standards update. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued an accounting standards update on the disclosure of supplier finance programs. Entities are required to disclose the key terms of each program, including a description of the payment terms and assets pledged as security or other forms of guarantees, if any, provided for the committed payment to the finance provider or intermediary. In addition, on a quarterly basis, entities are required to disclose the related obligations outstanding at each interim reporting period and where those obligations are presented on the balance sheet and, on an annual basis, entities are also required to disclose a roll-forward of the amount of the obligations outstanding at the end of the reporting period. The standards update is effective retrospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years, except for the roll-forward information, which is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, with early adoption permitted. We are currently assessing the impact of this standards update on our disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

 - days or at the point of sale for our consumer retail locations. Net sales exclude sales, value added and other taxes. Costs to obtain contracts are generally expensed as incurred due to the short term nature of individual contracts. Incidental items that are immaterial in the context of the contract are recognized as expense as incurred. We have elected to recognize the costs incurred for transportation of products to customers as a component of Cost of Goods Sold CGS ). Appropriate provisions are made for uncollectible accounts based on historical loss experience, portfolio duration, economic conditions and credit risk, considering both expected future losses as well as current incurred losses. The adequacy of the allowances are assessed quarterly. Effective January 1, 2020, we adopted, using the modified retrospective adoption approach, an accounting standards update with new guidance related to the accounting for credit losses on financial instruments. Our adoption of this standards update resulted in adjustments in 2020 that decreased Retained Earnings by million, with Accounts Receivable decreasing by million and Deferred Income Taxes increasing by million.

Cash flows associated with derivative financial instruments designated as hedges of identifiable transactions or events are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items. Cash flows associated with derivative financial instruments not designated as hedges are classified as operating activities. Bank overdrafts, if any, are recorded within Notes Payable and Overdrafts. Cash flows associated with bank overdrafts are classified as financing activities. Customer prepayments for products and government grants received that predominately relate to operations are reported as operating activities.

 year to approximately years. Most of our leases include options to extend the lease, with renewal terms ranging fro m to years or more, an d some include options to terminate the lease within year. If it is reasonably certain that an option to extend or terminate a lease will be exercised, that option is considered in the lease term. Leases with an initial term of months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet, and we recognize short-term lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Certain of our lease agreements include variable lease payments, generally based on consumer price indices. Variable lease payments that are assigned to an index are determined based on the initial index at commencement, and the variability based on changes in the index is accounted for as it changes. The variable portion of payments is not included in the initial measurement of the right-of-use asset or lease liability due to the uncertainty of the payment amount and are recorded as lease expense in the period incurred. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for separately. Operating leases are included in Operating Lease Right-of-Use ROU Assets, Operating Lease Liabilities due Within One Year and Operating Lease Liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finance leases are included in Property, Plant and Equipment, Long Term Debt and Finance Leases due Within One Year, and Long Term Debt and Finance Leases on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Generally, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments, unless there is a rate stated in the lease agreement. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Refer to Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 15, Leases. 
 
 Interest Rate Contracts Gains and losses on contracts designated as cash flow hedges are initially deferred and recorded in AOCL. Amounts are transferred from AOCL and recognized in income as Interest Expense in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in income. Gains and losses on contracts designated as fair value hedges are recognized in income in the current period as Interest Expense. Gains and losses on contracts with no hedging designation are recorded in the current period in Other (Income) Expense. Foreign Currency Contracts Gains and losses on contracts designated as cash flow hedges are initially deferred and recorded in AOCL. Amounts are transferred from AOCL and recognized in income in the same period and on the same line that the hedged item is recognized in income. Gains and losses on contracts designated as fair value hedges, excluding premiums and discounts, are recorded in Other (Income) Expense in the current period. Gains and losses on contracts with no hedging designation are also recorded in Other (Income) Expense in the current period. We do not include premiums or discounts on forward currency contracts in our assessment of hedge effectiveness. Premiums and discounts on contracts designated as hedges are recorded in AOCL. The amounts are recognized in the Statement of Operations on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract on the same line that the hedged item is recognized in the Statement of Operations. Net Investment Hedging Nonderivative instruments denominated in foreign currencies are used from time to time to hedge net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Gains and losses on these instruments are deferred and recorded in AOCL as Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments. These gains and losses are only recognized in income upon the complete or partial sale of the related investment or the complete liquidation of the investment. Termination of Contracts Gains and losses (including deferred gains and losses in AOCL) are recognized in Other (Income) Expense when contracts are terminated concurrently with the termination of the hedged position. To the extent that such position remains outstanding, gains and losses are amortized to Interest Expense or to Other (Income) Expense over the remaining life of that position. Gains and losses on contracts that we temporarily continue to hold after the early termination of a hedged position, or that otherwise no longer qualify for hedge accounting, are recognized in Other (Income) Expense. Refer to Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 16, Financing Arrangements and Derivative Financial Instruments. 

million of income related to accrued freight charges in Americas. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2021, we recorded out of period adjustments totaling million of expense, primarily related to the valuation of inventory in Ameri cas. The adjustments relate to prior years and did not have a material effect on any of the periods impacted. 

million and million, respectively, or approximately billion in total (the Merger Consideration ). The cash component of the Merger Consideration less cash and restricted cash of Cooper Tire that was acquired amounted to million. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the Merger Consideration is allocated, as of the Closing Date, to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed of Cooper Tire, which are recognized and measured at fair value based on management s estimates, available information and supportable assumptions that management considers reasonable. During the second quarter of 2022, we finalized our valuation of the identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed. No significant measurement period changes were recorded during the six months ended June 30, 2022. Principal changes since our initial measurement in the second quarter of 2021 included (i) decreasing the value attributed to customer relationships primarily to reflect updated assumptions related to customer attrition rates, (ii) updating the value attributed to trade names to reflect our long-term view of how each acquired brand fits into the overall product portfolio of the combined company and the appropriate royalty rate to value each acquired brand based on expected profitability, (iii) decreasing the value attributed to Property, Plant and Equipment primarily to reflect updated assumptions related to the estimated economic value of certain underlying assets, (iv) decreasing the value attributed to pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities primarily to reflect updated plan population data, (v) increasing the value attributed to a liability for environmental matters primarily to reflect updated estimated lifecycle remediation cost data and recording other liabilities identified during the measurement period, and (vi) a reclassification between Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable to conform to Goodyear's classification of customer rebate and discount program liabilities. These adjustments were recorded net of adjustments to Deferred Tax Liabilities with the corresponding offset recorded to Goodwill, as applicable.

The estimated value of Inventory includes adjustments totaling million, comprised of million, primarily to adjust inventory valued on a last-in, first-out LIFO basis to a current cost basis, and million to step-up inventory to estimated fair value. The fair value step-up was fully amortized to CGS in 2021 as the related inventory was sold, which negatively impacted our 2021 results. We eliminated the LIFO reserve on Cooper Tire s U.S. inventories as we predominately determine the value of our inventory using the first-in, first-out FIFO method. To estimate the fair value of inventory, we considered the components of Cooper Tire s inventory, as well as estimates of selling prices and selling and distribution costs that were based on Cooper Tire s historical experience. The estimated value of Property, Plant and Equipment includes adjustments totaling million to increase the net book value of million to the final fair value estimate of million. This estimate is based on a combination of cost and market approaches, including appraisals, and expectations as to the duration of time we expect to realize benefits from those assets. The estimated fair values of identifiable intangible assets acquired were prepared using an income valuation approach, which requires a forecast of expected future cash flows either through the use of the relief-from-royalty method or the multi-period excess earnings method. The estimated useful lives are based on our historical experience and expectations as to the duration of time we expect to realize benefits from those assets.

All of the goodwill was allocated to our Americas segment. The goodwill consists of expected future economic benefits that will arise from expected future product sales, operating efficiencies and other synergies that may result from the acquisition, including income tax synergies, and is not deductible for tax purposes. Since the Closing Date, Cooper Tire s operating results have been included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. As such, during the year ended December 31, 2022, our results included the results of Cooper Tire for the entire period, while the comparable period in 2021 only included the results of Cooper Tire subsequent to the Closing Date. Our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 include an incremental million and million of Net Sales and CGS, respectively, from Cooper Tire during the first six months of 2022. As a result of our ongoing integration efforts, particularly as it relates to administrative functions and financing activities, it is not practical to disclose Income before Income Taxes or Net Income separately for Cooper Tire. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred transaction and other costs in connection with the acquisition of Cooper Tire totaling million, including million for a commitment fee related to a bridge term loan facility that was not utilized to finance the transaction and million related to the post-combination settlement of certain Cooper Tire incentive compensation awards during the second quarter of 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2021, million of these costs are included in Other (Income) Expense, with the remainder included in CGS and SAG in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. There were no transaction-related costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2022. Pro forma financial information

(1) million in 2020 exclude million of benefit plan curtailments and settlements recorded in Rationalizations in the Statements of Operations. 

 In January 2023, we approved a rationalization plan and workforce reorganization that will result in an approximately reduction in salaried staff globally, or about positions, in response to a challenging industry environment and cost pressure driven by inflation. In certain foreign countries, relevant portions of the rationalization plan remain subject to consultation with employee representative bodies. We expect to substantially complete the rationalization plan during the first and second quarters of 2023 and estimate total pre-tax charges associated with this action to be approximately million, of which approximately million are expected to be cash charges primarily for associate-related and other exit costs, with the remainder representing non-cash charges primarily for accelerated depreciation and other asset-related charges. We have million accrued related to this plan at December 31, 2022 and expect to record a majority of the remaining charges in the first quarter of 2023. A majority of the cash outflows associated with this plan relate to cash severance payments that are expected to be paid during the first half of 2023. In January 2023, we also approved a plan to discontinue our operations in Russia. Total expected net pre-tax charges related to this plan are million, of which million are expected to be cash charges for associate-related and other exit costs. The remainder of the charges represent non-cash charges primarily related to the write-off of accounts receivable and other asset-related charges. The plan will result in approximately job reductions.

 2022, we approved a plan to close Cooper Tire's Melksham, United Kingdom tire manufacturing facility Melksham to address long-standing competitiveness issues at this plant. Total expected charges related to this plan are to be between million and million, of which million to million are expected to be cash charges primarily for associate-related and other exit costs, with the remainder representing non-cash charges primarily for accelerated depreciation and other asset-related charges. The plan will result in approximately job reductions. We have m illion accrued related to this plan at December 31, 2022 and expect that a majority of the remaining charges and related cash outflows will be recognized through 2023. During the third quarter of 2022, we approved a plan related to the exit of our retail operations in South Africa. Total expected charges related to this plan are million, primarily representing cash charges for associate-related and other exit costs. The plan will result in approximately job reductions. We have million accrued related to this plan at December 31, 2022, which is expected to be substantially paid through 2023. During the second quarter of 2022, we approved a plan related to the integration of Cooper Tire aimed at reducing duplicative global SAG headcount and closing redundant Cooper Tire warehouse locations in Americas in line with previously announced planned synergies. The plan will result in approximately job reductions. We have million accrued related to this plan at December 31, 2022, which is expected to be substantially paid through 2023. The remainder of the accrual balance at December 31, 2022 is expected to be substantially utilized in the next 12 months and include s million related to plans to reduce SAG headcount, million related to the closed Amiens, France tire manufacturing facility, million related to the permanent closure of our G adsden, Alabama tire manufacturing facility Gadsden ), and various other plans to reduce headcount and improve operating efficiency.

Income tax expense in 2022 was million on income before income taxes of million. In 2022, income tax expense includes net discrete tax expense totaling million, including a charge of million to write off deferred tax assets related to tax loss carryforwards in the UK and a charge of million to establish a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets in Russia, partially offset by a net benefit of million for various other items. In 2021, income tax benefit of million includes net discrete tax benefits totaling million, including a reduction in our valuation allowances of million for certain U.S. deferred tax assets for foreign tax credits and state tax loss carryforwards, a million benefit to adjust our deferred tax assets in England for a second quarter enacted change in the tax rate, a million benefit to reflect an increase in our estimated state tax rate used in calculating our U.S. net deferred tax assets as a result of a change in the overall mix of our earnings by state after including the impact of the acquisition of Cooper Tire, an million benefit related to a favorable court ruling in Brazil, and a net benefit of million for various other items. In 2020, income tax expense of million includes net discrete tax expense totaling million, including the establishment of a million valuation allowance in the U.S. on certain deferred tax assets for foreign tax credits. Discrete tax expense also includes a net charge of million, including a million charge related to a U.S. valuation allowance for state tax loss carryforwards, a million benefit to adjust our deferred tax assets in England for a third quarter enacted change in the tax rate, and various other net charges totaling million. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (the Act was signed into law in the U.S. The Act includes a new corporate alternative minimum tax CAMT ). This CAMT applies to tax years beginning after December 31, 2022 for companies with average annual adjusted financial statement income over the previous three years in excess of 1 billion. For 2023, we do not anticipate this CAMT will apply to us due to the significant pandemic-driven losses we incurred in 2020. As allowed, we elected to not consider the estimated impact of potential future CAMT obligations for purposes of assessing valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets. We consider both positive and negative evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance. The weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it may be objectively verified. Current and cumulative financial reporting results are a source of objectively verifiable evidence. We give operating results during the most recent three-year period a significant weight in our analysis. We typically only consider forecasts of future profitability when positive cumulative operating results exist in the most recent three-year period. We perform scheduling exercises to determine if sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character exists in the periods required in order to realize our deferred tax assets with limited lives (such as tax loss carryforwards and tax credits) prior to their expiration. We also consider prudent tax planning strategies (including an assessment of their feasibility) to accelerate taxable income if required to utilize expiring deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance is not required to the extent that, in our judgment, positive evidence exists with a magnitude and duration sufficient to result in a conclusion that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had approximately billion and billion of U.S. federal, state and local net deferred tax assets, respectively, inclusive of valuation allowances totaling million in each year primarily for state tax loss carryforwards with limited lives. Approximately million of these U.S. net deferred tax assets have unlimited lives and approximately million have limited lives and expire between . In the U.S., we have a cumulative loss for the three-year period ended December 31, 2022. However, as the three-year cumulative loss in the U.S. is driven by business disruptions created by the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily in 2020, and only includes the favorable impact of the Cooper Tire acquisition since the Closing Date, we also considered other objectively verifiable information in assessing our ability to utilize our net deferred tax assets, including continued favorable overall volume trends in the tire industry and our tire volume compared to 2020 levels. In addition, the Cooper Tire acquisition has generated significant incremental domestic earnings since the Closing Date and provides opportunities for cost and other operating synergies to further improve our U.S. profitability. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, our U.S. net deferred tax assets described above include approximately million and million, respectively, of foreign tax credits with limited lives. Our earnings and forecasts of future profitability, taking into consideration recent trends, along with three significant sources of foreign income, provide us sufficient positive evidence that we will be able to utilize these net foreign tax credits which expire through 2032. Our sources of foreign income are (1) 100 of our domestic profitability can be re-characterized as foreign source income under current U.S. tax law to the extent domestic losses have offset foreign source income in prior years, (2) annual net foreign source income, exclusive of dividends, primarily from royalties, and (3) tax planning strategies, including accelerating income on cross border transactions, including sales of inventory or raw materials to our subsidiaries, reducing U.S. interest expense by, for example, reducing intercompany loans through repatriating current year earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and other financing transactions, all of which would increase our domestic profitability. We consider our current forecasts of future profitability in assessing our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, including our foreign tax credits. These forecasts include the impact of recent trends, including various macroeconomic factors such as the impact of higher raw material, transportation, labor and energy costs, on our profitability, as well as the impact of tax planning strategies. These macroeconomic factors possess a high degree of volatility and can significantly impact our profitability. As such, there is a risk that future earnings will not be sufficient to fully utilize our U.S. net deferred tax assets, including our foreign tax credits. However, we believe our forecasts of future profitability along with the three significant sources of foreign income described above provide us sufficient positive, objectively verifiable evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that, at December 31, 2022, our U.S. net deferred tax assets, including our foreign tax credits, will be fully utilized. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we also had approximately billion and billion of foreign net deferred tax assets, respectively, and related valuation allowances of approximately billion in each year. Our losses in various foreign taxing jurisdictions in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require us to maintain a full valuation allowance against certain of these net foreign deferred tax assets. Most notably, in Luxembourg, we maintain a valuation allowance of million on all of our net deferred tax assets. Each reporting period, we assess available positive and negative evidence and estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize these existing deferred tax assets. We do not believe that sufficient positive evidence required to release valuation allowances having a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations will exist within the next twelve months.

At December 31, 2022, w e had million of tax assets for net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards related to certain foreign subsidiaries. These carryforwards are primarily from countries with unlimited carryforward periods, but include million of tax credit carryforwards in various European countries that are subject to expiration from . A valuation allowance totaling million has been recorded against these and other deferred tax assets where recovery of the asset or carryforward is uncertain. In addition, we had million of federal and million of state tax assets for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.

We are open to examination in the U.S. for 2021 and in Germany from 2018 onward. Generally, for our remaining tax jurisdictions, years from 2017 onward are still open to examination. We have undistributed earnings and profits of our foreign subsid iaries totaling approximately billion at December 31, 2022. We have concluded that no provision for tax in the U.S. is required because substantially all of the remaining undistributed earnings and profits have been or will be reinvested in property, plant and equipment and working capital outside of the U.S. A foreign withholding tax charge of approximately million (net of foreign tax credits) would be required if these earnings and profits were to be distributed to the U.S. Net cash payments for income taxes were million, million and million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Results of operations are measured based on net sales to unaffiliated customers and segment operating income. Each segment exports tires to other segments. The financial results of each segment exclude sales of tires exported to other segments, but include operating income derived from such transactions. Segment operating income is computed as follows: Net sales less CGS (excluding asset write-offs and accelerated depreciation charges) and SAG (including certain allocated corporate administrative expenses). Segment operating income also includes certain royalties and equity in earnings of most affiliates. Segment operating income does not include net rationalization charges, asset sales, goodwill and other asset impairment charges and certain other items.

CREDIT FACILITIES billion Amended and Restated First Lien Revolving Credit Facility due 2026 On September 15, 2022, we amended our billion first lien revolving credit facility to change the base interest rate from LIBOR to SOFR. Our first lien revolving credit facility is available in the form of loans or letters of credit. Up to million in letters of credit and million of swingline loans are available for issuance under the facility. Subject to the consent of the lenders whose commitments are to be increased, we may request that the facility be increased by up to million. Based on our current liquidity, amounts drawn under this facility bear interest at SOFR plus basis points. Our obligations under the facility are guaranteed by most of our wholly-owned U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries. Our obligations under the facility and our subsidiaries' obligations under the related guarantees are secured by first priority security interests in collateral that includes, subject to certain exceptions: U.S. and Canadian accounts receivable and inventory; 

 certain of our U.S. manufacturing facilities; 

 equity interests in our U.S. subsidiaries and up to of the voting equity interests in most of our directly owned foreign subsidiaries; and

To the extent that our eligible accounts receivable, inventory and other components of the borrowing base decline in value, our borrowing base will decrease and the availability under the facility may decrease below billion. In addition, if the amount of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under the facility exceeds the borrowing base, we would be required to prepay borrowings and/or cash collateralize letters of credit sufficient to eliminate the excess. As of December 31, 2022, our borrowing base was above the facility's stated amount of billion. The facility contains covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to (i) incur additional debt or issue redeemable preferred stock, (ii) pay dividends, repurchase shares or make certain other restricted payments or investments, (iii) incur liens, (iv) sell assets, (v) incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments to us, (vi) enter into affiliate transactions, (vii) engage in sale and leaseback transactions, and (viii) consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. These covenants are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. In addition, in the event that the availability under the facility plus the aggregate amount of our Available Cash is less than million, we will not be permitted to allow our ratio of EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense to be less than to for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. Available Cash, EBITDA and Consolidated Interest Expense have the meanings given them in the facility. The facility has customary representations and warranties including, as a condition to borrowing, that all such representations and warranties are true and correct, in all material respects, on the date of the borrowing, including representations as to no material adverse change in our business or financial condition since December 31, 2020.

If Available Cash (as defined in the facility) plus the availability under the facility is greater than million, amounts drawn under the facility will bear interest, at our option, at (i) basis points over SOFR or (ii) basis points over an alternate base rate (the higher of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds effective rate or the overnight bank funding rate plus basis points or (c) SOFR for a one month interest period plus basis points). If Available Cash plus the availability under the facility is equal to or less than million, then amounts drawn under the facility will bear interest, at our option, at (i) basis points over SOFR or (ii) basis points over an alternate base rate. Undrawn amounts under the facility will be subject to an annual commitment fee of basis points.

Up to million of swingline loans and million in letters of credit are available for issuance under the all-borrower tranche. Subject to the consent of the lenders whose commitments are to be increased, we may request that the facility be increased by up to million. Amounts drawn under this facility will bear interest at SOFR plus basis points for loans denominated in U.S. dollars, EURIBOR plus basis points for loans denominated in euros, and SONIA plus basis points for loans denominated in pounds sterling. Undrawn amounts under the facility are subject to an annual commitment fee of basis points. GEBV and certain of its subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, France and Germany provide guarantees to support the facility. GEBV s obligations under the facility and the obligations of its subsidiaries under the related guarantees are secured by security interests in collateral that includes, subject to certain exceptions: the capital stock of the principal subsidiaries of GEBV; and 

 a substantial portion of the tangible and intangible assets of GEBV and certain of its subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, France and Germany, including real property, equipment, inventory, contract rights, intercompany receivables and cash accounts, but excluding accounts receivable and certain cash accounts in subsidiaries that are or may become parties to securitization or factoring transactions. 

 The German guarantors secure the German tranche on a first-lien basis and the all-borrower tranche on a second-lien basis. GEBV and its other subsidiaries that provide guarantees secure the all-borrower tranche on a first-lien basis and generally do not provide collateral support for the German tranche. The Company and its U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries that guarantee our U.S. first lien revolving credit facility described above also provide unsecured guarantees in support of the facility. The facility contains covenants similar to those in our first lien revolving credit facility, with additional limitations applicable to GEBV and its subsidiaries. In addition, under the facility, GEBV s ratio of Consolidated Net GEBV Indebtedness to Consolidated GEBV EBITDA for a period of four consecutive fiscal quarters is not permitted to be greater than 3.0 to 1.0 at the end of any fiscal quarter. Consolidated Net GEBV Indebtedness and Consolidated GEBV EBITDA have the meanings given them in the facility. The facility has customary representations and warranties including, as a condition to borrowing, that all such representations and warranties are true and correct, in all material respects, on the date of the borrowing, including representations as to no material adverse change in our business or financial condition since December 31, 2021. The facility also has customary defaults, including a cross-default to material indebtedness of Goodyear and our subsidiaries. At December 31, 2022, there were borrowings outstanding under the German tranche, million million) of borrowings outstanding under the all-borrower tranche and letters of credit outstanding under the European revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2021, we had borrowings and letters of credit outstanding under the European revolving credit facility. Accounts Receivable Securitization Facilities (On-Balance Sheet) GEBV and certain other of our European subsidiaries are parties to a pan-European accounts receivable securitization facility that expires in 2027. The terms of the facility provide the flexibility to designate annually the maximum amount of funding available under the facility in an amount of not less than million and not more than million. For the period from October 19, 2021 through October 19, 2022, the designated maximum amount of the facility was million. For the period from October 20, 2022 through October 18, 2023, the designated maximum amount of the facility remains at million. The facility involves an ongoing daily sale of substantially all of the trade accounts receivable of certain GEBV subsidiaries. These subsidiaries retain servicing responsibilities. Utilization under this facility is based on eligible receivable balances. The funding commitments under the facility will expire upon the earliest to occur of: (a) October 19, 2027, (b) the non-renewal and expiration (without substitution) of all of the back-up liquidity commitments, (c) the early termination of the facility according to its terms (generally upon an Early Amortisation Event (as defined in the facility), which includes, among other things, events similar to the events of default under our first lien revolving credit facility; certain tax law changes; or certain changes to law, regulation or accounting standards), or (d) our request for early termination of the facility. The facility s current back-up liquidity commitments will expire on October 18, 2023. At December 31, 2022, the amounts available and utilized under this program totaled million million). At December 31, 2021, the amounts available and utilized under this program totaled million million). The program does not qualify for sale accounting, and accordingly, these amounts are included in Long Term Debt and Finance Leases. Accounts Receivable Factoring Facilities (Off-Balance Sheet) We have sold certain of our trade receivables under off-balance sheet programs. For these programs, we have concluded that there is generally no risk of loss to us from non-payment of the sold receivables. At December 31, 2022, the gross amount of receivables sold was million, compared to million at December 31, 2021. The increase from December 31, 2021 is primarily due to an increase in our accounts receivable as a result of higher sales prices. Other Foreign Credit Facilities A Mexican subsidiary and a U.S. subsidiary have a revolving credit facility in Mexico. At December 31, 2022, the amounts available and utilized under this facility were milli on. At December 31, 2021, the amounts available and utilized under this facility were million and million, respectively . The facility ultimately matures on November 22, 2024, has covenants relating to the Mexican and U.S. subsidiaries, and has customary representations and warranties and defaults relating to the Mexican and U.S. subsidiaries' ability to perform their respective obligations under the facility. As of December 31, 2022, SOFR has replaced LIBOR as the base interest rate for all tranches of loans under this facility. Our Chinese subsidiaries have several financing arrangements in China. These facilities contain covenants relating to these Chinese subsidiaries and have customary representations and warranties and defaults relating to these Chinese subsidiaries' ability to perform their respective obligations under these facilities. These facilities are also available for other off-balance sheet utilization, such as letters of credit and bank acceptances.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS We utilize derivative financial instrument contracts and nonderivative instruments to manage interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity price risks. We have established a control environment that includes policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval, reporting and monitoring of derivative financial instrument activities. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Foreign Currency Contracts We enter into foreign currency contracts in order to manage the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated results of operations and future foreign currency-denominated cash flows. These contracts may be used to reduce exposure to currency movements affecting existing foreign currency-denominated assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted transactions resulting primarily from trade purchases and sales, equipment acquisitions, intercompany loans and royalty agreements. Contracts hedging short term trade receivables and payables normally have no hedging designation.

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, these outstanding foreign currency derivatives had notional amounts of million and million, respectively, and were primarily related to intercompany loans. Other (Income) Expense included net transaction gains on derivatives of million i n 2022 and net transaction gains on derivatives of million in 2021. These amounts were substantially offset in Other (Income) Expense by the effect of changing exchange rates on the underlying currency exposures.

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, these outstanding foreign currency derivatives had notional amounts of million an d million, respectively, and primarily related to U.S. dollar denominated intercompany transactions. Based on our current forecasts, we believe that it is probable that the underlying hedge transactions will occur within an appropriate time frame in order to continue to qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment. We enter into master netting agreements with counterparties. The amounts eligible for offset under the master netting agreements are not material and we have elected a gross presentation of foreign currency contracts in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Reclassification adjustment for amounts recognized in CGS

There were no estimated deferred gains at December 31, 2022 that are expected to be reclassified to earnings within the next twelve months. The counterparties to our foreign currency contracts were considered by us to be substantial and creditworthy financial institutions that were recognized market makers at the time we entered into those contracts. We seek to control our credit exposure to these counterparties by diversifying across multiple counterparties, by setting counterparty credit limits based on long term credit ratings and other indicators of counterparty credit risk such as credit default swap spreads, and by monitoring the financial strength of these counterparties on a regular basis. We also enter into master netting agreements with counterparties when possible. By controlling and monitoring exposure to counterparties in this manner, we believe that we effectively manage the risk of loss due to nonperformance by a counterparty. However, the inability of a counterparty to fulfill its contractual obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial position or results of operations in the period in which it occurs.

million in assets and million in estimated obligations on a termination accounting basis as of December 31, 2022, is expected to be completed in the first half of 2023. During 2022, we recognized settlement charges of million in Other (Income) Expense, primarily related to our U.S. pension plans. The settlement charges resulted from total lump sum payments exceeding annual service and interest cost of the applicable plans. During 2021, we recognized settlement charges o f million in Other (Income) Expense, p rimarily related to our salaried U.S pension plans. The settlement charges resulted from total lump sum payments exceeding annual service and interest cost of the applicable plans. During 2020, we recognized settlement charges of million, primarily related to certain of our salaried U.S. pension plans, of which million was recognized in Other (Income) Expense and million in Rationalizations, related to the exit of employees under approved rationalization plans. The settlement charges resulted from total lump sum payments exceeding annual service and interest cost of the applicable plans. In addition, we recognized a curtailment credit of million in Other (Income) Expense during 2020, related to a freeze of one of our non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. During 2020, we also recognized a curtailment credit of million related to one of our Other Postretirement Benefits plans and a termination benefits charge of million related to our hourly U.S. pension plan in Rationalizations, related to the exit of employees under approved rationalization plans. Our U.K. pension plan obligations include million to recognize the estimated impact to our plans from court rulings in 2018 and later, involving a plan with similar features to ours that was sponsored by another company, that required equal guaranteed minimum pension benefits for males and females. The increases were primarily recognized in AOCL during 2018 as prior service cost from plan amendments. The actual impact to our U.K. pension plans is still subject to the finalization of plan amendments in response to the court rulings and potential future judicial decisions.

Service cost is recorded in CGS or SAG. Other components of net periodic cost are recorded in Other (Income) Expense. Net curtailments, settlements and termination benefits are recorded in Other (Income) Expense or Rationalizations if related to a rationalization plan. We use the fair value of pension assets in the calculation of pension expense for all plans. Total benefits cost for our other postretirement benefits was million , million and million for our U.S. plans in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and million, million and million for our non-U.S. plans in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act provides plan sponsors a federal subsidy for certain qualifying prescription drug benefits covered under the sponsor s postretirement health care plans. Our other postretirement benefits cost is presented net of this subsidy, which is less than million annually.)

For 2022, a weighted average discount rate of was used to determine interest cost for the U.S. pension plans. This rate was derived from spot rates along a yield curve developed from a portfolio of corporate bonds from issuers rated AA or higher by established rating agencies as of December 31, 2021, applied to our expected benefit payment cash flows. For our non-U.S. locations, a weighted average discount rate of was used. This rate was developed based on the nature of the liabilities and local environments, using available bond indices, yield curves, projected cash flows, and long term inflation. For 2022, an assumed weighted average long term rate of return of was used for the U.S. pension plans. In developing the long term rate of return, we evaluated input from our pension fund consultant on asset class return expectations, including determining the appropriate rate of return for our plans, which are substantially invested in fixed income securities. For our non-U.S. locations, an assumed weighted average long term rate of return of was used. Input from local pension fund consultants concerning asset class return expectations and long term inflation form the basis of this assumption. The U.S. pension plan mortality assumption is based on our actual historical experience or published actuarial tables, and expected future mortality improvements based on published actuarial tables. For our non-U.S. locations, mortality assumptions are based on published actuarial tables which include projections of future mortality improvements.

Our pension investment policies recognize the long-term nature of pension liabilities, and are primarily designed to offset the future impact of discount rate movements on the funded status for our plans, with target return-seeking allocations based upon given funded ratio levels. All assets are managed externally according to target asset allocation guidelines we have established. Manager guidelines prohibit the use of any type of investment derivative without our prior approval. Portfolio risk is controlled by having managers comply with guidelines, establishing the maximum size of any single holding in their portfolios, and using managers with different investment styles. We periodically undertake asset and liability modeling studies to determine the appropriateness of the investments. The portfolio of our U.S. pension plan assets includes holdings of global high quality and high yield fixed income securities, fixed income, equity and real estate collective trust funds, short term interest bearing deposits, and private equity and credit securities. The target asset allocation of our U.S. pens ion plans is in duration-matched fixed income securities, in private equity and credit securities, in equity securities and in real estate funds . Actual U.S. pension fund asset allocations are reviewed on a periodic basis and the pension funds are rebalanced to target ranges on an as needed basis. The portfolios of our non-U.S. pension plans include holdings of global high quality and high yield fixed income securities, U.S. and non-U.S. equities, real estate funds, insurance contracts, repurchase agreements, and short term interest bearing deposits. The weighted average target asset allocation of the non-U.S. pension funds is approximately fixed income, equities and in real estate funds.

Total Plan Assets 

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Plans did not directly hold any of our common stock. The classification of fair value measurements within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement. Investments that are measured at Net Asset Value NAV as a practical expedient to estimate fair value are not classified in the fair value hierarchy. Under the practical expedient approach, the NAV is based on the fair value of the underlying investments held by each fund less its liabilities. This practical expedient would not be used when it is determined to be probable that the fund will sell the investment for an amount different than the reported NAV. The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to total plan assets. Valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured at fair value are as follows: Cash and Short Term Securities: Cash and cash equivalents consist of U.S. and foreign currencies. Foreign currencies are reported in U.S. dollars based on currency exchange rates readily available in active markets. Short term securities held in commingled funds or pooled separate accounts are valued at the NAV of units held at year end, as determined by the investment manager. 

 Equity Securities: Common and preferred stock, which are held in non-U.S. companies, are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded. Commingled funds are primarily valued at the NAV of units held at year end, as determined by a pricing vendor or the fund family. Mutual funds are valued at the NAV of shares held at year end, as determined by the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded, or a pricing vendor or the fund family if an active market is not available. Partnership interests in private equity securities are priced based on valuations using the partnership s latest available financial statements and the plan's percent ownership, adjusted for any cash transactions which occurred between the date of those financial statements and our year end. 

 Debt Securities: Corporate and government bonds, including asset backed securities, are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded, or based on institutional bid evaluations using proprietary models if an active market is not available. Repurchase agreements are valued at the contract price plus accrued interest. These secured borrowings are collateralized by government bonds held by the non-U.S. plans and have maturities less than one year. Commingled funds are primarily valued at the NAV of units held at year end, as determined by a pricing vendor or the fund family. Mutual funds are valued at the NAV of shares held at year end, as determined by the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded, or a pricing vendor or the fund family if an active market is not available. Partnership interests in private credit securities are priced based on valuations using the partnership s latest available financial statements and the plan's percent ownership, adjusted for any cash transactions which occurred between the date of those financial statements and our year end. 

 Alternatives: Commingled funds, which primarily consist of real estate funds, are valued based on the NAV as determined by the fund manager using the most recent financial information available. Partnership interests are invested in real estate and priced based on valuations using the partnership's latest available financial statements and the plan's percent ownership, adjusted for any cash transactions which occurred between the date of those financial statements and our year end. Other investments primarily include derivative financial instruments, which are valued using independent pricing sources which utilize industry standard derivative valuation models. Directed insurance contracts are valued as reported by the issuer, based on discounted cash flows using weighted average discount rates of and at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

 The methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

 . A total of million shares of our com mon stock may be issued in respect of grants made under the 2022 Performance Plan. Any shares of common stock that are subject to awards of stock options or SARs will be counted as share for each share granted for purposes of the aggregate share limit and any shares of common stock that are subject to any other awards will be counted as shares for each share granted for purposes of the aggregate share limit. In addition, shares of common stock that are subject to awards issued under the 2022 Performance Plan or certain prior Plans that expire according to their terms or are forfeited, terminated, canceled or surrendered or are settled, or can be paid, only in cash, or are surrendered in payment of taxes associated with such awards (other than stock options or SARs) will be available for issuance pursuant to a new award under the 2022 Performance Plan. Shares issued under our Plans are usually issued from shares of our common stock held in treasury. Stock Options Grants of stock options and SARs (collectively referred to as options under the Plans generally have a graded vesting period of whereby one-fourth of the awards vest on each of the first four anniversaries of the grant date, an exercise price equal to the fair market value of share of our common stock on the date of grant (i.e., the closing market price on that date) and a contractual term of . The exercise of tandem SARs cancels an equivalent number of stock options and, conversely, the exercise of stock options cancels an equivalent number of tandem SARs. Option grants are cancelled on, or days following, termination of employment unless termination is due to retirement, death or disability under certain circumstances, in which case, all outstanding options vest fully and remain outstanding for a term set forth in the related grant agreement.

 million at both December 31, 2022 and 2021, for anticipated costs related to various environmental matters, primarily the remediation of numerous waste disposal sites and certain properties sold by us. Of these amounts, million and million were included in Other Current Liabilities at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The costs include legal and cons ulting fees, site studies, the design and implementation of remediation plans, post-remediation monitoring and related activities, and will be paid over several years. The amount of our ultimate liability in respect of these matters may be affected by several uncertainties, primarily the ultimate cost of required remediation and the extent to which other responsible parties contribute. We have limited potential insurance coverage for future environmental claims. Since many of the remediation activities related to environmental matters vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site and the associated costs for each vary depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, in some cases we cannot reasonably estimate a range of possible losses. Although it is not possible to estimate with certainty the outcome of all of our environmental matters, management believes that potential losses in excess of current reserves for environmental matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. Workers Compensation We have recorded liabilities, on a discounted basis, totaling million and milli on for anticipated costs related to workers compensation at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Of these amounts, million an d mill ion were included in Current Liabilities as part of Compensation and Benefits at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The costs include an estimate of expected settlements on pending claims, defense costs and a provision for claims incurred but not reported. These estimates are based on our assessment of potential liability using an analysis of available information with respect to pending claims, historical experience, and current cost trends. The amount of our ultimate liability in respect of these matters may differ from these estimates. We periodically, and at least annually, update our loss development factors based on actuarial analyses. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the liability was discounted using a risk-free rate of return. At December 31, 2022, we estimate that it is reasonably possible that the liability could exceed our recorded amounts by approximately million. General and Product Liability and Other Litigation We have recorded liabilities for both asserted and unasserted claims totaling million and million, including related legal fees expected to be incurred, for potential product liability and other tort claims, including asbestos claims, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Of these amounts, million and million were included in Other Current Liabilities at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The amounts recorded were estimated based on an assessment of potential liability using an analysis of available information with respect to pending claims, historical experience and, where available, recent and current trends. Based upon that assessment, at December 31, 2022, we do not believe that estimated reasonably possible losses associated with general and product liability claims in excess of the amounts recorded will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. However, the amount of our ultimate liability in respect of these matters may differ from these estimates. We have recorded an indemnification asset within Accounts Receivable of million and within Other Assets of million for Sumitomo Rubber Industries, Ltd.'s SRI obligation to indemnify us for certain product liability claims related to products manufactured by a formerly consolidated joint venture entity, subject to certain caps and restrictions. Asbestos. We are a defendant in numerous lawsuits alleging various asbestos-related personal injuries purported to result from alleged exposure to asbestos in certain products manufactured by us or present in certain of our facilities. Typically, these lawsuits have been brought against multip le defendants in state and federal courts. To date, we have disposed of approximately clai ms by defending, obtaining a dismissal thereof, or entering into a settlement. The sum of our accrued asbestos-related liability and gross payments to date, including legal costs, by us and our insurers totaled million and million through December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

We periodically, and at least annually, review our existing reserves for pending claims, including a reasonable estimate of the liability associated with unasserted asbestos claims, and estimate our receivables from probable insurance recoveries. We recorded gross liabilities for both asserted and unasserted claims, inclusive of defense costs, totaling million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In determining the estimate of our asbestos liability, we evaluated claims over the next period. Due to the difficulties in making these estimates, analysis based on new data and/or a change in circumstances arising in the future may result in an increase in the recorded obligation, and that increase could be significant. We maintain certain primary and excess insurance coverage under coverage-in-place agreements, and also have additional excess liability insurance with respect to asbestos liabilities. After consultation with our outside legal counsel and giving consideration to agreements with certain of our insurance carriers, the financial viability and legal obligations of our insurance carriers and other relevant factors, we determine an amount we expect is probable of recovery from such carriers. We record a receivable with respect to such policies when we determine that recovery is probable and we can reasonably estimate the amount of a particular recovery. We recorded an insurance receivable related to asbestos claims of million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We expect that approximat ely of asbestos claim related losses would be recoverable through insurance during the ten-year period covered by the estimated liability. Of these amounts, million and million were included in Current Assets as part of Accounts Receivable at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The recorded receivable consists of an amount we expect to collect under coverage-in-place agreements with certain primary and excess insurance carriers as well as an amount we believe is probable of recovery from certain of our other excess insurance carriers. We believe that, at December 31, 2022, we had approximately million in excess level policy limits applicable to indemnity and defense costs for asbestos products claims under coverage-in-place agreements. We also had additional unsettled excess level policy limits potentially applicable to such costs. In addition, we had coverage under certain primary policies for indemnity and defense costs for asbestos products claims under remaining aggregate limits pursuant to a coverage-in-place agreement, as well as coverage for indemnity and defense costs for asbestos premises claims pursuant to coverage-in-place agreements. We believe that our reserve for asbestos claims, and the receivable for recoveries from insurance carriers recorded in respect of these claims, reflects reasonable and probable estimates of these amounts. The estimate of the liabilities and assets related to pending and expected future asbestos claims and insurance recoveries is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, but not limited to, changes in: the litigation environment, 

 federal and state law governing the compensation of asbestos claimants, 

 recoverability of receivables due to potential insolvency of insurance carriers, 

 our approach to defending and resolving claims, and 

 the level of payments made to claimants from other sources, including other defendants and 524(g) trusts. 

 As a result, with respect to both asserted and unasserted claims, it is reasonably possible that we may incur a material amount of cost in excess of the current reserve; however, such amounts cannot be reasonably estimated. Coverage under insurance policies is subject to varying characteristics of asbestos claims including, but not limited to, the type of claim (premise vs. product exposure), alleged date of first exposure to our products or premises and disease alleged. Recoveries may also be limited by insurer insolvencies or financial difficulties. Depending upon the nature of these characteristics or events, as well as the resolution of certain legal issues, some portion of the insurance may not be accessible by us. Other Actions We are currently a party to various claims, indirect tax assessments and legal proceedings in addition to those noted above. If management believes that a loss arising from these matters is probable and can reasonably be estimated, we record the amount of the loss, or the minimum estimated liability when the loss is estimated using a range and no point within the range is more probable than another. As additional information becomes available, any potential liability related to these matters is assessed and the estimates are revised, if necessary. Based on currently available information, management believes that the ultimate outcome of these matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or overall trends in results of operations. Our recorded liabilities and estimates of reasonably possible losses for the contingent liabilities described above are based on our assessment of potential liability using the information available to us at the time and, where applicable, any past experience and recent and current trends with respect to similar matters. Our contingent liabilities are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable judicial or administrative decisions could occur which we did not anticipate. Such an unfavorable decision could include monetary damages, fines or other penalties or an injunction prohibiting us from taking certain actions or selling certain products. If such an unfavorable decision were to occur, it could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations in the period in which the decision occurs or in future periods. Income Tax Matters The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary. We also recognize income tax benefits to the extent that it is more likely than not that our positions will be sustained when challenged by the taxing authorities. We derecognize income tax benefits when based on new information we determine that it is no longer more likely than not that our position will be sustained. To the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established, or determine we need to derecognize tax benefits recorded in prior periods, our results of operations and effective tax rate in a given period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash, and lead to recognition of expense to the extent the settlement amount exceeds recorded liabilities and, in the case of an income tax settlement, result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction of expense to the extent the settlement amount is lower than recorded liabilities and, in the case of an income tax settlement, would result in a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. While the Company applies consistent transfer pricing policies and practices globally, supports transfer prices through economic studies, seeks advance pricing agreements and joint audits to the extent possible and believes its transfer prices to be appropriate, such transfer prices, and related interpretations of tax laws, are occasionally challenged by various taxing authorities globally. We have received various tax assessments challenging our interpretations of applicable tax laws in various jurisdictions. Although we believe we have complied with applicable tax laws, have strong positions and defenses and have historically been successful in defending such claims, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in the case we are unsuccessful in the defense of existing or future claims. Binding Commitments and Guarantees At December 31, 2022, we had binding commitments for raw materials, capital expenditures, utilities and various other types of contracts totaling approximately billion, of which approximately billion relate to commitments on contracts that extend beyond 2023. In addition, we have other contractual commitments, the amounts of which cannot be estimated, pursuant to certain long term agreements under which we will purchase varying amounts of certain raw materials and finished goods at agreed upon base prices that may be subject to periodic adjustments for changes in raw material costs and market price adjustments, or in quantities that may be subject to periodic adjustments for changes in our or our suppliers' production levels. We have off-balance sheet financial guarantees and other commitments totaling million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We issue guarantees to financial institutions or other entities on behalf of certain of our affiliates, lessors or customers. We generally do not receive a separate premium as consideration for, and do not require collateral in connection with, the issuance of these guarantees. In 2015, as a result of the dissolution of the global alliance with SRI, we issued a guarantee of million to an insurance company related to SRI's obligation to pay certain outstanding workers' compensation claims of a formerly consolidated joint venture entity. As of December 31, 2022, this guarantee amount has been reduced to million. We have concluded the probability of our performance to be remote and, therefore, have not recorded a liability for this guarantee. While there is no fixed duration of this guarantee, we expect the amount of this guarantee to continue to decrease over time as the formerly consolidated joint venture entity pays its outstanding claims. If our performance under these guarantees is triggered by non-payment or another specified event, we would be obligated to make payment to the financial institution or the other entity, and would typically have recourse to the affiliate, lessor, customer, or SRI. We are unable to estimate the extent to which our affiliates , lessors , customers , or SRI's assets would be adequate to recover any payments made by us under the related guarantees. We have an agreement to provide a revolving loan commitment to TireHub, LLC of up to million. At December 31, 2022, million was drawn on this commitment. At December 31, 2021, funds were drawn on this commitment. Indemnifications At December 31, 2022, we were a party to various agreements under which we had assumed obligations to indemnify the counterparties from certain potential claims and losses. These agreements typically involve standard commercial activities undertaken by us in the normal course of business; the sale of assets by us; the formation or dissolution of joint venture businesses to which we had contributed assets in exchange for ownership interests; and other financial transactions. Indemnifications provided by us pursuant to these agreements relate to various matters including, among other things, environmental, tax and shareholder matters; intellectual property rights; government regulations; employment-related matters; and dealer, supplier and other commercial matters. Certain indemnifications expire from time to time, and certain other indemnifications are not subject to an expiration date. In addition, our potential liability under certain indemnifications is subject to maximum caps, while other indemnifications are not subject to caps. Although we have been subject to indemnification claims in the past, we cannot reasonably estimate the number, type and size of indemnification claims that may arise in the future. Due to these and other uncertainties associated with the indemnifications, our maximum exposure to loss under these agreements cannot be estimated. We have determined that there are no indemnifications or guarantees other than liabilities for which amounts are already recorded or reserved in our consolidated financial statements under which it is probable that we have incurred a liability. Warranty We recorded millio n and million for potential claims under warranties offered by us at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, the majority of which are recorded in Other Current Liabilities.
