INTRODUCTORY NOTE 

Forward-Looking Statements 

This report includes statements that are, or
may be deemed, forward-looking statements. In some cases, these statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking
terminology such as believes, estimates, anticipates, expects, plans, 
 intends, may, could, might, will, should, approximately, 
 potential or negative or other variations of those terms or comparable terminology, although not all forward-looking statements
contain these words. 

Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties
because they relate to events, developments, and circumstances relating to Sensus Healthcare, Inc., our industry, and/or general economic
or other conditions that may or may not occur in the future or may occur on longer or shorter timelines or to a greater or lesser degree
than anticipated. Although we believe that we have a reasonable basis for each forward-looking statement contained in this report, forward-looking
statements are not guarantees of future performance, and our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the
development of the industry in which we operate, may differ materially from the forward looking statements contained in this report, as
a result of the following factors, among others: our ability to maintain profitability; our ability to obtain and maintain the intellectual

developments and will address them in future disclosures, if applicable. 

In addition, even if future events, developments,
and circumstances are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this report, they may not be predictive of results
or developments in future periods. Any forward-looking statements that we make in this report speak only as of the date of such statement,
and we undertake no obligation to update such statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report, except as
may be required by applicable law.

PART I. 

Item 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

Sensus Healthcare, Inc. (together, with its subsidiary,
unless the context otherwise indicates, Sensus, we, us, our, or the Company is a medical device company committed to providing highly effective, non-invasive, and cost-effective treatments for both oncological
and non-oncological skin conditions. The Company uses a proprietary low-energy X-ray technology known as superficial radiation therapy SRT ), which is based on over a decade of dedicated research and development, and has successfully incorporated SRT into
a portfolio of treatment devices: the SRT-100 TM , SRT-100+ TM and SRT-100 Vision TM . To date, SRT
technology has been used to effectively and safely treat oncological and non-oncological skin conditions in hundreds of thousands of
patients around the world. 

On February 25, 2022, the Company sold the assets
comprising its Sculptura TM product for 15 million in cash. Additional information regarding this transaction can be found
in the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on March
3, 2022. 

Our business was organized in 2010 and the Company,
incorporated in Delaware, completed its initial public offering in 2016. The Company operates as one segment from its corporate headquarters
located in Boca Raton, Florida. For further information see Note 1, Description of the Business , in the notes to the consolidated
financial statements in Part II, Item 8. 

Our Products and Services 

SRT is the Company s core technology. As
of December 31, 2022, the Company had installed 686 units in 18 countries, primarily in the United States. 

SRT-100 

The SRT-100 is a photon x-ray low energy SRT
system that provides patients an alternative to surgery for treating non-melanoma skin cancers, including basal cell and squamous cell
skin cancers and other skin conditions such as keloids. The SRT-100 is especially effective in treating primary lesions that would otherwise
be difficult to treat or require extensive surgery involving sensitive areas of the head and neck regions, such as the fold in the nose,
eyelids, lips, corner of the mouth, and the lining of the ear, that would otherwise lead to a less than desirable cosmetic outcome. SRT
treatment procedures do not require the use of anesthetics and eliminate the need for skin grafting. The Company believes that the SRT-100
provides healthcare providers and patients with a safe, virtually painless, and substantially non-scarring treatment option for non-melanoma
skin cancer and other skin conditions, such as keloids. It allows dermatologists to retain non-melanoma skin cancer patients, rather
than referring them to specialists, while offering radiation oncologists an alternative to costly linear accelerator based treatments
with a process that is less invasive, more time-efficient, and improves practice economics. Revenue is primarily derived from sales of
our SRT-100 product line. The SRT-100 provides the following clinical and functional advantages: 

Easy touch automatic set-up
 procedure, including automatic x-ray tube warm-up procedures; 

Specially designed control
 console for medical physicists and service technicians, providing integrated safety and back-up timer controls, automatic system
 conditioning procedures, calibration, x-ray output verification and system parameters, including last treatment status information; 

Advanced patient record
 management with integrated enterprise workflow management; 

Compact mobile design with
 a small 30 x 30 footprint and unique scissor x-ray tube arm movements, providing a large range of motion for patient
 access and treatment; and 

High reliability and MTBF
 mean time between failures performance that provides availability for patients and practitioners and lowers the total
 cost of ownership. 

1 

SRT-100 Vision 

The SRT-100 Vision provides customers with additional
options compared to the SRT-100 base model. These additional options allow for dedicated treatment planning and full treatment progression
documentation in a patient s record. The SRT-100 Vision provides the user with a unique SRT-tailored treatment planning application
that integrates an embedded high frequency ultrasound imaging module, volumetric tumor analysis, beam margins planning, and comprehensive
dosimetry parameters. This allows the user to precisely and more accurately plan and prescribe the patient-specific treatment course
to maximize patient outcomes and workflow efficiency. The SRT-100 Vision also offers a comprehensive control console and workflow management
that provides full record and treatment tracing, operator-level access and functional control, audio-visual patient and treated lesion
monitoring, and advanced dosimetry setting and tracing. 

SRT-100+ 

The SRT-100+ offers all the same features as
the SRT-100, with the addition of: 

An expanded energy range
 for customized, more precise treatment 

Remote diagnostics, including
 operation tracking 

New X-ray tube with extended
 functionality and performance 

Advanced console and enhanced
 system mobility to optimize clinical practice 

Sentinel service program 

The Company offers the Sentinel service program,
which provides customers comprehensive protection for their systems. The Sentinel service program covers all parts and labor for the
period of the contract and one annual preventive maintenance session that includes cooling system maintenance, high-voltage loop maintenance,
filters and system cleaning, and system touch-ups, should these be required during the preventative maintenance session. 

Sensus also provides, through the program, turnkey
pre-and post-sale services that include the following: 

Providing a pre-install
 kit for the contractors to prepare the treatment room; 

Room retrofit and shielding; 

System shipping coordination
 and installation; 

System commissioning by
 a medical physicist (through a national physics network); 

System registration with
 the state and daily workflow documentation preparation; 

Clinical applications training
 with the customer s SRT staff; and 

Treating the first scheduled
 patients with our customers (onsite applications training).

Other products 

Transdermal Infusion
(TDI) 

TransDermal Infusion is a Class II FDA cleared
biophysical alternative used to infuse high weight molecule modalities into the dermis (skin) for medical and aesthetic purposes without
the use of needles. The Company began distributing this product, which is manufactured in Italy, in 2022. The Company distributed 23
systems during 2022. 

Lasers 

Sensus also distributes laser devices, for the
aesthetic dermatology market, which includes applications for hair removal, vascular lesions, acne treatment, epidermal pigment removal
(including removal of spots, freckles, and tattoos), skin toning, and skin rejuvenation. 

Consumables 

The Company sells disposable lead shielding replacements,
disposable radiation safety items, such as aprons and eye shields, ultrasound probe film, and disposable applicator tips, which are used
to treat various sized lesions and different areas of the body. Additionally, TDI requires the purchase of disposable tips. 

Competition 

The medical device industry is highly competitive
and subject to rapid technological change and is significantly affected by new product introductions and market activities of other participants.
Current marketed products, and any future products that the Company commercializes, will compete against healthcare providers who use
other methods of treatment for the same disease or condition. 

In order to grow its business, Sensus must be
able to compete effectively for market acceptance of its products. Key competitive factors include improved outcomes for medical conditions,
acceptance by doctors treating non-melanoma skin cancer and keloids, acceptance by the patient community, ease of use and reliability,
product price and qualification for reimbursement, technical leadership and superiority, effective marketing and distribution, speed
to market, and quality of client service. 

Sales and Marketing 

The Company s focus is mainly on two primary
markets, private dermatology practices and radiation oncologists in both private and hospital settings. The Company currently employs
a multi-tier sales strategy to optimize geographic coverage and focus on its key markets. This multi-tier sales model uses a direct sales
force in the U.S., as well as international dealers and distributors. Sensus plans to continue selling and marketing the Company s
products to both the dermatology and radiation oncology markets concurrently. 

Dermatology Market 

Private dermatology practices in the U.S. represent
the point of entry for most non-melanoma skin cancer patients. The Company believes its SRT products offer dermatologists a competitive
advantage by allowing them to retain patients for the treatment of non-melanoma skin cancer, rather than having to refer them to other
professionals. In addition to non-melanoma skin cancers, the Company has had an FDA clearance to treat keloid scars since 2014. The Company s
SRT has been used by over 100 U.S. dermatology practices in the treatment of keloids. Since 2017, it is also being used to treat keloids
in China. 

Radiation Oncology Market 

For licensed radiation oncologists in the U.S.,
the Company believes its SRT products offer a simpler, faster method of treatment with a better overall patient experience. SRT offers
oncologists the ability to free up more expensive radiation equipment, such as linear accelerators, for more complex procedures while
providing patients with effective, non-invasive treatment options for non-melanoma skin cancer. 

Other Markets 

Sensus believes that the plastic surgery and
laser aesthetic markets present growth opportunities. With FDA clearance to treat keloids through SRT, plastic surgeons are recognizing
the opportunity to be able to provide an effective treatment solution for this benign tumor. Additionally, the Company believes that
plastic surgeons view the non-melanoma skin cancer market as a growth opportunity that can supplement their existing services. 

3 

Manufacturing and Supply 

The Company currently uses third parties located
in the U.S. to manufacture products. In 2010, the Company entered into a manufacturing agreement with RbM Services, LLC RbM pursuant to which RbM agreed to manufacture SRT-100 products. Under this agreement, the Company pays a fixed price per unit, subject
to annual adjustments due to changes in the cost of materials. The agreement renews for successive one-year periods unless either party
notifies the other party in writing, at least 60 days prior to the anniversary date of the agreement, that it will not renew the agreement.
The Company or manufacturer may terminate the agreement upon 90 days prior written notice. 

The Company maintains internal policies, procedures,
and supplier management processes designed to ensure that RbM meets applicable quality standards, including FDA and International Organization
for Standardization, or ISO, requirements. To date, Sensus has not experienced any difficulty in locating and obtaining the materials
necessary to meet the demand for our products, and believes manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet global market demand for our
products for the foreseeable future. 

The Company believes this third-party manufacturing
relationship allows us to work with a supplier that has well-developed specific competencies while minimizing our capital investment,
controlling costs, and shortening cycle times, all of which has allowed us to compete effectively with our competitors. Sensus also works
with other third parties that it believes could be relied upon if we needed to change suppliers. 

The Company has a single preferred supplier for
the x-ray tubes and other major components used in its products. The Company believes this supplier has superior products; however, products
of alternate suppliers would be adequate for Sensus s products and therefore the Company does not anticipate any material disruptions
to the supply of major components if there were a change in suppliers. 

Intellectual Property 

The Company actively seeks to protect the intellectual
property that is important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents that cover Sensus s products. The Company
also relies on trademarks to enhance, build, and maintain the integrity of the Sensus brand. 

The Company possesses seven issued U.S. and Global
patents. The patents relate to technology that is pertinent to the Company. 

The following patents were issued between August
2007 and September 2008: 

U.S. Patent No. 7,372,940:

 Hybrid Ultrasound-Guided Superficial Radiotherapy System and Method (expires August 14, 2038) 

4 

One patent application was pending at December
31, 2022. 

The Company also owns six U.S. trademark registrations
(expiring from 2025 through 2031). 

The Company also relies on trade secrets and
other unpatented proprietary rights to develop and maintain a competitive position. The Company seeks to protect unpatented proprietary
rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and others who may have access
to this proprietary information. The Company requires all employees to execute invention assignment agreements with respect to inventions
arising from their employment. 

The Company can provide no assurance that any
patents or trademarks will be issued or registered as a result of our pending or future applications for such intellectual property.
Even if any such patents or trademarks are ultimately issued or registered, they, or any of the Company s other intellectual property,
may not provide any meaningful protection or competitive advantage. Intellectual property could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented,
infringed upon, or misappropriated. In addition, third parties have claimed, and in the future may claim, that the Company or customers,
licensees, or other parties indemnified by the Company are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. 

Government Regulation 

Sensus s business is subject to extensive federal,
state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to the protection of the environment, health, and safety. Some
of the pertinent laws and regulations have not been definitively interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions
are open to a variety of subjective interpretations. In addition, these laws and regulations and their interpretations are subject to
change, and new laws may be enacted. Both federal and state governmental agencies continue to subject the healthcare industry to intense
regulatory scrutiny, including heightened civil and criminal enforcement efforts. The Company believes that its business operations and
relationships with customers and suppliers are structured to comply with all applicable legal requirements. However, it is possible that
governmental entities or other third parties could interpret these laws and regulations differently and assert otherwise. Discussed below
are statutes and regulations that are most relevant to the Company s business. For the two-year period ended December 31, 2022,
we incurred approximately 1.3 million in expenses related to regulatory compliance and quality standards. 

FDA Regulation of Medical Devices 

The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act FDCA and FDA regulations establish a comprehensive system for the regulation of medical devices intended for human use. Sensus s medical
device products are subject to these regulations, as well as other federal, state, and local laws and regulations. The FDA is also responsible
for the overall enforcement of quality, regulatory, and statutory requirements governing medical devices. 

FDA classifies medical devices into one of three
classes Class I, Class II, or Class III depending on their level of risk and the types of controls that are necessary
to assure device safety and effectiveness. The class assignment determines the type of premarketing submission or application, if any,
that will be required before marketing in the U.S. The Company s medical devices are Class II devices under the FDA s classification
system. Class II devices are deemed to present a moderate risk and are devices for which general controls alone are not sufficient
to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Medical devices in Class II are subject to both general controls and special
controls e.g., special labeling, compliance with industry standards, and post market surveillance. Unless exempted, Class
II devices typically require FDA clearance before marketing, through the premarket notification 510(k) process, in accordance
with 21 CFR, Part 807 requirements. 

Unless it is exempt from premarket review requirements,
a medical device must receive marketing authorization from the FDA prior to being commercially distributed in the U.S. For Class II devices,
510(k) is the most common pathway to obtain market authorization in the US. 

510(k) pathway 

We have previously received FDA 510(k) clearances
for our SRT-100, SRT-100 Vision, and SRT-100+ (Class II) products through the 510(k) pathway due to the requirement for special controls.
To date, other available US regulatory pathways have not been appropriate for our developed products and may involve extended review
periods. 

5 

Ongoing FDA regulation 

After a device is entered into commerce in the
U.S., regardless of its classification or premarket pathway, numerous additional FDA requirements generally apply. These include: 

Establishment registration
 and device listing requirements, in accordance with 21 CFR, Part 807; 

Quality System Regulation
 requirements, which govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling,
 storage, installation, and servicing of finished devices, in accordance with 21 CFR, Part 820; 

Labeling requirements,
 which mandate the inclusion of certain content in device labels and labeling, and which also prohibit the promotion of products for
 uncleared or unapproved (i.e., off-label uses; 

Medical Device Reporting
 regulation, which requires that manufacturers and importers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a
 death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to
 recur, in accordance with 21 CFR, Part 803; and 

Reports of Corrections
 and Removals regulation, which requires that manufacturers and importers (a) report to the FDA recalls (i.e., corrections or removals)
 if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health,
 and (b) keep records of recalls that they determine to be not reportable, all in accordance with 21 CFR, Part 806. 

The FDA enforces these requirements by inspection
and market surveillance. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which
may include, but is not limited to, the following sanctions: 

Issuance of Form 483 observations
 (also known as minor non-conformances during a facilities inspection; 

Untitled letters or warning
 letters; 

Fines, injunctions, and
 civil penalties; 

Consent Decrees, which
 forces improvements in the quality management system through the use of the federal courts; 

Recall or seizure of products; 

Operating restrictions,
 partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 

Refusing 510(k) clearance
 or premarket approval of new products; 

Withdrawing 510(k) clearance
 or premarket approvals that are already granted; and 

Criminal prosecution. 

The Company is subject to unannounced establishment
inspections by the FDA, as well as other regulatory agencies overseeing the implementation of and compliance with applicable state public
health regulations. These inspections may include our suppliers facilities.

International Regulations 

International sales of medical devices are subject
to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. In order to market our products in other countries,
the Company must obtain regulatory approvals and comply with safety and quality regulations. The time required to obtain approval by
a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and the requirements may differ. The European
Union/European Economic Area, or EU/EEA, requires a CE conformity mark in order to market medical devices. The UK, due to Brexit, also
requires a separate clearance. Many other countries, such as Australia, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, accept CE or FDA
clearance or approval, although others, such as China, Brazil, Canada and Japan, require separate regulatory filings. 

In the EU/EEA, existing Sensus devices are required
to comply with the essential requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directive (93/42/EEC), while any new products placed in the EU/EEA
must comply with the EU Medical Device Regulation (2017/745). Compliance with these requirements entitles the Company to affix the CE
marking of conformity to our medical devices, without which they cannot be commercialized in the EU/EEA. To demonstrate compliance with
the essential requirements and obtain the right to affix the CE marking of conformity, the Company must undergo a conformity assessment
procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I),
where the manufacturer can issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the
essential requirements of the Medical Devices Directive (existing products) or Medical Device Regulation (new products), a conformity
assessment procedure requires the intervention of a Notified Body, which is an organization accredited by a Member State of the EU/EEA
to conduct conformity assessments. The Notified Body typically audits and examines the quality system for the manufacture, design, and
final inspection of devices before issuing a certification demonstrating compliance with the essential requirements. Based on this certification,
we can draw up an EU Declaration of Conformity which allows us to affix the CE mark to our products. 

Further, the advertising and promotion of Sensus s
products in the EU/EEA is subject to the laws of individual EEA Member States implementing the EU Medical Devices Directive, Directive
2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising, and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, as well as other
EU/EEA Member State laws governing the advertising and promotion of medical devices. These laws may limit or restrict the advertising
and promotion of our products to the general public and may impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals. 

The Company has obtained approval to sell our
products in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, India, Israel, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, and Taiwan, and is currently
seeking approval in several other countries. 

Sales and Marketing Commercial Compliance 

Federal anti-kickback laws and regulations prohibit,
among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering, or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly,
in exchange for, or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, any good or service
paid for under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Possible sanctions for violation of these anti-kickback
laws include monetary fines, civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from Medicare and Medicaid programs, and forfeiture of amounts collected
in violation of such prohibitions. 

In addition, federal false claims laws prohibit
any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making,
or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. Off-label promotion has been pursued as a violation of the federal
false claims laws. Pursuant to FDA regulations, we can only market our products for cleared or approved uses. Although surgeons are permitted
to use medical devices for indications other than those cleared or approved by the FDA based on their medical judgment, we are prohibited
from promoting products for such off-label uses. Additionally, the majority of states in which we market our products have similar anti-kickback,
false claims, anti-fee splitting, and self-referral laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including
commercial insurers. Violations of these laws may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties. 

To enforce compliance with the federal laws,
the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, has increased its scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers,
which has led to an unprecedented level of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Dealing
with investigations can be time- and resource-consuming. Additionally, if a healthcare company settles an investigation with the DOJ
or other law enforcement agencies, the company may be required to agree to additional compliance and reporting requirements as part of
a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement. 

U.S. and foreign government regulators have increased
regulation, enforcement, inspections, and governmental investigations of the medical device industry, including increased U.S. government
oversight and enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Whenever a governmental authority concludes that a company is not in
compliance with applicable laws or regulations, that authority can impose fines, delay or suspend regulatory clearances, institute proceedings
to detain or seize the company s products, issue a recall, impose operating restrictions, enjoin future violations, assess civil
penalties against the company, or its officers or employees, and recommend criminal prosecution. Moreover, governmental authorities can
ban or request the recall, repair, replacement, or refund of the cost of devices the company distributes. 

7 

Additionally, the commercial compliance environment
is continually evolving in the healthcare industry as some states, including California, Massachusetts and Vermont, mandate implementation
of corporate compliance programs, along with the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation, and other remuneration to physicians.
The Affordable Care Act also imposes reporting and disclosure requirements on device manufacturers for any transfer of value 
made or distributed to prescribers and other healthcare providers. Device manufacturers are also required to report and disclose any
investment interests held by physicians and their family members during the preceding calendar year. Failure to submit required information
may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of 150,000 per year (and up to an aggregate of 1 million per year for
 knowing failures ), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual
submission. The shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply in multiple
jurisdictions with different compliance or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may run afoul of
one or more of the requirements. The Company has implemented policies and procedures related to compliance, including in connection
with sales and marketing activities. 

Healthcare Fraud and Abuse 

Healthcare fraud and abuse laws apply to Sensus s
business when a customer submits a claim for an item or service that is reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid, or most other federally
funded healthcare programs. The federal anti-kickback statute (the Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits unlawful inducements
for the referral of business reimbursable under federally funded healthcare programs, such as remuneration provided to physicians to
induce them to use certain tissue products or medical devices reimbursable by Medicare or Medicaid. The Anti-Kickback Statute is subject
to evolving interpretations. For example, the government has enforced the Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare
companies based on sham consultant arrangements with physicians. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws which establish
similar prohibitions that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers. Further,
recently enacted amendments to the Affordable Care Act, among other things, amend the intent requirement of the Anti-Kickback Statute
and criminal healthcare fraud statute. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent
to violate it. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services
resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of false claims statutes.
If a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we and our officers
and employees could be subject to severe criminal and civil penalties including, for example, exclusion from participation as a supplier
of product to beneficiaries covered by Medicare or Medicaid. In addition to the Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal physician self-referral
statute, commonly known as the Stark Law, prohibits physicians who have a financial relationship with an entity, including an investment,
ownership, or compensation relationship, from referring Medicare patients for designated health services, which include clinical pathology
services, unless an exception applies. Similarly, entities may not bill Medicare or any other party for services furnished pursuant to
a prohibited referral. Many states have their own self-referral laws as well, which in some cases apply to all third-party payors, not
just Medicare and Medicaid. If a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with the Stark Law or state self-referral
laws and regulations, our business could be subject to severe financial consequences, including the obligation to refund amounts billed
to third-party payors in violation of such laws, civil penalties, and potentially exclusion from participation in government healthcare
programs like Medicare and Medicaid. The Stark Law often is enforced through lawsuits brought under the Federal False Claims Act, violations
of which trigger significant monetary penalties and treble damages. 

Additionally, the civil False Claims Act prohibits
knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious, or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. government. Actions
under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government.
Violations of the False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using
the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigations of healthcare providers and suppliers
throughout the country for a wide variety of Medicare billing practices, obtaining multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements
in addition to individual criminal convictions. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the
government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers and suppliers compliance
with the healthcare reimbursement rules and fraud and abuse laws. The Company has implemented policies and procedures related to compliance
with applicable regulations designed to prevent healthcare fraud and abuse.

Health Information Privacy 

The federal Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or
HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and
healthcare clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as their business associates that perform services for them that involve
individually identifiable health information. The HIPAA privacy and security regulations, including the expanded requirements under HITECH,
establish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the use and disclosure of protected health information by covered entities
and their business associates, in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and security of protected
health information. 

The Company has implemented policies and procedures
related to compliance with the HIPAA privacy and security regulations, as required by law. The privacy and security regulations establish
a floor and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent. Therefore, we are required to comply with both federal
privacy and security regulations and varying state privacy and security laws. In addition, for healthcare data transfers from other countries
relating to citizens of those countries, the Company must comply with the laws of those other countries. The federal privacy regulations
restrict the ability to use or disclose patient identifiable laboratory data, without patient authorization, for purposes other than
payment, treatment, or healthcare operations (as defined by HIPAA), except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other
permitted purposes outlined in the privacy regulations. HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, provides for significant fines and other penalties
for wrongful use or disclosure of protected health information in violation of the privacy and security regulations, including potential
civil and criminal fines and penalties. If the Company does not comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to protecting
the privacy and security of health information, it could be subject to monetary fines, civil penalties, or criminal sanctions. In addition,
other federal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of patient information may be subject to enforcement and interpretations
by various governmental authorities and courts resulting in complex compliance issues. The Company could incur damages under state laws
pursuant to an action brought by a private party for the wrongful use or disclosure of confidential health information or other private
personal information. If the Company were to experience a breach of protected health information, it could be subject to significant
adverse publicity in addition to possible enforcement sanctions and civil damages lawsuits. Finally, the Company may be required to incur
additional costs related to ongoing HIPAA compliance as may be necessary to address evolving interpretations and enforcement of HIPAA
and other health information privacy and security laws, the enactment of new laws or regulations, emerging cybersecurity threats, and
other factors. 

Research and Development 

Research and development costs related to development
and quality and regulatory costs are expensed as incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company incurred research
and development expenses of approximately 3.5 million and 3.4 million, respectively. The Company expects research and development expenses
in 2023 to be generally consistent with 2022. 

Employees and Human Capital 

At December 31, 2022, the Company had 42 employees.
None of the Company s employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 

The Company believes that its success depends
on the ability to attract, develop, and retain key personnel. It also believes that the skills, experience, and industry knowledge of
its key employees significantly benefits its operations and performance. The Company believes that it offers competitive compensation
and other means of attracting and retaining key personnel. 

Employee levels are managed to align with the
pace of business and management believes it has sufficient human capital to operate its business successfully.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS 

An investment in Sensus s common stock
contains a high degree of risk. Investors should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties before making an investment
decision with respect to our common stock. Our business, including our operating results and financial conditions, could be harmed if
any of these risks, as well as other risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, were to materialize. The trading
price of Sensus s common stock could decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks. In assessing these risks, investors should
also refer to the other information included in our filings with the SEC, including our financial statements and the related notes. 

Risks Related to our Business 

If third-party payors do not provide coverage
and adequate reimbursement for the use of our products, it is unlikely that our products will be widely used, and our revenue will be
negatively impacted. 

In the U.S., the commercial success of Sensus s
existing products and any future products will depend, in part, on the extent to which governmental payors at the federal and state levels,
including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers, and other third-party payors provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement
levels for procedures using these products. Neither hospitals nor physicians are likely to use Sensus s products if they do not
receive adequate reimbursement payments for the procedures using these products. 

Some private payors in the U.S. may base their
reimbursement policies on the coverage decisions determined by the Center for Medicare Medical Services, or CMS, which administers
the Medicare program and works in partnership with state governments to administer the Medicaid program. Others may adopt different coverage
or reimbursement policies for procedures performed using Sensus s products, while some governmental programs, such as Medicaid,
have reimbursement policies that vary from state to state, some of which may not pay an amount that supports the selling price of Sensus s
products, if at all. A Medicare national or local coverage decision denying coverage for any of the procedures performed using the Company s
products could result in private and other third-party payors also denying coverage. Medicare (Part B) and a number of private insurers
in the U.S. currently cover and pay for both non-melanoma skin cancer and keloid treatments using the SRT-100. A withdrawal, or even
contemplation of a withdrawal, by CMS, Medicaid or private payors of reimbursements, or any other unfavorable coverage or reimbursement
decisions by government programs or private payors, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s revenues and business. 

Reimbursement systems in international markets
vary significantly by country and by region within some countries, and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country
basis. In many international markets, a product must be approved for reimbursement before it can be cleared for sale in that country.
Further, many international markets have government-managed healthcare systems that control reimbursement for new devices and procedures.
In most markets there are private insurance systems as well as government-managed systems. Sensus s products may not be considered
cost-effective by international third-party payors or governments managing healthcare systems. Furthermore, reimbursement may not be
available or, if available, third-party payors reimbursement policies may adversely affect the Company s ability to sell
products profitably. If sufficient coverage and reimbursement are not available for Sensus s products, in either the U.S. or internationally,
the demand for these products and, consequently, the Company s revenues and business, will be adversely affected. 

The Company s operations may be impaired
if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or are the subject of a data breach or cyberattack. 

The Company s information technology systems
are critically important to operating business efficiently. The Company relies on information technology systems to manage business data,
communications, employee information, and other business processes. The Company outsources certain business process functions to third-party
providers and similarly relies on these third parties to maintain and store confidential information on their systems. The failure of
these information technology systems to perform as the Company anticipates could disrupt business and could result in transaction errors,
processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers, causing business and results of operations to suffer. 

The Company has experienced, and expects to continue
to experience, cyber security threats and incidents, none of which has been material to the Company to date. Although the Company protects
our information technology systems, the Company has experienced varying degrees of cyber-incidents in the normal conduct of business,
including viruses, worms, phishing, and other malicious activities. Although there have been no serious consequences to date, such breaches
could result in unauthorized access to information, including customer, supplier, employee, or other company confidential data. The Company
carries insurance against these risks, performs penetration tests from time to time, and designs business processes to attempt to mitigate
the risk of such breaches. However, the Company s efforts to mitigate these risks may be unsuccessful, and security breaches may
occur. Moreover, the development and maintenance of these measures requires continuous monitoring as technologies change and efforts
to overcome security measures evolve. However, a successful breach or attack could have a material negative impact on operations and
subject the Company to consequences such as direct costs associated with incident response. 

10 

Substantially all of the Company s
revenue is generated from the sale of the SRT-100 and related products, and any decline in the sales of these products will negatively
impact the Company s business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

The Company is focused heavily on the development
and commercialization of a limited number of products for the treatment of non-melanoma skin cancer and other skin conditions with SRT.
From the Company s inception in 2010 through December 31, 2022, revenue has primarily been derived from sales of the SRT-100 product
line and related services and ancillary products. Although the Company has introduced new products, the Company expects most of revenue
in the near to medium term to be derived from or related to sales of the SRT-100 product line. Because of this, any decline in the sales
of these products will negatively impact the Company s business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

The Company s technology could be
superseded by new products, treatments, or technologies that gain wider acceptance among doctors and patients, which could adversely
affect the Company. 

The medical device industry is highly competitive
and subject to rapid technological change, and is significantly affected by the introduction of new products and treatment options. The
Company s products, some of which use technologies that have been available for many years, compete for market acceptance against
those of healthcare providers who use other methods of treatment for similar diseases and conditions. If new products, treatments, and/or
technologies were developed that gain wide acceptance among doctors and patients, it could take market share away from the Company, which
could adversely affect the Company s ability to maintain or increase revenue and/or render the Company s products obsolete. 

The Company has a single preferred supplier
for the x-ray tubes and other major components used in the Company s products and the loss of this preferred supplier could adversely
affect the Company. 

The Company has a single preferred supplier for
the x-ray tubes and other major components used in the Company s products. Although other suppliers exist in the market, the Company
believes that our preferred supplier s products are of a superior quality. The loss of the preferred supplier, or its inability
to supply the Company with an adequate supply of these components, could hinder the Company s ability to effectively produce the
Company s products to meet existing demand levels, especially if the Company were unable to timely procure them from other suppliers
in the market, which could adversely affect the Company s ability to commercialize products and to maintain or increase revenues. 

The Company s customers are concentrated
in the U.S. (including one U.S. customer accounting for a significant portion of our sales), and economic difficulties or changes in
the purchasing policies or patterns of the Company s customers in the U.S. could have a significant impact on our business and
operating results. 

Most of the Company s sales have been made
to customers located in the U.S. (94 and 95 in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively). Additionally, a single customer
in the U.S. accounted for approximately 73 and 57 of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively.
Because of these concentrations, revenue could fluctuate significantly due to changes in economic conditions, competitive products, or
the loss of, reduction of business with, or less favorable terms with, our significant customer or other U.S. customers. A reduction
or delay in orders for the Company s products for these or other reasons could materially harm business and results of operations. 

Sensus may be required to obtain additional
funds in the future, and these funds may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. 

Sensus s operations have consumed substantial
amounts of cash since its inception, and Sensus may need to seek additional capital in the future. We have maintained a revolving line
of credit with Silicon Valley Bank SVB since 2013. Although we have never borrowed any funds under this line of credit,
we have maintained it as our sole source of borrowings, should they be needed. On March 10, 2023, SVB was closed by California and federal
regulatory agencies. As a result of these actions, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) established Silicon Valley Bridge
Bank, N.A. (the Bridge Bank as successor to SVB. Based upon information available to us, we believe that the Bridge Bank
has assumed all contracts of SVB in effect at the time of its failure (including our line of credit) and, that the Bridge Bank is expected
to continue to perform under those contracts. Accordingly, we have not yet determined whether we will seek to replace the current line
of credit with the Bridge Bank. Should we do so, we may not be able to enter into new credit facilities, and if we are able to enter into
new credit facilities, the maximum borrowings permitted under, or other terms of, any such facilities may limit the amounts we are able
to borrow or may impose greater restrictions on such borrowings or other aspects of our operations. Please see Note 5, Debt , to
the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding current line of credit with the Bridge Bank. If we are unable
to borrow funds on favorable terms, or at all, we may not be able to support commercialization efforts, increase research and development
activities, compete effectively, or meet debt and other contractual obligations, and the growth of our business may be negatively impacted. 

11 

The Company s cash requirements in the
future may be significantly different from current estimates and depend on many factors, including: 

the results of commercialization
 efforts for products; 

the need for additional
 capital to fund development programs; 

the costs involved in obtaining
 and enforcing patents or any litigation by third parties regarding intellectual property; 

the establishment of high-volume
 manufacturing and increased sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities; 

success in entering into collaborative relationships with other parties; and 

financial market instability or disruptions to the banking system due
to bank failures, particularly in light of the recent events that have occurred with respect to SVB. 

To the extent that Sensus raises additional capital
through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of the existing stockholders will be diluted. Moreover,
the terms of newly issued securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect common stockholders rights.
Debt financing, if available, may involve covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional
debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring distributions or dividends. If Sensus raises additional funds through collaboration and
licensing arrangements with third parties, the Company may have to relinquish valuable rights to technologies or products or to grant
licenses on terms that are not favorable. Any of these events could adversely affect Sensus s ability to declare dividends on its
common stock and to achieve future product development and commercialization goals and could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, and results of operations. 

Consolidation in the healthcare industry
could adversely affect the Company s future revenues and operating income. 

The medical technology industry has experienced
a significant amount of consolidation, resulting in companies with greater market presence. Health care systems and other health care
companies are also consolidating, resulting in greater purchasing power for the combined companies. The disruption in the healthcare
industry caused by consolidation may lead to further competition among medical device suppliers to provide goods and services, which
could adversely affect the Company s future revenues and operating income. 

Our business, results of operations, and
financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the effects of widespread public health epidemics, including COVID-19,
that are beyond our control. 

Outbreaks of contagious diseases, public health
epidemics, and other adverse public health developments in countries where we, our customers, or our suppliers operate have had and could
have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely
impacted the global and national economies and certain industries and geographies in which we operate. Given its ongoing and dynamic
nature, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, customers, vendors, and suppliers. The extent
of such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain. Additionally, the responses of various governmental and
nongovernmental authorities and consumers to the pandemic may have material long-term effects on us and our customers which are difficult
to quantify in the near-term or long-term. 

Risks Related to our Regulatory Environment 

Sensus is subject to various federal, state,
and foreign healthcare laws and regulations, and a finding of failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material
adverse effect on its business. 

Sensus s operations are, and will continue
to be, directly and indirectly affected by various federal, state, and foreign healthcare laws, including, but not limited to, those
described below. 

The Anti-Kickback Statute,
 which prohibits any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving any remuneration, directly
 or indirectly, in cash or in kind, in return for or to induce the referring, ordering, leasing, purchasing, or arranging for or recommending
 the referring, ordering, purchasing, or leasing of any good, facility, item, or service, for which payment may be made, in whole
 or in part, under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 

12 

The Federal Sunshine 
 law, which requires us to track and report annually to CMS information related to certain payments and other transfers of
 value provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors) and teaching
 hospitals and to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
 We are also subject to similar foreign sunshine laws or codes of conduct, which vary country by country. 

Federal civil and criminal
 false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly presenting,
 or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim to, or the knowing use of false records or statements to obtain payment from,
 or approval by, the federal government. Suits filed under the False Claims Act, known as qui tam actions, can be brought
 by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals, commonly known as whistleblowers, may share in
 any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. When an entity is determined to have violated the False
 Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties for
 each separate false claim. Many of the physicians that use our products will file for reimbursement from governmental programs such
 as Medicare and Medicaid. As a result, we may be subject to the False Claims Act if we knowingly cause the filing of false claims. 

HIPAA, which, among other
 things, created federal criminal laws that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme or artifice
 to defraud any healthcare benefit program and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making
 any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits,
 items or services. 

Additionally, HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and
applicable implementing regulations, impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually
identifiable health information without appropriate authorization on entities subject to the law, such as health plans, clearinghouses,
and healthcare providers and their business associates. Internationally, substantially every jurisdiction in which we operate has established
its own data security and privacy legal framework with which we must comply, including the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC and national
implementation of the Directive in the member states of the European Union. 

Many states have also adopted laws similar to
each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may be broader in scope and apply to items or services
reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, as well as laws that restrict our marketing activities with healthcare
professionals and entities, and require the Company to track and report payments and other transfers of value, including consulting fees,
provided to healthcare professionals and entities. Some states mandate implementation of compliance programs to ensure compliance with
these laws. Additionally, certain states require a certificate of need prior to the installation of a radiation device, such as the SRT-100.
The Company is also subject to foreign fraud and abuse laws, which vary by country. 

If the Company s operations are found to
be in violation of any of the laws or regulations described above or any other governmental laws or regulations that apply now or in
the future, it may be subject to penalties, including administrative, civil, and criminal penalties; damages; fines; disgorgement; individual
imprisonment; contractual damages; reputational harm; exclusion from governmental healthcare programs; and the curtailment or restructuring
of its operations. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect the Company s ability to operate its business and financial results. 

Sensus is required to comply with medical
device reporting requirements and must report certain malfunctions, deaths, and serious injuries associated with its products, which
can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions. 

Under the FDA s medical device reporting
regulations (21 CFR 803), medical device manufacturers are required to submit information to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration when
they receive a report or become aware that a device has or may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or has or may
have a malfunction that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. All manufacturers
placing medical devices on the market in the European Economic Area are legally bound to report any serious or potentially serious incidents
involving devices they produce or sell (MEDDEV 2.12-1) to the competent authority in whose jurisdiction the incident occurred through
the European Vigilance process. 

13 

If an event subject to medical device reporting
requirements occurs, Sensus will need to comply with the reporting requirements, which would adversely affect its reputation and subject
Sensus to actions by regulatory authorities, such as ordering recalls, imposing fines, or seizing the affected products. Furthermore,
any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, will require the dedication of time and capital and will distract management
from business operations. Any of the foregoing would negatively impact Sensus s reputation, business, and financial results. 

Healthcare policy changes may have a material
adverse effect on Sensus s business. 

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,
as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, included, among other things, comparative effectiveness research, an
independent payment advisory board, payment system reforms (including shared savings pilots), and other provisions, one or more of which
may significantly affect the payment for, and the availability of, healthcare services and may result in fundamental changes to federal
healthcare reimbursement programs, any of which may materially affect numerous aspects of our business. 

Other healthcare reform measures may result in
more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the reimbursement received for procedures utilizing our products.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the law discussed above was enacted that may adversely affect
Sensus s revenues. Changes to existing laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which
could have a material adverse effect on Sensus s business and financial operations. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare
or other government programs may result in a reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures
or other healthcare reforms may prevent Sensus from being able to increase revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize its devices.
In addition, other legislative changes may be enacted or existing regulations, guidance, or interpretations may be changed, each of which
may adversely affect our operations. 

Risks Related to our Intellectual Property 

If Sensus s patents and other intellectual
property rights do not adequately protect its products, it may lose market share to competitors and be unable to operate business profitably. 

Sensus s success significantly depends
on its ability to protect proprietary rights to the technologies used in its products. Sensus relies on two U.S. patents and two foreign
patents, as well as a combination of copyright, trade secret, and trademark laws, and nondisclosure, confidentiality, and other contractual
restrictions, to protect its proprietary technology. Sensus also has patent applications currently pending and in the process of being
submitted. However, these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect its rights or permit Sensus to gain
or keep any competitive advantage. For example, some or all of the pending patent applications or any future pending applications may
be unsuccessful. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office may deny or require significant narrowing of claims in the pending patent applications
or future patent applications, and patents issued as a result of these patent applications, if any, may not provide Sensus with significant
commercial protection or be issued in a form that is advantageous. Sensus could also incur substantial costs in proceedings before the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. These proceedings could result in adverse decisions as to the priority of its inventions and the narrowing
or invalidation of claims in its issued patents. Third parties may successfully challenge issued patents and those that may be issued
in the future, which would render these patents invalid or unenforceable, which in turn could limit Sensus s ability to stop competitors
from marketing and selling related products. In addition, pending patent applications include claims to aspects of Sensus s products
and procedures that are not currently protected by issued patents, and third parties may successfully patent those aspects before us
or otherwise challenge our rights to these aspects. 

Both the patent application process and the process
of managing patent disputes can be time consuming and expensive. Competitors may be able to design around Sensus s patents or develop
products that provide outcomes that are comparable to Sensus s products. Although Sensus has entered into confidentiality agreements
and intellectual property assignment agreements with certain of its employees, consultants, and advisors in order to protect our intellectual
property and other proprietary technology, these agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for trade
secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements. In addition,
Sensus has not sought patent protection in all countries where it sells products. If Sensus fails to timely file a patent application
in any such country or major market, Sensus may be precluded from doing so at a later date. Competitors may use Sensus s technologies
in jurisdictions where Sensus has not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing
products to territories in which Sensus has patent protection that may not be sufficient to terminate infringing activities. Furthermore,
the laws of some foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S., if at all. 

In the event a competitor infringes upon one
of Sensus s patents or other intellectual property rights, enforcing those patents and rights may be difficult and time consuming.
Even if successful, litigation to defend these patents against challenges or to enforce Sensus s intellectual property rights could
be expensive and time consuming and could divert management s attention. Moreover, Sensus may not have sufficient resources to
defend patents against challenges or to enforce intellectual property rights, any of which would adversely affect its ability to compete.
Any of the foregoing would negatively impact Sensus s business, operations, and financial results. 

14 

If Sensus s trademarks or trade names
are not adequately protected, then Sensus may be unable to build name recognition in markets of interest and its business may be adversely
affected. 

Sensus s registered or unregistered trademarks
or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented, declared generic, or determined to infringe other marks. Sensus may be unable
to protect the rights to these trademarks and trade names, which it needs to build name recognition by potential partners or customers
in markets of interest. If these trademarks are challenged, infringed upon, circumvented, or declared generic or infringing, or if Sensus
is unable to establish name recognition based on these trademarks and trade names, then it may be unable to compete effectively and Sensus s
business may be adversely affected. 

The medical device industry is characterized
by extensive patent litigation, and if Sensus becomes subject to litigation, it could be costly, result in the diversion of management s
attention, require us to pay significant damages or royalty payments, or prevent us from marketing and selling existing or future products. 

The medical device industry is characterized
by extensive litigation and administrative proceedings over patent and other intellectual property rights. Determining whether a product
infringes a patent involves complex legal and factual issues. As the number of participants in the market for skin cancer and general
oncology devices and treatments increases, the possibility of patent infringement claims against Sensus increases. Any infringement claims,
litigation or other proceedings would place a significant strain on Sensus s financial resources, divert the attention of management
from the core business and harm Sensus s reputation. Any of the foregoing could negatively impact Sensus s business, operations,
and financial results. 

Adverse outcomes in litigation or similar
proceedings could adversely impact business. 

Sensus may in the future be named as a party
to litigation or other similar legal proceedings. Adverse outcomes in any or all of these proceedings could result in monetary damages
or injunctive relief that could adversely affect its ability to continue conducting business. If an unfavorable final outcome in any
such matter becomes probable and reasonably estimable, the Company s financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. 

Risks Related to the Ownership of Sensus s
Securities 

We have a history of net losses prior to
2021. If we do not maintain profitability, our financial condition and the value of our common stock could suffer. 

The Company has a history of net losses. The
historical losses from inception through December 31, 2020 totaled approximately 21.9 million. The Company reported net income of 24.2
million and 4.1 million, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company has significantly reduced its
research and development expenses and is planning to continue to control these expenses. However, there can be no assurances that this
and other actions will result in the Company s continued profitability. 

Limited trading activity for shares of
Sensus s common stock may contribute to price volatility. 

While Sensus s common stock is listed and
traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market, there has been limited trading activity in the Company s shares. Due to the limited trading
activity of Sensus s common stock, relativity small trades may have a significant impact on the price of our common stock. 

The Company does not anticipate paying
dividends for the foreseeable future. As a result, investors must rely on price appreciation of the Company s common stock for
a return on its investment in the foreseeable future. 

The Company expects to retain any funds and future
earnings to support the operation, growth, and development of its business and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends on its common
stock in the foreseeable future. As a result, a return on an investor s investment in the near future will occur only if the Company s
share price appreciates. The Company s common stock price may not appreciate in value or maintain the price at which an investor
purchased these securities, and in either case, may not realize a return on investment or could lose all or part of an investment in
the Company s securities. 

Any future determination to declare cash dividends
will be made at the discretion of the Company s Board of Directors (the Board of Directors and will be subject to
compliance with applicable laws and covenants under any credit facilities, which may restrict or limit the Company s ability to
pay dividends. For example, the Company s revolving line of credit with SVB (now with the Bridge Bank) has restricted the ability
to pay dividends or make any distributions or payments or redeem, retire, or purchase any capital stock without the prior written consent
of the lender, provided that the Company may pay dividends solely in common stock. Should the Company enter into a new credit facility
or facilities following the closing of SVB, any such facility may contain similar or additional restrictions on the payment of dividends
or may prohibit the payment of dividends altogether (see Risk Factors -- Sensus may be required to obtain additional funds in
the future, and these funds may not be available on acceptable terms or at all for additional information). Also, the form,
frequency, and amount of dividends will depend upon the Company s future operations and earnings, capital requirements and surplus,
general financial condition, contractual restrictions, and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant. Sensus may not
pay dividends as a result of any of the foregoing, and in these cases, an investor would need to rely on price appreciation of the Company s
common stock for a return on investment. 

15 

Sensus is a smaller reporting company, 
and the reduced reporting requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies may make Sensus s common stock less attractive
to investors. 

As a smaller reporting company, Sensus can take
advantage of certain reduced governance and disclosure requirements, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation
requirements in the assessment of internal control over financial reporting. As a result, investors and others may be less
comfortable with the effectiveness of Sensus s internal controls and the risk that material weaknesses or other deficiencies
in internal controls go undetected may increase. In addition, as a smaller reporting company, Sensus takes advantage of the
ability to provide certain other less comprehensive disclosures in our SEC filings, including, among other things, providing only two
years of audited financial statements in annual reports and simplified executive compensation disclosures. Consequently, it may be more challenging
for investors to analyze Sensus s results of operations and financial prospects, as the information provided to stockholders may
be different from what one might receive from other public companies in which one holds shares. 

Sensus s executive officers and directors
may exert control over the Company and may exercise influence over matters subject to stockholder approval. 

Sensus s executive officers and directors,
together with their respective affiliates, beneficially owned approximately 11 of our outstanding common stock as of February 21, 2023.
Accordingly, these stockholders, if they act together, may exercise substantial influence over matters requiring stockholder approval,
including the election of directors and approval of corporate transactions, such as a merger. This concentration of ownership could have
the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or otherwise discourage a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control
over Sensus, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the market value of Sensus s common stock. 

If securities or industry analysts do not
publish research or publish unfavorable or inaccurate research about Sensus, the price of Sensus s securities and trading volume
could decline. 

The trading market for Sensus s securities
depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us. Sensus may be unable to attract
or sustain coverage by well-regarded securities and industry analysts. If either none or only a limited number of securities or industry
analysts cover Sensus, or if these securities or industry analysts are not widely respected within the general investment community,
the trading price for Sensus s securities would be materially and negatively impacted. In the event Sensus obtains securities or
industry analyst coverage, if one or more of the analysts who cover Sensus downgrades the securities or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable
research about the Company, the price of Sensus s securities would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage
of Sensus, or fail to publish reports on Sensus regularly, demand for the Sensus s securities could decrease, which might cause
the price of its securities and trading volume to decline. 

The Company s certificate of incorporation
and bylaws, and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage another company from acquiring the Company and may prevent attempts
by the Company s stockholders to replace or remove the current directors and management. 

Provisions of the Delaware General Corporation
Law DGCL and the Company s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay, or prevent a merger or
acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which an investor might otherwise receive a premium for
its stock. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by the Company s stockholders to replace or remove
the current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace or remove directors from the Board of Directors. These
provisions include: 

authorizing the issuance
 of blank check preferred stock without any need for action by stockholders; 

16 

requiring supermajority
 stockholder voting to effect any merger or sale of all or substantially all of the Company s stock and assets; 

eliminating the ability
 of stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings of stockholders; 

prohibiting stockholder
 action by written consent; 

establishing advance notice
 requirements for nominations for election to the Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders
 at stockholder meetings; 

dividing the Board of Directors
 into three classes so that only one third of the directors will be up for election in any given year; and 

providing that the Company s
 directors may be removed only by the affirmative vote of at least 75 of the Company s then-outstanding common stock and only
 for cause. 

In addition, the Company is subject to Section
203 of the DGCL, which may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by the Board of Directors,
including discouraging takeover attempts that could result in a premium over the market price for shares of the Company s common
stock. These provisions will apply even if a takeover offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent
an acquisition that the Board of Directors determines is not in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and could also
affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for the Company s common stock. 

The Company s certificate of incorporation
provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between the Company
and its stockholders, which could limit a stockholder s ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with the Company
or its directors, officers, or employees. 

The Company s certificate of incorporation
provides that, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware is the exclusive forum for: any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company; any action asserting a breach
of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against the Company arising pursuant to the DGCL, the Company s certificate of
incorporation, or bylaws; or any action asserting a claim against the Company that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This
choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes
with the Company or its directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage these lawsuits against the Company and its directors,
officers, and other employees. If a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in the Company s certificate of
incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, the Company may incur additional costs associated with resolving the
action in other jurisdictions, which could harm business and financial condition. 

If the Company fails to maintain proper
and effective internal controls, the Company s ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired and
investors views of the Company or its business could be harmed, resulting in a decrease in value of the Company s common
stock. 

As a public company, the Company is required
to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in the Company s internal controls.
In addition, the Company is required to furnish a report by management on the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm will
be required to attest to the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting beginning with the Company s annual
report on Form 10-K following the date on which the Company no longer qualifies as a smaller reporting company. Compliance with Section
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will require the Company to incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts.
If the Company is unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or the Company and the independent registered
public accounting firm identify deficiencies in the internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses,
the market price of the Company s common stock could decline and the Company could be subject to sanctions or investigations by
Nasdaq, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources. 

17 

Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS 

The Company has no unresolved comments from the
SEC staff relating to the Company s periodic or current reports filed with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended. 

Item 2. PROPERTIES 

The Company s corporate headquarters is
located in Boca Raton, Florida and occupies approximately 8,926 square feet of space under a lease that currently expires in September
2027. The Company believes that the current facilities are suitable and adequate to meet the Company s current needs and
that suitable additional space will be available as and when needed. The Company s main manufacturing function is physically located
at our third-party manufacturer s facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Additional disclosures have been included within Note 8, Commitments
and Contingencies , of the consolidated financial statements. 

Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From time to time, Sensus is party to certain
legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. Management, after consultation with legal counsel, currently does not anticipate
that the aggregate liability arising out of certain legal proceedings will have a material effect on Sensus s results of operations,
financial position, or cash flows and have assessed that there is no need to record a liability for these legal proceedings and related
contingencies. Additional disclosures have been included within Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies of the consolidated financial
statements.

PART II. 

Item 5. MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED
STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 

Market Information 

The Company s Class A common stock
is publicly traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol SRTS. 

Holders 

At the close of business on March 1, 2023, there
were 20 common stockholders of record. This does not include street name or beneficial owners, whose shares are held of
record by banks, brokers, and other financial institutions. 

Dividends 

The Company has never declared or paid any dividends
on its common stock and anticipates that for the foreseeable future all earnings will be retained for use rather than paid out as dividends.
Any future payment of cash dividends will be dependent upon the Company s financial condition, results of operations, current and
anticipated cash requirements, and plans for expansion, as well as other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant. Additionally,
certain contractual agreements and provisions of Delaware law impose restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. For example, the Company s
current revolving line of credit restricts the ability to pay dividends or make any distributions or payments or redeem, retire, or purchase
any capital stock without the prior written consent of the lender, provided that the Company may pay dividends solely in common stock
without prior consent. Should the Company enter into a new credit facility or facilities, any such facility may contain similar or additional
restrictions on the payment of dividends or may prohibit the payment of dividends altogether (see Risk Factors -- Sensus may
be required to obtain additional funds in the future, and these funds may not be available on acceptable terms or at all for
additional information). Additionally, Section 170(a) of the DGCL only permits dividends to be paid out of two legally available sources:
(1) out of surplus, or (2) if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the year in which the dividend is declared or the preceding
year (so-called nimble dividends ). However, dividends may not be declared or paid out of net profits if the capital
of the corporation, computed in accordance with [sections] 154 and 244 [of the DGCL], shall have been diminished by depreciation in the
value of its property, or by losses, or otherwise, to an amount less than the aggregate amount of the capital represented by the issued
and outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets. Contractual obligations and applicable
law will restrict the ability to declare and pay dividends in the future. 

Unregistered Sales of Securities 

There were no unregistered sales of securities
during the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Purchases of Equity Securities by the Registrant
and Affiliated Purchasers 

In March 2022, the Company announced that its
Board of Directors had authorized a program to purchase up to 3,000,000 of shares of its common stock. Purchases may be made in
a variety of methods, including open market, from time to time, depending upon market conditions, including the market price of the common
stock, and other factors. The program has no time limit and may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time.

Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

You should read the following management s
discussion and analysis MD A in conjunction with the information set forth within the financial statements and related
notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Overview 

As discussed elsewhere in this Report, Sensus
achieved profitability for the first time in 2021 and increased profitability in 2022, and seeks to maintain and increase profitability
by, among other things, increasing sales and managing operational expenses where necessary in order to continue to invest in research
and development of new products and marketing initiatives to promote the Company s products. However, Sensus faces a number of
uncertainties in 2023 that could impact our ability to achieve this goal. These include inflation and international trade issues. Either
of these matters could adversely affect the Company s ability to do business in a number of countries and geographic regions, including
China. 

Components of our results of operations 

Sensus manages our business globally within one
reportable segment, which is consistent with how management views the business, prioritizes investment and resource allocation decisions,
and assesses operating performance.

2022 Compared with 2021 

Revenues of 44.5 million in 2022 increased
 17.5 million, or 65 , from 27.0 million in 2021. The 65 increase was driven by a higher number of units sold in 2022 in response to
increased demand. 

Cost of sales of 14.9 million in 2022
increased by 4.8 million, or 48 , from 10.1 million in 2021, reflecting the higher number of units sold. 

Gross profit of 29.6 million, or 66.5 
of revenue, in 2022 increased by 12.6 million, or 74 , from 17.0 million, or 62.8 of revenue, in 2021. The increases were driven by
a higher number of units sold in 2022 and service revenue on installed units. 

Selling and marketing expenses of 6.3
million in 2022 increased by 1.5 million, or 31 , from 4.8 million in 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to higher spending
on marketing activities, and an increase in headcount. 

General and administrative expenses of
 5 million in 2022 increased by 0.4 million, or 9 , from 4.6 million in 2021, due primarily to higher compensation and bad debt expense. 

Research and development expenses of 3.5
million in 2022 increased by 0.1 million, or 3 , from 3.4 million in 2021. The Company expects research and development expenses in
2023 to be generally consistent with 2022. 

Other income (expense), net of 13.2 million
in 2022 increased by 13.3 million from 0.1 million in 2021 and is primarily attributable to the gain on sale of assets of 12.8 million
(See Note 2, Disposition , to the consolidated financial statements) and an interest income of 0.4 million. 

Financial Condition 

The Company s cash, cash equivalent, and
investment balance increased to 25.5 million at December 31, 2022 from 14.5 million at December 31, 2021, primarily due to cash received
in investing activities. 

There were no borrowings under the revolving line
of credit at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

The Company continued to take proactive steps
during 2022 to manage costs and preserve liquidity. These steps included maintaining borrowing availability as a precautionary measure
to preserve financial flexibility in view of the uncertainty in global markets. In 2022, the Company paid the outstanding balance 51,021)
of its 2020 loan under the Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program PPP enabled by the Coronavirus Aid,
Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020 (the CARES Act ). 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Overview 

In general terms, the liquidity is a measurement
of the Company s ability to meet its cash needs. For the year ended December 31, 2022, funding was derived primarily from the sale
of the Sculptura assets for 15 million in cash . The Company believes that cash generated by operations and proceeds from maturing investments,
as well as borrowing capacity and access to capital resources are sufficient to meet operating capital and funding requirements for the
next 12 months from the date of this annual report. Based upon information available to us, we believe that the Bridge Bank has assumed
all contracts of SVB in effect at the time of its failure (including our line of credit) and that the Bridge Bank is expected to continue
to perform under those contracts. Accordingly, we have not yet determined whether to seek to replace the current line of credit with
the Bridge Bank. (For additional information, see Risk Factors -- Sensus may be required to obtain additional funds in the
future, and these funds may not be available on acceptable terms or at all ). The Company s liquidity position and capital
requirements may also be impacted by a number of factors, including the following: 

ability to generate and
 increase revenue; 

fluctuations in gross margins,
 operating expenses, and net results; and 

financial market instability
 or disruptions to the banking system due to bank failures, particularly in light of the recent events that have occurred with respect
 to SVB. 

The Company s primary short-term capital
needs, which are subject to change, include expenditures related to: 

expansion of sales and marketing activities; and 

expansion of research and development activities. 

Sensus s management regularly evaluates
cash requirements for current operations, commitments, capital requirements, and business development transactions, and may seek to raise
additional funds for these purposes in the future. However, there can be no assurance that it will be able to raise such funds or the
terms on which such funds may be raised, if at all. 

As of December 31, 2022, a substantial portion
of our cash was deposited with or invested through SVB. Subsequent to the closing of SVB in March 2023, we opened a new operating account
with a different bank, and we may open additional accounts from time to time in the future. However, in light of various factors, including
the actions taken by the FDIC following the closing of SVB, the amount deposited in the new bank account is not, and any amounts deposited
in or invested through other banks in the future are not expected to be, significant compared to the amounts deposited with and invested
through SVB (now the Bridge Bank).

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The preparation of consolidated financial statements
in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue
and expense during the reporting periods. Management has identified certain accounting policies as critical to understanding the financial
condition and results of operations. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see the notes
to the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Shareholders and Board of Directors of 

Sensus
Healthcare, Inc. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sensus
Healthcare, Inc. (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders 
equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to
as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years
in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and
(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
We have performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our management used the Internal
Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission to perform this evaluation.
Based on that evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. 

As a smaller reporting company, our independent
registered accounting firm is not required to issue an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 that have materially affected
or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
