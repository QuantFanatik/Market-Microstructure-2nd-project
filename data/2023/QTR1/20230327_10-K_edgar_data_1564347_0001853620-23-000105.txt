EXPLANATORY NOTES 

Except as set forth below, each of the parties to each pooling and servicing
agreement listed in the Exhibit Index both (1) participates in the servicing function for purposes of Item 1122 of Regulation AB and (2)
constitutes a servicer that meets the criteria in Item 1108(a)(2)(i) through (iii) of Regulation AB for purposes of Item 1123 of Regulation
AB: 

The trustee under a pooling and servicing agreement has a nominal role with respect to the mortgage pool securitized pursuant to such pooling and servicing agreement. The trustee s only servicing function is the contingent obligation to make certain advances if the master servicer under such pooling and servicing agreement fails to do so, while all other servicing functions are performed by other parties. The trustee under each of the pooling and servicing agreements listed in the Exhibit Index has confirmed to the registrant that it has not made any such contingent advances during the reporting period, and consequently, each such trustee does not participate in the servicing function for purposes of Item 1122 of Regulation AB, nor does it perform the functions of a servicer for purposes of the definition of servicer under Item 1101 of Regulation AB or for purposes of Item 1123 of Regulation AB. 

The operating advisor under a pooling and servicing agreement represents the interests of senior certificateholders in the transaction governed by such pooling and servicing agreement and is responsible for monitoring the performance of the special servicer under such pooling and servicing agreement and producing certain reports to certificateholders relating to the resolution of the mortgage pool securitized pursuant to such pooling and servicing agreement. While the operating advisor under a pooling and servicing agreement has certain reporting obligations in respect of the related mortgage pool, it has no obligation to collect or disburse funds in respect of the mortgage pool or to administer any of the underlying mortgage loans. Consequently, the operating advisor under a pooling and servicing agreement participates in the servicing function for purposes of Item 1122 of Regulation AB, but is not responsible for the management or collection of the pool assets or making allocations or distributions to holders of the asset-backed securities within the meaning of servicer under Item 1101 of Regulation AB and does not perform the functions of a servicer for purposes of Item 1123 of Regulation AB. 

In addition, each of the following parties engaged the services of
certain servicing function participants and sub-servicers for the reporting period, as set forth below: 

On November 1, 2021, pursuant to the second amended and restated servicing agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 99.3, Computershare Trust Company, National Association was engaged to perform all or virtually all of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association s roles as certificate administrator, custodian and trustee, as applicable, under the pooling and servicing agreement. 

Midland Loan Services, a Division of PNC Bank, National Association, as master servicer, engaged the services of Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC, as servicing function participant in respect of 8.37 of the mortgage pool for the reporting period.

Item 1117 of Regulation AB, Legal Proceedings. 

The registrant knows of no legal proceeding pending against the sponsors,
depositor, trustee, issuing entity, servicer contemplated by Item 1108(a)(3) of Regulation AB, originator contemplated by Item 1110(b)
of Regulation AB, or other party contemplated by Item 1100(d)(1) of Regulation AB, or of which any property of the foregoing is the subject,
that is material to security holders, other than as follows: 

In December 2014, Phoenix Light SF Limited (Phoenix Light) and certain
related entities filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging claims against Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A., in its capacity as trustee for a number of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) trusts. Complaints raising
similar allegations have been filed by Commerzbank AG in the Southern District of New York and by IKB International and IKB Deutsche Industriebank
in New York state court. In each case, the plaintiffs allege that Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee, caused losses to investors, and
plaintiffs assert causes of action based upon, among other things, the trustee s alleged failure to notify and enforce repurchase
obligations of mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations and warranties, notify investors of alleged events of default,
and abide by appropriate standards of care following alleged events of default. In July 2022, the district court dismissed Phoenix Light s
claims and certain of the claims asserted by Commerzbank AG, and subsequently entered judgment in each case in favor of Wells Fargo Bank,
N.A. In August 2022, Phoenix Light and Commerzbank AG appealed the district court s decision to the United States Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. previously settled two class actions filed by institutional investors and an action filed by the National
Credit Union Administration with similar allegations. In addition, Park Royal I LLC and Park Royal II LLC have filed substantially similar
lawsuits in New York state court alleging Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee, failed to take appropriate actions upon learning of defective
mortgage loan documentation. 

In the last several years, U.S. Bank National Association U.S. Bank and other large financial institutions have been sued in their capacity as trustee or successor trustee for
certain residential mortgage backed securities RMBS trusts. The complaints, primarily filed by investors or investor groups
against U.S. Bank and similar institutions, allege the trustees caused losses to investors as a result of alleged failures by the sponsors,
mortgage loan sellers and servicers to comply with the governing agreements for these RMBS trusts. Plaintiffs generally assert causes
of action based upon the trustees purported failures to enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for alleged breaches
of representations and warranties, notify securityholders of purported events of default allegedly caused by breaches of servicing standards
by mortgage loan servicers and abide by a heightened standard of care following alleged events of default. 

 U.S. Bank denies liability and believes that it has
performed its obligations under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions were not the cause of losses to investors, that it has
meritorious defenses, and it has contested and intends to continue contesting the plaintiffs claims vigorously. However, U.S. Bank
cannot assure you as to the outcome of any of the litigation, or the possible impact of these litigations on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. 

 On March 9, 2018, a law firm purporting to represent
fifteen Delaware statutory trusts (the DSTs that issued securities backed by student loans (the Student Loans filed a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery against U.S. Bank National Association U.S. Bank in its capacities as
indenture trustee and successor special servicer, and three other institutions in their respective transaction capacities, with respect
to the DSTs and the Student Loans. This lawsuit is captioned The National Collegiate Student Loan Master Trust I, et al. v. U.S. Bank
National Association, et al., C.A. No. 2018-0167-JRS (Del. Ch.) (the NCMSLT Action ). The complaint, as amended on June 15,
2018, alleged that the DSTs have been harmed as a result of purported misconduct or omissions by the defendants concerning administration
of the trusts and special servicing of the Student Loans. Since the filing of the NCMSLT Action, certain Student Loan borrowers have made
assertions against U.S. Bank concerning special servicing that appear to be based on certain allegations made on behalf of the DSTs in
the NCMSLT Action. 

 U.S. Bank believes that it has performed its obligations
as indenture trustee and special servicer in good faith and in compliance in all material respects with the terms of the agreements governing
the DSTs (the Governing Agreements ), and accordingly that the claims against it in the NCMSLT Action are without merit. 

U.S. Bank has filed a motion seeking dismissal of
the operative complaint in its entirety with prejudice pursuant to Chancery Court Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) or, in the alternative,
a stay of the case while other prior filed disputes involving the DSTs and the Student Loans are litigated. On November 7, 2018, the Court
ruled that the case should be stayed in its entirety pending resolution of the first-filed cases. On January 21, 2020, the Court entered
an order consolidating for pretrial purposes the NCMSLT Action and three other lawsuits pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery concerning
the DSTs and the Student Loans (the Consolidated Action ). U.S. Bank and other parties to the Consolidated Action have briefed
and argued motions for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Chancery Court Rule 12(c) regarding disputed issues of contractual interpretation
at issue in one or more of the cases comprising the Consolidated Action, including the NCMSLT Action. The Court has not yet ruled on these
motions or on U.S. Bank s dismissal motion in the NCMSLT Action. 

 U.S. Bank intends to continue to defend the NCMSLT Action vigorously.

Appendix
B to the Company s Assessment of Compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria 

Wells
Fargo s transfer of its roles on the Document Custody Platform transactions to Computershare is ongoing. As of the beginning of
the Period, Wells Fargo has not transferred to Computershare its document custody related roles, and the duties, rights, and liabilities
for such roles, under the relevant agreements for any of the Document Custody Platform transactions. During the Period, for all the Document
Custody Platform transactions, Wells Fargo engaged Computershare as a subservicer 1 to perform virtually all of Wells Fargo s
obligations under the transaction agreements. As a result, the Company has determined that Computershare is a party participating in
the servicing function with respect to the Document Custody Platform and the applicable servicing criteria relevant to the servicing
activities performed by Computershare for the Document Custody Platform (the Computershare Applicable Servicing Criteria ).
Accordingly, Computershare is taking, and Wells Fargo is not taking, responsibility for assessing Computershare s compliance with
the Computershare Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Document Custody Platform, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31,
2022.

 In this Assessment, the term subservicer means agent.

ASSESSMENT
OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA 

 Computershare
Corporate Trust- Document Custody Platform 

The
management Management of the Computershare Corporate Trust division of Computershare Trust Company, National
Association (the Company is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management has determined
that the servicing criteria are applicable to the servicing platform for the period as follows: 

Purchase
of corporate trust business . On November 1, 2021, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Wells Fargo and certain of
its affiliates sold substantially all of its Corporate Trust Services CTS division to the Company, Computershare
Delaware Trust Company CDTC ), and Computershare Limited Computershare Limited , and
collectively with the Company and CDTC, Computershare ). Virtually all CTS employees of Wells Fargo, along
with most existing CTS systems, technology, and offices transferred to Computershare as part of the sale. 

For
the Document Custody Platform (defined below) transactions and during the Period, the Company either (i) served directly in the
related document custody services role (collectively, the Document Custody Platform Role ), or (ii) served
as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related Document Custody Platform Role. More specifically, since its acquisition
of the Wells Fargo CTS business on November 1, 2021, the Company has closed new Document Custody transactions for which, during
all or a portion of the Period, it performed the related Document Custody Platform Role directly (the Company s
Direct Role Transactions ). The Company s Direct Role Transactions comprise a small percentage of the overall
Document Custody Platform transactions. For a significant majority of Document Custody Platform transactions, the Company served,
during all or a portion of the Period, as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related Document Custody Platform Role (the
 Company s Agent Role Transactions ). Wells Fargo had not, as of the beginning of the Period, transferred
to Computershare the Document Custody Platform Role for the Company s Agent Role Transactions, and therefore the Company
performed, during all or a portion of the Period, virtually all of Wells Fargo s contractual duties for such transactions
as its agent. As a result, for the Company s Agent Role Transactions, the Company and Wells Fargo have determined that the
Company is a party participating in the servicing function with respect to the Document Custody Platform, and accordingly, the
Company is taking responsibility for assessing its compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria (defined below) relevant
to the servicing activities performed by the Company for the Document Custody Platform, as of and for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2022. 

Period :
As of January 1, 2022 through and including December 31, 2022 (the Period ). 

Platform :
The platform consists of residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS transactions, commercial mortgage-backed
securities CMBS transactions, and other asset-backed securities ABS transactions,
in each case for which the Company provides document custody services, either directly in the related role for such services or
as the agent of the party performing such services, and for which either (a) some or all of the issued securities for such RMBS,
CMBS, and ABS transactions were publicly offered on or after January 1, 2006 pursuant to a registration statement delivered under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (b) the issued securities for such RMBS, CMBS, and ABS transactions were privately
offered on or after January 1, 2006 pursuant to an exemption from registration and the Company (and/or the party for whom it acts
as agent) has an obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing
criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform excludes any transactions for which the offered
securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by any agency or instrumentality of the U.S. government or any government-sponsored
entity, other than certain RMBS transactions for which the offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Company (the Document Custody Platform ). Appendix A identifies the individual
transactions defined by Management as constituting the Document Custody Platform for the Period. 

Applicable
Servicing Criteria : Management has determined that the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iv),
1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(ii) and 1122(d)(4)(iii) are applicable to the Company s obligations, or the obligations of the
party for whom the Company ultimately acts as agent, in either case under the related transaction agreements with respect to the
Document Custody Platform for the Period (as applicable, the Company s Obligations ); provided however
that, with respect to the Document Custody Platform, servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable only as it relates to the
Company s Obligation to review and maintain the required loan documents related to any additions, removals or substitutions
in accordance with the transaction agreements (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ). Management has determined
that all other servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are not applicable to the Company s Obligations with respect
to the Document Custody Platform for the Period. 

Third
parties classified as vendors : With respect to servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(ii), for certain ABS transactions
included in the Document Custody Platform, the Company has engaged a vendor to handle certain aspects of maintaining and safeguarding
pool assets, the security thereon, and related documents as required by such servicing criteria. Management has determined that
the vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and Management elects to take
responsibility for assessing compliance with the portion of servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(ii) applicable to
this vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation C DI 200.06,
Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06 . The Company has policies and procedures in place designed
to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor s activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria
applicable to the vendor. Management is solely responsible for determining that the Company meets the SEC requirements to apply
 C DI 200.06 for the vendor and the related servicing criteria. 

With
respect to the Document Custody Platform and the Period, Management provides the following assessment of the Company s compliance
with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria: 

1.
Management is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 

2.
Management has assessed the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria, including the servicing criteria
for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 as described above. In performing this assessment, Management
used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. 

3.
With respect to Applicable Servicing Criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii), Management has determined that there were no activities performed
during the Period with respect to the Document Custody Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require
the Company to perform such activities. 

4.
Based on such assessment for the Period, the Company has complied in all material respects with the Applicable Servicing Criteria
for the Period. 

2 

PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report with respect to Management s assessment
of the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Period.

The
Board of Directors 

 U.S.
Bank National Association 

We
have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Report on Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing
Criteria, that U.S. Bank National Association and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association (collectively, the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB
for the U.S. Bank Corporate Trust Asset-Backed Securities Platform (the Platform ), for which the Company provides
trustee, securities administration, registrar and paying agent services, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, except
for servicing criteria Items 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(4)(i)-(ii), and 1122(d)(4)(iv)-(xiv), which the Company has determined are
not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the servicing platform covered by this report. Management is responsible
for the Company s compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s
assertion about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence
about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than all of the individual asset-backed transactions
and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining
whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing
criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company
during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either
prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during
the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. Although the Company is responsible
for assessing compliance with Items 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(v), and 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB, there were no servicing
activities performed by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2022 that required these servicing criteria to be complied
with. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

We
are required to be independent of the Company and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant
ethical requirements related to our examination engagement. 

Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 

In
our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2022, for the U.S. Bank Corporate Trust Asset-Backed Securities Platform is fairly stated, in all material
respects.

that each vendor is not considered a servicer, as that term is defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and
therefore, the Company is assuming responsibility for compliance with such servicing criteria applicable to each
vendor s servicing activities. In accordance with Regulation AB and its related interpretations, the requirement for
management to assess compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to a vendor s activities is satisfied if the
Company has instituted policies and procedures to monitor whether such vendor s activities comply in all material
respects with such criteria. Compliance with the applicable servicing criteria is achieved if those policies and procedures
are designed to provide reasonable assurance that such vendor s activities comply with such criteria and those policies
and procedures are operating effectively for the period covered by Management s Report. Our examination does not
provide a legal determination of whether a vendor is or is not considered a servicer, and therefore, on whether the Company,
in its Management Report, is eligible to elect to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria
applicable to each vendor s servicing activities. 

In
our opinion, management s assertion that Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC complied with the aforementioned applicable servicing
criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 for the Primary Servicing Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.
