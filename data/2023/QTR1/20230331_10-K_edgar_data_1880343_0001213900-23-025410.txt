Cautionary
Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements 

We
make forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In some cases, you can identify these statements by forward-looking words
such as may, might, should, would, could, expect, 
 plan, anticipate, intend, believe, estimate, predict, 
 potential or continue, and the negative of these terms and other comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements,
which are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and assumptions about us, may include projections of our future financial
performance based on our growth strategies and anticipated trends in our business. These statements are only predictions based on our
current expectations and projections about future events. There are important factors that could cause our actual results, level of activity,

by the forward-looking statements. In particular, you should consider the numerous risks and uncertainties described in this report
under the caption Risk Factors. 

While
we believe we have identified material risks, these risks and uncertainties are not exhaustive. New risks and uncertainties emerge from
time to time, and it is not possible to predict all risks and uncertainties, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business
or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any
forward-looking statements. 

Although
we believe the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, level
of activity, performance, or achievements. Moreover, neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy or completeness
of any of these forward-looking statements. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events.
The forward-looking statements in this report represent our views as of the date on which the statements are made. We undertake no obligation
to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, and we do not intend
to do so. 

Forward-looking statements
include, but are not limited to, statements about: 

our
 ability to continue as a going concern in the absence of obtaining additional financing;

our
 ability to adequately address increased demands that may be placed on our management, operational
 and production capabilities.

our
 reliance on celebrities to endorse our wines and market our brand; 

general
 competitive conditions, including actions our competitors may take to grow their businesses; 

fluctuations
 in consumer demand for wine; 

overall
 decline in the health of the economy and consumer discretionary spending; 

the
 occurrence of adverse weather events, natural disasters, public health emergencies, including
 the COVID-19 pandemic, or other unforeseen circumstances that may cause delays to or interruptions
 in our operations; 

risks
 associated with disruptions in our supply chain for grapes and raw and processed materials,
 including corks, glass bottles, barrels, winemaking additives and agents, water and other
 supplies; 

ii 

the
 impact of COVID-19 on our customers, suppliers, business operations and financial results; 

disrupted
 or delayed service by the distributors we rely on for the distribution of our wines; 

our
 ability to successfully execute our growth strategy, including continuing our expansion in
 the direct-to-consumer sales channel; 

quarterly
 and seasonal fluctuations in our operating results; 

our
 success in retaining or recruiting, or changes required in, our officers, key employees or
 directors;

 ability to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights, including our brand
 and reputation;

the
 risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic
 risks and conditions; 

claims,
 demands and lawsuits to which we are, and may in the future, be subject and the risk that

This
Annual Report on Form 10-K includes market data and forecasts with respect to the wine industry. We have obtained this market data and
certain industry forecasts from various independent third-party sources, including industry publications, reports by market research
firms, surveys, and other independent sources. Some data and information are based on management s estimates and calculations,
which are derived from our review and interpretation of internal company research and data, surveys, and independent sources. We believe
the data regarding the industry in which we compete and our market position and market share within this industry generally indicate
size, position, and market share within this industry; however, this data is inherently imprecise and is subject to significant business,
economic and competitive uncertainties and risks due to a variety of factors, including those described in Risk Factors. 
These and other factors could cause our future performance to differ materially from our assumptions and estimates. 

In
addition, statements that we believe and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These
statements are based on information available to us as of the date of this report. Although we believe that information provides a reasonable
basis for these statements, that information may be limited or incomplete. Our statements should not be read to indicate that we have
conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain, and investors
are cautioned not to unduly rely on these statements. 

Risk Factor
Summary 

An
investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Any of the factors set forth under Risk Factors may limit
our ability to successfully execute our business strategy. You should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this report,
and, in particular, you should evaluate the specific factors set forth under Risk Factors in deciding whether to invest
in our common stock. Among these important risks are the following: 

iii 

We
 have a limited operating history and have generated limited revenue to date. 

We
 have not generated profits from operations to date. 

We
 need to hire additional executive officers and other personnel. 

The
 success of our business depends heavily on the strength of our wine brand. 

If
 our business grows, it will place increased demands on our management, operational and production
 capabilities that we may not be able to adequately address. If we are unable to meet these
 increased demands, our business will be harmed. 

Our
 advertising and promotional investments may affect our financial results but not be effective. 

We
 rely heavily on celebrities and sports organizations to endorse our wines and market our
 brand. 

We
 rely heavily on third-party suppliers and service providers, and they may not continue to
 produce products or provide services that are consistent with our standards or applicable
 regulatory requirements, which could harm our brand, cause consumer dissatisfaction, and
 require us to find alternative suppliers and service providers. 

We
 face significant competition with an increasing number of products and market participants
 that could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial
 results. 

Consolidation
 of the distributors of our wines, as well as the consolidation of retailers, may increase
 competition in an already crowded space and may have a material adverse effect on our business,
 results of operations and financial results. 

A
 reduction in consumer demand for wine, which may result from a variety of factors, including
 demographic shifts and decreases in discretionary spending, could materially and adversely
 affect our business, results of operations and financial results. 

Due
 to the three-tier alcohol beverage distribution system in the United States, we are heavily
 reliant on our distributors that resell alcoholic beverages in all states in which we do
 business. A significant reduction in distributor demand for our wines would materially and
 adversely affect our sales and profitability. 

Our
 marketing strategy involves continued expansion into the direct-to-consumer channel, which
 may present risks and challenges for which we are not adequately prepared and which could
 negatively affect our sales in these channels and our profitability. 

A
 failure to adequately prepare for adverse events that could cause disruption to elements
 of our business, including the availability of bulk grapes, and the blending, inventory aging
 or distribution of our wines could materially and adversely affect our business, results
 of operations and financial results. 

Inclement
 weather, drought, pests, plant diseases and other factors could reduce the amount or quality
 of the grapes available to produce our wines, which could materially and adversely affect
 our business, results of operations and financial results. 

If
 we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of premium juice from third-party juice suppliers,
 the quantity or quality of our annual production of wine could be adversely affected, causing
 a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

If
 we are unable to identify and obtain adequate supplies of quality agricultural, raw and processed
 materials, including corks, glass bottles, barrels, winemaking additives and agents, water
 and other supplies, or if there is an increase in the cost of the commodities or products,
 our profitability, production and distribution capabilities could be negatively impacted,
 which would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial
 condition. 

iv 

The
 COVID-19 pandemic has affected our customers, our suppliers and our business operations,
 and the duration and extent to which this and any future global health pandemics will impact
 our business, results of operations and financial results in future periods remains uncertain. 

In
 addition to litigation that may arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business,
 we have been engaged in litigation with each of our former Chief Operating Officer and former
 Chief Executive Officer. 

The
 impact of U.S. and worldwide economic trends and financial market conditions could materially
 and adversely affect our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 

If
 we are unable to secure and protect our intellectual property in domestic and foreign markets,
 including trademarks for our wine brands and wines, the value of our wine brands and intellectual
 property could decline, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results
 of operations and financial results. 

We
 may not be fully insured against catastrophic perils, including catastrophic loss or inaccessibility
 of wineries, production facilities and/or distribution systems resulting from fire, wildfire,
 flood, wind events, earthquake and other perils, which may cause us to experience a material
 financial loss. 

From
 time to time, we may become subject to litigation specifically directed at the alcoholic
 beverage industry, as well as litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. 

A
 failure of one or more of our key IT systems, networks, processes, associated sites or service
 providers could have a material adverse impact on business operations, and if the failure
 is prolonged, our financial condition. 

Our
 failure to adequately maintain and protect the personal information of our customers or our
 employees in compliance with evolving legal requirements could have a material adverse effect
 on our business. 

If
 our business grows, it will place increased demands on our management, operational and production
 capabilities that we may not be able to adequately address. If we are unable to meet these
 increased demands, our business will be harmed.

PART

ITEM
1. BUSINESS. 

Overview 

We
are a premier producer of low carb, low calorie, premium wines in the United States. Founded in 2019, Fresh Vine Wine brings an
innovative better-for-you solution to the wine market. Offering bold, crisp, and creamy wines that embody health, warmth,
and a deeper connection to wellness and an active lifestyle, we offer a unique and innovative collection of today s most popular
varietals. We currently sell seven proprietary varietals: Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros , Sparkling
Ros , and a limited Reserve Napa Cabernet Sauvignon. All varietals are produced and bottled in Napa, California. 

Our
wines are exclusively focused on the affordable luxury segment, the fastest growing segment of the wine market according to IWSR, addressing
the largest wine drinking segment in the 340 billion world-wide wine market, in which United States consumers spent 53 billion
in 2020 for wine produced in the U.S., with an additional 16 billion spent on imported wines in the U.S. Importantly, our
wines stand out in the luxury wine market because they address the preferences of our target demographic of consumers with moderate to
affluent income and with a desire to pursue a healthy and active lifestyles for a low-calorie, low-carb, gluten-free product, while
concurrently delivering the quality and taste profile of a premium wine brand. This allows us to position our wines in the rapidly emerging
 better for you segment that seeks to appeal to consumers emphasis on a healthy lifestyle. While we believe our product
offerings have mass appeal among all consumers of affordable luxury wines, we have positioned the Fresh Vine Wine brand as a complement
to the healthy and active lifestyles of younger generation wine consumers. 

Our
core wine offerings are priced strategically to appeal to mass markets and sell at a list price between 15 and 25 per bottle price
points that support a premium product strategy, appeal to mass markets, and allow us to offer significant value across all consumer distribution
channels. Given the Fresh Vine Wine brand s celebrity backing, better-for-you appeal, and overall product quality,
we believe that it presents today s consumers with a unique value proposition within this price category. We have partnered
with celebrities Nina Dobrev and Julianne Hough to promote our wines and our brand. Additionally, Fresh Vine Wine is one of very few
products available at this price point that includes a renowned Napa Valley winemaker, Jamey Whetstone. 

We
conducted an international search to find an accomplished winemaker who shared the Fresh Vine Wine vision and have entered into an agreement
with Mr. Whetstone, an established, award-winning winemaker from Napa Valley, to develop our wines. Consulting with the Fresh Vine
Wine brand compliments Mr. Whetstone s lifestyle as an active surfer, skier, and all-around outdoorsman. His passion
for winemaking is mirrored by his passion for adventure, and he too wanted to create a better-for-you wine that customers can be
proud to bring to the table for any occasion. We believe it is unique for a high-profile winemaker like Mr. Whetstone to attach
his name and reputation to a brand in the better-for-you wine segment, and we believe that Mr. Whetstone s association
with our brand increases consumer awareness and speaks to the quality of our varietals. 

As
a testament to this quality, in September 2022 we announced that The Tasting Panel Magazine and The Somm Journal, two highly regarded
wine publications, had awarded Fresh Vine Wine s California Cabernet Sauvignon, 2020 Vintage, a 92 Rating (out of 100). This is
the second of our varietals to receive a 92 Rating during 2022, with our Limited Reserve Napa Cabernet Sauvignon receiving a Rating of
92 from James Suckling, regarded as one of the world s most influential wine critics, in July. Also, in July 2022, our 2020
California Pinot Noir and California 2021 Ros varietals were awarded Bronze Medals by TEXSOM. In 2022, Fresh Vine Wine varietals
were recognized by various industry authorities with a total of 16 separate awards. 

Our wines are distributed across the
United States and Puerto Rico through wholesale, retail, and direct-to-consumer (DTC) channels. We are able to conduct
wholesale distribution of our wines in all 50 states and Puerto Rico, and we are licensed to sell through DTC channels in 43 states.
As of December 31, 2022, we hold active relationships with wholesale distributors in 48 states, unchanged from September 30, 2022,
and currently have additional states in which licensing is pending. We are actively working with leading distributors, including
Southern Glazer s Wine Spirits (SGWS), Johnson Brothers, and Republic National Distributing Company (RNDC), to
expand our presence across the contiguous United States. 

1 

Our
DTC channel enables us to sell wine directly to the consumer at full retail prices. Although these prices are consistent with our suggested
retail prices (SRPs), we incur two mark-ups of approximately 30 each for our distributor and retail partners when selling wine
through our wholesale distribution channel, therefore directly reducing our revenue and margins. Because the DTC channel provides significantly
higher margins than sales generated through wholesale distributors, we intend to further invest in DTC capabilities to ensure it remains
an integral part of our business. We also believe continued investment in DTC technologies and capabilities are critical to maintaining
an intimate relationship with our customers, which is becoming increasingly digital. In addition, we also sell through alternative DTC
sales platforms, such as ecommerce marketplaces, product aggregators and virtual distributors, all of which have experienced significant
recent growth, as well as sales through home delivery services. 

We
do not own or operate any vineyards. Instead of cultivating our own grapes, we currently use Fior di Sole, a third-party supplier,
to source grapes with the help of our winemaker. This allows us to leverage our supplier s broad network of vendor relationships
and purchasing power to negotiate favorable cost structures. Because our supplier procures product inputs on our behalf, including bulk
juice, we do not currently engage directly with grape growers growers or bulk distributors of juice bulk distributors ).
As a result, we have limited front-end supply chain visibility. This is a strategy by design that we believe provides us with access
to diversified growers and large distributors, which reduces our reliance upon any single vendor and mitigates our exposure to droughts,
wildfires, spoilage, contamination and other supply side risks common to the wine industry. 

Our
supplier procures grapes and/or juice for our existing varietals from California. This juice is then stored in Napa until time of production,
at which point it is made available for blending and bottling processes at our Napa Valley production and bottling facility. This is
significant in that both blending and bottling must occur within Napa to be considered produced and bottled in Napa a
distinctive product attribute that adds significant production value to our brand in the eyes of consumers. However, wine produced by
the Company will only be labelled with a Napa Valley appellation of origin if it is produced from grapes grown in the Napa Valley American
Viticultural Area (AVA). The labels for the Company s core wines identify California as the appellation of origin. 

Our
asset-light operating model allows us to utilize third-party assets, including land and production facilities. This approach
helps us mitigate many of the risks associated with agribusiness, such as isolated droughts or fires. Because we source product inputs
from multiple geographically dispersed vendors, we reduce reliance on any one vendor and benefit from broad availability/optionality
of product inputs. This is particularly important as a California-based wine producer where droughts or fires can have an extremely
detrimental impact to a company s supply chain if not diversified. 

Our Strengths 

Differentiated
Product Offerings Premium, Napa Valley Wines within the Better-For-You Segment 

We
offer wines that are differentiated from those sold by other wine producers operating within the better-for-you segment of the affordable
luxury category based on our premium quality, our association with an award-winning winemaker and our Napa Valley based state of
the art production. 

Premium
 Wines. Premium wines are differentiated from other varietals based on consumers 
 perception and expectation that they are of exceptional quality. We have developed a proprietary
 winemaking process that produces superior quality and taste in the affordable luxury wine
 category based on consumer preferences data, direct consumer feedback and careful market
 research. Importantly, our current wines stand out in the luxury wine market because they
 address consumers growing preference for a less-calorie, less-carb, less sugar and
 gluten-free option, while concurrently delivering the quality and taste profile of a
 premium wine brand.

Award-Winning Winemaker. We
 conducted an international search to find an accomplished winemaker who shared the Fresh
 Vine Wine vision and have entered into an agreement with Jamey Whetstone, an established,
 award winning winemaker from Napa Valley, to develop our wines. Consulting with the Fresh
 Vine Wine brand compliments Mr. Whetstone s lifestyle as an active surfer, skier,
 and all-around outdoorsman. His passion for winemaking is mirrored by his passion for
 adventure, and he too wanted to create a better-for-you wine that customers can be proud
 to bring to the table for any occasion. We believe it is unique for a high-profile winemaker
 like Mr. Whetstone to attach his name and reputation to a brand in the better-for-you wine
 segment, and we believe that Mr. Whetstone s association with our brand increases
 consumer awareness and speaks to the quality of our varietals. 

Produced
 and Bottled in Napa Valley. Importantly, we are able to market
 our wines as being produced and bottled in Napa Valley, California. We believe that this
 designation impacts consumption decisions of many wine drinkers, as Napa Valley-produced wines
 are considered by many to be a sign of superior production quality. However, wine produced
 by the Company will only be labelled with a Napa Valley appellation of origin if it is produced
 from grapes grown in the Napa Valley American Viticultural Area (AVA). The labels for the
 Company s existing wines identify California as the appellation of origin. Currently,
 this only applies to our Reserve wine. 

Capital-Efficient and
Scalable Operational Structure 

We
have strategically structured our organization and operations to minimize our capital investment requirements while maintaining flexibility
to rapidly scale our production capabilities to meet consumer demands. We do this by utilizing our internal capabilities while leveraging
a network of reputable third-party providers with industry experience and expertise that we use to perform various functions falling
outside our internal core competencies. 

Production
and Bottling on an Alternating Proprietorship Basis 

We
contract with Fior di Sole, an industry leading packaging innovation and wine production company based in Napa Valley, California,
to serve as a host winery and to occupy a portion of its production and warehouse facility and utilize its production equipment
on an alternating proprietorship basis. Under this arrangement, we use capacity at Fior di Sole s production facility at times
mutually convenient to us and Fior di Sole to produce and bottle our wines for an initial set-up fee and a recurring monthly fee.
Fior di Sole is responsible for keeping its production equipment in good operating order. When the alternating Premises is operated by
or used on behalf of our Company, it is operated pursuant to our federal basic permit and California winegrower s license. Under
the agreement, we are solely responsible for managing and conducting our own winemaking activities and we make all production decisions
relating to our wines. However, we may request the use of Fior di Sole s personnel to perform crush, fermentation, blending, cellar,
warehousing, barrel topping and/or bottling services for additional fees. This arrangement has allowed us to commence our operations
and build the Fresh Vine Wine brand without having to incur the considerable overhead costs involved with the purchase or full-time lease
of a production facility. The term of the agreement commenced in July 2019, had an initial term of one year and automatically renews
for additional one-year terms unless either party provides 90 days written notice to the other of its intent to terminate at
the end of the then current term. Either party may terminate the agreement upon 30 days written notice if the other party is in
violation of any law or regulation that renders it impossible to perform its obligations under the agreement for a period of greater
than 30 days, makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors or files for bankruptcy protection, or is in material breach of its
obligations under the agreement and such failure to perform is not cured within 30 days of written notice from the other party.
We believe we have sufficient capacity under our current agreement or with alternative suppliers to increase production to meet increased
consumers demand for our wines. 

Fior
di Sole also provides us with capacity juice and blends, finishes, bottles, stops, labels and packages our wine, which reduces our internal
overhead expenses and allows us to benefit from that company s increased purchasing power. Fior di Sole provides these services
on a purchase order basis, which purchase orders are subject to the parties mutual agreement and governed by a Custom Winemaking
and Bottling Agreement. This agreement outlines the schedule for placing orders, the responsibility and schedule for delivery of production
materials, procedures for establishing the wine bottling date and delivery date. We are required to remit 20 of the amount due for wine
produced, bottled and packaged pursuant to this agreement upon our submission of a purchase order. The payment advance is used by Fior
Di Sole to reserve or procure materials on our behalf with additional vendors for bottles, boxes, corks, labels, juice, and other inputs.
We, or our winemaker on our behalf, oversees the production at the winery approves all components and aspects of the production process.
The balance of the amount due for wine produced, bottled and packaged (the remaining 80 is due following our quality review and acceptance
of the finished product. 

The
ability and willingness of Fior di Sole to supply and provide services to us pursuant to purchase orders delivered under the Custom Winemaking
and Bottling Agreement may be affected by competing orders placed by other companies, the demands of those companies or other factors.
If Fior di Sole becomes unable or unwilling to supply and provide services to us, we believe we can obtain comparable supplies and services
from alternative suppliers. However, there can be no assurance that alternative suppliers will be available when required on terms that
are acceptable to us, or at all, or that alternative suppliers will allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements.

Licensing,
Tax and Regulatory Compliance 

We
have contracted with a third-party to manage our regulatory licensing and compliance activities. We maintain licenses that enable
us to distribute our wine to all 50 states, and to sell direct-to-consumer from our e-commerce website in 48 states. We currently
utilize software tools available to the industry and work with our license compliance service provider to navigate and manage the complex
state-by-state tax and other regulations that apply to our operations in the beverage alcohol industry. This has enabled us to expand
our operations and grow our revenue while reducing the administrative burden of tax compliance, reporting and product registration. 

Through
selective recruiting and hiring, we have also built these capabilities internally; we increasingly perform these activities in-house.
This allows us to operate with greater control and responsiveness over regulatory licensing and compliance requirements, ensuring that
our brand and each of its underlying varietals is properly licensed across state and federal levels. 

We
believe that leveraging our network of supply chain and compliance partners, consultants and service providers enables us to avoid potential
costly and lengthy delays on nearly every aspect of our business, from grapes to packaging materials, and will accelerate our return
on capital due to our limited need to procure expensive equipment, real estate, and other capital-intensive resources. We believe we
are well-positioned to 

Sales
and Marketing Strategy 

We
believe we bring a unique sales and marketing approach that will increase the visibility of our brand and product offerings to our target
consumers. 

Omni-Channel Marketing
Approach 

Today s
consumers interact with brands through many channels, from traditional media to social media and other digital channels, and through
various in-person and online purchasing methods. In order to build the visibility of our brand and create a grassroots consumer
following to support our DTC distribution channel, we have employed a strategic omnichannel marketing approach that we believe allows
us to engage with our target consumers on their terms to expand and deepen their recognition of our brand. In addition to other mass
market promotional activities, our marketing strategy also utilizes modern techniques, efficiency measures, and channels not commonly
seen in the wine industry, including a combination of social media lifestyle and wine influencer activities, through which brand ambassadors
or influencers may conduct promotional activities through the Company s or their own social media channels including,
but not limited to, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube and Pinterest, among others. 

Celebrity-based Affinity 

Recent years
have seen a rise in the creation of celebrity owned and/or endorsed alcoholic beverage brands, which utilize fans affinity towards
celebrities to promote their product offerings and drive sales. We are positioned to take advantage of this trend based on the popularity
of Nina Dobrev and Julianne Hough, two of our co-founders, each of whom served on our board of directors prior to our initial public
offering. 

4 

In
March 2021, we entered into five-year license agreements with Ms. Dobrev and Ms. Hough, who have a collective following of
approximately 31 million people on their Instagram social media platforms alone, pursuant to which they actively promote our business
and varietals of wine. Under these license agreements, each has also granted us a license to use her pre-approved name, likeness,
image, and other indicia of identity, as well as certain content published by her on her social media or other channels, on and in conjunction
with the sale and related pre-approved advertising and promotion of our varietals of wine and marketing materials. Ms. Dobrev and
Ms. Hough have agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to grant any similar license or render services of any sort on behalf of or
in connection with any party in the wine category anywhere in the world during the term of her agreement, other than with respect to
Company. The license agreements are scheduled to expire in March 2026. However, the license agreements to provide that each of Ms.
Dobrev and Ms. Hough will have the right to terminate her agreement if as of the end of calendar year 2023, we have not achieved at least
 5.0 million in EBITDA in either fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2023. See Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions License
Agreements with Nina Dobrev and Julianne Hough. 

We
also enjoy support from several other celebrity influencers who have supported our brand without any agreement or obligation to do so.
Together with celebrity brand ambassadors, our marketing efforts have produced highly visible content, including multiple billboards
on the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles, promotions in connection with the opening of Resort World Casino in Las Vegas, product placements
in major sports venues and coverage in various print and television media. 

Professional
Sports Sponsorships 

We
have previously entered into sponsorship agreements with professional sports organizations and venues spanning all four major United States
professional sports leagues, which support our commitment and outreach to consumers focused on active and healthy lifestyles, including
agreements with the following organizations and/or their affiliates: 

Washington
 Capitals (NHL) and Washington Wizards (NBA) 

Tampa
 Bay Rays (MLB) 

Washington
 Commanders (NFL) 

Los
 Angeles Chargers (NFL) 

These
sponsorship arrangements generally provide us with advertising placements at the stadiums and arenas during sporting and concert events,
as well as specified media and other advertising and promotional benefits, in exchange for our payment of annual sponsorship fees. 

We
completed our sponsorship agreement with the Los Angeles Chargers in the fourth quarter of 2022, intend to reduce or cancel the remaining
sponsorships and do not anticipate pursuing new professional sports sponsorships as part of our marketing and brand awareness initiatives
going forward since our brand has reached national retail distribution. 

Labelling
and Innovative Packaging Initiatives 

We
believe wine labelling can have a big impact on consumers purchasing practices. We conduct market research to validate the consistency
of our wine labels with our brand narrative. Packaging also continues to be a key driver of brand perception, and we are exploring active
lifestyle packaging alternatives to traditional bottling that provides an opportunity for our customers to enjoy Fresh Vine Wines
in non-traditional settings now and for future years, including bottles with screw-off caps, aluminum cans, and smaller
size bottles and cans that can be taken on-the-go and are ideal for in-store point of purchase sales. 

Engagement
with Industry Experienced Third Party Vendors 

In
October 2022, we executed a strategy that is aimed at amplifying cash preservation initiatives while continuing to focus on accelerating
sales growth. The plan resulted in the termination of ten employees on the Company s internal sales team and the engagement by
the Company of a third party sales and distribution management company positioned to more efficiently and effectively facilitate current
and future product sales. In addition, the Company engaged a reputable third party vendor to manage marketing initiatives and drive growth
primarily within the Company s Direct-to-Consumer sales channel. 

5 

Consulting
Agreement with Whetstone Consulting 

On
June 12, 2019, we entered into a consulting agreement with Whetstone Consulting, through which our winemaker, Jamey Whetstone, does
business, which agreement was subsequently amended on May 15, 2020, amended and restated on March 16, 2021 and further amended
and restated on April 13, 2022 (the Consulting Agreement ). 

As
amended and restated, the Consulting Agreement provides the Company with ownership and intellectual property protections for Inventions
(as defined therein) conceived, made or reduced to practice by Whetstone Consulting that relate to the services provided to the Company.
In addition, Whetstone Consulting has agreed, for a period of one year following termination of the Consulting Agreement, not to directly
or indirectly engage or invest in, be employed by, lend credit to, receive compensation from or render services or advice to any person
engaged in a Competing Business located within a twelve-mile radius of a specified Napa, California address. For such purposes,
a Competing Business means any business relating to the development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of any product
that competes with any low calorie and/or low sulfite wine products sold or substantially under development by the Company during the
one-year restricted period. The Consulting Agreement does not restrict the acquisition, operation, management, consulting, or other
commercial activity by Whetstone Consulting, directly or indirectly in or with a winery, brewery, spirits, or other alcoholic beverage
industry business not concerning low calorie or low sulfite products or services. The Consulting Agreement
also contains non-solicitation restrictions applicable to clients, customers, suppliers, licensors, and employees for a period of
one year follow the agreement s termination, subject to certain exceptions. 

Under
the Consulting Agreement, we pay Whetstone Consulting a base consulting fee of 5,000 per month. In addition, the Company has agreed
to pay Whetstone Consulting additional commission-based compensation subject to satisfaction of identified milestones. Specifically,
the Company will pay Whetstone Consulting a 5,000 commission for each non-overlapping 30-day period in which the Company sells
Fresh Vine Wine Products to a minimum threshold number of separate True Food Kitchen locations for sale to customers from their menus.
For such purposes, Fresh Vine Wine Products means Client s wine products developed with the assistance of Whetstone
Consulting pursuant to the Services. Whetstone Consulting will also be entitled to receive a one-time 100,000 commission upon the
Company selling certain volumes of Fresh Vine Wine Products within any given non-overlapping 30-day period to at least a minimum
threshold number of locations of a single fast casual dining restaurant chain, and a one-time 40,000 commission upon the Company
selling certain volumes of Fresh Vine Wine Products within any given non-overlapping 30-day period to at least a minimum threshold
number of separate fine dining establishments. 

The
Consulting Agreement has an initial one year term expiring April 13, 2023, but renews automatically for successive one year periods
unless either party provides advance notice of non-renewal to the other. Whetstone Consulting may terminate the Consulting Agreement
at any time by giving us written notice at least 30 days prior to the termination date. We may terminate the Consulting Agreement
at any time. 

As
partial compensation for Whetstone Consulting s services to the Company pursuant to the Company s original consulting agreement
with Whetstone Consulting, the Company issued to Whetstone Consulting 619,343 shares of the Company s common stock (the Whetstone
Shares ). If the Company terminates the Consulting Agreement for cause, as such term is defined therein, and such
cause arises or relates to an act or acts directly related to Whetstone Consulting s ownership interest in the Company, the Company
may elect to purchase all Whetstone Shares then held by Whetstone Consulting at their fair market value.

Related
party services 

In
October 2021, the Company entered into a service agreement with Appellation Brands, LLC, a related party in the wine industry due to
common ownership, to provide representation and distribution services. As of June 15, 2022, the original agreement was terminated. Prior
to termination, the Company provided access to new markets and retail and wholesale customers to the related party. In exchange for these
services, the Company received a management fee of 50,000 per month plus a tiered fee ranging between 5.00 and 6.50 per
case of the products sold. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized 297,224 in service revenue related to this
agreement. In September 2022, the Company entered into a new distribution agreement with Appellation Brands, LLC to purchase approximately
 195,000 of wine inventory and sell directly to our customers. Sales associated with the new agreement are recorded within wholesale
revenue beginning September 1, 2022. Total sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 associated with the new agreement was 25,863. After
our sales of the Appellation Brands, LLC wine inventory has been completed, our affiliation with Appellation Brands, LLC is expected
to cease altogether. 

Our Strategy
for Growth 

We
expect to deliver meaningful increases in stockholder value by executing the following strategies to gain brand and product visibility
and increase sales and market share: 

Continuing
 to establish brand visibility, awareness and credibility through mass and micro marketing
 tactics and association with other strong brands, including celebrities, influencers and
 top tier winemakers, among others. These will range from organic to paid media. 

Continuing
 to build grass roots demand through high visibility sales and marketing activities that promote
 high margin DTC and home delivery sales channels, including continued investment in DTC technologies
 and capabilities that are critical to maintaining an intimate relationship with consumers. 

Expanding
 our U.S.-based wholesale and retail distribution network by leveraging our product and
 brand differentiation, the emerging better-for-you category and to provide distribution
 partners with a differentiated value proposition. 

Pursuing
 distribution of our wines internationally. 

Embracing
 disruptive technologies and customer trends, and exploring and expanding partnerships with
 other organizations investing in customer-centric technologies, such as home delivery,
 third party wine clubs and evolving alternative DTC purchasing methods, such as ecommerce
 marketplaces, product aggregators and virtual distributors. 

Expanding
 and strengthening key supply chain relationships, including with current and future juice
 suppliers, bottlers, materials suppliers, and dry goods suppliers, to establish a diversified
 portfolio of partners across all areas of our supply chain and to maintain effective capital
 management. 

Continuing
 to add to the Fresh Vine Wine product portfolio by developing new varietals that fit within
 the better-for-you category and are consistent with our existing brand. 

Continuing
 to invest in packaging innovation, including active lifestyle packaging alternatives
 to traditional bottling that provides an opportunity for our customers to enjoy Fresh Vine
 Wines in non-traditional settings. 

Capitalizing
 on upward price mobility While many other wine companies are experiencing
 downward price pressure to enter the coveted under 30 category, our wines currently sell
 for suggested retail prices ranging from 15 to 25 per bottle. 

Increasing
 our on-premises sales effort. COVID-19 severely limited on-premise sales across
 the industry. We believe as restrictions continue to loosen, there is significant opportunity
 to capture market share and available shelf space. 

Developing
 additional wine brands by replicating the strategies used to build the Fresh Vine Wine brand
 via business service line agreements. 

With
over 500,000 licensed retail accounts (according to Neilson) in the United States, there remains ample opportunity to continue broadening
distribution of our wines as well as increasing the volume of wine sold to existing accounts. 

7 

Competition 

The
wine industry and alcohol markets generally are intensely competitive. Our wines compete domestically and internationally with other
premium or higher quality wines produced in Europe, South America, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, as well as North America.
Our wines compete on the basis of quality, price, brand recognition and distribution capability. The ultimate consumer has many choices
of products from both domestic and international producers. Our wines may be considered to compete with all alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. 

At
any given time, there are more than 400,000 wine choices available to consumers, differing with one another based on vintage, variety
or blend, location and other factors. Accordingly, we experience competition from nearly every segment of the wine industry. Additionally,
some of our competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, offer a wider range of products, and have greater
name recognition, which may give them greater negotiating leverage with distributors and allow them to offer their products in more locations
and/or on better terms than us. Nevertheless, we believe that our brand offerings, scalable infrastructure and relationships with one
of the largest domestic distributors will allow us to continue growing our business. 

IT Systems 

We
rely on various IT systems, owned by us and third parties, to effectively manage our sales and marketing, accounting, financial, legal
and compliance functions. Our website is hosted by a third party, and we rely on third-party vendors for regulatory compliance for
order processing, shipments, and e-commerce functionality. We believe these systems are scalable to support our growth plans. We recognize
the value of enhancing and extending the uses of information technology in our business. 

Regulatory
Matters 

Regulatory
framework 

We,
along with our contract growers, producers, manufacturers, distributors, retail accounts and ingredients and packaging suppliers, are
subject to extensive regulation in the United States by federal, state and local government authorities with respect to registration,
production processes, product attributes, packaging, labelling, storage and distribution of wine and other products we make. 

We
are also subject to state and local tax requirements in all states where our wine is sold. We monitor the requirements of relevant jurisdictions
to maintain compliance with all tax liability and reporting matters. In California, we are subject to a number of governmental authorities,
and are also subject to city and county building, land use, licensing and other codes and regulations. 

Alcohol-related regulation 

We
are subject to extensive regulation in the United States by federal, state and local laws regulating the production, distribution
and sale of consumable food items, and specifically alcoholic beverages, including by the TTB and the FDA. The TTB is primarily
responsible for overseeing alcohol production records supporting tax obligations, issuing wine labelling guidelines, including grape
source and bottle fill requirements, as well as reviewing and issuing certificates of label approval, which are required for the sale
of wine through interstate commerce. We carefully monitor compliance with TTB rules and regulations, as well as the state law of each
state in which we sell our wines. In California, where most of our wines are made, we are subject to alcohol-related licensing and
regulations by many authorities, including the ABC. ABC agents and representatives investigate applications for licenses to sell
alcoholic beverages, report on the moral character and fitness of alcohol license applicants and the suitability of premises where sales
are to be conducted and enforce California alcoholic beverages laws. We are subject to municipal authorities with respect to aspects
of our operations, including the terms of our use permits. These regulations may limit the production of wine and control the sale of
wine, among other elements. 

8 

Employee
and occupational safety regulation 

We
are subject to certain state and federal employee safety and employment practices regulations, including regulations issued pursuant
to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act OSHA ), and regulations governing prohibited workplace discriminatory
practices and conditions, including those regulations relating to COVID-19 virus transmission mitigation practices. These regulations
require us to comply with manufacturing safety standards, including protecting our employees from accidents, providing our employees
with a safe and non-hostile work environment and being an equal opportunity employer. In California, we are also subject to employment
and safety regulations issued by state and local authorities. 

Environmental
regulation 

As
a result of our wine production activities, we and certain third parties with which we work are subject to federal, state and local environmental
laws and regulations. Federal regulations govern, among other things, air emissions, wastewater and stormwater discharges, and the treatment,
handling and storage and disposal of materials and wastes. State environmental regulations and authorities intended to address and oversee
environmental issues are largely state-level analogues to federal regulations and authorities intended to perform the similar purposes.
In California, we are also subject to state-specific rules, such as those contained in the California Environmental Quality Act,
California Air Resources Act, Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act, California Water Code sections 13300-13999 and
Title 23 of the California Administrative Code and various sections of the Health and Safety Code. We are subject to local environmental
regulations that address a number of elements of our wine production process, including air quality, the handling of hazardous waste,
recycling, water use and discharge, emissions and traffic impacts. 

Labelling
regulation 

Many
of our wines are identified by their appellation of origin, which are among the most highly regarded wine growing regions in the world.
An appellation may be present on a wine label only if it meets the requirements of applicable state and federal regulations that seek
to ensure the consistency and quality of wines from a specific territory. These appellations designate the specific geographic origin
of most or all (depending on the appellation) of the wine s grapes, and can be a political subdivision (e.g., a country, state
or county) or a designated viticultural area. The rules for vineyard designation are similar. Although we expect that most of our labels
will maintain the same appellation of origin from year to year, we may choose to change the appellation of one or more of our wines from
time to time to take advantage of high-quality grapes in other areas or to change the profile of a wine. 

Privacy
and security regulation 

We
collect personal information from individuals. Accordingly, we are subject to several data privacy and security related regulations,
including but not limited to: U.S. state privacy, security and breach notification laws; the GDPR; and other European privacy laws
as well as privacy laws being adopted in other regions around the world. In addition, the FTC and many state attorneys general are interpreting
existing federal and state consumer protection laws to impose evolving standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security
of information about individuals. Certain states have also adopted robust data privacy and security laws and regulations. For example,
the CCPA, which took effect in 2020, imposes obligations and restrictions on businesses regarding their collection, use, and sharing
of personal information and provides new and enhanced data privacy rights to California residents, such as affording them the right to
access and delete their personal information and to opt out of certain sharing of personal information. In response to the data privacy
laws and regulations discussed above and those in other countries in which we do business, we have implemented several technological
safeguards, processes, contractual third-party provisions, and employee trainings to help ensure that we handle information about
our employees and customers in a compliant manner. We maintain a global privacy policy and related procedures, and we train our workforce
to understand and comply with applicable privacy laws. 

9 

Intellectual
Property 

We
strive to protect the reputation of our wine brand. We establish, protect and defend our intellectual property in a number of ways, including
through employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, domestic and foreign trademark protections, intellectual
property licenses and social media and information security policies for employees. We have been granted three (3) trademark registrations
in the United States for FRESH VINE , FRESH VINE (Stylized) , and our FV Logo , and
numerous trademark registrations in other countries for the FRESH VINE mark, and we have filed, and expect to continue to file, trademark
applications seeking to protect any newly-developed wine brands. We have also been granted a copyright registration in the first
version of our website located at www.freshvine.com . Information contained on or accessible through our website is not incorporated
by reference in or otherwise a part of this report. As a copyright exists in a work of art once it is fixed in tangible medium, we intend
to continue to file copyright applications to protect newly-developed works of art that are important to our business. 

We
also rely on, and carefully protect, proprietary knowledge and expertise, including the sources of certain supplies, formulations, production
processes, innovation regarding product development and other trade secrets necessary to maintain and enhance our competitive position. 

Seasonality 

There
is a degree of seasonality in the growing cycles, procurement and transportation of grapes. The wine industry in general tends to experience
seasonal fluctuations in revenue and net income, with lower sales and net income during the quarter spanning January through March and
higher sales and net income during the quarter spanning from October through December due to the usual timing of seasonal holiday buying.
As our operations expand, we expect that we will be impacted by the seasonality experienced in the wine industry generally. 

Employees 

As
of December 31, 2022, we had approximately eight full-time employees. All of our employees are employed in the United States.
None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship
with our employees to be good. 

Legal
Proceedings 

We
may be subject to legal disputes and subject to claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. Except as disclosed in Item
3 Legal Proceedings, we are not a party or subject to any pending legal proceedings the resolution of which is expected
to have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition. 

Corporate
History 

We
were initially organized on May 8, 2019 as a Texas limited liability company under the name Fresh Grapes, LLC. In
connection with our initial public offering, on December 8, 2021, we converted from a Texas limited liability company into a Nevada
corporation and changed our name from Fresh Grapes, LLC to Fresh Vine Wine, Inc., which we refer to herein as the LLC Conversion. 
In conjunction with the LLC Conversion, all of our outstanding units were converted into shares of our common stock based on the relative
ownership interests of our pre-IPO equity holders. While operating as a limited liability company, our outstanding equity was referred
to as units. In this report, for ease of comparison, we may refer to such units as our common stock for periods prior to
the LLC Conversion, unless otherwise indicated in this report. Similarly, unless otherwise indicated, we may refer to members 
equity in this report as stockholders equity. Further, while operating as a limited liability company, our governing body was
referred to as our Board of Managers, with the members thereof being referred to as Managers. We may refer to such governing
body throughout this report as our board of directors and such individuals as our directors. 

Company

make available on the Investor Relations section of our website, free of charge, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports
on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, Proxy Statements, and Forms 3, 4 and 5, and amendments to those reports
as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such documents with, or furnishing such documents to, the SEC. The SEC maintains
a website www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file
electronically with the SEC.

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS. 

Our
business involves a number of challenges and risks. In addition to the other information in this report, you should consider carefully
the following risk factors in evaluating us and our business. The risks described below are not the only ones that we face. Additional
risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business, financial condition, operating results,
or prospects. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information contained in this report, including our financial
statements and related notes. 

Risks
related to our company and our business. 

We
have a limited operating history and have generated limited revenue to date. 

Our
company was recently founded, and to date we have engaged primarily in finalizing our business plan and establishing the corporation
and other formalities necessary to begin operations. Accordingly, we have a very limited operating history on which to base an evaluation
of our business and prospects. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered
by companies in their early stage of development, particularly companies in new and evolving markets such as ours. The risks include,
but are not limited to, an evolving business model and the management of growth and product development. To address these risks, we must,
among other things, implement and successfully execute our business strategy and other business systems, respond to competitive developments,
and attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in addressing the risks we may
encounter, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results
of operations. 

We
have generated very limited revenues to date, including revenues of 2,860,001 and 1,700,207 during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively.
We have incurred net losses of 15.20 million and 9.97 million during fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. We had an accumulated deficit
of 15.82 million and total stockholders equity of 5.61 million at December 31, 2022. We may never generate material revenues
or achieve profitability. 

We
have not generated profits from operations to date. The success and longevity of our company will depend on our ability to generate profits
from future operations or obtain sufficient capital through financing transactions to meet our business obligations. 

The report of our independent registered public
accounting firm on our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 included an explanatory paragraph indicating that
there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months from the financial statement issuance date.
We incurred net losses of 15.1 million and 9.97 million during fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our cash balance at December 31,
2022 was 2.1 million. On March 14, 2023, we completed a subscription rights offering of common stock and warrants to purchase common
stock in which we received aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 3.14 million, before deducting dealer-manager fees and offering
expenses. Our ability to continue as a going concern will be determined by our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to sustain our
operations and/or raise additional capital in the form of debt or equity financing. 

11 

We
need to hire additional executive officers and other personnel. 

Our
executive management is currently comprised of an Chief Executive Officer and a Chief Financial Officer, both of whom are serving in
interim positions. Also, pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, Damian Novak, Executive Chairman and a member of our board of directors,
resigned as Executive Chairman and removed himself from his management duties with the Company effective February 20, 2023, and resigned
from our board of directors effective March 14, 2023. Rick Nechio, our interim Chief Executive Officer and a member of our board of directors,
resigned from our board of directors effective February 20, 2023 and we continue to search for a permanent chief executive officer to
replace Mr. Nechio. Our future success will be dependent upon us locating and retaining qualified individuals who will serve as executive
officers on a permanent basis and lead our Company and our business operations, and on us locating additional members to serve on our
board of directors to help oversee and guide our company. We cannot predict with certainty when we will be able locate such individuals.
Following our appointment of a new chief executive officer, Mr. Nechio may aid in the transition of his management duties, we cannot
assure that such transition will be seamless or that it won t adversely impact our business operations. 

In
addition, our future success depends on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate highly skilled executive and
technical personnel. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, particularly in the wine industry in which there exists a limited
number of qualified individuals with expertise in launching, managing and expanding wine brands. If we fail to successfully attract,
assimilate, and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel, our business could suffer. 

The
success of our business depends heavily on the strength of our wine brand. 

Obtaining,
maintaining and expanding our reputation as a producer of premium wine among our customers and the premium wine market generally is critical
to the success of our business and our growth strategy. The premium wine market is driven by a relatively small number of active and
well-regarded wine critics within the industry who have outsized influence over the perceived quality and value of wines. If we are unable
to maintain the actual or perceived quality of our wines, including as a result of contamination or tampering, environmental or other
factors impacting the quality of our grapes or other raw materials, or if our wines otherwise do not meet the subjective expectations
or tastes of one or more of a relatively small number of wine critics, the actual or perceived quality and value of one or more of our
wines could be harmed, which could negatively impact not only the value of that wine, but also the value of the vintage, the particular
brand or our broader portfolio. The winemaking process is a long and labor-intensive process that is built around yearly vintages, which
means that once a vintage has been released we are not able to make further adjustments to satisfy wine critics or consumers. As a result,
we are dependent on our winemakers and tasting panels to ensure that every wine we release meets our exacting quality standards. 

With
the advent of social media, word within the premium wine market spreads quickly, which can accentuate both the positive and the negative
reviews of our wines and of wine vintages generally. Public perception of our brands could be negatively affected by adverse publicity
or negative commentary on social media outlets, particularly negative commentary on social media outlets that goes viral, 
or our responses relating to, among other things: 

an
 actual or perceived failure to maintain high-quality, safety, ethical, social and environmental
 standards for all of our operations and activities; 

an
 actual or perceived failure to address concerns relating to the quality, safety or integrity
 of our wines and the hospitality we offer to our guests at our potential future tasting rooms; 

our
 environmental impact, including our use of agricultural materials, packaging, water and energy
 use, and waste management; or 

an
 actual or perceived failure by us to promote the responsible consumption of alcohol. 

If
we do not produce wines that are well-regarded by the relatively small wine critic community, the wine market will quickly become aware
and our reputation, wine brand, business and financial results of our operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition,
if our wine receives negative publicity or consumer reaction, whether as a result of our wines or wines of other producers, our wines
in the same vintage could be adversely affected. Unfavorable publicity, whether accurate or not, related to our industry, us, our winery
brands, marketing, personnel, operations, business performance or prospects could also unfavorably affect our corporate reputation, company
value, ability to attract high-quality talent or the performance of our business. 

12 

Any
contamination or other quality control issue could have an adverse effect on sales of the impacted wine or our broader portfolio of wines.
If any of our wines become unsafe or unfit for consumption, cause injury or are otherwise improperly packaged or labelled, we may have
to engage in a product recall and/or be subject to liability and incur additional costs. A widespread recall, multiple recalls, or a
significant product liability judgment against us could cause our wines to be unavailable for a period of time, depressing demand and
our brand equity. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, any resulting negative publicity could adversely
affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and accounts, as well as our corporate and individual winery brands image
in such a way that current and future sales could be diminished. In addition, should a competitor experience a recall or contamination
event, we could face decreased consumer confidence by association as a producer of similar products. 

Additionally,
third parties may sell wines or inferior brands that imitate our wine brand or that are counterfeit versions of our labels, and customers
could be duped into thinking that these imitation labels are our authentic wines. For example, there could be instances of potential
counterfeiting. A negative consumer experience with such a wine could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future
and damage our brand integrity. Any failure to maintain the actual or perceived quality of our wines could materially and adversely affect
our business, results of operations and financial results. 

Damage
to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our wines for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for
our wines and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operational results, and financial results, as well as require additional
resources to rebuild our reputation, competitive position and winery brand strength. 

If
our business grows, it will place increased demands on our management, operational and production capabilities that we may not be able
to adequately address. If we are unable to meet these increased demands, our business will be harmed. 

Unless
we manage our growth effectively, we may make mistakes in operating our business, such as inaccurate forecasting. The anticipated growth
of our operations will place significant demand on our management and operational resources. In order to manage growth effectively, we
must implement and improve our operational systems, procedures and controls on a timely basis. Our key personnel have limited experience
managing this type of business. If we cannot manage our business effectively, our business could suffer. 

Our
advertising and promotional investments may affect our financial results but not be effective. 

Consumer
awareness is of great importance to the success of businesses operating in the wine industry. We have incurred, and expect to continue
to incur, significant advertising and promotional expenditures to enhance our wine brand and raise consumer awareness, which we believe
is vital to the long-term success of our operations. These expenditures may adversely affect our results of operations in a particular
quarter or even a full fiscal year and may not result in increased sales. Variations in the levels of advertising and promotional expenditures
have in the past caused, and are expected in the future to continue to cause, variability in our quarterly results of operations. While
we strive to invest only in effective advertising and promotional activities in both the digital and traditional segments, it is difficult
to correlate such investments with sales results, and there is no guarantee that our expenditures will be effective in building brand
strength or growing long term sales. 

We
rely heavily on celebrities and sports organizations to endorse our wines and market our brand. 

The
success of our business is heavily dependent on positive image and public popularity of, and affinity towards, celebrity spokespersons.
Nina Dobrev and Julianne Hough, two of our founders, currently serve as ambassadors of our company who actively endorse our wines on
their sizable social media and other outlets and are considered by many to be the face of our brand. Customers may be drawn to our products
because of their involvement in our Company as celebrities. We also have sponsorship arrangements with teams and/or venues associated
with the National Football League, National Hockey League, National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball. 

13 

We
have entered into license agreements with Ms. Dobrev and Ms. Hough, pursuant to which each granted us a license to use her pre-approved
name, likeness, image, and other indicia of identity, as well as certain content published by her on her social media and other channels,
on and in conjunction with the sale and related pre-approved advertising and promotion of our wine. The license agreements are scheduled
to expire in March 2026. However, the license agreements provide that each of Ms. Dobrev and Ms. Hough will have the right to terminate
her agreement if as of the end of calendar year 2023, we have not achieved at least 5.0 million in EBITDA in either fiscal 2022 or fiscal
2023. See Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions License Agreements with Nina Dobrev and Julianne Hough. 
If we are unable to renew our license arrangements with Ms. Dobrev and Ms. Hough upon the expiration of these agreements in March 2026,
or if Ms. Dobrev and Ms. Hough are entitled to and elect to terminate the license agreements after 2023, the rights and licenses granted
to us will be revoked and we will be required to cease the marketing and sale of products that feature their name, likeness, image, and
other indicia of identity. In such event, we would be required to refocus our marketing and brand promotion efforts, which may adversely
affect our business and results of operations. 

In
addition, there is no assurance that our celebrity-based brand promotion and marketing activities will be well-received by consumers
and result in the levels of product sales that we anticipate. Under extreme situations, our marketing efforts through celebrity endorsement
may have a material adverse effect on our brand image. For example, any damage to the reputations of our celebrity founders or any negative
or controversial publicities that our celebrities are involved in, either directly or indirectly, may result in the public s negative
perception of our brands and thus adversely affect our reputation and the marketability and sales of our products. It is possible for
negative posts or comments about our Company or our celebrity spokespersons to be shared quickly and disseminated widely due to the continued
growing use of social and digital media, possibly resulting in cancellation. Celebrities reputation and favorability
in the eyes of the public could also decrease for a number of other reasons, including, without limitation, participation in media endeavors
that are unsuccessful, diminished recognition with the public due to decreased participation in the media landscape or shifting tastes
of the public, failure to generate engagement on new social media platforms at the levels they have enjoyed on existing platforms, and
an inability to access to social media platforms due to violations of terms of use or otherwise. 

If
the positive image and public popularity of our celebrity spokespersons wanes or the public s affinity towards the sports organizations
that we sponsor decreases, regardless of the reason, it would have a material adverse impact on one of our primary marketing activities
and could result in decreased demand for our wines, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operational results and
financial results, and require us to seek additional resources to rebuild our reputation, competitive position and winery brand strength. 

We
rely heavily on third-party suppliers and service providers, and they may not continue to produce products or provide services that are
consistent with our standards or applicable regulatory requirements, which could harm our brand, cause consumer dissatisfaction, and
require us to find alternative suppliers and service providers. 

We
have strategically structured our organization and operations with a view towards minimizing our capital investment requirements. We
do this by leveraging a network of third-party providers with industry experience and expertise that we use to perform various functions
on our behalf. Specifically, we contract with Fior di Sole, an industry leading packaging innovation and wine production company based
in Napa Valley, California, to serve as a host winery and permit us occupy a portion of its production and warehouse
facility and its production equipment on an alternating proprietorship basis. Under this arrangement, we are able to use capacity at
Fior di Sole s production facility at times mutually convenient to us and Fior di Sole to produce and bottle our wines. Fior di
Sole is responsible for keeping its production equipment in good operating order. Although we are solely responsible for managing and
conducting our own winemaking activities, we may request use of the Fior di Sole s personnel to perform crush, fermentation, blending,
cellar, warehousing, barrel topping and/or bottling services for additional fees. Under a separate agreement, Fior di Sole provides us
with bulk juice and blends, finishes, bottles, stops, labels, and packages our wine. Fior di Sole provides these services on a purchase
order basis, which purchase orders are subject to the parties mutual agreement. 

In
addition, in October 2022, we executed a strategy that is aimed at amplifying cash preservation initiatives while continuing to focus
on accelerating sales growth. The plan resulted in the termination of ten employees on the Company s internal sales team and the
engagement by the Company of a third party sales and distribution management company positioned to more efficiently and effectively facilitate
current and future product sales. In addition, the Company engaged a reputable third party vendor to manage marketing initiatives and
drive growth primarily within the Company s Direct-to-Consumer sales channel. The Company relies heavily on the third parties to
manage the sales and distribution of our wine and manage our DTC marketing initiatives. We also utilize third parties to help manage
all of our regulatory licensing and compliance activities, and we utilize additional software tools available to the industry to navigate
and manage the complex state-by-state regulations that apply to our operations in the beverage alcohol industry. 

14 

We
engage many of our third-party suppliers and service providers on a purchase order basis or pursuant to agreements that are generally
one year or less in duration. The ability and willingness of these third parties to supply and provide services to us may be affected
by competing orders placed by other companies, the demands of those companies or other factors. If we experience significant increases
in demand or need to replace a significant third party supplier or service provider, there can be no assurance that alternative third
party vendors will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or that any such vendor will allocate sufficient
capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. If we fail to replace a supplier or servicer provider in a timely manner or on commercially
reasonable terms, we could incur product disruptions and our operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed. Switching
or adding additional vendors, particularly our alternating proprietorship host winery, would also involve additional costs and require
management time and focus. 

Except
for remedies that may be available to us under our agreements with our third-party vendors, we cannot control whether or not they devote
sufficient time and resources to supporting our business operations. These third parties may also have relationships with other commercial
entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be providing services, which could affect their performance on our behalf.
If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines or need to be
replaced for other reasons, it could adversely impact our ability to meet consumers demands for our products or comply with regulatory
requirements and subject us to potential liability, any of which may harm the reputation of our company and our products. 

Although
we carefully manage our relationships with our network of third-party vendors, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges
or delays in the future or that these challenges or delays will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition
and prospects. 

We
face significant competition with an increasing number of products and market participants that could materially and adversely affect
our business, results of operations and financial results. 

Our
industry is intensely competitive and highly fragmented. Our wines compete with many other domestic and foreign wines. Our wines compete
with popularly priced generic wines and with other alcoholic and, to a lesser degree, non-alcoholic beverages, for drinker acceptance
and loyalty, shelf space and prominence in retail stores, presence, and prominence on restaurant wine lists and for marketing focus by
the Company s distributors, many of which carry extensive portfolios of wines and other alcoholic beverages. This competition is
driven by established companies as well as new entrants in our markets and categories. In the United States, wine sales are relatively
concentrated among a limited number of large suppliers, including E J Gallo, Constellation, Duckhorn, Trinchero, Jackson Family Wines,
Ste. Michelle and The Wine Group, and these and our other competitors may have more robust financial, technical, marketing and distribution
networks and public relations resources than we have. As a result of this intense competition, combined with our growth goals, we have
experienced and may continue to face upward pressure on our selling, marketing and promotional efforts and expenses. There can be no
assurance that in the future we will be able to successfully compete with our competitors or that we will not face greater competition
from other wineries and beverage manufacturers. 

If
we are unable to successfully compete with existing or new market participants, or if we do not effectively respond to competitive pressures,
we could experience reductions in market share and margins that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial results. 

15 

Consolidation
of the distributors of our wines, as well as the consolidation of retailers, may increase competition in an already crowded space and
may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial results. 

Other
than sales made directly to our consumers, the majority of our wine sales are made through distributors for resale to retail outlets,
restaurants and hotels across the United States. We expect sales to distributors to represent an increasingly substantial portion of
our future net sales as we continue to grow our network of wholesale distributors. Consolidation among wine producers, distributors,
wholesalers, suppliers and retailers could create a more challenging competitive landscape for our wines. In addition, we believe that
the increased growth and popularity of the retail e-commerce environment across the consumer product goods market, which accelerated
during the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting quarantines, stay at home orders, travel restrictions, retail store closures,
social distancing requirements and other government action, has and is likely to continue to to change the competitive landscape for
our wines. Consolidation at any level could hinder the distribution and sale of our wines as a result of reduced attention and resources
allocated to our winery brands both during and after transition periods, because our winery brands might represent a smaller portion
of the new business portfolio. Furthermore, consolidation of distributors may lead to the erosion of margins as newly consolidated distributors
take down prices or demand more margin from existing suppliers. Changes in distributors strategies, including a reduction in the
number of brands they carry or the allocation of resources for our competitors brands or private label products, may adversely
affect our growth, business, financial results and market share. Distributors of our wines offer products that compete directly with
our wines for inventory and retail shelf space, promotional and marketing support and consumer purchases. Expansion into new product
categories by other suppliers or innovation by new entrants into the market could increase competition in our product categories. 

An
increasingly large percentage of our net sales is concentrated within a small number of wholesale customers. The purchasing power of
large retailers is significant, and they have the ability to command concessions. There can be no assurance that the distributors and
retailers will purchase our wines or provide our wines with adequate levels of promotional and merchandising support. The failure to
bring on major accounts or the need to make significant concessions to retain one or more such accounts could have a material and adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. 

A reduction
in consumer demand for wine, which may result from a variety of factors, including demographic shifts and decreases in discretionary
spending, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial results. 

We
rely on consumers demand for our wine. Consumer preferences may shift due to a variety of factors, including changes in demographic
or social trends, changes in discretionary income, public health policies and perceptions and changes in leisure, dining and beverage
consumption patterns. Our success will require us to anticipate and respond effectively to shifts in consumer behavior and drinking tastes.
If consumer preferences were to move away from our wine brand, our results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. 

A
limited or general decline in consumer demand could occur in the future due to a variety of factors, including: 

a
 general decline in economic or geopolitical conditions; 

a
 general decline in the consumption of alcoholic beverage products in on-premise establishments,
 such as those that may result from smoking bans and stricter laws relating to driving while
 under the influence of alcohol and changes in public health policies, including those implemented
 to address the COVID-19 pandemic; 

a
 generational or demographic shift in consumer preferences away from wines to other alcoholic
 beverages; 

increased
 activity of anti-alcohol groups; 

concern
 about the health consequences of consuming alcoholic beverage products; and 

increased
 federal, state, provincial, and foreign excise, or other taxes on beverage alcohol products
 and increased restrictions on beverage alcohol advertising and marketing. 

Demand
for premium wine brands, like ours, may be particularly susceptible to changing economic conditions and consumer tastes, preferences
and spending habits, which may reduce our sales of these products and adversely affect our profitability. An unanticipated decline or
change in consumer demand or preference could also materially impact our ability to forecast for future production requirements, which
could, in turn, impair our ability to effectively adapt to changing consumer preferences. Any reduction in the demand for our wines would
materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial results. 

16 

Due
to the three-tier alcohol beverage distribution system in the United States, we are heavily reliant on our distributors that resell alcoholic
beverages in all states in which we do business. A significant reduction in distributor demand for our wines would materially and adversely
affect our sales and profitability. 

Due
to regulatory requirements in the United States, we sell a significant portion of our wines to wholesalers for resale to retail accounts.
A change in the relationship with any of our significant distributors could harm our business and reduce our sales. The laws and regulations
of several states prohibit changes of distributors, except under certain limited circumstances, making it difficult to terminate or otherwise
cease working with a distributor for poor performance without reasonable justification, as defined by applicable statutes. Any difficulty
or inability to replace distributors, poor performance of our major distributors or our inability to collect accounts receivable from
our major distributors could harm our business. In addition, an expansion of the laws and regulations limiting the sale of our wine would
materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial results. There can be no assurance that the distributors
and accounts to which we sell our wines will continue to purchase our wines or provide our wines with adequate levels of promotional
support, which could increase competitive pressure to increase sales and marketing spending and could materially and adversely affect
our business, results of operations and financial results. 

Our
marketing strategy involves continued expansion into the direct-to-consumer channel, which may present risks and challenges for which
we are not adequately prepared and which could negatively affect our sales in these channels and our profitability. 

During the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated
total revenue of 2,860,001 from all sources. Of this amount, we generated 911,326 from direct-to-consumer sales, which represents a
 136,905 increase in direct to consumer revenue generate during the year ended December 31, 2021. A portion of our operating strategy
is to expand our sales of wine through this direct-to-consumer channel. However, the direct-to-consumer marketplace is highly competitive
and in recent years has seen the entrance of new competitors and products targeting similar customer groups as our business. To be competitive
and forge new connections with customers, we are continuing investment in the expansion of our direct-to-consumer channel. Such expansion
may require significant investment in e-commerce platforms, marketing, fulfilment, information technology IT infrastructure
and other known and unknown costs. The success of our direct-to-consumer sales channel depends on our ability to maintain the efficient
and uninterrupted operation of online order-processing and fulfilment and delivery operations. As such, we are heavily dependent on the
performance of our shipping and technology partners. Any system interruptions or delays could prevent potential customers from purchasing
our wines directly. 

Our
ability to ship wines directly to our customers is the result of court rulings, including the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Granholm v.
Heald, which allow, in certain circumstances, shipments to customers of wines from out-of-state wineries. Any changes to the judicial,
legal, or regulatory framework that reduce our ability to sell wines in most states using our direct-to-consumer sales channel could
have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial results. 

We
may be unable to adequately adapt to shifts in consumer preferences for points of purchase, such as an increase in at-home delivery during
the COVID-19 pandemic, and our competitors may react more rapidly or with improved customer experiences. A failure to react quickly to
these and other changes in consumer preferences, or to create infrastructure to support new or expanding sales channels may materially
and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial results. 

17 

A failure
to adequately prepare for adverse events that could cause disruption to elements of our business, including the availability of bulk
grapes, and the blending, inventory aging or distribution of our wines could materially and adversely affect our business, results of
operations and financial results. 

Disruptions
to our operations caused by adverse weather, natural disasters, public health emergencies, including the COVID-19 pandemic, or unforeseen
circumstances may cause delays to or interruptions in our operations. Concerns regarding the availability of water for production is
particular to companies that produce and bottle wines in California. A consequence of any of these or supply or supply chain disruptions,
including the temporary inability to produce our wines due to the closure of our production sites, could prevent us from meeting consumer
demand in the near term or long term for our aged wines. For example, as result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our industry has experienced
temporary supply chain disruptions for certain processed materials, cardboard packaging, and glass, as well as increased strain on logistics
networks and shipping partners. The occurrence of any such disruptions during a peak time of demand for such processed materials could
increase the magnitude of the effect on our distribution network and sales. Failure to adequately prepare for and address any such disruptions
could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial results. 

A
catastrophic event causing physical damage, disruption or failure at our production facility could adversely affect our business. Although
our wines currently available for sale do not require substantial aging, we expect that certain of our wines, including the Reserve Cabernet
Sauvignon, require aging for some period of time. As a result, we expect to maintain inventory of aged and maturing wines in warehouses.
The loss of a substantial amount of aged inventory through fire, accident, earthquake, other natural or man-made disaster, contamination
or otherwise could significantly reduce the supply of the affected wine or wines, including our aged wines, which are typically the highest
priced and limited production wines. 

Any
disruptions that cause forced closure or evacuation could materially harm our business, results of operations and financial results.
Additionally, should multiple closings occur, we may lose guest confidence resulting in a reduction in direct sales, which could materially
and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial results. If we expand our future operations to include tasting
rooms, such closings would also negatively impact visitation. 

Inclement
weather, drought, pests, plant diseases and other factors could reduce the amount or quality of the grapes available to produce our wines,
which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial results. 

A
shortage in the supply of quality grapes may result from the occurrence of any number of factors that determine the quality and quantity
of grape supply, including adverse weather conditions (including heatwaves, frosts, drought and excessive rainfall), and various diseases,
pests, fungi and viruses. We cannot anticipate changes in weather patterns and conditions, and we cannot predict their impact on our
operations if they were to occur. Any shortage could cause an increase in the price of some or all of the grape varietals required for
our wine production or a reduction in the amount of wine we are able to produce, which could materially and adversely affect our business,
results of operations and financial results. 

Factors
that reduce the quantity of grapes the growers with which we contract grow may also reduce their quality. Deterioration in the quality
of our wines could harm our winery brand strength, and a decrease in our production could reduce our sales and increase our expenses,
both of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial results. 

18 

If
we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of premium juice from third-party juice suppliers, the quantity or quality of our annual production
of wine could be adversely affected, causing a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

The
production of our wines and the ability to fulfill the demand for our wines is restricted by the availability of premium grapes and juice
from third-party growers. If we are unable to source grapes and juice of the requisite quality, varietal and geography, among other factors,
our ability to produce wines to the standards, quantity and quality demanded by our customers could be impaired. 

Factors
including climate change, agricultural risks, competition for quality, water availability, land use, wildfires, floods, disease, and
pests could impact the quality and quantity of grapes and bulk juice available to our company. Furthermore, these potential disruptions
in production may drive up demand for grapes and bulk juice creating higher input costs or the inability to purchase these materials.
Following the 2020 wildfires in Northern California, the price of bulk juice increased substantially in a very short period of time,
leading to some wine producers reducing lot sizes of certain wines. As a result, our financial results could be materially and adversely
affected both in the year of the harvest and future periods. 

If
we are unable to identify and obtain adequate supplies of quality agricultural, raw and processed materials, including corks, glass bottles,
barrels, winemaking additives and agents, water and other supplies, or if there is an increase in the cost of the commodities or products,
our profitability, production and distribution capabilities could be negatively impacted, which would materially and adversely affect
our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

We
use grapes and other raw materials to produce and package our wine, including corks, barrels, winemaking additives, and water, as well
as large amounts of packaging materials, including metal, cork, glass and cardboard. We purchase raw materials and packaging materials
under contracts of varying maturities from domestic and international suppliers. 

Glass
bottle costs are one of our largest packaging components of cost of goods sold. In North America, glass bottles have only a small number
of producers. The inability of any of our glass bottle suppliers to satisfy our requirements could materially and adversely affect our
business. In addition, costs and programs related to mandatory recycling and recyclable materials deposits could be adopted in states
of manufacture, imposing additional and unknown costs to manufacture products utilizing glass bottles. The amount of water available
for use is important to the supply of our grapes and winemaking, other agricultural raw materials, and our ability to operate our business.
If climate patterns change and droughts become more severe, there may be a scarcity of water or poor water quality, which may affect
our production costs, consistency of yields or impose capacity constraints. We depend on sufficient amounts of quality water for operation
of our wineries, as well as to conduct our other operations. The suppliers of the grapes and other agricultural raw materials we purchase
also depend upon sufficient supplies of quality water for their vineyards and fields. Prolonged or severe drought conditions in the western
United States or restrictions imposed on irrigation options by governmental authorities could have an adverse effect on our operations
in the region. If water available to our operations or the operations of our suppliers becomes scarcer, restrictions are placed on our
usage of water or the quality of that water deteriorates, we may incur increased production costs or face manufacturing constraints which
could negatively affect our production. Even if quality water is widely available to us, water purification and waste treatment infrastructure
limitations could increase our costs or constrain operation of our production facilities. Any of these factors could materially and adversely
affect our business, results of operations and financial results. 

Our
production and shipping activities also use energy in their operations, including electricity, propane and natural gas. Energy costs
could rise in the future, which would result in higher transportation, freight and other operating costs, such as ageing and bottling
expenses. Our freight cost and the timely delivery of our wines could be adversely affected by a number of factors that could reduce
the profitability of our operations, including driver shortages, higher fuel costs, weather conditions, traffic congestion, increased
government regulation, and other matters. In addition, increased labor costs or insufficient labor supply could increase our production
costs. 

Our
supply and the price of raw materials, packaging materials and energy and the cost of energy, freight and labor used in our productions
and distribution activities could be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including market demand, global geopolitical
events (especially their impact on energy prices), economic factors affecting growth decisions, exchange rate fluctuations and inflation.
To the extent any of these factors, including supply of goods and energy, affect the prices of ingredients or packaging, or we do not
effectively or completely hedge changes in commodity price risks, or are unable to recoup costs through increases in the price of our
finished wines, our business, results of operations and financial results could be materially and adversely affected. 

19 

The
COVID-19 pandemic has affected our customers, our suppliers and our business operations, and the duration and extent to which this and
any future global health pandemics will impact our business, results of operations and financial results in future periods remains uncertain. 

The
COVID-19 pandemic is having widespread, rapidly evolving and unpredictable impacts on global society, economies, financial markets and
business practices. Federal, state and foreign governments have implemented measures to contain the virus, including social distancing,
travel restrictions, border closures, limitations on public gatherings, work from home requirements and closure of non-essential businesses.
While we continue to closely monitor the situation and may adjust our current policies as more information and public health guidance
become available, such precautionary measures, or any similar precautionary measures we are required or deem advisable to take in the
future could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial results. Our business may suffer should there be supply
disruption due to restrictions on the ability of employees or our suppliers to travel and work, or if government or public health officials
limit the travel of individuals impacting our ability to source materials. These events may impair our ability to make, bottle and ship
our wines, our distributors ability to distribute our wines or our ability to obtain the grapes needed to produce our wines. Our
operations may become less efficient or otherwise be negatively impacted if critical employees are unable to work or if a significant
percentage of the workforce is unable to work. 

In
addition to litigation that may arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business, we have been engaged in litigation with each
of our former Chief Operating Officer and former Chief Executive Officer. 

As
disclosed under Item 3 Legal Proceedings, the Company has been involved in litigation with two of its former executive officers,
Timothy Michaels and Janelle Anderson. 

Mr.
Michaels lawsuit alleges that the Company breached a Separation Agreement entered into with Mr. Michael following termination
of his employment by including a restricted lock-up legend on certain shares of common stock that the Company issued to
Mr. Michaels. The complaint also included counts alleging breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, issuer liability
under Minn. Stat. 336.8-401 for delay in removing or directing the Company s transfer agent to remove the lock-up legend
from the shares, conversion and civil theft. The Company has denied the allegations and intends to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.
The Company has made a motion seeking dismissal of the conversion and civil theft counts, which was granted by the Fourth Judicial District
Court, Hennepin County, Minnesota on October 31, 2022. 

Although
the Company has denied Mr. Michaels claims in his complaint, litigation and related actions may be expensive to defend, the outcome
of any litigation is difficult to predict and may result in damages, penalties or fines as well as reputational damage to the Company
and its wine brands, and the existence of litigation may impact the ability of management to focus on other business matters. Furthermore,
any adverse judgment may result in an increase in future insurance premiums, and any judgments for which the Company is not fully insured
may result in a significant financial loss and may materially and adversely affect the Company s business, results of operations
and financial results. 

The
complaint in Ms. Anderson s lawsuit alleged, among other things, that the Company terminated her employment as retaliation for
reports of alleged wrongdoing in violation of the Minnesota Whistleblower Act. Mr. Novak, Executive Chairman and a director of the Company,
and Mr Nechio, interim Chief Executive Officer and a director of the Company, were also named as defendants in Ms. Anderson s complaint.
On January 27, 2023, the Company entered into a Global Mutual Compromise, Release and Settlement Agreement (the Settlement Agreement among Ms. Anderson and each of Messrs. Novak and Nechio, pursuant to which Ms. Anderson has agreed to dismiss the lawsuit with prejudice. 

20 

As
consideration for Ms. Anderson s dismissal and release, and provided that she does not revoke or rescind the Settlement Agreement
within prescribed time periods, the Company agreed to make a cash payment to Ms. Anderson in the amount of 1,250,000, less certain attorney
fees and relevant taxes and other withholdings, in a lump sum. This cash payment is in addition to 400,000 that the Company previously
paid to Ms. Anderson in January 2023 in respect of 2022 bonus compensation earned by Ms. Anderson under her employment agreement while
employed by the Company. Also as contemplated by the Settlement Agreement, the Company and Ms. Anderson have agreed to enter into a consulting
agreement (the Anderson Consulting Agreement pursuant to which Ms. Anderson will provide certain consulting services to
the Company for a period of six months in exchange for the Company granting and issuing to Ms. Anderson 500,000 shares of the Company s
common stock (the Anderson Consulting Shares from the Company s 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the Anderson
Consulting Share Grant ). The cash payment and the Anderson Consulting Share Grant were scheduled to be made at the closing 
of the Settlement Agreement (the Settlement Closing ), subject to Ms. Anderson not revoking or rescinding the Settlement
Agreement during the applicable revocation period. The Settlement Closing was completed on February 20, 2023. The Anderson Consulting
Shares are unrestricted and freely tradable. If Ms. Anderson were to sell the Anderson Consulting Shares, such sales may adversely impact
the market price of our common stock, especially given the significant number of shares available for sale and the low volume of our
shares that trade. 

The
impact of U.S. and worldwide economic trends and financial market conditions could materially and adversely affect our business, liquidity,
financial condition and results of operations. 

We
are subject to risks associated with adverse economic conditions in the United States and globally, including economic slowdown, inflation,
and the disruption, volatility and tightening of credit and capital markets. Unfavorable global or regional economic conditions could
materially and adversely impact our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. In general, positive conditions
in the broader economy promote customer spending on wine, while economic weakness, which generally results in a reduction of customer
spending, may have a more pronounced negative effect on spending on wine. Unemployment, tax increases, governmental spending cuts or
a return of high levels of inflation could affect consumer spending patterns and purchases of our wines and other alcoholic beverage
products. Reduced consumer discretionary spending and reduced consumer confidence could negatively affect the trend towards consuming
premium wines and could result in a reduction of wine and beverage alcohol consumption in the United States generally. In particular,
extended periods of high unemployment, lower consumer discretionary spending and low consumer confidence could result in lower sales
of premium wine brands, including our wine, in favor of wine brands which have a lower average sales price and generally have lower gross
profit margins and lower overall sales, which could negatively impact our business and results of operations. These conditions could
also create or worsen credit issues, cash flow issues, access to credit facilities and other financial hardships for us and our suppliers,
distributors, accounts and consumers. An inability of our suppliers, distributors and retailers to access liquidity could impact our
ability to produce and distribute our wines. 

If
we are unable to secure and protect our intellectual property in domestic and foreign markets, including trademarks for our wine brands
and wines, the value of our wine brands and intellectual property could decline, which could have a material and adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial results. 

Our
future success depends significantly on our ability to protect our current and future wine brands and wines and to enforce and defend
our trademarks and other intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well
as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to secure and protect our intellectual property rights. We have been granted
three (3) trademark registrations in the United States for FRESH VINE , FRESH VINE (Stylized) , and our FV Logo , and numerous
trademark registrations in other countries for the FRESH VINE mark, and we have filed, and expect to continue to file, trademark applications
seeking to protect newly-developed wine brands. We have also been granted a copyright registration in the first version of our website
located at www.freshvine.com. While a copyright exists in a work of art once it is fixed in tangible medium, we intend to continue to
file copyright applications to protect newly-developed works of art that are important to our business. 

We
cannot be sure that any trademark office or copyright office will issue trademark registrations under any of our trademark applications,
or copyright registrations under any of our copyright applications. Third parties may oppose the registration of our trademark applications,
contest our trademark rights or copyrights, and petition to cancel our registered trademarks. We cannot assure you that we will be successful
in defending our trademarks or copyrights in actions brought by third parties. There is also a risk that we could fail to timely maintain
or renew our trademark registrations or otherwise protect our trademark rights or copyrights, which could result in the loss of those
trademark rights (including in connection with failure to maintain consistent use of these trademarks). If we fail to maintain our trademarks
or a third party successfully challenges our trademarks or copyrights, we could be forced to rebrand our wineries, wines, and other products,
which could result in a loss of winery brand recognition and could require us to devote additional resources to the development and marketing
of new wine brands. 

21 

Notwithstanding
any trademark registrations or copyright registrations held by us, a third party could bring a lawsuit or other claim alleging that we
have infringed that third party s trademark rights or copyrights. Any such claims, with or without merit, could require significant
resources to defend, could damage the reputation of our wine brands, could result in the payment of compensation (whether as a damages
award or settlement) to such third parties, and could require us to stop using our wine brands or otherwise agree to an undertaking to
limit that use. In addition, our actions to monitor and enforce trademark rights or copyrights against third parties may not prevent
counterfeit products or products bearing confusingly similar trademarks from entering the marketplace, which could divert sales from
us, tarnish our reputation or reduce the demand for our products or the prices at which we sell those products. Any enforcement litigation
brought by us, whether or not successful, could require significant costs and resources, and divert the attention of management, which
could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial results. Third parties may also acquire and register domain
names that are confusingly similar to or otherwise damaging to the reputation of our trademarks, and we may not be able to prevent or
cancel any such domain name registrations. 

In
addition to registered intellectual property rights such as trademark registrations and copyright registrations, we rely on non-registered
proprietary information, such as trade secrets, confidential information, and know-how, including in connection with the crafting of
our low calorie, low-carb, premium tasting wines. In order to protect our proprietary information, we rely in part on agreements with
our employees, independent contractors and other third parties that place restrictions on the use and disclosure of this intellectual
property. These agreements may be breached, or this intellectual property, including trade secrets, may otherwise be disclosed or become
known to our competitors, which could cause us to lose any competitive advantage resulting from this intellectual property. To the extent
that our employees, independent contractors or other third parties with whom we do business use intellectual property owned by others
in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. The loss of trade secret protection
could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products. In addition, any changes in, or unexpected interpretations of, intellectual
property laws may compromise our ability to enforce our trade secret and intellectual property rights. Costly and time-consuming litigation
could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain protection of our
trade secrets or other proprietary information could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and competitive position. 

We
may not be fully insured against catastrophic perils, including catastrophic loss or inaccessibility of wineries, production facilities
and/or distribution systems resulting from fire, wildfire, flood, wind events, earthquake and other perils, which may cause us to experience
a material financial loss. 

Although
we currently store the bulk of our wine inventory at our third-party warehouse in California, which is prone to seismic activity, wildfires
and floods, among other perils. If any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss in the future, it could disrupt our
operations, delay production, shipments and our recognition of revenue, and result in potentially significant expenses to repair or replace
the facility. If such a disruption were to occur, we could breach agreements, our reputation could be harmed and our business and operating
results could be materially and adversely affected. Although we carry insurance to cover property and inventory damage and business interruption,
these coverages are subject to deductibles and self-insurance obligations, as well as caps on coverage that could be below the value
of losses we could incur in certain catastrophic perils. Furthermore, claims for recovery against our insurance policies can be time-consuming,
and may result in significant delays between when we incur damages and when we receive payment under our insurance policies. If one or
more significant catastrophic events occurred damaging our own or third-party assets and/or services, we could suffer a major financial
loss and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. 

Furthermore,
increased incidence or severity of natural disasters has adversely impacted our ability to obtain adequate property damage, inventory,
and business interruption insurance at financially viable rates, if at all. For example, we have observed certain insurers ceasing to
offer certain inventory protection policies, and we have supplemented our insurance coverage recently by purchasing policies at higher
premiums. If these trends continue and our insurance coverage is adversely affected, and to the extent we elect to increase our self-insurance
obligations, we may be at greater risk that similar future events will cause significant financial losses and materially and adversely
affect our business, results of operations and financial results. 

22 

From
time to time, we may become subject to litigation specifically directed at the alcoholic beverage industry, as well as litigation arising
in the ordinary course of business. 

Companies
operating in the alcoholic beverage industry may, from time to time, be exposed to class action or other private or governmental litigation
and claims relating to product liability, alcohol marketing, advertising or distribution practices, alcohol abuse problems or other health
consequences arising from the excessive consumption of or other misuse of alcohol, including underage drinking. Various groups have,
from time to time, publicly expressed concern over problems related to harmful use of alcohol, including drinking, and driving, underage
drinking and health consequences from the misuse of alcohol. These campaigns could result in an increased risk of litigation against
the Company and our industry. Lawsuits have been brought against beverage alcohol companies alleging problems related to alcohol abuse,
negative health consequences from drinking, problems from alleged marketing or sales practices and underage drinking. While these lawsuits
have been largely unsuccessful in the past, others may succeed in the future. 

From
time to time, we may also be party to other litigation in the ordinary course of our operations, including in connection with commercial
disputes, enforcement or other regulatory actions by tax, customs, competition, environmental, anti-corruption and other relevant regulatory
authorities, or, securities-related class action lawsuits, particularly following any significant decline in the price of our securities.
Any such litigation or other actions may be expensive to defend and result in damages, penalties, or fines as well as reputational damage
to our company and our winery brands and may impact the ability of management to focus on other business matters. Furthermore, any adverse
judgments may result in an increase in future insurance premiums, and any judgments for which we are not fully insured may result in
a significant financial loss and may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial results. 

A failure
of one or more of our key IT systems, networks, processes, associated sites or service providers could have a material adverse impact
on business operations, and if the failure is prolonged, our financial condition. 

We
rely on IT systems, networks, and services, including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools, hardware (including
laptops and mobile devices), software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted, provided, and used
by third parties or their vendors, to assist us in the management of our business. The various uses of these IT systems, networks and
services include, but are not limited to: hosting our internal network and communication systems; supply and demand planning; production;
shipping wines to customers; hosting our winery websites and marketing products to consumers; collecting and storing customer, consumer,
employee, stockholder, and other data; processing transactions; summarizing and reporting results of operations; hosting, processing
and sharing confidential and proprietary research, business plans and financial information; complying with regulatory, legal or tax
requirements; providing data security; and handling other processes necessary to manage our business. 

Increased
IT security threats and more sophisticated cybercrimes and cyberattacks, including computer viruses and other malicious codes, ransomware,
unauthorized access attempts, denial of service attacks, phishing, social engineering, hacking and other types of attacks pose a potential
risk to the security of our IT systems, networks and services, as well as the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data,
and we have in the past, and may in the future, experience cyberattacks and other unauthorized access attempts to our IT systems. Because
the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access are constantly changing and often are not recognized until launched against a target,
we or our vendors may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement sufficient preventative or remedial measures. If we are unable
to efficiently and effectively maintain and upgrade our system safeguards, we may incur unexpected costs and certain of our systems may
become more vulnerable to unauthorized access. In the event of a ransomware or other cyber-attack, the integrity and safety of our data
could be at risk, or we may incur unforeseen costs impacting our financial position. If the IT systems, networks or service providers
we rely upon fail to function properly, or if we suffer a loss or disclosure of business or other sensitive information due to any number
of causes ranging from catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches, unauthorized use or usage errors by employees, vendors
or other third parties and other security issues, we may be subject to legal claims and proceedings, liability under laws that protect
the privacy and security of personal information (also known as personal data), litigation, governmental investigations and proceedings
and regulatory penalties, and we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage our operations and reputational, competitive or business
harm, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial results. In addition, such events could result in
unauthorized disclosure of material confidential information, and we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or
misappropriated confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, stockholders, customers, suppliers, consumers or others.
In any of these events, we could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a
security breach or technological failure and the reputational damage resulting therefrom, to pay for investigations, forensic analyses,
legal advice, public relations advice or other services, or to repair or replace networks and IT systems. As a result of the COVID-19
pandemic, a greater number of our employees are working remotely and accessing our IT systems and networks remotely, which may further
increase our vulnerability to cybercrimes and cyberattacks and increase the stress on our technology infrastructure and systems. Even
though we maintain cyber risk insurance, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses from any future breaches or
failures of our IT systems, networks and services. 

23 

Our
failure to adequately maintain and protect personal information of our customers or our employees in compliance with evolving legal requirements
could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

We
collect, use, store, disclose or transfer (collectively, process personal information, including from employees and customers,
in connection with the operation of our business. A wide variety of local and international laws as well as regulations and industry
guidelines apply to the privacy and collecting, storing, use, processing, disclosure, and protection of personal information and may
be inconsistent among countries or conflict with other rules. Data protection and privacy laws and regulations are changing, subject
to differing interpretations and being tested in courts and may result in increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels
of enforcement and sanctions. 

A
variety of data protection legislation apply in the United States at both the federal and state level, including new laws that may impact
our operations. For example, the State of California has enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 CCPA ), which
generally requires companies that collect, use, share and otherwise process personal information (which is broadly defined)
of California residents to make disclosures about their data collection, use, and sharing practices, allows consumers to opt-out of certain
data sharing with third parties or the sale of personal information, allows consumers to exercise certain rights with respect to any
personal information collected and provides a new cause of action for data breaches. In addition, a new privacy law, the California Privacy
Rights Act CPRA ), which significantly modifies the CCPA, was recently approved by ballot initiative during the November
3, 2021 general election. On January 1, 2023 the CCPA became effective and added additional privacy protection. This may require us to
incur additional expenditures to ensure compliance. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission, and many state attorneys general are
interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination, and security
of data. The burdens imposed by the CCPA and other similar laws that have been or may be enacted at the federal and state level may require
us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur additional expenditures in order to comply. 

Foreign
laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, information security and consumer protection often are more restrictive than
those in the United States. The European Union, for example, traditionally has imposed stricter obligations under its laws and regulations
relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection than the United States. In May 2018 the European Union s new regulation
governing data practices and privacy called the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, became effective and substantially replaced
the data protection laws of the individual European Union member states. The law requires companies to meet more stringent requirements
regarding the handling of personal data of individuals in the EU than were required under predecessor EU requirements. In the United
Kingdom, a Data Protection Bill that substantially implements the GDPR also became law in May 2018. The GDPR and other similar regulations
require companies to give specific types of notice and in some cases seek consent from consumers and other data subjects before collecting
or using their data for certain purposes, including some marketing activities. Outside of the European Union, many countries have laws,
regulations, or other requirements relating to privacy, data protection, information security, and consumer protection, and new countries
are adopting such legislation or other obligations with increasing frequency. Many of these laws may require consent from consumers for
the use of data for various purposes, including marketing, which may reduce our ability to market our products. There is no harmonized
approach to these laws and regulations globally. Consequently, we would increase our risk of non-compliance with applicable foreign data
protection laws by expanding internationally. We may need to change and limit the way we use personal information in operating our business
and may have difficulty maintaining a single operating model that is compliant. In addition, various federal, state and foreign legislative
and regulatory bodies, or self-regulatory organizations, may expand current laws or regulations, enact new laws or regulations or issue
revised rules or guidance regarding privacy, data protection, information security and consumer protection. 

Compliance
with these and any other applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations is a rigorous and time-intensive process, and we
may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new privacy and data protection laws and regulations.
Our actual or alleged failure to comply with any applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations, industry standards or contractual
obligations, or to protect such information and data that we process, could result in litigation, regulatory investigations, and enforcement
actions against us, including fines, orders, public censure, claims for damages by employees, customers and other affected individuals,
public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups, damage to our reputation and competitive position and loss of goodwill (both
in relation to existing customers and prospective customers) any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Additionally, if third parties that we work with, such as vendors or developers, violate
applicable laws or our policies, such violations may also place personal information at risk and have an adverse effect on our business.
Even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation, subject us to regulatory scrutiny and investigations,
and inhibit adoption of our wines by existing and potential customers. 

24 

Risks
related to regulation. 

As
a producer of alcoholic beverages, we are regularly the subject of regulatory reviews, proceedings and audits by governmental entities,
any of which could result in an adverse ruling or conclusion, and which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and future prospects. 

We
are subject to extensive regulation in the United States by federal, state, and local laws regulating the production, distribution and
sale of consumable food items, and specifically alcoholic beverages, including by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (the TTB and the Food and Drug Administration (the FDA ). These and other regulatory agencies impose a number of product safety,
labelling and other requirements on our operations and sales. In California, where all of our wines are made, we are subject to alcohol-related
licensing and regulations by many authorities, including the Department of Alcohol Beverage Control (the ABC ), which investigates
applications for licenses to sell alcoholic beverages, reports on the moral character and fitness of alcohol license applicants and the
suitability of premises where sales are to be conducted. We are also subject to regulatory compliance requirements in all states in which
we sell our wines. Any governmental litigation, fines, or restrictions on our operations resulting from the enforcement of these existing
regulations or any new legislation or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
results. Any government intervention challenging the production, marketing, promotion, distribution or sale of beverage alcohol or specific
brands could affect our ability to sell our wines. Because litigation and other legal proceedings can be costly to defend, even actions
that are ultimately decided in our favor could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations or financial results. Adverse
developments in major lawsuits concerning these or other matters could result in management distraction and have a material adverse effect
on our business. Changes to the interpretation or approach to enforcement of regulations may require changes to our business practices
or the business practices of our suppliers, distributors, or customers. The penalties associated with any violations or infractions may
vary in severity, and could result in a significant impediment to our business operations, and could cause us to have to suspend sales
of our wines in a jurisdiction for a period of time. 

New
and changing environmental requirements, and new market pressures related to climate change, could materially and adversely affect our
business, results of operations and financial results. 

There
has been significant public discussion related to concerns that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have an adverse
impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. Federal regulations
govern, among other things, air emissions, wastewater and stormwater discharges, and the treatment, handling and storage and disposal
of materials and wastes. State environmental regulations and authorities intended to address and oversee environmental issues are largely
state-level analogues to federal regulations and authorities intended to perform the similar purposes. We are subject to local environmental
regulations that address a number of elements of our wine production process, including air quality, the handing of hazardous waste,
recycling, water use and discharge, emissions and traffic impacts. Compliance with these and other environmental regulation requires
significant resources. Continued regulatory and market trends towards sustainability may require or incentivize us to make changes to
our current business operations. We may experience future increases in the costs associated with environmental regulatory compliance,
including fees, licenses and the cost of capital improvements to meet environmental regulatory requirements. Although we don t
cultivate our own grapes, increased costs associated with environmental regulatory compliance may impact grape growers, which may increase
out costs to purchase bulk juice. 

Changes
in foreign and domestic laws and government regulations to which we are currently subject, including changes to the method or approach
of enforcement of these government rules and regulations, may increase our costs or limit our ability to sell our wines into certain
markets, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

Government
laws and regulations may result in increased production and sales costs, including an increase on the applicable tax in various state,
federal and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. The amount of wine that we can sell directly to consumers outside of California
is regulated, and in certain states we are not allowed to sell wines directly to consumers at all. Changes in these laws and regulations
that tighten current rules could have an adverse impact on sales or increase costs to produce, market, package or sell wine. Changes
in regulation that require significant additional source data for registration and sale, in the labelling or warning requirements, or
limitations on the permissibility of any component, condition or ingredient, in the places in which our wines can be legally sold could
inhibit sales of affected products in those markets. 

25 

The
wine industry is subject to extensive regulation by a number of foreign and domestic agencies, state liquor authorities and local authorities.
These regulations and laws dictate such matters as licensing requirements, land use, production methods, trade and pricing practices,
permitted distribution channels, permitted and required labelling, advertising, sequestration of classes of wine and relations with wholesalers
and retailers. Any expansion of our existing facilities may be limited by present and future zoning ordinances, use permit terms, environmental
restrictions and other legal requirements. In addition, new or updated regulations, requirements or licenses, particularly changes that
impact our ability to sell DTC and/or retain accounts in California, or new or increased excise taxes, income taxes, property and sales
taxes or international tariffs, could affect our financial condition or results of operations. From time to time, states consider proposals
to increase state alcohol excise taxes. New or revised regulations or increased licensing fees, requirements or taxes could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Risks
related to our common stock 

Our
current executive management has limited direct experience in satisfying public company reporting requirements and we must implement
additional finance and accounting systems, procedures, and controls in order to satisfy such requirements, which will increase our costs
and divert management s time and attention. 

As
a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, including
costs associated with our public company reporting requirements and corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as new rules implemented by the SEC and the NYSE American. Our current executive management has little
to no experience in complying with such requirements and rules. 

As
an example of reporting requirements, we are evaluating our internal control systems in order to allow management to report on our internal
control over financing reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. As a company with limited capital and
human resources, we anticipate that more of management s time and attention will be diverted from our business to ensure compliance
with these regulatory requirements than would be the case with a company that has established controls and procedures. This diversion
of management s time and attention may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We
are eligible to be treated as an emerging growth company, and we cannot be certain that the reduced disclosure requirements applicable
to emerging growth companies will not make our shares less attractive to investors. 

We
are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take
advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth
companies, including, among others, (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (2) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements,
(3) exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any
golden parachute payments not previously approved and (4) the requirement to present only two years of audited financial statements and
only two years of related Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in
this report. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier,
including if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds 700.0 million as of the end of the second fiscal quarter
in any fiscal year before that time or if we have total annual gross revenues of 1.07 billion or more during any fiscal year before
that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the fiscal year end, or if we issue more than 1.0 billion
in non-convertible debt during any three-year period before that time we would cease to be an emerging growth company immediately. We
cannot predict if investors will find our shares of common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors
find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our share price
may be more volatile. 

Under
the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards
apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards
that have different effective dates for public and private companies and intend to continue such election until the earlier of the date
we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided
in the JOBS Act. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of other public companies that comply with such new
or revised accounting standards. 

26 

As
a result of being a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting
and any failure to maintain the adequacy of these internal controls may negatively impact investor confidence in our company and, as
a result, the value of our common stock. 

We
are required pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified
by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm will
be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our first annual report required to be
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC following the date we are no longer an emerging growth company.
Any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our
financial condition or results of operations. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective,
or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial
reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common
stock could decline, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the NYSE American, the SEC or other regulatory authorities
and our access to the capital markets could be restricted. 

In this report, our management concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2022 due
to the existence of material weaknesses, including those related to the lack of segregation of duties, accounting for inventory deposits,
accounting for insurance recoveries, and accounting for executive bonus compensation. See Item 9A Controls and Procedures. Although
we intend to engage in activities aimed at remediating these material weaknesses, our remediation activities may not be successful, and
our management may continue to conclude that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting
are not effective in future periods. 

Provisions
of our corporate governance documents could make an acquisition of our Company more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders
to replace or remove our current management, even if beneficial to our stockholders. 

Our
articles of incorporation and bylaws and the Nevada Revised Statutes contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third
party to acquire us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders. These provisions include: 

advance
 notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations; 

the
 ability of our board of directors to issue new series of, and designate the terms of, preferred
 stock, without stockholder approval, which could be used to, among other things, institute
 a rights plan that would have the effect of significantly diluting the stock ownership of
 a potential hostile acquirer, likely preventing acquisitions that have not been approved
 by our board of directors; and 

limitations
 on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings and to take action by written consent. 

Because
our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt
to replace current members of our management team. As a result, you may lose your ability to sell your stock for a price in excess of
the prevailing market price due to these protective measures, and efforts by stockholders to change the direction or management of the
Company may be unsuccessful. 

Your
percentage ownership in us may be diluted by future issuances of capital stock, which could reduce your influence over matters on which
stockholders vote. 

Pursuant
to our articles of incorporation and bylaws, our board of directors has the authority, without action or vote of our stockholders, to
issue all or any part of our authorized but unissued shares of common stock, including shares issuable upon the exercise of options,
or shares of our authorized but unissued preferred stock. Issuances of common stock or voting preferred stock would reduce your influence
over matters on which our stockholders vote and, in the case of issuances of preferred stock, would likely result in your interest in
us being subject to the prior rights of holders of that preferred stock. 

27 

An
active, liquid trading market for our common stock may not develop, which may limit your ability to sell your shares. 

Prior
to our December 2021 initial public offering, there was no public market for our common stock. Although we list shares of our common
stock on the NYSE American under the symbol VINE, an active trading market for our shares may not develop or be sustained
going forward. A public trading market having the desirable characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends upon the existence
of willing buyers and sellers at any given time, such existence being dependent upon the individual decisions of buyers and sellers over
which neither we nor any market maker has control. The failure of an active and liquid trading market to develop and continue would likely
have a material adverse effect on the value of our common stock. The market price of our common stock may decline, and you may not be
able to sell your shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid for them, or at all. An inactive market may also impair our
ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies
by using our shares as consideration. 

Sales
of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly,
even if our business is performing well. 

Sales
of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in
the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. 

As
a public company, we are subject to additional laws, regulations and stock exchange listing standards, which will result in additional
costs to us and may strain our resources and divert our management s attention. 

Prior
to our December 2021 initial public offering, we operated on a private basis. As a public reporting company, we are now subject to the
reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the listing requirements of the NYSE American and other applicable
securities laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and
make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly. We also expect that being a public company and being subject to new rules
and regulations will make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept
reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. However, the incremental costs that we incur as a result of
becoming a public company could exceed our estimate. These factors may therefore strain our resources, divert management s attention
and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors. 

Since
we have no current plans to pay regular cash dividends on our common stock, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell
your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it. 

We
do not anticipate paying any regular cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends
in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations,
financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. In
addition, our ability to pay dividends is, and may be, limited by covenants of existing and any future outstanding indebtedness we incur.
Therefore, any return on investment in our common stock is solely dependent upon the appreciation of the price of our common stock on
the open market, which may not occur. See Item 5. Market For Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities - Dividends for more detail. 

28 

If
securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they adversely change their recommendations
regarding our shares or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our share price and trading volume could decline. 

The
trading market for our shares will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or
our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. Securities and industry analysts do not currently, and may never, publish
research on our Company. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of our Company, the trading price of our shares would
likely be negatively impacted. In the event securities or industry analysts-initiated coverage, and one or more of these analysts cease
coverage of our Company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn
could cause our share price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock,
or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our share price could decline. 

General
risks 

Our
operating results and share price may be volatile, and the market price of our common stock may drop below the price you pay. 

Our
year-end and quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate in the future as a publicly traded company. In addition, securities
markets worldwide have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, significant price and volume fluctuations. This market
volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, could subject the market price of our shares to wide price fluctuations
regardless of our operating performance. You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price that you paid or pay for them
or at all. Our operating results and the trading price of our shares may fluctuate in response to various factors, including: 

market
 conditions in the broader stock market; 

actual
 or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results; 

introduction
 of new wines by us or our competitors; 

issuance
 of new or changed securities analysts reports or recommendations; 

results
 of operations that vary from expectations of securities analysis and investors; 

guidance,
 if any, that we provide to the public, any changes in this guidance or our failure to meet
 this guidance; 

strategic
 actions by us or our competitors; 

announcement
 by us, our competitors or our vendors of significant contracts or acquisitions; 

sales,
 or anticipated sales, of large blocks of our stock; 

additions
 or departures of key personnel; 

regulatory,
 legal, or political developments; 

public
 response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including
 our filings with the SEC; 

litigation
 and governmental investigations; 

changing
 economic conditions; 

changes
 in accounting principles; 

default
 under agreements governing our indebtedness; 

exchange
 rate fluctuations; and 

other
 events or factors, including those from natural disasters, war, actors of terrorism or responses
 to these events. 

29 

These
and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, may cause our operating results and the market price and demand for our shares
to fluctuate substantially. While we believe that operating results for any particular year or quarter are not necessarily a meaningful
indication of future results, fluctuations in our yearly or quarterly operating results could limit or prevent investors from readily
selling their shares and may otherwise negatively affect the market price and liquidity of our shares. In addition, in the past, when
the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against
the company that issued the stock. If any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending
the lawsuit. Such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management from our business, which could significantly harm
our profitability and reputation. 

We
may require additional debt and equity capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges, or
unforeseen circumstances. If such capital is not available to us, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be
materially and adversely affected. 

We
may require additional capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges, or unforeseen circumstances,
including to increase our marketing expenditures to improve our wine brand awareness, build and maintain our product inventory, develop
new wines, enhance our operating infrastructure and acquire complementary businesses. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or
debt financings to secure additional funds. However, additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable
to us or at all. Moreover, any debt financing that we secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants, which may make it more
difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. Volatility in the credit markets may also have an
adverse effect on our ability to obtain debt financing. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible
debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights,
preferences, and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing
on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, we may be forced to obtain financing on undesirable terms or our ability to continue
to pursue our business objectives and to respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances could be significantly
limited, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Through
October 31, 2022, our principal executive offices located at 505 Highway 169 North, Suite 255, Plymouth, Minnesota 55441 were leased
by Rabbit Hole Equity, L.L.C., a Texas limited liability company that serves as a family office that manages a portfolio of business
investments held by our former Executive Chairman, Damian Novak and his affiliates Rabbit Hole Equity ). Pursuant to an
unwritten month-to-month arrangement, a portion of Rabbit Hole Equity s lease payments were allocated to the Company. Effective
November 1, 2022, we terminated this lease arrangement and currently maintain a virtual administrative office environment. The address,
for mailing purposes, of our principle executive offices is 11500 Wayzata Blvd #1147, Minnetonka, Minnesota 55305. 

Our
production facility, which we occupy on an alternating proprietorship basis, is located in Napa, California. The initial term of the
Alternating Proprietorship Agreement with our host winery expired in July 2022, but is automatically renewed for successive
one-year terms unless either party provides 90 days advance written notice of intent to terminate the agreement at the end of
the then current term. The current renewal term will expire in July 2023, subject to the automatic renewal. 

We
utilize a warehouse facility in American Canyon, California, for which we pay a storage fee per pallet and entry and exit processing
fees. 

We
expect that the current properties will be adequate for our current office and production needs. 

During

Timothy
Michaels Lawsuit 

On
February 24, 2022, Timothy Michaels, the former Chief Operating Officer of the Company, signed a Separation Agreement and Release
(the Separation Agreement in connection with the termination of his employment with the Company, which occurred on February 7,
2022. 

On
May 27, 2022, Mr. Michaels filed a complaint against the Company in the Fourth Judicial District Court, Hennepin County, Minnesota,
alleging that the Company breached a February 24, 2022 Separation Agreement entered into with Mr. Michael following termination
of his employment by including a restricted lock-up legend on certain shares of the Company s common stock issued
to Mr. Michaels pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. The complaint also included counts alleging breach of the implied covenant
of good faith and fair dealing, issuer liability under Minn. Stat. 336.8-401 for delay in removing or directing the Company s
transfer agent to remove the lock-up legend from the shares, conversion and civil theft. The Company has denied the allegations
and intends to defend against the lawsuit. The Company has made a motion seeking dismissal of the conversion and civil theft counts,
which was granted by the Fourth Judicial District Court, Hennepin County, Minnesota on October 31, 2022. The action remains pending. 

Janelle
Anderson Lawsuit and Settlement 

On
or about July 18, 2022, Janelle Anderson, the former Chief Executive Officer of the Company, served a complaint against the Company
in the Fourth Judicial District Court, Hennepin County, Minnesota, captioned Janelle Anderson v. Fresh Vine Wine, Inc., Damian Novak,
and Rick Nechio, Court File No. 27-CV-22-11491 (the Lawsuit ), in which Ms. Anderson alleged, among other things, that the
Company terminated her employment as retaliation for reports of alleged wrongdoing in violation of the Minnesota Whistleblower Act. Defendants
also included Damian Novak, former Executive Chairman and a former director of the Company, and Rick Nechio, our interim Chief Executive
Officer. 

On
January 27, 2023, the Company entered into a Global Mutual Compromise, Release and Settlement Agreement (the Settlement Agreement among Ms. Anderson and each of Messrs. Novak and Nechio. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, Ms. Anderson agreed to dismiss the Lawsuit
with prejudice and to file with the court any and all documents necessary to effect such dismissal with prejudice within five business
days after all settlement consideration has been actually received by her, and the parties agreed to general mutual releases. The Company
also agreed to indemnify Ms. Anderson and hold her harmless against any liability, civil damages, penalties, or fines claimed against
her for any of her actions done within the course and scope of her employment with the Company as required by Minn. Stat. 181.970,
and under any applicable insurance policies, including but not limited to any directors and officers policies. The Settlement Agreement
also contains a non-disparagement provision. 

As
consideration for Ms. Anderson s dismissal and release, the Company agreed to make a cash payment to Ms. Anderson in the amount
of 1,250,000, less certain attorney fees and relevant taxes and other withholdings, in a lump sum. The Company recouped approximately
 805,000 of this of cash payment from insurance coverage. The cash payment is in addition to 400,000 that we previously paid to Ms.
Anderson in January 2023 in respect of 2022 bonus compensation earned by Ms. Anderson under her employment agreement while employed by
the Company. Also as contemplated by the Settlement Agreement, the Company and Ms. Anderson have agreed to enter into a consulting agreement
(the Anderson Consulting Agreement pursuant to which Ms. Anderson provides certain consulting services to the Company
for a period of six months. As consideration for such services, the Company has agreed to grant and issue to Ms. Anderson 500,000 shares
of the Company s common stock (the Anderson Consulting Shares from the Company s 2021 Equity Incentive Plan
(the Anderson Consulting Share Grant ). The cash payment and the Anderson Consulting Share Grant were scheduled to be made
at the closing of the Settlement Agreement (the Settlement Closing ), subject to Ms. Anderson not revoking
or rescinding the Settlement Agreement during the applicable revocation period. The Settlement Closing was completed on February 20,
2023. 

In
conjunction with entering into the Settlement Agreement, Rick Nechio and Damian Novak entered into Agreements to Forfeit Shares of Common
Stock (the Forfeiture Agreements pursuant to which each agreed to forfeit and transfer back to the Company without consideration
250,000 shares of common stock of the Company held by them (a total of 500,000 shares), to enable the Company to issue the
Anderson Consulting Shares to Ms. Anderson without subjecting the Company s other stockholders to dilution therefrom (the Anderson
Consulting-related Forfeitures ). The Anderson Consulting-related Forfeitures became effective in connection with the
Settlement Closing.

7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and related notes to those statements as included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical
financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and
assumptions. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-looking Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors,
including those discussed in Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Overview 

Fresh
Vine Wine, Inc. is a premier producer of low carb, low calorie, premium wines in the United States. Founded in 2019, Fresh Vine
Wine brings an innovative better-for-you solution to the wine market. We currently sell seven varietals: Cabernet Sauvignon,
Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros , Sparkling Ros , and a limited Reserve Napa Cabernet Sauvignon. All varietals
are produced and bottled in Napa, California. 

Our
wines are distributed across the United States and Puerto Rico through wholesale, retail, and direct-to-consumer (DTC) channels. We are
able to conduct wholesale distribution of our wines in all 50 states and Puerto Rico, and we are licensed to sell through DTC channels
in 43 states. As of December 31, 2022, we hold active relationships with wholesale distributors in 48 states, unchanged from September
2022, and currently have additional states in which licensing is pending. We are actively working with leading distributors, including
Southern Glazer s Wine Spirits (SGWS), Johnson Brothers, and Republic National Distributing Company (RNDC), to expand our
presence across the contiguous United States. 

Our
core wine offerings are priced strategically to appeal to mass markets and sell at a list price between 15 and 25 per bottle. Given
the Fresh Vine Wine brand s celebrity backing, better-for-you appeal, and overall product quality, we believe that
it presents today s consumers with a unique value proposition within this price category. Additionally, Fresh Vine Wine is one
of very few products available at this price point that includes a named winemaker, Jamey Whetstone. 

33 

Our
marketing activities focus primarily on consumers in the 21-to-34-year-old demographic with moderate to affluent income and on those
with a desire to pursue a healthy and active lifestyles. 

Our
asset-light operating model allows us to utilize third-party assets, including land and production facilities. This approach helps us
mitigate many of the risks associated with agribusiness, such as isolated droughts or fires. Because we source product inputs from multiple
geographically dispersed vendors, we reduce reliance on any one vendor and benefit from broad availability/optionality of product inputs.
This is particularly important as a California-based wine producer where droughts or fires can have an extremely detrimental impact to
a company s supply chain if not diversified. 

Key
Financial Metrics 

We
use net revenue, gross profit (loss), net income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the performance of Fresh Vine Wine. These metrics
are useful in helping us to identify trends in our business, prepare financial forecasts and make capital allocation decisions, and assess
the comparable health of our business relative to our direct competitors.

Net revenue 

Net
revenue represents all revenues less discounts, promotions, and excise taxes. Net revenue is driven through wine sales, merchandise sales,
and wine club membership dues. 

Gross
profit (loss) 

Gross
profit (loss) is equal to our net revenue less cost of revenues (or cost of goods sold). Cost of revenues is comprised of all direct
product costs such as juice, bottles, caps, corks, labels, and capsules. Additionally, we also categorize boxes and quality assurance
testing within our cost of revenues. 

Adjusted
EBITDA 

Adjusted
EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as operating profits before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and
stock-based compensation. We use this metric to evaluate business performance in comparison to budgets, forecasts, and prior year financial
results, providing a measure that management believes reflects the Company s core operating performance and overall health. 

We
believe the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to assess the Company s
operating performance and makes it easier to compare our results with other similar companies, despite the potential impacts of varying
financial or capital structures, depreciation benefits, or tax strategies. In addition, we believe this measure is among the measures
used by investors, analysts and peers in our industry for purposes of evaluating and comparing our operating performance to other companies.
Stock-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense arising from the grant of stock-based awards to employees or other service providers.
We believe that excluding the effect of stock-based compensation from Adjusted EBITDA assists management and investors in making period-to-period
comparisons in our company s operating performance because (i) the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly
correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations and (ii) such expenses can vary significantly between periods as a
result of the timing of grants of new stock-based awards. Investors should note that stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered

Components
of Results of Operations and Trends That May Impact Our Results of Operations 

Net
Revenue 

Our
net revenue consists primarily of wine sales to distributors and retailers, which together comprise our wholesale channel, and directly
to individual consumers through our DTC channel. Net revenues generally represent wine sales and shipping, when applicable, and to a
lesser extent branded merchandise and wine club memberships. For wine and merchandise sales, revenues are generally recognized at time
of shipment. For Wine Club memberships, revenues are recognized quarterly at the time of fulfilment and only after the club member has
made three consecutive (monthly) payments. 

We
refer to the volume of wine we sell in terms of cases. Each case contains 12 standard bottles, in which each bottle has a volume of 750
millilitres. Cases are sold through Wholesale/Retail or DTC channels. 

The
following factors and trends in our business have driven net revenue growth since January 1, 2022, and are expected to be key drivers
of our net revenue for the foreseeable future: 

Brand
recognition: As we expand our marketing presence and drive visibility through traditional and modern marketing methods,
we expect to build awareness and name recognition for Fresh Vine Wine in consumers minds. Brand awareness will be built substantially
through social media channels, where we are able to immediately access more than 30 million potential consumers through our celebrities 
Instagram and Facebook platforms. 

Portfolio
evolution: As a relatively new, high-growth brand, we expect and seek to learn from our consumers. We will continuously evolve
and refine our products to meet our consumers specific needs and wants, adapting our offering to maximize value for our consumers
and stakeholders. Our growth mindset, coupled with our differentiated production and distribution platform, will enable us to accelerate
growth and deliver on our value proposition over time. 

One
way in which we will evolve our portfolio is through product extensions. Fresh Vine Wine added a sixth varietal, Sauvignon Blanc, late
in the second quarter of 2022 and seventh varietal, Sparkling Ros , in the third quarter of 2022, currently offering seven varietals
(Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve, Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros , and Sparkling Ros within
its product portfolio. In the future, we can use the same knowledge and supplier networks to launch new varietals with much greater efficiency
than we were previously able to achieve. 

35 

Distribution
expansion and acceleration: Purchasing by distributors and loyal accounts that continue to feature our
wines are key drivers of net revenue. We plan to continue broadening our distributor network, adding new geographies, and increasing
each distributor s average order size as we accelerate growth. 

Opportunistic
evaluation of strategic acquisitions: With strong internal knowledge and a depth of experience in private
equity and the broader financial services industry, we intend to maintain a strategic and opportunistic approach to evaluating acquisitions
and growing through acquisition. We will also remain open to other inorganic growth activities, including joint ventures and strategic
alliances, as we seek to accelerate this business to market. While we have not identified any prospective targets to date, we consider
this a core competency of our leadership team and believe that this presents us with a viable growth alternative as we move forward. 

Seasonality:
 In line with industry norms, we anticipate our net revenue to peak during the quarter spanning from October through December
due to increased consumer demand around the major holidays. This is particularly true in our DTC revenue channel, where marketing programs
will often be aligned with the holiday season and product promotions will be prevalent. 

Revenue
Channels 

Our
sales and distribution platform is built upon a highly developed network of distributor accounts. Within this network, we have signed
agreements in place with several of the nation s largest distributors including Southern Glazer s Wine Spirits and
RNDC, among others. While we are actively working with these distributors in certain markets, they operate across the United States and
we intend to grow our geographic/market presence through these relationships. The development of these relationships and impacts on our
related product mix will impact our financial results as our channel mix shifts. 

Wholesale
 channel : Consistent with sales practices in the wine industry, sales to retailers and
 distributors occur below SRP (Suggested Retail Price). We work closely with distributors
 to increase wine volumes and the number of products sold by their retail accounts in their
 respective territories. 

DTC
 channel : Wines sold through our DTC channels are generally sold at SRP, although we do
 periodically offer various promotions. Our DTC channel continues to grow as a result of a
 number of factors, including expanded e-commerce sites and social media capabilities. 

Related
 party services : We have entered into service agreements with related parties in the wine
 industry to provide representation and distribution services. These services were suspended
 in June 2022 to allow the Company s lean team to prioritize the growth and expansion
 of the Fresh Vine Wine brand. 

Wholesale
channel sales made on credit terms generally require payment within 30 days of delivery; however, our credit terms with Southern Glazer s
Wine Spirits requires payment within 60 days of delivery. During periods in which our net revenue channel mix reflects a greater
concentration of wholesale sales, we typically experience an increase in accounts receivable for the period to reflect the change in
sales mix; payment collections in the subsequent period generally reduce our accounts receivable balance and have a positive impact on
cash flows. 

While
we seek to increase revenue across all channels, we expect the majority of our future revenue to be 

driven through
the wholesale channel. We intend to maintain and expand relationships with existing distributors and form relationships with new distributors
as we work to grow the Company. With multiple varietals within the Fresh Vine Wine portfolio, we consider ourselves to be a one-stop
shop for better-for-you wines. We continue to innovate with new products at competitive price points and strive to enhance the
experience as we increase revenue with new and existing consumers. 

In
the DTC channel, our comprehensive approach to consumer engagement in both online and traditional forums is supported by an integrated
e-commerce platform. Our marketing efforts target consumers who have an interest in healthy and active lifestyles. We attempt to motivate
consumers toward a simple and easy purchasing decision using a combination of defined marketing programs and a modernized technology
stack. 

36 

Increasing
customer engagement is a key driver of our business and results of operations. We continue to invest in our DTC channel and in performance
marketing to drive customer engagement. In addition to developing new product offerings and cross-selling wines in our product portfolio,
we focus on increasing customer conversion and retention. As we continue to invest in our DTC channel, we expect to increase customer
engagement and subsequently deliver greater satisfaction. We also distribute our wines via other wine e-commerce sites such as Wine.com
and Vivino.com and plan to continue to add affiliate retail websites. 

Net
Revenue Percentage by Channel 

We
calculate net revenue percentage by channel as net revenue made through our wholesale channel to distributors, through our wholesale
channel directly to retail accounts, and through our DTC channel, respectively, as a percentage of our total net revenue. We monitor
net revenue percentage across revenue channels to understand the effectiveness of our distribution model and to ensure we are employing
resources effectively as we engage customers.

Cost of
Revenues 

Cost
of revenues (or cost of goods sold). Cost of revenues is comprised of all direct product costs such as juice, bottles, caps, corks, labels,
and capsules. Additionally, we also categorize boxes and quality assurance testing within our cost of revenues. We expect that our cost
of revenues will increase as our net revenue increases. As the volume of our product inputs increases, we intend to work to renegotiate
vendor contracts with key suppliers to reduce overall product input costs as a percentage of net revenue. 

Additionally,
the Company includes shipping fees in all DTC revenues. These fees are paid by end consumers at time of order and subsequently itemized
within the cost of each individual sale. 

As
a commodity product, the cost of wine fluctuates due to annual harvest yields and the availability of juice. This macroeconomic consideration
is not unique to Fresh Vine Wine, although we are conscious of its potential impact to our product cost structure. 

Gross
Profit (Loss) 

Gross
profit (loss) is equal to our net revenue less cost of revenues. As we grow our business in the future, we expect gross profit to increase
as our revenue grows and as we optimize our cost of revenues. 

Selling,
General, and Administrative Expenses 

Selling,
general, and administrative expenses consist of selling expenses, marketing expenses, and general and administrative expenses. Selling
expenses consist primarily of direct selling expenses in our wholesale and DTC channels, including payroll and related costs, product
samples, processing fees, and other outside service fees or consulting fees. Marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising costs
to promote brand awareness, contract fees incurred as a result of significant sports marketing agreements, customer retention costs,
payroll, and related costs. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs. 

Equity-Based
Compensation 

Equity-based
compensation consists of the accounting expense resulting from our issuance of equity or equity-based grants issued in exchange for employee
or non-employee services. We measure equity-based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize
the compensation expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. We recognize any forfeitures as they
occur.

Revenue, Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit 

We
had net revenue in fiscal 2022 of 2,860,001. Net revenue in fiscal 2021 was 1,700,207. The increase in net revenue was attributable
to our increasing presence in the wholesale market, the launch of our wine club, and the introduction of service revenues. We generated
net revenue of 1,651,451 during fiscal 2022 from our wholesale distribution channel, 911,326 of net revenue from our direct-to-consumer
sales channel, and 297,224 from our services from our related party channel. This revenue distribution represents 58 , 32 and 10 ,
respectively, of our net revenue during the period.

Selling,
general and administrative expenses 

For
the year ended December 31, 2022, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 140 , compared to the period ended December
31, 2021. Selling, general and administrative expense increases were largely driven by certain one-time charges associated with the leadership
transition, as well as increases in general and administrative expenses due to higher staffing headcount and related salaries and additional
consulting, legal and financial expenses as operational activity increased from 2021 to 2022. In addition, the Company incurred incremental
costs due to the Company being a public reporting company in 2022, such as higher professional services for accounting, finance and legal,
as well as higher insurance expenses and listing fees, among others. The increase in selling expenses primarily relates to our sponsorship
agreements in the sports and entertainment industry. The year-over-year increase in marketing expenses primarily resulted from increased
advertising, social media marketing, tastings, and other promotion materials and events. We typically expect selling and marketing expenses
to follow our sales volume growth as the activities are intended to generate revenues, however we expect these expenses to be higher
in the initial growth phase of the Company and begin to normalize in the coming quarters.

31, 2021, respectively. Cash used in operating activities increased in the period ended December 31, 2022 primarily because of selling,
general and administrative expense increases driven by certain one-time charges associated with the leadership transition, as well as
increases in general and administrative expenses due to higher staffing headcount and related salaries and additional consulting, legal
and financial expenses as operational activity increased from 2021 to 2022. In addition, the Company incurred incremental costs due to
the Company being a public reporting company in 2022, such as higher professional services for accounting, finance and legal, as well
as higher insurance expenses and listing fees. Investments in inventory also contributed to the increase in net cash used in operating
activities during the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Net
cash used in investing activities was 0 and 250 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Cash used

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Our
primary cash needs are for working capital purposes, such as producing or purchasing inventory and funding operating. Prior to our December
2021 initial public offering, we funded our operational cash requirements primarily with funds advanced from Damian Novak, our former
Executive Chairman and co-founder, and entities affiliated with Mr. Novak. We also received proceeds from the sale of Class W
Units representing membership interests in the Company, which converted into common stock upon the LLC Conversion, and we received
short term loans in the form of promissory notes from two of our equity holders, which supplemented the loans from Mr. Novak and
his affiliates as sources of operating capital, along with limited cash flows from our operating activities. See Financing Transactions 
below. 

During
the year ending on December 31, 2022, we used a portion of the net proceeds we received from our initial public offering to repay net
outstanding related party payables of 432,000 that we owed to Mr. Novak and his affiliates, and the promissory notes held by our equity
holders. We are currently funding our operational cash requirements with net proceeds from the sale of our common stock in our initial
public offering and our recently completed subscription rights offering (discussed below), supplemented by cash flows from our operating
activities. 

39 

We
have incurred losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception in May 2019, including net losses of approximately 15.2) million and 10.0) million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31,
2022, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 15.8 million and a total stockholders equity of approximately 5.6 million.
We expect to incur losses in future periods as we continue to increase our expenses in order to position us to grow our business and
incur expenses associated with being a public company. 

As
of December 31, 2022, we had 2,080,335 in cash, accounts receivable of 259,317, inventory of 3,696,198, and prepaid expenses of 961,211.
On December 31, 2022, current assets amounted to approximately 8.6 million and current liabilities were 3.0 resulting in a working
capital surplus (with working capital defined as current assets minus current liabilities) of approximately 5.6 million. 

On
January 27, 2023, we entered into a Global Mutual Compromise, Release and Settlement Agreement (the Settlement Agreement with Janelle Anderson, among others, pursuant to which Ms. Anderson has agreed to dismiss her pending lawsuit against us in exchange
for (among other things) a cash payment in the amount of 1,250,000 (less certain attorney fees and relevant taxes and other withholdings)
in a lump sum. We recouped approximately 805,000 of this of cash payment from insurance coverage. The cash payment was made at the closing 
of the Settlement Agreement, which occurred on February 20, 2023. The cash payment is in addition to 400,000 that we previously paid
to Ms. Anderson in January 2023 in respect of 2022 bonus compensation earned by her under her employment agreement while employed by
the Company. Our cash payments to Ms. Anderson (net of amounts recouped from insurance) have reduced the amount of our cash reserves,
current assets and working capital. 

During
the first quarter of 2023, on March 14, 2023, the Company completed an offering to its stockholders as of February 22, 2023 of the right
to purchase up to 6,366,129 units Units at a subscription price of 1.00 per Unit (the Rights Offering ).
The Rights Offering resulted in the sale of 3,143,969 Units for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 3.14 million to the Company.
Each Unit consisted of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase one share of common stock (the Warrants ). The
Warrants were exercisable immediately, expire five years from the date of issuance and have an exercise price of 1.25 per share. If
exercised, additional gross proceeds of up to approximately 3.93 million may be received through the exercise of Warrants issued in
the rights offering. The Company expects to use net proceeds from the sale of the Units, after deducting fees and expenses (including
dealer-manager fees) of approximately 2.7 million related to the Rights Offering, to fund its working capital requirements and for general
corporate purposes. See Financing Transactions below and note 10 to the accompanying financial statements for additional
information on the Rights Offering. 

Although
the Company s revenue generated during the year ended December 31, 2022 represents a 68 increase over its revenues generated in
same period of 2021, the Company s operating expenses have significantly exceeded its revenues over these periods. During the year
ended December 31, 2022, the Company purchased additional inventory in efforts to mitigate supply chain risks and incurred additional
expenses in order to invest in sales and marketing activities and increase staffing and infrastructure to position the Company for future
growth. Meanwhile, the Company has put in place several cash preservation initiatives starting in the third quarter of 2022. 

The
Company currently holds no debt and expects to seek additional debt or equity financing to sustain existing operations. If adequate financing
is not available, the Company may be forced to curtail its growth priorities, take measures to severely reduce our expenses and business
operations, or discontinue them completely. Such financing may be dilutive. At the current pace of incurring expenses and without receipt
of additional financing, the Company projects that the existing cash balance, when added to anticipated proceeds from budgeted sales,
will be sufficient to fund current operations through the end of 2023, after which additional financing will be needed to satisfy obligations.
Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all. If additional financing is available, it may be highly dilutive
to existing shareholders and may otherwise include burdensome or onerous terms. The Company s inability to raise additional working
capital in a timely manner would negatively impact the ability to fund operations, generate revenues, grow the business and otherwise
execute the Company s business plan, leading to the reduction or suspension of operations and ultimately potentially ceasing operations
altogether. Should this occur, the value of any investment in the Company s securities could be adversely affected. 

40 

These
factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include
any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities
that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Our
ability to continue as a going concern in the future will be determined by our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to sustain our
operations and/or raise additional capital in the form of debt or equity financing. Our forecast of cash resources is forward-looking
information that involves risks and uncertainties, and the actual amount of our expenses could vary materially as a result of a number
of factors. We have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and our revenue could prove to be less and our expenses
higher than we currently anticipate. Management does not know whether additional financing will be on terms favorable or acceptable to
us when needed, if at all. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to fund our operations and adequate additional funds are
not available when required, management may need to curtail its sales and marketing efforts, which would adversely affect our business
prospects, or we may be unable to continue operations. 

Financing
Transactions 

We
have funded our operations through a combination of debt and equity financings. 

Since
the Company s inception in May 2019 and prior to its December 2021 initial public offering, Damian Novak, co-founder, and affiliates
of Mr. Novak incurred expenses on our behalf or advanced funds to us from time to time as needed to satisfy our working capital requirements
and expenses. The reimbursable expenses and advances were reflected as related party payables on our balance sheet and were not evidenced
promissory notes or other written documentation. On December 17, 2021, we used a portion of the proceeds from our initial public offering
to repay 2.0 million, representing the outstanding amount of these related party payables, net of related party receivables that Mr.
Novak and his affiliates owed to us at that time. 

In
November 2020, we sold 50,000 Class W Units representing membership interests in the Company to an investor at a price of 5.00 per unit,
for gross proceeds of 250,000. Such Class W Units converted into an aggregate of 309,672 shares of our common stock upon the LLC Conversion. 

In
January 2021, we sold 40,000 Class W Units representing membership interests in the Company to an investor at a price of 5.00 per unit,
for gross proceeds of 200,000. Such Class W Units converted into an aggregate of 247,738 shares of our common stock upon the LLC Conversion. 

During
the period from April 2021 through September 2021, we sold an aggregate of 60,388 Class W Units representing membership interests in
the Company to investors at a price of 34.94 per unit, for gross proceeds of 2,109,945. Such Class W Units converted into an aggregate
of 374,017 shares of our common stock upon the LLC Conversion. 

In
September 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with an unrelated party to pledge certain eligible accounts receivable for a cash
advance at a percentage of the outstanding amount, with the remaining balance due upon collection from the customer. The agreement had
an initial term of one year which automatically renews for successive one year terms unless the Company provides a notice of termination
at least 60 days prior to the termination date. The receivables are pledged with full recourse, which means we bear the risk of non-payment.
The amounts advanced to the Company were classified as a secured loan on our balance sheet and any fees computed on the outstanding amounts
are treated as interest expense on our statement of operations. The Company terminated this arrangement effective October 1, 2022. 

In
September 2021, we issued a 216,000 promissory note to a stockholder of the Company that became due and payable upon the December 17,
2021 closing of our initial public offering. In October 2021, we issued another 216,000 promissory note to a different stockholder of
the Company that became due and payable upon the December 17, 2021 closing of our initial public offering. Collectively, the stockholders
holding these notes owned approximately 3.63 of our outstanding shares immediately prior to our initial public offering. 

In
December 2021, we completed an initial public of our common stock, in which we sold 2,200,000 shares. The shares began trading on the
NYSE American on December 14, 2021. The shares were sold at an initial public offering price of 10.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds
to the Company of approximately 19.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses
payable by us. 

41 

During
the first quarter of 2023, the Company distributed, at no charge to holders of the Company s common stock, non-transferable subscription
rights to purchase up to an aggregate of 6,366,129 Units. Each Unit consisted of one share of our common stock and a Warrant to purchase
one share of our common stock. The Warrants were exercisable immediately, expire five years from the date of issuance and have an exercise
price of 1.25 per share. For each share of common stock held by a stockholder of the Company on February 22, 2023, the record date of
the Rights Offering, such stockholder received 0.5 subscription rights. Each whole subscription right allowed the holder thereof to subscribe
to purchase one Unit, which we refer to as the basic subscription right, at a subscription price of 1.00 per Unit. In addition, any
holder of subscription rights exercising his, her or its basic subscription right in full was eligible to subscribe to purchase additional
Units that remained unsubscribed in the Rights Offering at the same subscription price per Unit that applied to the basic subscription
right, subject to proration among participants exercising their over-subscription privilege, which we refer to as the over-subscription
privilege. The subscription rights period expired on March 9, 2023, and resulted in stockholders subscribing for 3,143,969 Units. Upon
the closing of the Rights Offering, which occurred on March 14, 2023, we issued 3,143,969 shares of common stock and 3,143,969 Warrants
and received aggregate gross cash proceeds of approximately 3.14 million. After deducting dealer-manager fees and other fees and expenses
related to the Rights Offering, we received net proceeds of approximately 2.7 million. If exercised, additional gross proceeds of up
to approximately 3.93 million may be received through the exercise of Warrants issued in the Rights Offering. The Rights Offering was
made pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 (Registration No. 333-269082), which was declared effective by the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission on February 14, 2023, and the prospectus dated February 22, 2023.

of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

all significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our audited
financial statements, we believe that the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to our business operations and understanding
of our financial results. 

Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts 

Accounts
receivable consists of amounts owed to us for sales of our products on credit and are reported at net realizable value. Credit terms
are extended to customers in the normal course of business. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial conditions.
We estimate allowances for future returns and doubtful accounts based upon historical experience and its evaluation of the current status
of receivables. Accounts considered uncollectible are written off against the allowance. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021 we had
 0 in the allowance for doubtful accounts. 

Allowance
for Inventory Obsolescence 

Inventories
primarily include bottled wine which is carried at the lower of cost (calculated using the first-in-first-out FIFO method)
or net realizable value. We reduce the carrying value of inventories that are obsolete or for which market conditions indicate cost will
not be recovered to estimated net realizable value. Our estimate of net realizable value is based on analysis and assumptions including,
but not limited to, historical experience, future demand and market requirements. Reductions to the carrying value of inventories are
recorded in cost of revenues. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021 there was no allowance for inventory obsolescence. 

Useful
Lives of Intangible Assets 

We
assess intangible assets with finite useful lives which are amortized on a systematic basis over their estimated useful lives. The amortization
period and amortization method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life reflects the pattern in which the assets future
economic benefits are expected to be consumed. Where the pattern cannot be reliably determined, the straight-line method is used. The
amortization period and method are reviewed at least at each financial year-end. Amortization of intangible assets with fixed determinable
lives is recorded on a straight-line basis over 10 years for trademarks. 

42 

Equity-Based
Compensation 

We
measure equity-based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize the compensation expense
over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. We recognize any forfeitures as they occur. 

We
measure equity-based compensation when the service date precedes the grant date based on the fair value of the award as an accrual of
equity-based compensation and adjusts the cost to fair value at each reporting date prior to the grant date. In the period in which the
grant occurs, the cumulative compensation cost is adjusted to the fair value at the date of the grant. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have not engaged in any off-balance sheet activities as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K. 

Accounting
Standards and Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

See
Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our audited financial statement for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. 

Emerging
Growth Company Status 

Pursuant
to the JOBS Act, a company constituting an emerging growth company is, among other things, entitled to rely upon certain
reduced reporting requirements and is eligible to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting
standards applicable to public companies. We are an emerging growth company and have elected to use this extended transition period for
complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier
of the date we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition
period provided in the JOBS Act. Our financial statements may, therefore, not be comparable to those of other public companies that comply
with such new or revised accounting standards.

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Rule
13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), defines the term disclosure controls and procedures 
as those controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files
or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal
financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

43 

Management,
with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of December 31, 2022.
Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective as of December 31, 2022 due to the material weaknesses
in internal control over financial reporting as described below. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

We
are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. As defined in the securities laws,
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal
financial officer and effected by our Board of Directors, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable
detail accurately and fairly reflect the acquisitions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
not prevent or detect misstatements. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we carried
out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934) as of December 31, 2022 based on the criteria in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in 2013. Based upon this evaluation, we
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2022 due to the following material
weaknesses. 

Material
Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Lack
of Segregation of Duties. Management has determined that the limited number of the Company employees responsible for accounting and
reporting functions results in a lack of segregation of incompatible duties in that such employees have access to both physical assets
and the related accounting records or to all phases of a transaction. At December 31, 2022, our principal financial officer had access
to the general ledger, access and authority to use Company credit cards, authority to authorize cash disbursements under threshold amounts
and access to inventories. Although the Company s cash disbursements and credit card transactions are subject to oversight, there
is a lack of preventative controls with cash disbursements and credit card transactions and limited or no controls with oversight of
the general ledger and inventory records. In addition, an individual who serves the Company s information technology function has
transactional access on both of the Company s primary financial applications and the Company s principal financial offering
has unrestricted administrative access to the Company s accounting application. As a result, a lack of preventative application
controls exists to prevent or detect material misstatements in the financial statements on a timely basis. 

Accounting
for Inventory Deposits . The Company does not have a properly designed control or process in place to reconcile the inventory deposit
accounting in a timely manner. An adjustment was identified during the audit that could have been material to the financial statements. 

Accounting
for Insurance Recoveries. Gross versus net balance sheet treatment for the settlement and related insurance recoverable was not considered
which resulted in a material adjustment to gross up assets and liabilities. 

Accounting
for Executive Bonus Compensation. The performance conditions for the former Chief Executive Officer s bonus were not evaluated
which resulted in a material entry to record accrued compensation at December 31, 2022. 

44 

Material
Weakness Remediation Activities 

Lack
of Segregation of Duties. To ensure timely and accurate financial reporting, management is designing processes to keep authorization,
recordkeeping, custody of assets, and reconciliation duties separate, and intends to re-evaluate its overall staffing levels within the
accounting, finance and information technology departments and may hire additional staff to enable segregation of duties. 

Accounting
for inventory deposits . The current process requires re-engineering to ensure the inventory deposit balance is accurately measured.
In the future, the Company plans to communicate with our inventory warehouse vendor to reconcile any discrepancies. 

Accounting
for insurance recoveries. The Company has gathered and reviewed all applicable guidance regarding the accounting treatment of insurance
recoveries. We plan to use this guidance to appropriately record any future insurance recoveries. 

Accounting
for executive bonus compensation. The performance conditions of bonuses will be reviewed periodically to ensure the Company is accurately
recording accrued bonus compensation. 

Once
the above actions and processes have been in operation for a sufficient period of time for our management to conclude that the material
weaknesses have been fully remediated and our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, we will consider these material
weaknesses fully addressed. 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of Wipfli, LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, regarding internal
control over financial reporting. Our management report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting
firm pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which exempts nonaccelerated filers from the independent
registered public accounting firm attestation requirement. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934)
during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022 that has materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

Family
Relationships 

Messrs.
Brad and David Yacullo, two of our directors, are brothers. There are no other family relationships between any of the other directors
or executive officers. 

Board
Composition and Director Independence 

Our
business and affairs are managed under the direction of our board of directors. Our bylaws provide that our board of directors shall
consist of one or more members and that the number of directors may be fixed from time to time by a majority vote of the directors then
in office. Our board of directors is currently comprised of the five individuals identified above. 

When
considering whether directors have the experience, qualifications, attributes and skills to enable the Board of Directors to satisfy
its oversight responsibilities effectively in light of our business and structure, our Board of Directors focuses primarily on the information
discussed in each of the directors individual biographies set forth above. 

47 

Our
Board of Directors periodically reviews relationships that directors have with our Company to determine whether our directors are independent
directors as such term is defined in Section 803 of the NYSE American LLC Company Guide. Our Board of Directors has determined
that each of Eric Doan, Michael Pruitt, Brad Yacullo and David Yacullo is an independent director. In making this determination, the
Board of Directors considered the relationships that such individuals have with our Company and other facts and circumstances that the
Board of Directors deemed relevant in determining their independence, including ownership interests in us. 

Board
Leadership Structure and Risk Oversight 

Damian
Novak, one of our founders, served as Executive Chair of our Board of Directors from our December 2021 initial public offering until
February 20, 2023. Effective February 20, 2023, our Board of Directors appointed Michael Pruitt to serve as Non-Executive Chair
of the Board of Directors. We believe that having a chair separate from the Chief Executive Officer creates an environment that is more
conducive to objective evaluation and oversight of management s performance, increasing management accountability and improving
the ability of the Board to monitor whether management s actions are in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. 

Board
Committees 

Our
Board of Directors has a standing audit committee, compensation committee nominating and corporate governance committee. Each committee
operates under its own written charter adopted by the Board of Directors, which are available on our website at ir.freshvinewine.com/info/. 

Audit
Committee 

The
audit committee is responsible for overseeing financial reporting and related internal controls, risk, and ethics and compliance, including
but not limited to review of filings and earnings releases, selection and oversight of the independent registered public accounting firm,
oversight of internal audit, interactions with management and the board, and communications with external stakeholders. Our audit committee
is composed of Eric Doan and Michael D. Pruitt, with Mr. Doan serving as Chair of the committee. Our board of directors has determined
that each of Messrs. Doan and Pruitt meet the definition of independent director under the rules of the NYSE American and
under Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act and that each is an audit committee financial expert as that term is defined in
Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

Compensation
Committee 

The
compensation committee is responsible for establishing the compensation philosophy and ensuring that elements of our compensation program
encourage high levels of performance among the executive officers and positions the Company for growth. The compensation committee ensures
our compensation program is fair, competitive, and closely aligns the interests of our executive officers with the Company s short
and long-term business objectives. The compensation committee is responsible for determining the compensation of our officers and directors,
or recommending that such compensation be approved by the full board of directors. Our Chief Executive Officer may not be present during
voting or deliberations regarding the Chief Executive Officer s compensation. The compensation committee also administers the Company s
equity incentive plans and approves all equity grants made thereunder. Our compensation committee is composed of one director, Eric Doan,
who is an independent director under the rules of the NYSE American. 

Compensation
Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 

During
the year ended December 31, 2022, Mr. Doan served as the sole member of the compensation committee. Mr. Doan has never been an executive
officer or employee of ours or had a relationship requiring disclosure under Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. None of our officers currently serves, or has served during the last completed year, on the compensation
committee or the board of directors of any other entity that has one or more officers serving as a member of our board of directors or
our compensation committee. 

48 

Nominating
and Corporate Governance Committee 

The
nominating and corporate governance committee is responsible for selecting directors to be nominated for election to our board of directors
or recommending such nominees for selection by the full board. The nominating and corporate governance committee is also responsible
for board effectiveness and governance, with duties that include board succession planning, director recruiting, shaping the Company s
governance policies and practices, and director education and self-evaluations. Our nominating and corporate governance committee is
composed of one director, Eric Doan. 

Board
Oversight of Risk Management 

While
the full board of directors has the ultimate oversight responsibility for the risk management process, its committees oversee risk in
certain specified areas. In particular, our audit committee oversees management of enterprise risks as well as financial risks. Our compensation
committee is responsible for overseeing the management of risks relating to our executive compensation plans and arrangements and the
incentives created by the compensation awards it administers. Our nominating and corporate governance committee oversees risks associated
with corporate governance, business conduct and ethics, and is responsible for overseeing the review and approval of related party transactions.
Pursuant to the board of directors instruction, management reports on applicable risks to the relevant committee or the full board
of directors, as appropriate, with additional review or reporting on risks conducted as needed or as requested by the board of directors
and its committees. 

Code of
Ethics 

We
have adopted a code of conduct that applies to all of our officers, employees and directors, and a separate code of ethics that applies
to our Chief Executive Officer and senior financial officers. Our code of conduct and code of ethics are available on our Internet website
at ir.freshvinewine.com/info/. 

Diversity 

The
Nominating Committee and Governance of the Board of Directors considers and makes recommendations to the Board on all matters pertaining
to the effectiveness of the Board, such as the size and composition of the Board, including the recognition of diversity characteristics
and equal opportunity (which is the policy of treating directors and others without discrimination, especially on the basis of their
sex, ethnicity, religion, disability, national origin, sexual orientation or identification, veteran status, race or age). 

Delinquent
Section 16(a) Reports 

Section
16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires our officers and directors, and persons who own more than ten percent
of a registered class of our equity securities, to file electronically reports of ownership and changes in ownership of such securities
with the SEC. Based on review of the copies of Forms 3 and 4 (and amendments thereto, if any) filed electronically with the SEC during
the year ended December 31, 2022 and Forms 5 (and amendments thereto, if any) filed electronically with the SEC with respect to such
year, or written representations that no Forms 5 were required, we believe that the following is the list of our officers, directors
and greater than ten percent beneficial owners who have failed to file on a timely basis all Section 16(a) filing requirements during
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022: Janelle Anderson filed a Form 4 on January 3, 2022 which was due on December 31, 2021; Nechio
 Novak LLC filed a Form 4 on July 29, 2022 which was due on July 22, 2022; Janelle Anderson filed a Form 4 on August 29, 2022 which
was due on August 26, 2022; James Spellmire file a Form 3 on September 13, 2022 which was due on September 12, 2022; and Janelle Anderson
filed a Form 4 on September 21, 2022 which was due on September 19, 2022.

Nechio and Elliot Savoie were employed by us during 2022 and 2021 pursuant to unwritten employment arrangements pursuant to which each
received a base salary, which is subject to adjustment, from time to time, at the discretion of our board of directors. Upon our initial
public offering in December of 2021, Messrs. Nechio and Savoie each began receiving annual base salaries of 300,000. On February 1,
2022, Mr. Savoie s annual base salary was reduced to 220,000. Effective October 15, 2022, Mr. Nechio s annual
base salary was reduced to 150,000. Messrs. Nechio and Savoie did not receive bonus payments for 2022 or 2021. Mr. Nechio continues
to be employed by us pursuant to his unwritten employment arrangement. 

Effective
December 17, 2021, the Company granted 125,926 restricted stock units RSUs to Elliot Savoie under the Company s
2021 Equity Incentive Plan. Each RSU represented the right to receive one share of Common Stock from the Company upon vesting, with vesting
occurring on June 11, 2022 (180 days after the date of the final prospectus for our initial public offering). 

Mr. Savoie
served as Chief Financial Officer from October 2019 until March 31, 2022, as Head of Corporate Development and Ventures until
June 30, 2022, and then as interim Chief Financial Officer from June 30, 2022 until August 1, 2022. Effective September 1,
2022, the Company entered into an Employment Transition and Consulting Agreement with Mr. Savoie (the Transition Agreement pursuant to which he remained employed by the Company through November 30, 2022 in order to provide for an orderly transition of
his roles and responsibilities within the Company. During such period of employment, Mr. Savoie received an annualized salary of
 100,000. The Transition Agreement further provided for the Company s engagement of Mr. Savoie as a consultant for a nine
month period commencing December 1, 2022 and expiring August 31, 2023, during which time the Company agreed to pay Mr. Savoie
a 5,000 monthly consulting fee. On the September 1, 2022 effective date of the Transition Agreement, the Company granted Mr. Savoie
a stock option to purchase 69,892 shares of common stock at a per share exercise price equal to 3.04 (the fair market value of
the Company s common stock on the date of grant). The stock option vested with respect to 3,584 shares on the last calendar day
of September, October and November of 2022, and the balance of the stock option vests in monthly installments as nearly equal as possible
(approximately 6,571 shares each) on the last calendar day of each month from December 2022 through August 2023.
On March 20, 2023, the Company and Mr. Savoie entered into an Amendment to the Transition Agreement (the Amendment pursuant
to which the parties agreed that the consulting period (and the Company s obligation to make monthly consulting payments) would
terminate on March 31, 2023. In exchange for accelerating the expiration of the consulting period, the Company agreed to forgive Mr.
Savoie s obligation to pay approximately 101,000 owed by him to the Company, which the parties previously agreed would be payable
on or prior to March 1, 2024. 

Effective
August 31, 2022, James Spellmire was appointed to serve as Chief Financial Officer and Secretary of the Company. Under the terms
of his engagement, the Company is paying an hourly wage of 290 to Mr. Spellmire. 

Janelle
Anderson commenced employment with the Company as Chief Marketing Officer on August 1, 2021 and was appointed as Chief Executive
Officer on September 1, 2021. Pursuant to her employment agreement, which is described below, the Company paid Ms. Anderson an annual
base salary of 400,000 from August 1, 2021 until September 17, 2021, and a base salary of 300,000 for the remainder of 2021.
In each of January 2022 and 2023, the Company also paid Ms. Anderson 400,000 for achieving all performance objectives under the
annual incentive cash bonus plan set forth in her employment agreement, which objectives related to increases in the number of points
of distribution to which the Company sells its wine. Ms. Anderson s employment agreement contemplated that the Company would, on
the initial closing date of its initial public offering, grant her an option to purchase 427,001 shares of common stock that is
exercisable at the initial public offering price; however such stock option was not granted at the time of the initial public offering
because the vesting criteria had not been established. As a result, the fair value of the option is not reflected in the Summary Compensation
Table. On March 11, 2022, the Company granted Ms. Anderson a stock option to purchase up to 427,001 shares of common stock,
which option had an exercise price equal to 3.47 per share (which is the closing price of the Company s common stock on the date
of grant) and was scheduled to vest in three instalments in amounts as nearly equal as possible on the six month, one year and two year
anniversaries of the date of grant subject to her continuing to be employed by the Company through the applicable vesting date. The stock
option granted on March 11, 2022 was in lieu of (and not in addition to) the stock option contemplated by Ms. Anderson s
employment agreement. Ms. Anderson s employment with the Company terminated on June 8, 2022, and the entire 427,001 share
stock option terminated unvested. See also Item 3. Legal Proceedings Janelle Anderson Lawsuit and Settlement.

Employment
Agreements 

Janelle
Anderson Employment Agreement 

Effective
August 1, 2021, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Janelle Anderson pursuant to which Ms. Anderson initially
served as Chief Marketing Officer and was paid an annualized base salary of 400,000. This agreement was amended and restated effective
September 1, 2021, at which time Ms. Anderson was appointed as Chief Executive Officer, and further amended and restated effective
September 17, 2021, at which time her annualized base salary was reduced to 300,000. The agreement, as further amended and restated,
provided that during the period from September 17, 2021 through December 31, 2021, and during each calendar year thereafter
while she was employed under the agreement (each a performance period ), Ms. Anderson would be eligible to receive a 100,000
incentive cash bonus each time that the number of points of distribution to which the Company sells its wine is increased by 100 over
the number of points of distribution to which the Company sells its wine at the commencement of the applicable performance period, up
to a maximum of 400,000 per performance period. For such purposes, points of distribution included on-premise outlets
(e.g., bars, restaurants, arenas and similar venues) and off-premise outlets (e.g., grocery, liquor and convenient stores and similar
outlets). Ms. Anderson was eligible to receive additional discretionary bonuses based upon her performance on behalf of the Company and/or
the Company s performance in such amounts, in such manner and at such times as determined by the board of directors. Ms. Anderson
was also eligible to participate in the standard benefits which the Company generally provided to its full-time employees under
its applicable plans and policies. 

Upon
commencement of her employment, Ms. Anderson was granted units representing a 0.75 equity interest in the Company, calculated as of
August 1, 2021 (the effective date of the employment agreement), which converted into 67,676 shares of the Company s
common stock upon the Company conversion to a corporation in December 2021 (the LLC Conversion ). Ms. Anderson was
entitled to receive an additional 33,838 shares of common stock (representing a 0.3725 equity interest in the Company, calculated
as of August 1, 2021) upon each of two milestone events, provided that she remained employed by the Company on the date on which
the applicable milestone event is achieved. The first milestone was to be satisfied upon the Company achieving a market capitalization
of at least 225 million, and the second milestone was to be satisfied upon the later to occur of the Company achieving a market
capitalization of at least 300 million and the Company s completion of a secondary underwritten public offering of its common
stock pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act. 

52 

Under
her employment agreement, if Ms. Anderson s employment was terminated by the Company for any reason other than Cause (as defined
in the employment agreement), or Ms. Anderson resigned as an employee of the Company for Good Reason (as defined in the employment agreement),
so long as she signed and did not revoke a release agreement, she would have been entitled to receive severance in the form of continued
base salary payments over a period of six months. In addition, if Ms. Anderson s employment was terminated by the Company
(or its successor) for a reason other than for Cause or as a result of her death or disability, or she voluntarily terminated her employment
for Good Reason, in either case within twelve months following the occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined in the employment
agreement) or within 90 days prior to a Change in Control, the vesting of all outstanding unvested equity-based incentive awards
would have accelerated. The employment agreement included a provision allowing the Company to reduce the payment to which Ms. Anderson
would have been entitled upon a Change-in-Control transaction to the extent needed for her to avoid paying an excise tax under Internal
Revenue Code Section 280G, unless she would have been better off, on an after-tax basis, receiving the full amount of such
payments and paying the excise taxes due. 

Ms.
Anderson s employment agreement provided that the Company would, on the initial closing date of its initial public offering, grant
her an option to purchase 427,001 shares of common stock that is exercisable at the initial public offering price; however such
stock option was not granted at the time of the initial public offering because the vesting criteria had not been established. In lieu
of such stock option, on March 11, 2022, the Company granted Ms. Anderson a stock option to purchase up to 427,001 shares of
common stock at an exercise price equal to 3.47 per share (which is the closing price of the Company s common stock on the date
of grant) and was scheduled to vest in three installments in amounts as nearly equal as possible on the six month, one year and two year
anniversaries of the date of grant subject to her continuing to be employed by the Company through the applicable vesting date. The stock
option terminated upon the termination of her employment with the Company. 

Ms.
Anderson s employment agreement contained customary confidentiality and intellectual property covenants and a non-competition restriction
that provided, among other things, that Ms. Anderson would not engage in a competitive business or solicit our employees or consultants
for a period of one year after termination of employment. For such purpose, competitive business means a business primarily
engaged in the development, production, marketing and/or sale of wine varietals and brands that are primarily marketed to consumers as
embodying a connection to health, wellness and/or an active lifestyle. 

Ms.
Anderson s employment with the Company terminated on June 8, 2022. 

Ellen
Scipta Employment Agreement 

On
March 24, 2022, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Ellen Scipta pursuant to which she commenced employment with
the Company on March 30, 2022 and was appointed as the Company s Chief Financial Officer on March 31, 2021. Under her
employment agreement, which was for an indefinite term, Ms. Scipta was entitled to receive annual base salary of 255,000 and was eligible
to receive an annual cash bonus commencing in 2022, the target amount of which was to be equal to 65 of her base salary. The Company
agreed that the actual cash bonus for 2022 would be at least 50,000. Ms. Scipta was also eligible to receive additional discretionary
bonuses based upon her performance on behalf of the Company and/or the Company s performance in such amounts, in such manner and
at such times as may be determined by the board of directors or a committee thereof. 

While
employed by the Company, and commencing in 2023, the Company agreed to make annual grants to Ms. Scipta of (i) restricted stock
unit awards having a value equal to 35 of her base salary (as determined in good faith by the Company s board of directors or
a committee thereof), which would vest one-third annually commencing on the first anniversary of the date of grant, and (ii) stock
options, exercisable at fair market value on the grant date, having a value equal to 70 of her base salary (as determined in good faith
by the Company s board of directors or a committee thereof), which would vest one-third annually commencing on the first anniversary
of the date of grant and the per share exercise price for such Stock Option would be equal to the closing price as of the date of grant.
Ms. Scipta was also eligible to receive annual and periodic equity-based compensation awards, with the amount of such awards granted
and the terms and conditions thereof to be determined from time to time by and in the sole discretion of the Company s board of
directors or a committee thereof, and she was eligible to participate in the standard benefits which the Company generally provides to
its full-time employees under its applicable plans and policies. 

53 

Upon
commencement of her employment on March 30, 2022, Ms. Scipta was granted (i) a 100,000 share restricted stock award, which
was subject to transfer and forfeiture restrictions, one-third of which lapsed on the date of grant, and one-third of which
was scheduled to lapse on each of the one-year and two-year anniversary of the date of grant, and (ii) a 200,000 share
stock option award, one-third of which vested on the date of grant, and one-third of which was scheduled to lapse on each of
the one-year and two-year anniversary of the date of grant. The stock option had an exercise price equal to 3.30 (the fair
market value of the Company s common stock on the date of grant). Upon the termination of Ms. Scipta s employment with the
Company, the unvested portion of her restricted stock award was forfeited and her stock option terminated. 

Under
her employment agreement, if Ms. Scipta s employment was terminated by the Company for any reason other than Cause (as defined
in the employment agreement), or Ms. Scipta resigned as an employee of the Company for Good Reason (as defined in the employment agreement),
so long as she signed and did not revoke a release agreement, she would be entitled to receive severance in the form of continued base
salary and bonus payments over a period of six months. In addition, if Ms. Scipta s employment was terminated by the Company
(or its successor) for a reason other than for Cause or as a result of her death or disability, or she voluntarily terminates her employment
for Good Reason, in either case within twelve months following the occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined in the employment
agreement) or within 90 days prior to a Change in Control, the vesting of all outstanding unvested equity-based incentive awards
would accelerate. The employment agreement included a provision allowing the Company to reduce the payment to which Ms. Scipta would
be entitled upon a Change-in-Control transaction to the extent needed for her to avoid paying an excise tax under Internal Revenue
Code Section 280G, unless she would be better off, on an after-tax basis, receiving the full amount of such payments and paying
the excise taxes due. 

Ms.
Scipta s employment agreement contained customary confidentiality and intellectual property covenants and a non-competition restriction
that provides, among other things, that Ms. Scipta will not engage in a competitive business or solicit our employees or consultants
for a period of one year after termination of employment. For such purpose, competitive business means a business primarily
engaged in the development, production, marketing and/or sale of wine varietals and brands that are primarily marketed to consumers as
embodying a connection to health, wellness and/or an active lifestyle in the United States and in any other country or U.S. territory
in which the Company does business during the term of Ms. Scipta s employment with the Company. 

Ms.
Scipta s resigned and her employment with the Company terminated on June 24, 2022.

DIRECTOR
COMPENSATION 

Prior
to our December 2021 initial public offering, our directors did not receive compensation for serving as members of our board of
directors. Effective March 2, 2022, we granted 10,000 restricted stock units RSUs under the Company s 2021
Equity Incentive Plan to each of our seven directors serving at such time as compensation for their services as directors of the Company
during 2022. Each RSU represented the right to receive one share of Common Stock from the Company upon vesting, with vesting occurring
on June 18, 2022. In accordance with the Company s bylaws, our board of directors adopted resolutions reducing the number
of seats on the board of directors from seven to six, which reduction took effect in conjunction with the election of directors at our
November 4, 2022 annual stockholders meeting. The board of directors (or a compensation committee thereof) will periodically
reevaluate the form and amount of director compensation and make adjustments that it deems to be appropriate. We will also reimburse
our directors for reasonable expenses incurred in the performance of the directors services to us upon submission of invoices
and receipts for such expenses. 

The
Company has adopted a new director compensation program commencing in 2023. Under this program, the Company will pay quarterly cash compensation
of 5,000 to each non-employee member of our board of directors, which shall be paid in quarterly installments in arrears on the last
day of each calendar quarter (or, if not a business day, then the next business day), prorated for partial quarterly periods as appropriate
(the Director Fees ). In addition, on April 1, 2023 (or as soon as is administratively possible thereafter), each non-employee
member of the board of directors will receive a grant of 20,000 shares of restricted stock. The restricted stock will be vested with
respect to 5,000 shares on the grant date, and will vest with respect to 5,000 shares on each of July 1, 2023, October 1, 2023 and January
1, 2024, subject to the directors continuing to serve as a director through the applicable vesting date.

In

Since
the Company s inception in May 2019, Damian Novak, our former Executive Chairman and co-founder, and affiliates of Mr. Novak
have incurred expenses on our behalf or advanced funds to us from time to time as needed to satisfy our working capital requirements
and expenses. The reimbursable expenses and advances were reflected as related party payables on our balance sheet and were not evidenced
promissory notes or other written documentation. We used a portion of the proceeds from our initial public offering to repay approximately
 2.0 million, representing the entire outstanding amount of these related party payables, net of related party receivables that
Mr. Novak and his affiliates owed to us at that time. 

Arrangement

and his affiliates Rabbit Hole Equity ), and a portion of Rabbit Hole Equity s lease payments were allocated to the
Company. Effective November 1, 2022, we terminated this lease arrangement. 

License
Agreements with Nina Dobrev and Julianne Hough 

In
March 2021, we entered into five-year license agreements with each of Nina Dobrev and Julianne Hough pursuant to which each
agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to help grow and promote our business and varietals of wine. Each has also granted us a
license to use her pre-approved name, likeness, image, and other indicia of identity, as well as certain content published by her
on her social media or other channels, on and in conjunction with the sale and related pre-approved advertising and promotion of
our varietals of wine and marketing materials. Ms. Dobrev and Ms. Hough have agreed not to grant any similar license or render services
of any sort on behalf of or in connection with any party in the wine category anywhere in the world during the term of her agreement,
other than with respect to Company. Notwithstanding such restrictions, the agreements do not prevent Ms. Dobrev or Ms. Hough from (i) appearing
in the news, entertainment or information portion of any program or event, regardless of those programs or event s sponsorship
or tie-ins; or (ii) becoming a passive investor in any other company provided that if the company is in the category of wine, such
investment must be financial only and Ms. Dobrev or Ms. Hough, as applicable, may not provide services or grant any rights in or to her
name, likeness, image, and other indicia of identity in connection with such investment. 

Upon
entering into such agreements, we issued to each of Ms. Dobrev and Hough (or their designees) 156,500 units representing membership
interests in Fresh Grapes, LLC, which represent 969,272 shares each on a post-LLC Conversion basis. In addition, each of Ms.
Dobrev and Ms. Hough will be entitled to an annual license fee equal to 300,000 per year commencing in March 2022 (the one year
anniversary of the effective date of the agreements). The Company is also required to reimburse each of Ms. Dobrev and Ms. Hough
for reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred in connection with the promotion of the Company s varietals of wine. 

58 

The
license agreements may be terminated by either party for Cause (as defined in the applicable agreement), if the other party
materially breaches any material term of the agreement and fails to cure such breach within 30 days after receiving notice of such
breach. In addition, the Company may terminate the agreement upon the death or physical or mental incapacitation that substantially impairs
the ability of Ms. Dobrev or Ms. Hough, as applicable, to render the Services for more than 180 days. Upon expiration or termination
of each agreement, the rights and licenses granted under the agreement will be immediately revoked, and the Company must cease the marketing
and sale of products that feature the licensor s name, likeness, image, and other indicia of identity, provided that the Company
may continue to use approved marketing materials and sell off the remaining product inventory for a sell-off period of up to 90 days. 

Effective
November 12, 2021, we entered into amendments to the license agreements. As amended, the license agreements provide that payment
of the annual license fees to Ms. Dobrev and Ms. Hough would commence on the initial closing date of our December 2021 initial public
offering. In addition, the amendments provide that each of Ms. Dobrev and Ms. Hough have the right to terminate her agreement if as of
the end of calendar year 2023, we have not achieved at least 5.0 million in EBITDA in either fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2023. In connection
with entering into the amendments, Nechio Novak, LLC assigned and transferred to each of Ms. Dobrev and Ms. Hough (or
their designees) 20,702 additional units representing membership interests in Fresh Grapes, LLC, which represent 128,217 shares
each on a post-LLC Conversion basis. Pursuant to the amendments, we have agreed to indemnify and reimburse the licensees for any
United States federal and state income taxes that may become be due and payable by them solely as a result of the assignment and
transfer of the additional units, and to gross-up such payments for income taxes resulting from the indemnification payments. We
have agreed to satisfy the licensors claims for indemnification and reimbursement no later than thirty (30) days following
the filing of their applicable tax return. During the term of the license agreements, as amended, we have granted observer rights to
each Ms. Dobrev and Ms. Hough pursuant to which each will be entitled, among other things, to attend all meetings, excluding committee
meetings and executive sessions of independent directors, of our Board of Directors in a non-voting, observer capacity, subject to certain
exceptions. 

Founders

date of our initial public offering) and ending on the third anniversary thereof (the Performance Period ), with 20 of

a co-founder ceases to provide services to the Company either as a member of our board of directors a Company employee (with respect
to Messrs. Novak and Nechio) or a Company ambassador and licensor under such co-founder s license agreement with the Company (with
respect to Ms. Dobrev and Ms. Hough), that portion of such co-founder s option scheduled to vest on such vesting date, and all
portions of such option scheduled to vest in the future, will not vest and all of such co-founder s rights to and under such non-vested portions
will terminate. Upon his resignation as a director of the Company, the 375,001 share option granted to Mr. Novak pursuant to his Founder

To the Board

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We have audited
the accompanying balance sheets of Fresh Vine Wine, Inc. (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related
statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for the years then ended and the related notes (collectively
referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and cash flows for the years
then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going
Concern 

The accompanying
financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial
statements, the Company has a history of operating losses and insufficient cash flow from operations, that raises substantial doubt about
its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted
our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we
are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits
included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,
and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

units for one share of common stock. As
a result of the corporate conversion, accumulated deficit was reduced to zero on the date of the corporate conversion, and the corresponding
amount was recorded to additional paid-in capital. The corporate conversion was approved by members holding a majority of the outstanding
units, and in connection with such conversion, the Company filed a certificate of incorporation and adopted bylaws. Pursuant to the Company s
certificate of incorporation, the Company is authorized to issue up to shares of common stock par value per share
and shares of preferred stock par value per share. The Company determined that the corporate conversion is equivalent
to a change in the Company s capital structure. As such, all references in the audited financial statements to the number of shares
and per-share amounts of member units are now presented as common stock and have been retroactively restated to reflect this conversion.
