See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Item 7 herein and Note 27 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in Item 8 herein for segment financial information.

The Wendy s Restaurant System 
 
 The revenues from our restaurant business are derived from two principal sources: (1) sales at Company-operated restaurants and (2) franchise-related revenues, including royalties, national advertising funds contributions, rents and franchise fees received from Wendy s franchised restaurants. Company-operated restaurants comprised approximately 5 of the total Wendy s system as of January 1, 2023 . 
 
 Restaurant Openings and Closings 
 
 During 2022 , Wendy s opened 14 new Company-operated restaurants and closed seven generally underperforming Company-operated restaurants. During 2022 , Wendy s franchisees opened 262 new restaurants and closed 123 generally underperforming restaurants. 
 
 The following table sets forth the number of Wendy s restaurants in operation at the beginning and end of each fiscal year from 2020 to 2022 : 
 2022 2021 2020 Restaurants open at beginning of period 6,949 6,828 6,788 Restaurants opened during period 276 210 147 Restaurants closed during period (130) (89) (107) Restaurants open at end of period 7,095 6,949 6,828 
 
 Restaurant Operations 
 
 Each Wendy s restaurant offers an extensive menu specializing in hamburger sandwiches and featuring filet of chicken breast sandwiches, which are prepared to order with the customer s choice of toppings and condiments. Wendy s menu also includes chicken nuggets, chili, french fries, baked potatoes, freshly prepared salads, soft drinks, Frosty desserts and kids meals. In addition, Wendy s restaurants sell a variety of promotional products on a limited time basis. In March 2020, Wendy s entered the breakfast daypart across the U.S. system and, in May 2022, launched breakfast in Canada. Wendy s breakfast menu features a variety of breakfast sandwiches such as the Breakfast Baconator and sides such as seasoned potatoes. 
 
 Free-standing Wendy s restaurants generally include a pick-up window in addition to a dining room. In 2020, 2021 and 2022 pick-up window sales represented approximately 83 , 82 and 77 of sales at Company-operated restaurants, respectively. 
 
 Wendy s strives to maintain quality and uniformity throughout all restaurants by publishing detailed specifications for food products, preparation and service, continual in-service training of employees, restaurant operational audits and field visits from Wendy s supervisors. In the case of franchisees, field visits are made by Wendy s personnel who review restaurant operations, including quality, service and cleanliness, and make recommendations to assist in compliance with Wendy s specifications. 
 
 Supply Chain, Distribution and Purchasing 
 
 As of January 1, 2023 , three independent processors (five total production facilities) supplied all of the beef used by Wendy s restaurants in the U.S. In addition, seven independent processors (14 total production facilities) supplied all of the chicken used by Wendy s restaurants in the U.S. In addition, there was one main in-line distributor of food, packaging and beverage products, excluding breads, that serviced approximately 67 of Wendy s restaurants in the U.S. and four additional in-line distributors that, in the aggregate, serviced approximately 32 of Wendy s restaurants in the U.S. Except as discussed below, Wendy s and its franchisees have not experienced any material shortages of food, equipment, fixtures or other products that are necessary to maintain restaurant operations, and Wendy s anticipates no such shortages of products and believes that alternate suppliers and distribution sources are available. During 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to interruptions in the delivery of beef and other products and, as a result, some menu items were occasionally in short supply at some Wendy s system restaurants. While we and our supply chain partners effectively managed through this disruption, there can be no assurances that we will not see similar disruptions in the future. Suppliers and distributors to the Wendy s system must comply with U.S. Department of Agriculture USDA and U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA regulations governing the manufacture, packaging, storage, distribution and sale of all food and packaging products. 
 
 7 

Wendy s has a purchasing co-op relationship structure with its franchisees that establishes Quality Supply Chain Co-op, Inc. QSCC ). QSCC manages, for the Wendy s system in the U.S. and Canada, contracts for the purchase and distribution of food, proprietary paper, operating supplies and equipment under national agreements with pricing based upon total system volume. QSCC s supply chain management facilitates the continuity of supply and provides consolidated purchasing efficiencies while monitoring and seeking to minimize possible obsolete inventory throughout the Wendy s supply chain in the U.S. and Canada. Wendy s and its franchisees pay sourcing fees to third-party vendors on certain products sourced by QSCC. Such sourcing fees are remitted by these vendors to QSCC and are the primary means of funding QSCC s operations. Should QSCC s sourcing fees exceed its expected needs, QSCC s board of directors may return some or all of the excess to its members in the form of a patronage dividend. 
 
 Wendy s does not sell food or restaurant supplies to its franchisees. 
 
 Quality Assurance 
 
 Wendy s quality assurance program is designed to verify that the food products supplied to our restaurants are processed in a safe, sanitary environment and in compliance with our food safety and quality standards. Wendy s quality assurance personnel regularly conduct sanitation and production audits for all of our core menu product processing facilities, which include beef, chicken, egg, pork, buns, french fries, Frosty dessert ingredients and produce. Animal welfare audits are also conducted at all beef, chicken and pork facilities to confirm compliance with our required animal welfare and handling policies and procedures. In addition to our facility audit program, weekly samples of beef, chicken and other core menu products from our distribution centers are randomly sampled and analyzed by a third-party laboratory to test conformance to our quality specifications. Wendy s representatives, including third-party auditors, regularly conduct evaluations and inspections of all Company-operated and franchised restaurants to test conformance to our sanitation, food safety and operational requirements. In addition, restaurant crew and managers at Company-operated and franchised restaurants are re-certified each year on critical food safety standards. Wendy s has the right to terminate franchise agreements if franchisees fail to comply with quality standards. 
 
 Information Technology 
 
 Wendy s relies on computer systems and information technology to conduct its business. Wendy s utilizes both commercially available third-party software and proprietary software owned by the Company to run the point-of-sale and kitchen delivery functions and certain other consumer-facing and back-office functions in Wendy s restaurants. Wendy s has invested significant resources to focus on consumer-facing technology, including installing a single point-of-sale system for Wendy s restaurants, activating mobile ordering via Wendy s mobile apps, launching the Wendy s Rewards loyalty program and establishing delivery arrangements with third-party vendors for Wendy s U.S. and Canadian restaurants. We believe our digital platforms are critical to creating a more seamless user experience, providing insights to enhance our relationship with customers and meeting consumer demand for customization, speed and convenience. In December 2019, we implemented a plan to realign and reinvest resources in our IT organization to strengthen our ability to accelerate growth. We are partnering with a third-party global IT consultant on this new structure to leverage their global capabilities and enable a more seamless integration between our digital and corporate IT assets. In October 2021, we announced a partnership with a third-party global cloud provider with the intention to enhance our restaurant experience and unlock new customer, restaurant and employee experiences through data-driven insights. 
 
 Trademarks and Service Marks 
 
 Wendy s or its subsidiaries have registered certain trademarks and service marks in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and in international jurisdictions, some of which include Wendy s , Quality Is Our Recipe and the Wendy Cameo design. Wendy s believes that these and other related marks are of material importance to its business. Domestic trademarks and service marks have their next required maintenance filings at various times from 2023 to 2033 in order to keep such registrations in force, while international trademarks and service marks have various durations of seven to 15 years. Wendy s generally intends to maintain and renew its trademarks and service mark registrations in accordance with applicable deadlines. 
 
 Wendy s entered into an Assignment of Rights Agreement with the Company s founder, Dave Thomas, and his wife dated as of November 5, 2000 (the Assignment ). Wendy s had used Mr. Thomas, who was Senior Chairman of the Board until his death on January 8, 2002, as a spokesperson and focal point for its products and services for many years. With the efforts and attributes of Mr. Thomas, Wendy s has, through its extensive investment in the advertising and promotional use of Mr. Thomas name, likeness, image, voice, caricature, endorsement rights and photographs (the Thomas Persona ), made the Thomas Persona well known in the U.S. and throughout North America and a valuable asset for both Wendy s and Mr. 
 8 

Thomas estate. Under the terms of the Assignment, Wendy s acquired the entire right, title, interest and ownership in and to the Thomas Persona, including the sole and exclusive right to commercially use the Thomas Persona. 
 
 Research and Development 
 
 New product development is important to the Wendy s system. The Company believes that the development and testing of new and improved products is critical to increasing sales, attracting new customers and differentiating the Wendy s brand from competitors. The Company maintains a state-of-the-art research and development facility that includes a sensory lab, analytical labs, culinary kitchens and a Wendy s test kitchen. The Company employs a variety of professionals from the culinary and food science disciplines to bring new and improved products to market. 
 
 Seasonality 
 
 Wendy s restaurant operations are moderately seasonal. Wendy s average restaurant sales are normally higher during the summer months than during the winter months. Because our business is moderately seasonal, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for any other quarter or for the full fiscal year. 
 
 Competition 
 
 Each Wendy s restaurant is in competition with other food service operations within the same geographical area. The quick-service restaurant segment is highly competitive and includes well-established competitors. Wendy s competes with other restaurant companies and food outlets, primarily through the quality, variety, convenience, price and value perception of food and beverage products offered. The number and location of restaurants, quality and speed of service, attractiveness of facilities, effectiveness of marketing and new product development by Wendy s and its competitors are also important factors. The price charged for each menu item may vary from market to market (and within markets) depending on competitive pricing and the local cost structure. Wendy s competes within the food service industry and the quick-service restaurant sector for customers as well as for personnel, suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees. 
 
 Wendy s competitive position is differentiated by a focus on high quality, craveable food, its made-to-order square hamburgers using fresh, never frozen ground beef , its unique and diverse menu, including chicken sandwiches, freshly-prepared salads and other signature items like chili, baked potatoes and the Frosty dessert, its promotional products, its choice of toppings and condiments and the atmosphere and d cor of its restaurants. Fresh beef available in the contiguous U.S., Alaska and Canada.) Wendy s continues to implement its Image Activation program, which includes reimaging existing Wendy s restaurants and building new Wendy s restaurants with innovative exterior and interior restaurant designs, with plans for a significant number of new and reimaged restaurants in 2023 and beyond. The Image Activation program also differentiates the Company from its competitors by its emphasis on selection and performance of restaurant employees that provide friendly and engaged customer service in Wendy s restaurants. 
 
 Many of the leading restaurant chains continue to focus on new restaurant development as one strategy to increase market share through increased consumer awareness and convenience. This results in increased competition for available development sites and higher development costs for those sites. Competitors also employ marketing strategies such as frequent use of price discounting, frequent promotions and heavy advertising expenditures. Continued price discounting, including the use of coupons and offers, in the quick-service restaurant industry and the emphasis on value menus could have an adverse impact on Wendy s business. 
 
 Other restaurant chains have also competed by offering high quality sandwiches made with fresh ingredients and artisan breads, and there are several emerging restaurant chains featuring high quality food served at in-line locations. Several chains have also sought to compete by targeting certain consumer groups, such as capitalizing on trends toward certain types of diets or dietary preferences (e.g., plant-based food, alternative proteins, low carbohydrate, low trans-fat, gluten free or antibiotic free) by offering menu items that are promoted as being consistent with such diets. 
 
 Additional competitive pressures for prepared food purchases come from operators outside the restaurant industry. A number of major grocery chains offer fresh deli sandwiches and fully prepared food and meals to go as part of their deli sections. Some of these chains also have in-store cafes with service counters and tables where consumers can order and consume a full menu of items prepared especially for that portion of the operation. Additionally, convenience stores and retail outlets at gas stations frequently offer a wide variety of sandwiches and other foods. 
 
 9 

Wendy s also competes with grocery chains, food delivery providers and other retail outlets that sell food to be prepared at home. Competition with these chains, providers and other outlets could increase based on the gap between the price of food prepared at home compared to the price of food purchased at restaurants. 
 
 Technology and delivery are becoming increasingly critical parts of the restaurant consumer experience. In the quick-service restaurant category, technology initiatives include mobile interactive technology for brand and menu search information, mobile ordering, mobile payment, mobile offers, mobile order pick-up and carryout, customer loyalty and rewards programs and other self-service technologies. An increasing number of restaurant chains have also introduced or expanded their restaurant delivery arrangements as another strategy to increase market share. If our technology initiatives, digital commerce platforms or third-party delivery providers do not meet customers expectations in terms of security, speed, cost, attractiveness or ease of use, customers may be less inclined to use those platforms or providers and our competitive position could be adversely impacted. 
 
 System Optimization 
 
 The Company s system optimization initiative included a shift from Company-operated restaurants to franchised restaurants over time, through acquisitions and dispositions, as well as by facilitating Franchise Flips. During 2016, the Company completed the sale of 310 Company-operated restaurants to franchisees, which resulted in the achievement of its plan to reduce its ongoing Company-operated restaurant ownership to approximately 5 of the total Wendy s system. 
 
 While the Company has no plans to move its ownership away from approximately 5 of the Wendy s system, it expects to continue to optimize the Wendy s system by facilitating Franchise Flips, as well as evaluating strategic acquisitions of franchised restaurants and strategic dispositions of Company-operated restaurants to existing and new franchisees, to further strengthen the franchisee base, drive new restaurant development and accelerate adoption of Wendy s Image Activation program. Wendy s generally retains a right of first refusal in connection with any proposed sale or transfer of franchised restaurants. 
 
 The table below shows the number of restaurant acquisitions, restaurant dispositions and Franchise Flips completed in each of 2022, 2021 and 2020.

 Franchising 
 
 As of January 1, 2023, 217 Wendy s U.S. franchisees operated 5,591 franchised restaurants in 50 states and the District of Columbia, and 106 Wendy s international franchisees operated 1,089 franchised restaurants in 31 foreign countries and U.S. territories. 
 
 U.S. Franchise Arrangements 
 
 The rights and obligations governing the majority of franchised restaurants operating in the U.S. are set forth in the Wendy s current Unit Franchise Agreement (the Current Franchise Agreement (non-traditional locations, including delivery kitchens, may operate under an amended agreement or alternate form of agreement). This agreement provides the franchisee the right to construct, own and operate a Wendy s restaurant upon a site accepted by Wendy s and to use the Wendy s system in connection with the operation of the restaurant at that site. The Current Franchise Agreement provides for a 20-year term and a 10-year renewal subject to certain conditions. The initial term may be extended up to 25 years and the renewal extended up to 20 or 25 years for qualifying restaurants under the new restaurant development incentive and reimage programs described below in Franchise Development and Other Relationships. Wendy s has in the past franchised under different agreements on a multi-unit basis; however, Wendy s now grants new Wendy s franchises on a unit-by-unit basis. 
 10 

The Current Franchise Agreement requires that the franchisee pay a monthly royalty of 4.0 of sales, as defined in the agreement, from the operation of the restaurant. The agreement also typically requires that the franchisee pay Wendy s an initial technical assistance fee. In the U.S., the standard technical assistance fee required under a newly executed Current Franchise Agreement is currently 50,000 for each new restaurant opened. 
 
 The technical assistance fee is used to defray some of the costs to Wendy s for training, start-up and transitional services related to new and existing franchisees acquiring Company-operated restaurants and in the development and opening of new restaurants. In certain limited instances (such as a reduced franchise agreement term, development incentive programs or other unique circumstances), Wendy s may charge a reduced technical assistance fee or may waive the technical assistance fee. Wendy s does not select or employ personnel on behalf of franchisees. 
 
 International Franchise Arrangements 
 
 Wendy s Restaurants of Canada Inc. WROC ), a 100 owned subsidiary of Wendy s, holds master franchise rights for Canada. The rights and obligations governing the majority of franchised restaurants operating in Canada are set forth in a Single Unit Sub-Franchise Agreement (the Single Unit Sub-Franchise Agreement (non-traditional locations, including delivery kitchens, may operate under an amended agreement or alternate form of agreement). This document provides the franchisee the right to construct, own and operate a Wendy s restaurant upon a site accepted by WROC and to use the Wendy s system in connection with the operation of the restaurant at that site. The Single Unit Sub-Franchise Agreement provides for a 20-year term and a ten-year renewal subject to certain conditions. The sub-franchisee pays to WROC a monthly royalty of 4.0 of sales, as defined in the agreement, from the operation of the restaurant. The agreement also typically requires that the franchisee pay WROC an initial technical assistance fee. The standard technical assistance fee is currently C 50,000 for each new restaurant opened. 
 
 Franchisees who wish to operate Wendy s restaurants outside of the U.S. and Canada enter into franchise or license agreements with Wendy s that generally provide franchise rights for each restaurant for an initial term of ten years or 20 years, depending on the country, and typically include a ten-year renewal provision, subject to certain conditions. The agreements grant a license to the franchisee to use the Wendy s trademarks and know-how in the operation of a Wendy s restaurant at a specified location. Generally, the franchisee pays Wendy s an initial technical assistance fee or other per restaurant fee and monthly fees based on a percentage of gross monthly sales of each restaurant. In certain foreign markets, Wendy s may grant the franchisee exclusivity to develop a territory in exchange for the franchisee undertaking to develop a specified number of new Wendy s restaurants in the territory based on a negotiated schedule. In these instances, the franchisee generally pays Wendy s an upfront development fee, annual development fees or a per restaurant development fee. In certain circumstances, Wendy s may charge an upfront development fee for a non-exclusive territory, which is proportionate to a multi-unit development commitment. Wendy s may also grant a franchisee the right to sub-franchise in a stated territory, subject to certain conditions. 
 
 Non-Traditional Development 
 
 Non-traditional locations, such as fuel and transportation centers, food courts and other retail locations, military bases and delivery kitchens, represent a component of Wendy s development strategy. These non-traditional locations may be subject to different rights and obligations than our traditional franchise arrangements, including with respect to initial and renewal franchise terms, technical assistance fees, monthly royalty rates and advertising contribution rates, and the sales levels at these locations may also differ from sales levels at traditional Wendy s restaurants. 
 
 Franchise Development and Other Relationships 
 
 In addition to its franchise and license agreements, Wendy s also enters into development and/or relationship agreements with certain franchisees. The development agreement provides the franchisee with the right to develop a specified number of new Wendy s restaurants using the Image Activation program design within a stated, non-exclusive territory for a specified period, subject to the franchisee meeting interim new restaurant development requirements. The relationship agreement addresses other aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship, such as restrictions on operating competing restaurants, participation in brand initiatives such as the Image Activation program, employment of approved operators, confidentiality and restrictions on engaging in sale/leaseback or debt refinancing transactions without Wendy s prior consent. 
 
 To promote new restaurant development, Wendy s has provided franchisees with certain incentive programs for qualifying new restaurants . In February 2023, Wendy s announced a new restaurant development incentive program in the U.S. and 
 11 

Canada that provides for waivers of royalty, national advertising and technical assistance fees for up to the first three years of operation for qualifying new restaurants Pacesetter ). Wendy s previously offered and will continue to offer a restaurant development incentive program that provides for reductions in royalty and national advertising fees for up to the first two years of operation for qualifying new restaurants Groundbreaker ). Wendy s U.S. and Canadian franchisees may elect either the Pacesetter program or the Groundbreaker program when committing to new multi-unit development agreements or adding incremental commitments to existing development agreements. Wendy s also provides franchisees with the option of an early 20-year or 25-year renewal of their franchise agreement upon completion of reimaging utilizing certain approved Image Activation reimage designs. 
 
 Franchised restaurants are required to be operated under uniform operating standards and specifications relating to the selection, quality and preparation of menu items, signage, decor, equipment, uniforms, suppliers, maintenance and cleanliness of premises and customer service. Wendy s monitors franchisee operations and inspects restaurants periodically to ensure that required practices and procedures are being followed. See The Wendy s Restaurant System Quality Assurance above for additional information. 
 
 See Note 7 and Note 22 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in Item 8 herein, and the information under Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations herein, for information regarding certain guarantee obligations, reserves, commitments and contingencies involving franchisees. 
 
 Advertising and Marketing 
 
 In the U.S. and Canada, Wendy s advertises nationally through national advertising funds primarily on network and cable television programs, including nationally televised events, as well as through audio and digital media, and advertises locally primarily through regional network and cable television, audio and digital media and out-of-home media, such as billboards. Wendy s maintains two national advertising funds established to collect and administer funds contributed for use in advertising through television, radio, the Internet and a variety of promotional campaigns, including through digital and social media platforms. Separate national advertising funds are administered for Wendy s U.S. and Canadian restaurant locations. Contributions to the national advertising funds are required to be made by both Company-operated and franchised restaurants and are based on a percentage of restaurant sales. In addition to the contributions to the national advertising funds, Wendy s requires additional contributions to be made for both Company-operated and franchised restaurants based on a percentage of restaurant sales for the purpose of local and regional advertising programs. Required franchisee contributions to the national advertising funds and for local and regional advertising programs are governed by the Current Franchise Agreement in the U.S. and by the Single Unit Sub-Franchise Agreement in Canada. Required contributions by Company-operated restaurants for advertising and promotional programs are at the same percentage of sales as franchised restaurants within the Wendy s system. As of January 1, 2023, the contribution rate for U.S. restaurants was generally 3.5 of sales for national advertising and 0.5 of sales for local and regional advertising. As of January 1, 2023, the contribution rate for Canadian restaurants was generally 3.0 of sales for national advertising and 1.0 of sales for local and regional advertising, with the exception of Quebec, for which there is no national advertising contribution rate and the local and regional advertising contribution rate is 4.0 of sales. Non-traditional locations, including delivery kitchens, may be subject to adjusted requirements for national, local and regional advertising contributions. See Note 25 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in Item 8 herein for additional information regarding advertising. 
 
 Human Capital 
 
 At Wendy s, our vision is to become the world s most thriving and beloved restaurant brand, and every day we strive to live our purpose of creating joy and opportunity through food, family and community. Our restaurants, our food and the value and service we provide to our customers are all integral to our long-term success, but ultimately it is our people that help us deliver our brand promise of Fast Food Done Right every single day. 
 
 We continue to invest in employees to ensure we are able to attract, hire and retain great talent throughout our organization. We measure our effectiveness in these areas using various tools and metrics, including administering employee engagement surveys annually and tracking our employee turnover rates compared to others in the restaurant industry. 
 
 Employees 
 
 As of January 1, 2023, the Company was comprised of approximately 14,500 employees, of which approximately one-third were full-time, and two-thirds were part-time. The vast majority of our employees are located in the U.S. and work in our Company-operated restaurants within our Wendy s U.S. business segment. Outside of our Company-operated restaurants, our 
 12 

largest population of employees work in our restaurant support organization, which includes employees across the globe and at our restaurant support center in Dublin, Ohio. We are proud to have a workforce with diverse backgrounds and experiences. 
 
 Respectful Workplace 
 
 From day one, the Wendy s business has always been of, for and about people. Respect and fair treatment for our team members, franchisees, supplier partners and vendors are a central part of our business. So is staying true to the values established by our founder Dave Thomas more than 50 years ago, which include Doing the Right Thing, Treating People with Respect and Giving Something Back. Our commitment to these values is reflected in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which applies to Company employees and directors, and in our Supplier Code of Conduct, which sets forth our expectations for key suppliers to the Wendy s system in the U.S. and Canada. We strive to bring our values to life through daily interactions with our team members, franchisees and customers and in the communities where we do business. We expect our employees to maintain respectful workplaces that support and protect the integrity of the Wendy s brand and fuel our continued success. 
 
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
 
 We believe our strategic focus on diversity, equity and inclusion DE I has helped, and will continue to help, the Company remain true to our values as well as support our financial performance and global growth strategy. Creating and fostering inclusive work environments allows us to create an engaging and welcoming culture for our employees, which we believe positively affects the quality of products, service and experience we deliver to our customers. Through the leadership and support of our Office of DE I, we continue to make meaningful progress against all of our goals, including increasing the diversity of representation among Company leadership and management and attracting new, diverse franchisees into our system. 
 
 We are fortunate to have several thriving Employee Resource Groups ERGs ), which are voluntary employee-led groups, each sponsored by a Wendy s senior leadership team member. Our ERGs serve an important role in support of our DE I strategy, creating forums for learning and inclusion, providing opportunities to celebrate different backgrounds, empowering employees to bring their authentic self to work, and creating leadership and professional development opportunities. Our ERGs focus on employees and allies who identify as Women (W omen of Wendy s), LGBTQ+ (WeQual), Military Veterans Families (WeVets), Culturally Diverse (WCD), Black (WeBERG) and Young Professionals (WenGEN). In 2022, we added our newest ERG, GiveCare, with a focus on caretakers for children, siblings, parents, partners and other family members. 
 
 Compensation and Benefits 
 
 We are committed to providing market-competitive pay and benefits to attract and retain great talent. We enable this by benchmarking and analyzing pay and benefits both externally and internally. In addition to receiving competitive hourly rates and base salaries, all general managers and district managers of our Company-operated restaurants are eligible for performance-based cash incentive bonuses. Restaurant support service employees are also eligible to participate in a performance-based annual bonus plan. For our restaurant-level employees, we offer the potential for raises based on individual performance reviews throughout the year. At Wendy s, we are committed to providing pay equity for all employees, regardless of gender or ethnicity. 
 
 We also offer a robust set of benefits to help eligible employees and their families stay healthy, manage spend related to health and financial well-being and effectively balance work and life. For our U.S. employees, this includes offerings such as insurance for medical, dental, vision and prescription drugs, telehealth access, 401(k) savings and retirement plans, health savings accounts, employee assistance program, paid sick leave, bonding leave and adoption assistance. 
 
 Safety and Well-Being 
 
 We are committed to providing our employees with safe and comfortable work environments and offering resources that our employees can use to help promote their well-being. We are extremely proud of the work our employees have done to support our restaurants, employees, customers and communities that we serve throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. As the Company and our communities have transitioned from pandemic crisis intervention to ongoing prevention and protection, we remain committed to continuing to do our part to support the well-being of each other, our customers and our workplaces. 
 
 13 

We remain focused on our high standards of quality and cleanliness at our restaurants through processes like reviewing cleaning procedures, maintaining an adequate supply of cleaning products and conducting our annual food safety recertification for our restaurant crew and managers. We also recognize that the well-being of our employees goes beyond work and our work environments. We offer several ben efits to support the health and well-being of our employees, including our employee assistance program (EAP), available at no cost to all Company Employees and their household members, as well as other training and resources related to overall health and well-being. 
 
 Talent Development 
 
 To set our employees up for success and help them achieve their personal development needs and career growth, we invest in training and development programs at all levels within the Company. We also leverage annual processes that support individual performance planning, individual professional development planning and a broad review of talent development throughout the Company. Restaurant-level employees have the opportunity to take advantage of an extensive online learning curriculum, as well as hands-on training led by crew trainers, managers and field support staff. Restaurant managers and multi-unit operators participate in Wendy s University, which includes targeted training to develop management and leadership skills. Wendy s University also provides targeted programming for corporate management staff, including diversity training, people manager training, leadership dialogues and the opportunity to participate in third-party conferences and training. In 2022, we launched a new leadership development program (WeLead), facilitating a six-month program designed to build a performance-driven culture and develop talent across our organization. 
 
 Community-Based Giving 
 
 Wendy s maintains a charitable giving program that supports four core categories: (1) foster care adoption; (2) hunger and food integrity; (3) youth and families; and (4) vibrant communities. In 2022, Wendy s made charitable donations to a variety of organizations across the globe, highlighted by our continued support of the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption, a charitable foundation created by our founder, Dave Thomas, which has been our signature charitable cause for more than 25 years. In addition to corporate contributions, we also host an employee-driven Community Giving Program, in which employees from across the Wendy s system nominate worthy charitable organizations to receive charitable grants from The Wendy s Foundation. We also made grants available to charitable organizations chosen by each of our ERGs in support of their missions.

The contents of our website and these additional information sources are not incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K or any other report or document we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 
 Governmental Regulations 
 
 U.S. Operations 
 
 The Company and our franchisees are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting the operation of our respective businesses, including laws and regulations relating to building and zoning, health, fire and safety, sanitation, food preparation, nutritional content and menu labeling, advertising, information security and privacy and consumer protection. Each Wendy s restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities in the state and/or municipality in which the restaurant is located. The Company is also subject to federal, state and local laws governing labor and employment matters, including minimum wage requirements, overtime and other working conditions, family leave and health care mandates, union organizing, work authorization requirements, insurance and workers compensation rules and anti-discrimination and anti-harassment laws applicable to Company employees, and our franchisees are subject to labor and employment laws with respect to their employees. Additionally, the Company and our franchisees are subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act and other similar laws that provide civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of public accommodations and other areas. 
 
 The Company s franchising activities are subject to the rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. The FTC requires that franchisors furnish a franchise disclosure document FDD containing certain information to prospective franchisees before the execution of a franchise agreement. Several states require registration and disclosure of the FDD in connection with franchise offers and sales and have laws regulating the franchisor-franchisee relationship. These state laws often limit, among other things, the duration and scope of non-competition provisions and the ability of franchisors to terminate franchise agreements or withhold consent to the 
 14 

renewal or transfer of franchise agreements. The Company believes that our FDD, together with applicable state versions or supplements, and franchising procedures comply in all material respects with the FTC s franchise rules and applicable state franchise laws. 
 International Operations 
 
 Internationally, the Company and our franchisees are subject to national, provincial and local laws and regulations that often are similar to those impacting us and our franchisees in the U.S., including laws and regulations concerning franchises, labor and employment, building and zoning, health, fire and safety, sanitation, food preparation, nutritional content, menu labeling, advertising, information security, privacy and consumer protection. Wendy s restaurants outside the U.S. are also often subject to tariffs and regulations on imported commodities and equipment and laws regulating foreign investment, as well as anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws. The Company believes that our international franchise disclosure documents and franchising procedures comply in all material respects with the laws of the applicable countries. 
 
 Environmental Matters 
 
 The Company s operations, including the selection and development of properties that we own, lease and/or sublease to franchisees, and any construction or improvements made at those properties, are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations concerning the storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances. Our properties are sometimes located in developed commercial or industrial areas and might previously have been occupied by more environmentally significant operations, such as gas stations. Environmental laws and regulations sometimes require owners or operators of contaminated property to remediate that property, regardless of fault, and could give rise to significant fines, penalties and liabilities, as well as third-party claims. The Company believes that our restaurant operations comply substantially with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. 
 
 Increased focus by governmental authorities on environmental matters is likely to lead to new governmental initiatives, particularly in the area of climate change. While we cannot predict the precise nature of these initiatives, we expect that they may impact our business both directly and indirectly. There is a possibility that government initiatives, or actual or perceived effects of changes in weather patterns, climate change or scarcity of energy and water resources, could have a direct impact on our business in ways that we cannot predict at this time. 
 
 Legal Matters 
 
 The Company is involved in litigation and claims incidental to our business. We provide accruals for such litigation and claims when we determine it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. We believe we have adequate accruals for all of our legal and environmental matters. See Item 3 Legal Proceedings for additional information. 
 
 The Company does not believe that compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations, or the outcome of any legal matters in which we are involved, will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. However, the Company cannot predict what laws or regulations will be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted or whether any legal matters in which we are involved could result in greater liabilities than we currently anticipate. See Item 1A Risk Factors for a discussion of certain risks relating to legal and regulatory requirements, litigation and claims and related matters affecting our business.

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 We wish to caution readers that in addition to the important factors described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, we have included below certain material factors that have affected, or in the future could affect, our actual results and could cause our actual consolidated results during fiscal 2023, and beyond, to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. 
 
 Risks Related to Macroeconomic and Industry Conditions 
 
 Competition from other restaurant companies, as well as grocery chains and other retail food outlets, or poor customer experience at Wendy s restaurants, could hurt our brand. 
 
 The market segments in which Wendy s restaurants compete are highly competitive with respect to, among other things, price, food quality and presentation, service, location, convenience and the nature and condition of the restaurant facility. If customers have a poor experience at a Wendy s restaurant, whether at a Company-operated or franchised restaurant, we may experience a decrease in customer counts. Further, Wendy s restaurants compete with a variety of locally owned restaurants, as well as competitive regional, national and global restaurant chains. Several of these chains compete by offering menu items that are targeted at certain consumer groups or dietary trends. Additionally, many of our competitors have introduced lower cost value meal menu options and have employed marketing strategies that include frequent use of price discounting (including through the use of coupons and other offers), frequent promotions and heavy advertising expenditures. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do, which may allow them to react to changes in pricing and marketing strategies better than we can and drive higher levels of brand awareness among consumers. This product and price competition could result in reduced revenues and loss of market share. 
 
 Moreover, new companies, including operators outside the quick-service restaurant industry, may enter market areas in which Wendy s restaurants operate and target our customer base. For example, additional competitive pressures for prepared food purchases have come from deli sections and in-store cafes of a number of major grocery store chains, as well as from convenience stores, casual dining outlets and food delivery providers. Such competitors may have, among other things, lower operating costs, better locations, better facilities, more effective marketing and more efficient operations. Wendy s also competes with grocery chains and other retail outlets or concepts that sell food to be prepared at home. Competition with these chains and other outlets could increase based on the gap between the price of food prepared at home compared to the price of food purchased at restaurants. This increased product and price competition could put deflationary pressure on the selling price of products offered at Wendy s restaurants. All such competition may adversely affect our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Adverse economic conditions or disruptions in the national and global economies, or in regions that have a high concentration of Wendy s restaurants, could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Adverse economic conditions or disruptions in the national and global economies could result in higher unemployment rates, labor shortages, increases in inflation and interest rates and declines in consumer confidence and spending. If such disruptions occur, they may result in significant declines in consumer food-away-from-home spending and customer counts in Wendy s restaurants. There can be no assurance that government responses to economic disruptions will restore consumer confidence. Ongoing disruptions in the national and global economies may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, adverse economic conditions in regions that contain a high concentration of Wendy s restaurants, including markets in which Company-operated restaurants are located, could also have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 
 
 Changes in discretionary consumer spending, and in consumer tastes and preferences, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 The success of the Wendy s system depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending, which is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income. Material declines in the amount of discretionary spending or consumer food-away-from-home spending could hurt our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, significant increases in expenses incurred by consumers, such as living expenses or gasoline prices, could also adversely affect our business. Our success also depends to a large extent on continued consumer acceptance of our offerings, the success of our operating, promotional, marketing and new product development initiatives and the reputation of our brand. If we are unable to continue to achieve consumer acceptance or adapt to changes in consumer preferences, including 
 16 

with respect to nutrition, health or dietary trends or environmental or social concerns, Wendy s restaurants may lose customers, and the resulting revenues from Company-operated restaurants and the royalties that we receive from franchisees may decline. 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and could continue to disrupt our business, which has materially affected and could continue to materially affect our results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic and related protective measures have adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our business. During the height of the pandemic, our customer counts and systemwide sales were significantly negatively impacted. Even as mobility increases, customers have been and may continue to be reluctant to return to in-restaurant dining. Our restaurant operations have been and could continue to be disrupted by the pandemic, including restaurant and dining room closures, labor shortages or increased labor costs. Furthermore, the pandemic has led, and could again lead, to interruptions in the delivery of food or other supplies to Wendy s restaurants arising from delays or restrictions on shipping or manufacturing, labor shortages and increased labor costs, closures of supplier or distributor facilities or financial distress of suppliers or distributors. These delays or interruptions have impacted, and could continue to impact, the availability of certain food items at Wendy s restaurants, including beef, chicken, pork and other core menu products. Our results of operations and those of our franchisees could be adversely affected if our key suppliers or distributors are unable to fulfill their responsibilities and we are unable to timely identify and transition the impacted business to alternative suppliers or distributors. The pandemic has had, and could again have, an adverse effect on new restaurant development, as well as on our franchisees operations and financial condition. To the extent the pandemic causes development delays, or leads to the financial distress of our franchisees, our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be impacted. Such risks and other potential impacts from the pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources, which may impede our ability to comply with our debt covenants or access additional capital. In addition to the risks described above, the pandemic has had, and could continue to have, the effect of heightening other risks disclosed in this risk factors section, including, but not limited to, those related to brand value and perception, consumer preferences and spending, our ability to achieve or maintain market share, new restaurant development, commodity costs, labor, supply chain and purchasing and international operations. We cannot predict the ultimate duration, scope or severity of the pandemic or its ultimate impact on our results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 
 
 Risks Related to Brand Perception and Value 
 
 Our success depends substantially on our corporate reputation and on the value and perception of our brand. 
 
 Our success depends in large part upon our ability to maintain and enhance the value of our brand, our customers loyalty to our brand and a positive relationship with our franchisees and other business partners. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities. Business incidents, whether isolated or recurring, and whether originating from us, our franchisees or our business partners, can significantly reduce brand value and consumer trust, particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation. For example, our brand could be damaged by claims or perceptions about the quality or safety of our products or the quality or reputation of our franchisees or other business partners, regardless of whether such claims or perceptions are true. Our brand could also be adversely impacted by other incidents described in this risk factors section, including incidents related to customer service, health or safety, a failure to attract and retain qualified employees, food safety or other health concerns regarding our products, the impact of social media, data privacy violations, cyber incidents, environmental, social and governance matters or reports of our employees, franchisees or business partners taking controversial positions or acting in an unethical, illegal or socially irresponsible manner. Any such incidents could cause a decline in consumer confidence in our brand and reduce consumer demand for our products, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Our results of operations and the value and perception of our brand depend in part on the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising programs and the successful development and launch of new products. 
 
 Our results of operations and the value and perception of our brand are heavily influenced by brand marketing and advertising and by our ability to develop and launch new and innovative products. Our marketing and advertising programs may not be successful, or we may fail to develop commercially successful new products, which may impact our ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers, which, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and the value and perception of our brand. Moreover, because franchisees contribute to advertising funds based on a percentage of sales at their franchised restaurants, advertising fund expenditures are dependent upon sales volumes across the Wendy s system. If systemwide sales decline, this could result in a reduced amount of funds available for our marketing and advertising programs. In addition, to the extent we use value offerings or other promotions or discounts in our marketing and advertising 
 17 

programs to drive customer counts, these actions may condition our customers to resist higher menu prices or result in reduced demand for premium products. 
 
 Our inability or failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could adversely impact our brand, business and results of operations. 
 
 Social media platforms, including forms of internet-based communications, allow individuals access to a broad audience. The availability of information on social media platforms is virtually immediate and has given users the ability to more effectively organize collective actions such as boycotts and other brand-damaging behaviors. The dissemination of information via social media, whether accurate or inaccurate, could harm our business, brand, reputation, results of operation and financial condition. This damage may be immediate, without an opportunity to correct inaccurate information or respond to or address particular issues. In addition, as part of our marketing efforts, we frequently use social media to communicate with consumers in order to build their awareness of, engagement with and loyalty to our brand. Our failure to use social media effectively or appropriately, particularly as compared to our competitors, could lead to a decline in brand value, customer visits and revenues. Laws and regulations governing the use of social media continue to rapidly evolve. A failure by us, our employees, our franchisees or third parties acting on our behalf to abide by applicable laws and regulations in the use of social media could adversely impact our reputation, brand, results of operations and financial condition or subject us to litigation, fines or other penalties. Social media risks could also arise from employees not following defined policies for the use of social media during business operations, or actions taken by employees during personal activities outside of their employment, but which could still reflect negatively on the Wendy s brand. 
 
 We may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of our brand and hurt our business . 
 
 Our intellectual property is material to the conduct of our business. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brand and other intellectual property. The success of our business strategy depends, in part, on our continued ability to use our trademarks and service marks to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in existing and new markets. If our efforts to protect our intellectual property are not adequate, or if any third party misappropriates, infringes, dilutes or otherwise violates our intellectual property, the value of our brand may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. While we try to ensure that the quality of our brand is maintained by our franchisees, we cannot ensure that franchisees will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property or the reputation of the Wendy s brand or restaurant system. Any damage or violation of our intellectual property could harm our image, brand or competitive position and result in significant legal fees and the diversion of resources. If we do not attempt or are unable to successfully protect, maintain or enforce our intellectual property rights, there could be a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations as a result of, among other things, consumer confusion, dilution of the Wendy s brand or increased competition from unauthorized users of our brand. 
 
 We have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. Not all of the trademarks that are used in the Wendy s system have been registered in all of the countries in which we do business or may do business in the future, and some trademarks will never be registered in all of these countries. Some countries laws make unregistered trademarks more difficult to enforce, or do not protect them at all, and third parties have filed, or may in the future file, for Wendy s or similar marks. Accordingly, we may not be able to adequately protect the Wendy s brand everywhere in the world and use of the Wendy s brand may result in liability for trademark infringement, trademark dilution or unfair competition. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. We cannot ensure that all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the United States and foreign countries will be adequate. 
 
 We cannot ensure that third parties will not bring infringement claims against us in the future. Any such claim, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, cause delays in introducing new menu items, require costly modifications to advertising and promotional materials, harm our brand, image, competitive position or ability to expand our operations into other jurisdictions, cause us to incur significant costs related to defense or settlement or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. As a result, any such claim could harm our business and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, third parties may assert that certain of our intellectual property, or our rights therein, are invalid or unenforceable. If our rights in any of our intellectual property were found to infringe third-party rights, or portions thereof were deemed invalid or unenforceable, we may be forced to defend or resolve related claims and incur related expenses. In addition, such loss of rights could permit competing uses of such intellectual property which, in turn, could harm our business and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.

Food safety events or health concerns regarding our products could create negative publicity and adversely affect our brand, business and results of operations. 
 
 Food safety is a top priority for Wendy s, and we dedicate substantial resources to food safety matters to ensure our customers enjoy safe, quality food products. However, food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness (such as salmonella or E. coli), have occurred in the food industry in the past, and could occur in the future. For example, in August 2022, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the CDC began investigating a multistate outbreak of E. coli in which many of the impacted individuals reported having eaten at a Wendy s restaurant and most reported consuming sandwich romaine lettuce. The Company cooperated with the CDC s investigation and, as a precautionary measure, removed sandwich romaine lettuce from its restaurants in the relevant region. In October 2022, the CDC announced that the outbreak was over and that the specific source of the outbreak had not been confirmed. The Company was referenced in news stories related to the outbreak, and the Company (and others) have been named in various claims and lawsuits related to the outbreak. Food safety events, whether or not involving Wendy s restaurants or other restaurant companies, could adversely affect the price and availability of certain products and result in negative publicity for Wendy s or the restaurant industry. This negative publicity may reduce demand for Wendy s food and could result in a decrease in customer counts to Wendy s restaurants as consumers shift their preferences to our competitors or to other products or food types. Any report linking our restaurants or suppliers to food-borne illnesses, food tampering, contamination or mislabeling or other food-safety issues could damage the value of our brand immediately and severely hurt sales of our products and possibly lead to product liability claims, litigation (including class actions) or other damages. The Wendy s system may also be adversely impacted by consumer concerns regarding the nutritional aspects of the products we sell, the ingredients in our products or the cooking processes used in our restaurants. These or similar concerns could result in less demand for our products and a decline in sales at Company-operated restaurants and in royalties from sales at franchised restaurants. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Business Strategy 
 
 We may be unable to deliver accelerated global sales growth or achieve or maintain market share across our dayparts. 
 
 Our business strategy includes a focus on driving strong sales momentum across all of our dayparts through exciting menu innovation, compelling value offerings and operational excellence. However, we may be unable to deliver accelerated global sales growth or achieve or maintain market share across our dayparts due to competitive pressures and other factors, such as consumer tastes and preferences, the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising programs, the successful development and launch of new products, commodity and labor costs, providing fast and accurate customer experiences, further accelerating our digital business, driving new restaurant development and ensuring the support and engagement of franchisees. For example, Wendy s recently entered the breakfast daypart in the United States and Canada with a breakfast program designed to drive incremental sales and profits through a strong economic model. Our inability to successfully execute on our strategy for the breakfast daypart and reach targeted levels of sales and profits could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Our predominantly franchised business model presents a number of risks. 
 
 As of January 1, 2023, approximately 95 of restaurants in the Wendy s system were operated by franchisees. Wendy s franchisees are contractually obligated to operate their restaurants in accordance with the standards set forth in our franchise and other agreements with them. Wendy s also provides training and support to franchisees. However, franchisees are independent third parties that we do not control, and franchisees own, operate and oversee the daily operations of their restaurants. Specifically, franchisees are solely responsible for developing and utilizing their own policies and procedures, making their own hiring, firing and disciplinary decisions, scheduling hours and establishing wages and managing their day-to-day employment processes and procedures in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, all of which is done independent of Wendy s. Further, franchisees have discretion as to the prices charged to customers. As a result, the ultimate success and quality of any franchise restaurant rests with the franchisee. If franchisees do not successfully operate their restaurants in a manner consistent with required standards, their royalty payments to us could be adversely affected and our brand s image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn, could hurt our business and results of operations. In addition, the failure of franchisees to adequately engage in succession planning may adversely affect their restaurant operations and development of new Wendy s restaurants, which in turn could hurt our business and results of operations. 
 
 Wendy s franchisees are an integral part of our business, growth and brand strategies, and difficulties in identifying, attracting and retaining franchisees who meet our criteria could harm our business and brand. Our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if a significant number of franchisees do not participate in brand strategies, such as new restaurant development, Image Activation, marketing and menu programs and digital commerce platforms and technologies, 
 19 

which in turn may harm our business and financial condition. In addition, Wendy s current franchise model, and the way our brand strategies are executed across the system, may make it difficult for our brand to respond and adapt to the speed of change in technology, consumer preferences or other factors as quickly as may be required to maintain and grow market share and remain competitive. Certain of our competitors that have a significantly higher percentage of company-operated restaurants than we do may have greater influence over their respective restaurant systems and greater ability to implement operational initiatives and business strategies. 
 
 We receive revenues in the form of royalties and national advertising funds contributions (both of which are generally based on a percentage of sales at franchised restaurants), as well as rent and fees from franchisees. Accordingly, a substantial portion of our financial results is to a large extent dependent upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees. If sales trends or economic conditions worsen for franchisees, or if the overall business or financial health of franchisees deteriorates, their results of operations or financial condition may worsen and our royalty, national advertising funds, rent and other fee revenues may decline. Additionally, when Company-operated restaurants with leased real estate are sold to franchisees, we are often required to remain responsible for lease payments for these restaurants in the event the purchasing franchisees default on their leases. Similarly, when we lease or sublease properties to franchisees, we remain responsible for certain expenses related to the properties, such as lease payments and maintenance charges. If franchisees fail to renew their franchise agreements or fail to perform under or extend their leases or subleases with us, or if we are unable to identify, attract and retain new franchisees who meet our criteria, then our royalty and rental revenues may decrease and our future growth could be adversely affected. 
 
 The growth of our business is dependent on new restaurant openings, which could be affected by factors beyond our control. 
 
 Our business derives earnings from sales at Company-operated restaurants as well as royalties and other fees received from franchised restaurants. Growth in our revenues and earnings is dependent on new restaurant openings. Numerous factors beyond our control may adversely affect new restaurant openings, which in turn could hurt our business and results of operations. These factors include, among others: (i) our ability to attract new franchisees; (ii) the availability of site locations for new restaurants; (iii) the ability of restaurant owners to obtain financing; (iv) the ability of restaurant owners to attract, train and retain qualified operating personnel; (v) construction and development costs; (vi) the ability of restaurant owners to secure required governmental approvals and permits in a timely manner, or at all; (vii) the ability of us and our franchises to execute our development strategy for non-traditional restaurants, such as fuel and transportation centers, food courts and other retail locations, military bases and delivery kitchens; and (viii) adverse weather conditions. Our inability to identify suitable locations, achieve consumer acceptance or otherwise execute our development strategy could have an adverse impact on our future growth, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Our Image Activation program may not positively affect sales or improve our results of operations, and franchisees may not participate in our Image Activation program to the extent expected by us. 
 
 We continue to implement our Image Activation program, which includes reimaging existing Wendy s restaurants and building new Wendy s restaurants with innovative exterior and interior restaurant designs. Our Image Activation program may not positively affect sales at Wendy s restaurants or improve our results of operations. There can also be no assurance that franchisees will participate in the Image Activation program to the extent expected by the Company. In order to support our Image Activation program and promote new restaurant development, we have provided franchisees with certain incentive programs for qualifying new and reimaged restaurants, including waivers or reductions in royalty, national advertising and technical assistance fees and options for the early renewal of franchise agreements. It is possible we may provide additional financial incentives to franchisees, which could result in additional expenses, a reduction of royalties or other revenues or the incurrence of other costs or liabilities. Some franchisees may need to borrow funds in order to reimage existing restaurants or build new restaurants under the Image Activation program. If franchisees are unable to obtain financing at commercially reasonable rates, or at all, they may be unwilling or unable to invest in the reimaging of their existing restaurants or the development of new restaurants, and our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 
 We may be unable to manage effectively the acquisition and disposition of restaurants, or successfully implement other strategic initiatives, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial results. 
 
 We continue to optimize the Wendy s system through our system optimization initiative, which includes facilitating the transfer of restaurants between and among franchisees, as well as evaluating strategic acquisitions of franchised restaurants and strategic dispositions of Company-operated restaurants to existing and new franchisees, to further strengthen the franchisee base, drive new restaurant development and accelerate adoption of our Image Activation program. The success of this initiative 
 20 

is dependent upon many factors, such as the availability of sellers and buyers, the availability of financing, the ability to negotiate transactions on terms deemed acceptable and the ability to successfully transition and integrate restaurant operations. Acquisitions of franchised restaurants pose various risks to our operations, including (i) diversion of management s attention to the integration of acquired restaurant operations; (ii) increased operating expenses and the inability to achieve expected cost savings and operating efficiencies; (iii) exposure to liabilities arising out of prior operations of acquired restaurants; and (iv) the assumption of long-term, non-cancelable leases. Our system optimization initiative also places demands on our operational and financial management resources and may require us to expand these resources. If we are unable to execute our system optimization initiative or effectively manage the acquisition and disposition of restaurants, our business and financial results could be adversely affected. 
 
 In addition, Wendy s from time to time evaluates and may pursue other opportunities for growth, including through new and existing franchise partners, joint venture investments, expansion of our brand through other opportunities and strategic mergers, acquisitions and divestitures. These strategic initiatives involve various risks, including general transaction and business risk, integration and synergy risk, market acceptance risk and risks associated with the potential diversion of management s attention. Strategic transactions may not ultimately create value for us or our stockholders and may harm our reputation and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Our leasing and ownership of significant amounts of real estate exposes us to possible liabilities and losses, including liabilities associated with environmental matters. 
 
 We have significant real estate operations in connection with our business and are subject to the normal risks associated with owning, leasing and subleasing real estate. Our real estate values and the costs associated with our real estate operations are impacted by a variety of factors, including changes in the investment climate for real estate, macroeconomic trends, governmental regulations, infrastructure, condemnation or eminent domain, insurance, demographic trends, supply chain management, supply and demand for the ownership and operation of restaurants and environmental matters. A significant decrease in real estate values or increase in real estate costs could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 We are subject to federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling, release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances. These environmental laws provide for significant fines, penalties and liabilities, sometimes without regard to whether the owner, operator or occupant of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. Third parties may also make claims against owners, operators or occupants of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of or exposure to such substances. A number of our restaurant sites were formerly gas stations or are adjacent to current or former gas stations or were used for other commercial activities that can create environmental impacts. While we employ environmental review standards and practices in the current development of our real estate, we have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of all of our properties and we may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at our leased and owned properties, and any such liabilities identified in the future could cause us to incur significant costs, including costs associated with litigation, fines or clean-up responsibilities. We cannot predict the amount of future expenditures that may be required in order to comply with any environmental laws or regulations or to satisfy any such claims. 
 
 We generally secure long-term real estate interests for our leased restaurants and have limited flexibility to quickly alter our real estate portfolio. Many leases provide that the rent will increase over the term of the lease and any renewals of the term. Most leases require us to pay the costs of insurance, taxes, maintenance, utilities and capital repairs and replacements. We generally cannot cancel these leases prior to the expiration of their term. If an existing or future restaurant is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying rent, taxes and maintenance costs for the balance of the lease term. In addition, as our leases expire, we may fail to negotiate additional renewals or renewal options, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close restaurants in desirable locations, negatively impacting our results of operations. 
 
 Our international operations are subject to various risks and uncertainties and there is no assurance that our international operations will continue to be profitable. 
 
 In addition to many of the factors described in this risk factors section, our business outside of the United States is subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties, including international economic and political conditions, risk of corruption and violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws of other countries, the inability to adapt to differing cultures or consumer preferences, inadequate brand infrastructure to support our international activities, inability to obtain adequate supplies meeting our quality standards and product specifications or interruptions in obtaining such supplies, 
 21 

challenges and risks associated with managing and monitoring suppliers, restrictions on our ability to move cash out of certain foreign countries, currency regulations and fluctuations, diverse government regulations and tax systems, uncertain or differing interpretations of rights and obligations in connection with international franchise agreements, the collection of royalties and other fees from international franchisees, the inability to protect technology, data or intellectual property rights, compliance with international privacy and information security laws and regulations, the availability and cost of land, construction costs, other legal, financial or regulatory impediments to the development or operation of restaurants, the inability to identify, attract and retain experienced management, qualified franchisees and joint venture partners and ongoing disruptions and impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. Adverse conditions or unforeseen events in countries that contain a high concentration of Wendy s restaurants (including Canada, our largest international market), could have a material adverse impact on our international growth strategy and results of operations. In addition, to the extent we invest in international Company-operated restaurants or joint ventures, we would also have the risk of operating losses related to those restaurants, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that our international growth strategy will be successful or that our international operations will be profitable. 
 
 For example, Wendy s entered the United Kingdom in 2021, plans to expand into other anchor markets in Europe utilizing a franchise model and intends to accelerate restaurant development in other existing international markets. New and emerging markets may have lower brand awareness as well as competitive conditions, consumer tastes and preferences, discretionary spending patterns and social and cultural differences that are more difficult to predict or satisfy than our existing markets. We may need to make greater investments than we originally planned in advertising and promotional activity to build brand awareness, which could negatively impact the profitability of our operations. In addition, we may be unable to obtain desirable locations for new restaurants at reasonable prices, or at all, and restaurants may have higher construction, occupancy, food and labor costs than we currently anticipate. Any of these risks and uncertainties, and other factors we cannot anticipate, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Risks Related to Supply Chain and Labor 
 
 Changes in commodity costs and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 
 Our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs (including beef, chicken, pork, dairy and grains), supplies, fuel, utilities, distribution and other operating costs, including labor costs. Increases in commodity costs have adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact our results of operations. Our business is susceptible to increases in commodity and other operating costs as a result of various factors beyond our control, such as general economic conditions, inflation, industry demand, energy costs, food safety concerns, animal disease outbreaks, product recalls and government regulations. Increasing weather volatility or other long-term changes in weather patterns, including related to climate change, could have a significant impact on the price or availability of some of our ingredients. In addition, our supply chain is subject to increased costs arising from actual or perceived effects of climate change, greenhouse gas emissions and scarcity of energy and water resources. The ongoing and long-term costs of these impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business if not properly mitigated. We could also be adversely impacted by the cost of products raised or grown in accordance with our responsible sourcing criteria, including those related to environmental sustainability and animal welfare, as the availability of products that can be assured to meet those criteria are generally smaller and more concentrated, and may be more costly, than the markets for conventionally raised or grown products that are not assured to meet those criteria. We cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing commodity costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices, and a failure to do so could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, we may not seek to or be able to pass along price increases to our customers. If increased costs were passed to our customers, demand for our products may decrease, which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 
 Shortages or interruptions in the supply or distribution of perishable food products could damage our brand and adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 
 Wendy s and our franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of perishable food products that meet brand specifications. Shortages or interruptions in the supply of perishable food products caused by unanticipated demand, problems in production or distribution, labor shortages, disease or food-borne illnesses, political unrest, health epidemics or pandemics, inclement weather or other calamities or conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients, which could lower revenues, increase operating costs, damage brand reputation and otherwise harm our business and the businesses of our franchisees. Certain of the products sold in our restaurants, such as beef and chicken, are sourced from a limited number of suppliers, which may increase our reliance on those suppliers. In addition, our system relies on a limited number of in-line distributors to deliver certain food, packaging and beverage products to our restaurants. If a disruption of service from any of our key suppliers or distributors was to occur, we could experience short-term increases in our costs while 
 22 

supply and distribution channels were adjusted, and we may be unable to identify or negotiate with new suppliers or distributors on terms that are commercially reasonable to us. 
 
 We do not exercise ultimate control over purchasing for our restaurant system, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 While we require and seek to ensure that all suppliers to the Wendy s system meet certain quality control standards, our franchisees ultimately control the purchasing of food, proprietary paper, equipment and other operating supplies from third party suppliers through QSCC, Wendy s independent purchasing co-op. QSCC manages, for the Wendy s system in the United States and Canada, contracts for the purchase and distribution of food, proprietary paper, equipment and other operating supplies under national agreements with pricing based on total system volume. We do not control the decisions and activities of QSCC. If QSCC does not properly estimate the product needs of the Wendy s system, makes poor purchasing decisions or ceases its operations, or if our relationship with QSCC is terminated for any reason, system sales, operating costs and supply chain management could be adversely affected, which could harm us and our franchisees and have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Our business could be hurt by increased labor costs or labor shortages. 
 
 Labor is a primary component in the cost of operating our restaurants. We devote significant resources to recruiting and training our restaurant personnel, including managers and hourly employees. Increased labor costs due to competition, inflationary pressures, increased wages or employee benefits costs (including various federal, state and local actions to increase minimum wages), unionization activity or other factors have adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact our cost of sales and operating expenses. In addition, Wendy s success depends on our ability to attract, motivate and retain qualified employees, including restaurant managers and staff as well as employees and key personnel at our restaurant support center, and our inability to do so could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our business, results of operations and brand perception could also be adversely impacted by unionization efforts or other campaigns by labor organizations affecting our employees or the employees of our franchisees or by our responses to any such efforts or campaigns. 
 
 Our success depends in part upon the continued succession and retention of certain key personnel and the effectiveness of our leadership and organizational structure. 
 
 We believe that over time our success has been dependent to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior leadership team and other key personnel. Our failure to retain members of our senior leadership team or other key personnel could adversely affect our ability to achieve our growth strategy and other business initiatives. In addition, changes to our leadership and organizational structure can be inherently difficult to manage, and if we are unable to implement such changes effectively, our business, results of operations and financial results could be adversely affected. 
 
 Risks Related to Technology and Cybersecurity 
 
 There are risks and uncertainties associated with our increasing dependence on digital commerce platforms and technologies and alternative methods of delivery. 
 
 Advances in technologies, including advances in digital food ordering and delivery technologies, and changes in consumer behavior driven by such advances could have a negative effect on our business. Technology and consumer offerings continue to develop and evolve, and we expect that new and enhanced technologies and consumer offerings will be available in the future, including those with a focus on restaurant modernization, restaurant technology, digital engagement and integration, online ordering and delivery. Our inability to predict consumer acceptance of new technology or our failure to adequately invest in and implement new technology or adapt to technological developments, industry trends and evolving legal and regulatory requirements could result in a loss of customers and related market share. In addition, our competitors, some of whom have greater resources than we do, may be better able to benefit from changes in technologies or consumer acceptance of such changes, which could harm our competitive position and brand. 
 
 An increasing amount of our sales and revenues is derived from digital orders, which includes online ordering and delivery. We have implemented technology and targeted advertising and promotions to support the growth of our digital business. If we are unable to continue to grow our digital business, it may be difficult for us to achieve our planned sales growth. If our digital commerce platforms, including the Wendy s mobile app and online ordering system, do not meet customers expectations in terms of security, privacy, speed, attractiveness or ease of use, customers may be less inclined to return to those platforms, 
 23 

which could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our business could also be negatively impacted if we are unable to successfully implement or execute other consumer-facing digital initiatives, such as mobile order pick-up and carryout. We rely on third-party delivery services to fulfill delivery orders, and errors or failures by those providers to make timely deliveries could cause customers to stop ordering from us. The third-party restaurant delivery business is intensely competitive, with a number of companies competing for capital, market share, online traffic and delivery drivers. If the third-party delivery services that we utilize cease or curtail their operations, increase their fees or give greater priority or promotions on their platforms to our competitors, our delivery business and our sales may be negatively impacted. In addition, the delivery business has been consolidating and may continue to consolidate, which may give third-party delivery companies more leverage in negotiating the terms and pricing of contracts, which could in turn negatively impact our profits from this channel. 
 
 We are heavily dependent on computer systems and information technology and any material failure, interruption or degradation of our systems or technology or issues with our key technology providers could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 We are heavily dependent on our computer systems and information technology, including those controlled by third-party providers, to conduct our business, including point-of-sale processing in our restaurants, technologies that support our digital and delivery solutions, management of our supply chain, collection of cash, payment of obligations and various other processes and procedures. Our ability to efficiently manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and performance of our systems and technology. The failure of our systems and technology to operate effectively, or an interruption or degradation in our systems or technology could be harmful and cause delays in customer service, result in the loss of digital sales or data, reduce efficiency or cause delays in operations. Significant capital investments might be required to remediate any such problems or to maintain or upgrade our systems and technology or transition to replacement systems or technology. 
 
 We are dependent to a significant extent on our ongoing relationship with key technology providers, including their personnel, resources, technological expertise, systems and technology and their ability to help execute our digital, restaurant technology and enterprise technology initiatives and support our technology innovation and growth initiatives. The inability of us or our providers to successfully execute our technology growth initiatives while maintaining our brand value and perception could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 The occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in cybersecurity, could negatively impact our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Cybersecurity incidents or breaches have, from time to time, occurred and may in the future occur involving our systems, the systems of our franchisees or the systems of third-party service providers. Such cybersecurity incidents and breaches may include, without limitation, unauthorized access, phishing attacks, account takeovers, denial of service, computer viruses, introduction of malware or ransomware and other disruptive problems caused by malicious actors. As our reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to our systems, both internal and those managed by third parties. Our business involves the collection and retention of customer data, including, in some instances, credit and debit card numbers and other personally identifiable information, in various information systems that we and our franchisees maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we and our franchisees contract to provide credit card processing, digital ordering and related services. We also maintain important internal data, such as personally identifiable information about our employees and franchisees and information relating to our operations. Our use of personally identifiable information is regulated by international, federal and state laws, as well as by certain third-party agreements. As privacy and information security laws and regulations change, we will likely incur additional costs to ensure that we remain in compliance with those laws and regulations. If our security and information systems are compromised or if our employees or franchisees fail to comply with these laws, regulations or contract terms, and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately, it could adversely affect our reputation, disrupt our operations, damage our relationship with customers, franchisees or employees and result in costly litigation, judgments, or penalties resulting from violation of applicable laws and payment card industry regulations. A cyber incident could also require us to notify customers, employees or other groups, result in adverse publicity or a loss in consumer confidence, sales and profits, increase fees payable to third parties or cause us to incur penalties or remediation and other costs that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have devoted considerable resources to secure our systems and technology against security breaches and have implemented various processes, procedures and controls to help mitigate the risk of a cyber incident. However, the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyber-attacks change frequently and the measures we have taken do not guarantee that a cyber incident or security breach could not occur or that our business, reputation and financial condition will not be adversely affected.

Risks Related to Our Indebtedness 
 
 The Company and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various restrictions, and substantially all of the assets of certain subsidiaries are security, under the terms of a securitized financing facility. 
 
 Wendy s Funding, LLC, a limited-purpose, bankruptcy-remote, wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the Company, is the master issuer (the Master Issuer of outstanding senior secured notes under a securitized financing facility entered into in June 2015. Under the facility, the Master Issuer issued and has outstanding certain series of fixed rate and variable funding notes (collectively, the Senior Notes ). The Senior Notes are secured by a security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Master Issuer and certain other limited-purpose, bankruptcy-remote, wholly-owned indirect subsidiaries of the Company that act as guarantors (collectively, the Securitization Entities ), except for certain real estate assets and subject to certain limitations as set forth in the indenture governing the Senior Notes (the Indenture and the related guarantee and collateral agreement. The assets of the Securitization Entities include most of the domestic and certain of the foreign revenue-generating assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, which principally consist of franchise-related agreements, real estate assets, intellectual property and license agreements for the use of intellectual property. 
 
 The Senior Notes are subject to a series of covenants and restrictions customary for transactions of this type, including that the Master Issuer maintains specified reserve accounts to be used to make required payments in respect of the Senior Notes, provisions relating to optional and mandatory prepayments and the related payment of specified amounts, including specified make-whole payments under certain circumstances, certain indemnification payments in the event, among other things, that the assets pledged as collateral for the Senior Notes are in stated ways defective or ineffective and covenants relating to recordkeeping, access to information and similar matters. The Senior Notes are also subject to customary rapid amortization events provided for in the Indenture, including events tied to failure to maintain stated debt service coverage ratios, the sum of global gross sales for specified restaurants being below certain levels on certain measurement dates, certain manager termination events, the occurrence of an event of default and the failure to repay or refinance on the applicable scheduled maturity date. The Senior Notes are also subject to certain customary events of default, including events relating to non-payment of required interest, principal or other amounts due on or with respect to the Senior Notes, failure to comply with covenants within certain time frames, certain bankruptcy events, breaches of specified representations and warranties, the trustee under the Indenture ceasing to have valid and perfected security interests in certain collateral and certain judgments. In the event that a rapid amortization event occurs under the Indenture (including, without limitation, upon an event of default under the Indenture or the failure to repay the securitized debt at the end of the applicable term), the funds available to the Company would be reduced or eliminated, which would in turn reduce our ability to operate or grow our business. 
 
 In addition, the Indenture and the related management agreement contain various covenants that limit the Company and its subsidiaries ability to engage in specified types of transactions, subject to certain exceptions, including, for example, to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, sell certain assets, create or incur liens on certain assets to secure indebtedness or consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets. As a result of these restrictions, the Company may not have adequate resources or flexibility to continue to manage the business and provide for growth of the Wendy s system, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s future growth prospects, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 
 
 We have a significant amount of debt outstanding, and such indebtedness could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 As of January 1, 2023, the Company had approximately 2.9 billion of outstanding debt on its balance sheet. Additionally, a subsidiary of the Company has issued variable funding notes, which allows for the borrowing of up to 300.0 million from time to time on a revolving basis. This level of debt could have significant consequences on the Company s future operations, including: (i) making it more difficult to meet payment and other obligations under outstanding debt; (ii) resulting in an event of default if the Company s subsidiaries fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in debt agreements, which event of default could result in all of the Company s subsidiaries debt becoming immediately due and payable; (iii) reducing the availability of the Company s cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, equity and debt repurchases, dividends, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting the Company s ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes; (iv) subjecting the Company to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on indebtedness with variable interest rates; (v) limiting the Company s flexibility in planning for or reacting to, and increasing its vulnerability to, changes in the Company s business or industry or the general economy; and (vi) placing the Company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that are less leveraged. Further, the Company s outstanding variable funding notes may accrue interest based on the London interbank offered rate LIBOR ). In connection with the 
 25 

discontinuance of LIBOR, we expect to renegotiate certain loan documents and cannot predict what alternative index will be negotiated with our lenders or the resulting impact on our interest expense. 
 
 The ability of the Company to make payments on, repay or refinance its debt, and to fund planned capital expenditures, dividends and other cash needs will depend largely upon its future operating performance and ability to generate significant cash flows. In addition, the ability of the Company to borrow funds in the future to make payments on its debt will depend on the satisfaction of the covenants in the securitized financing facility and other debt agreements, and other agreements it may enter into in the future. There can be no assurance that the Company s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available under the Company s securitized financing facility or other debt agreements or from other sources in an amount sufficient to enable the Company to pay its debt or to fund its dividend and other liquidity needs. 
 
 In addition to the Company s outstanding indebtedness, the Company is subject to risks related to certain commitments, guarantees and other liabilities. These commitments, guarantees and other liabilities include, among others, significant contractual requirements regarding the purchase of soft drinks and guarantees and contingent liabilities related to certain franchisee leases for which the Company has been indemnified. These commitments, guarantees and other liabilities could have an adverse effect on the Company s liquidity and the ability of its subsidiaries to meet payment obligations. The Company may incur additional indebtedness, guarantees, commitments or other liabilities in the future that could amplify the risks that the Company currently faces. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Common Stock 
 
 There can be no assurance regarding whether or to what extent we will pay dividends on our common stock in the future. 
 
 Holders of our common stock will only be entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Any dividends will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our earnings, financial condition, cash requirements and such other factors as the Board may deem relevant from time to time. In addition, because Wendy s is a holding company, its ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent upon cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand and cash flows from its subsidiaries. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay cash dividends to the holding company is dependent upon their ability to achieve sufficient cash flows after satisfying their respective cash requirements, including the requirements and restrictions under our securitized financing facility and other debt agreements. 
 
 A substantial amount of our common stock is concentrated in the hands of certain stockholders. 
 
 Nelson Peltz, our Chairman, Peter May, our Senior Vice Chairman, Matthew Peltz, our Vice Chairman, and Edward Garden, a former director of the Company, beneficially own shares of our outstanding common stock that collectively constitute approximately 20 of the Company s total voting power as of February 21, 2023. These individuals may, from time to time, acquire beneficial ownership of additional shares of common stock. 
 
 On December 1, 2011, the Company entered into an agreement (the Trian Agreement with Messrs. N. Peltz, May and Garden, and several of their affiliates (the Covered Persons ). Pursuant to the Trian Agreement, our Board of Directors, including a majority of the independent directors, approved, for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Covered Persons becoming the owners (as defined in Section 203(c)(9)) of or acquiring an aggregate of up to (and including), but not more than, 32.5 (subject to certain adjustments set forth in the Trian Agreement) of the outstanding shares of the Company s common stock, such that no such persons would be subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 203 solely as a result of such ownership. This concentration of ownership gives these individuals significant influence over the outcome of actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of the Company s assets. They are also in a position to have significant influence to prevent or cause a change in control of the Company. 
 
 Our certificate of incorporation contains certain anti-takeover provisions and permits our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and limits our ability to raise capital from affiliates. 
 
 Certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation are intended to discourage or delay a hostile takeover of control of the Company. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of shares of blank check preferred stock, which will have such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our Board of Directors. Accordingly, our 
 26 

Board of Directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of our common stock. The preferred stock could be used to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company that is determined by the Board of Directors to be undesirable. Our certificate of incorporation prohibits the issuance of preferred stock to affiliates, unless offered ratably to the holders of our common stock, subject to an exception in the event that the Company is in financial distress and the issuance is approved by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. This prohibition limits our ability to raise capital from affiliates. 
 
 General Business Risks 
 
 Complaints or litigation could hurt our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Wendy s customers may file complaints or lawsuits against us or our franchisees alleging that we are responsible for an illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to a Wendy s restaurant, or alleging that there was a problem with food safety, food quality or operations at a Wendy s restaurant. We may also be subject to a variety of other claims arising in the ordinary course of our business, including personal injury claims, contract claims, claims from franchisees, intellectual property claims, data privacy claims and claims alleging violations of law regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters, including class action lawsuits. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are found to be liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert management s attention away from operations, hurt our performance and have a negative impact on our brand. While we believe we have adequate accruals for all of our legal and environmental matters, we cannot estimate the aggregate possible range of loss for our existing litigation and claims due to various reasons, including, but not limited to, many proceedings being in preliminary stages, with various motions either yet to be submitted or pending, discovery yet to occur, and significant factual matters unresolved. In addition, most cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages and many involve multiple parties. Predicting the outcomes of settlement discussions or judicial or arbitral decisions are thus inherently difficult. Insurance policies contain customary limitations, conditions and exclusions that can affect the amount of insurance proceeds ultimately received. A judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. Additionally, the restaurant industry has been subject to a number of claims alleging that the menus and actions of restaurant chains have contributed to the obesity or otherwise adversely impacted the health of certain of their customers. Adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may harm the reputation of our restaurants, even if the allegations are not directed against our restaurants or are not valid. Moreover, complaints, litigation or adverse publicity experienced by one or more of our franchisees could also hurt our brand or business as a whole. 
 
 Existing and changing legal and regulatory requirements, as well as an increasing focus on environmental, social and governance issues, could adversely affect our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Each Wendy s restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by health, sanitation, safety and other agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located, as well as to federal laws, rules and regulations and requirements of non-governmental entities such as payment card industry rules. Governmental authorities may enact laws, rules or regulations that impact restaurant operations and the cost of conducting those operations. In addition, there can be no assurance that we and our franchisees will not experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for opening new restaurants. More stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respect to tax, zoning, land use and environmental factors could also delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations. 
 
 We are subject to various laws and regulations that govern the offer and sale of a franchise, including rules by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Various state, provincial and foreign laws regulate certain aspects of the franchise relationship, including terminations and the refusal to renew franchises. The failure to comply with these laws and regulations in any jurisdiction or to obtain required government approvals could result in a ban or temporary suspension on future franchise sales, fines and penalties or require us to make offers of rescission or restitution, any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We could also face lawsuits by franchisees based upon alleged violations of these laws. We and our franchisees are each also subject to laws and regulations that govern employment matters at the federal/national, state/provincial and local levels. In the United States, this includes laws like the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions, Title VII, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the National Labor Relations Act, family leave, paid sick time and similar requirements and a variety of other laws, regulations and rules. Changes in laws, regulations, rules and governmental policies, including the interpretation thereof, could increase our costs, require modifications to our business practices, result in increased litigation, investigations, enforcement actions, fines or liabilities and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Changes in the legal framework of employment or franchise liability could negatively impact our business, particularly if such 
 27 

changes result in any law, rule, regulation, governmental policy or interpretation or judicial decision determining that Wendy s is an employer of its franchisees or a joint employer with our franchisees or otherwise imposing liability for employment-related claims or impacting our employment relationships based on theories of joint employer liability or other theories of vicarious liability. In addition, various state and local laws may require wage increases and impose working hour and working condition standards that could result in increased costs, limit our or our franchisees ability to respond to market conditions and negatively impact our ability to identify, attract and retain qualified franchisees to operate or open restaurants in the impacted markets. If we are unable to effectively manage the risks associated with this complex legislative and regulatory environment, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. 
 
 We are also subject to legal and compliance risks related to privacy and data collection, protection and management of certain data and information associated with our technology-related services and platforms made available to customers, employees, franchisees, business partners or other third parties. We are subject to a variety of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations in this area. These laws and regulations have been subject to frequent change, and there may be jurisdictions that propose or enact new data privacy requirements in the future. Failure to meet applicable data privacy requirements could result in legal proceedings and substantial penalties and adversely impact our business and financial condition. Additionally, evolving laws and regulations could require us and our franchisees to change or limit the way we collect or use information in operating our business, which may result in additional costs, limit our marketing or growth strategies and adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 
 There has been increasing public focus by investors, environmental activists, the media and governmental and nongovernmental organizations on environmental, social and governance matters, including packaging and waste, animal health and welfare, human rights, diversity, climate change, greenhouse gases and land, energy and water use. As a result, we have experienced increased pressure and expectations to provide expanded disclosure and establish commitments, goals or targets with respect to various environmental, social and governance issues and to take the actions necessary to meet those commitments, goals and targets. Furthermore, the standards by which certain environmental, social and governance issues are measured are evolving and subject to frequent change. If we are not effective, or perceived to be effective, in achieving our commitments, goals or targets or otherwise addressing various environmental, social and governance matters, consumer trust in our brand may suffer. In addition, the actions needed to achieve our commitments, goals and targets could result in market, operational, execution and other costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition. Our results of operation and financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to effectively manage the risks or costs to us, our franchisees and our supply chain associated with environmental, social and governance matte rs. 
 
 Our current insurance may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims that have been or may be filed. 
 
 We currently maintain insurance that we believe to be adequate for businesses of our size and type. However, there are types of losses we could encounter that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure, such as losses due to natural disasters, acts of terrorism or the declaration of war. In addition, we currently self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under workers compensation, general liability, products liability, auto liability and property insurance programs. Unanticipated changes in the actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our reserves for these losses could result in materially different amounts of expense, which could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We also currently maintain insurance coverage to address cyber incidents. Applicable insurance policies contain customary limitations, conditions and exclusions, and there can be no assurance that our cyber insurance policies will cover substantially all of the costs and expenses related to any previous or future cyber incidents. In addition, our future insurance premiums may increase, and we may be unable to obtain similar levels of insurance on reasonable terms, or at all, due to challenging conditions in the insurance industry. Any inadequacy of, or inability to obtain, insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition. 
 
 Changes in accounting standards, or the recognition of impairment or other charges, could adversely affect our future results of operations. 
 
 New accounting standards or changes in financial reporting requirements, accounting principles or practices, including with respect to our critical accounting estimates, could adversely affect our future results. We may also be affected by the nature and timing of decisions about underperforming markets or assets, including decisions that result in impairment or other charges that reduce our earnings. In assessing the recoverability of our long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets, we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. These estimates are highly subjective and can be significantly impacted by many factors such as business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, consumer and demographic trends and restructuring activities. If our estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, or if the operating performance or cash flows of our business decline, we may be 
 28 

required to record impairment charges, which could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results for the affected periods. 
 
 Tax matters, including changes in tax rates or laws, imposition of new taxes, disagreements with taxing authorities and unanticipated tax liabilities, could impact our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, and our operations, plans and results are affected by tax matters and initiatives around the world. In particular, we are affected by the impact of changes to tax rates, laws or policies or related authoritative interpretations. We are also impacted by the settlement of adjustments proposed by taxing and governmental authorities in connection with our tax reviews and audits, all of which will depend on their timing, nature and scope. While we believe our recorded provision for income taxes properly reflects all applicable tax laws as currently enacted, there can be no assurance that we would be successful in challenging adjustments by the relevant tax authorities. Any significant increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Our operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 
 Most of our revenues, costs and indebtedness is denominated in U.S. dollars, which is also our reporting currency. Our international operations that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated to U.S. dollars for our financial reporting purposes and are impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in currency regulations. Our exposures to foreign currency risk are primarily related to fluctuations in the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar for our Canadian operations. Unfavorable currency fluctuations could reduce our royalty income and revenues. While we attempt to minimize our foreign currency risks, our risk management strategies may not be effective and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
 
 Our results can be adversely affected by unforeseen events, such as adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities, social unrest, health epidemics or pandemics or other catastrophic events. 
 
 Unforeseen events, such as adverse weather conditions (including related to climate change), natural disasters, hostilities (including acts of war, terrorist activities and public or workplace violence), social unrest, health epidemics or pandemics or other catastrophic events can adversely affect consumer spending, consumer confidence, restaurant sales and operations, supply chains and our ability to perform corporate or support functions at our restaurant support center, any of which could affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. 
 
 None. 

Item 2. Properties. 
 
 We believe that our properties, taken as a whole, are generally well maintained and are adequate for our current and foreseeable business needs.

 The Wendy s Restaurants of Canada Inc. facility primarily serves the International operating segment. 
 
 At January 1, 2023, Wendy s and its franchisees operated 7,095 Wendy s restaurants. Of the 403 Company-operated restaurants in the Wendy s U.S. segment, Wendy s owned the land and building for 158 restaurants, owned the building and held long-term land leases for 143 restaurants and held leases covering the land and building for 102 restaurants. Wendy s also 
 29 

held leases covering the land and building for each of the 12 Company-operated restaurants in the Wendy s International segment. Lease terms are generally initially between 15 and 20 years and, in most cases, provide for rent escalations and renewal options. Certain leases contain contingent rent provisions that require additional rental payments based upon restaurant sales volume in excess of specified amounts. As part of the Global Real Estate Development segment, Wendy s also owned 488 and leased 1,199 properties that were either leased or subleased principally to franchisees as of January 1, 2023. Surplus land and buildings are generally held for sale and are not material to our financial condition or results of operations. 

Item 3. Legal Proceedings. 
 
 The Company is involved in litigation and claims incidental to our business. We provide accruals for such litigation and claims when we determine it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the loss is reasonably estimable. The Company believes it has adequate accruals for all of its legal and environmental matters. We cannot estimate the aggregate possible range of loss for our existing litigation and claims due to various reasons, including, but not limited to, many proceedings being in preliminary stages, with various motions either yet to be submitted or pending, discovery yet to occur, and significant factual matters unresolved. In addition, most cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages and many involve multiple parties. Predicting the outcomes of settlement discussions or judicial or arbitral decisions is thus inherently difficult and future developments could cause these actions or claims, individually or in aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows of a particular reporting period.

 The Wendy s Company is the parent company of its 100 owned subsidiary holding company, Wendy s Restaurants, LLC Wendy s Restaurants ). Wendy s Restaurants is the parent company of Wendy s International, LLC (formerly known as Wendy s International, Inc). Wendy s International, LLC is the indirect parent company of (1) Quality Is Our Recipe, LLC Quality ), which is the owner and franchisor of the Wendy s restaurant system in the United States (the U.S. and all international jurisdictions except for Canada, and (2) Wendy s Restaurants of Canada Inc., which is the owner and franchisor of the Wendy s restaurant system in Canada.

 Wendy s is primarily engaged in the business of operating, developing and franchising a system of distinctive quick-service restaurants serving high quality food. Wendy s opened its first restaurant in Columbus, Ohio in 1969. Today, Wendy s is the second largest quick-service restaurant company in the hamburger sandwich segment in the U.S. based on traffic share, and the third largest globally with 7,095 restaurants in the U.S. and 31 foreign countries and U.S. territories as of January 1, 2023. 
 
 The Company is comprised of the following segments: (1) Wendy s U.S., (2) Wendy s International and (3) Global Real Estate Development. Wendy s U.S. includes the operation and franchising of Wendy s restaurants in the U.S. and derives its revenues from sales at Company-operated restaurants and royalties, fees and advertising fund collections from franchised restaurants.

Executive Overview 
 
 Our Business 
 
 As of January 1, 2023, the Wendy s restaurant system was comprised of 7,095 restaurants, with 5,994 Wendy s restaurants in operation in the U.S. Of the U.S. restaurants, 403 were operated by the Company and 5,591 were operated by a total of 217 franchisees. In addition, at January 1, 2023, there were 1,101 Wendy s restaurants in operation in 31 foreign countries and U.S. territories. Of the international restaurants, 1,089 were operated by 106 franchisees and 12 were operated by the Company in the United Kingdom (the U.K. ). 
 
 The revenues from our restaurant business are derived from two principal sources: (1) sales at Company-operated restaurants and (2) franchise-related revenues, including royalties, national advertising funds contributions, rents and franchise fees received from Wendy s franchised restaurants. Company-operated restaurants comprised approximately 5 of the total Wendy s system as of January 1, 2023. 
 
 Wendy s operating results are impacted by a number of external factors, including commodity costs, labor costs, intense price competition, unemployment and consumer spending levels, general economic and market trends and weather. The COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have the effect of heightening the impact of many of these factors. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Projections in Part I preceding Item 1 - Business for additional information. 
 
 Wendy s long-term growth opportunities include delivering accelerated global growth through (1) driving strong same-restaurant sales momentum across all dayparts, (2) accelerating our implementation of consumer-facing digital platforms and technologies and (3) expanding the Company s footprint through global restaurant expansion. 
 
 Key Business Measures 
 
 We track our results of operations and manage our business using the following key business measures, which include non-GAAP financial measures: 
 
 Same-Restaurant Sales - We report same-restaurant sales commencing after new restaurants have been open for 15 continuous months and as soon as reimaged restaurants reopen. Restaurants temporarily closed for more than one week are excluded from same-restaurant sales. For 2020, same-restaurant sales excluded the impact of a 53 rd operating week. For 2020, same-restaurant sales compared the 52 weeks from December 30, 2019 through December 27, 2020 to the 52 weeks from December 31, 2018 through December 29, 2019. For 2021, same-restaurant sales compared the 52 weeks from January 4, 2021 through January 2, 2022 to the 52 weeks from January 6, 2020 through January 3, 2021. This methodology is consistent with the metric used by our management for internal reporting and analysis. The table summarizing same-restaurant sales below in Results of Operations provides the same-restaurant sales percent changes. 
 
 Restaurant Margin - We define restaurant margin as sales from Company-operated restaurants less cost of sales divided by sales from Company-operated restaurants. Cost of sales includes food and paper, restaurant labor and occupancy, advertising and other operating costs. Cost of sales excludes certain costs that support restaurant operations that are not allocated to individual restaurants, which are included in General and administrative. Cost of sales also excludes depreciation and amortization expense and impairment of long-lived assets. Therefore, as restaurant margin as presented excludes certain costs as described above, its usefulness may be limited and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies in our industry. 
 
 Restaurant margin is influenced by factors such as price increases, the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing initiatives, featured products, product mix, fluctuations in food and labor costs, restaurant openings, remodels and closures and the level of our fixed and semi-variable costs. 
 
 Systemwide Sales - Systemwide sales is a non-GAAP financial measure, which includes sales by both Company-operated restaurants and franchised restaurants. Franchised restaurants sales are reported by our franchisees and represent their revenues from sales at franchised Wendy s restaurants. The Company s consolidated financial statements do not include sales by franchised restaurants to their customers. The Company s royalty and advertising funds revenues are computed as percentages of sales made by Wendy s franchisees. As a result, sales by Wendy s franchisees have a direct effect on the Company s royalty and advertising funds revenues and profitability. 
 33 

Average Unit Volumes - We calculate Company-operated restaurant average unit volumes by summing the average weekly sales of all Company-operated restaurants which reported sales during the week. Average unit volumes exclude the impact of the 53 rd week of 2020. For 2020, average unit volumes are calculated using the 52 weeks from December 30, 2019 through December 27, 2020. 
 
 Franchised restaurant average unit volumes is a non-GAAP financial measure, which includes sales by franchised restaurants, which are reported by our franchisees and represent their revenues from sales at franchised Wendy s restaurants. The Company s consolidated financial statements do not include sales by franchised restaurants to their customers. We calculate franchised restaurant average unit volumes by summing the average weekly sales of all franchised restaurants which reported sales during the week. 
 
 The Company calculates same-restaurant sales and systemwide sales growth on a constant currency basis. Constant currency results exclude the impact of foreign currency translation and are derived by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. The Company believes excluding the impact of foreign currency translation provides better year over year comparability. 
 
 Same-restaurant sales and systemwide sales exclude sales from Argentina and Venezuela due to the highly inflationary economies of those countries. The Company considers economies that have had cumulative inflation in excess of 100 over a three-year period as highly inflationary. 
 
 The Company believes its presentation of same-restaurant sales, restaurant margin, systemwide sales and average unit volumes, including franchised restaurant average unit volumes, provide a meaningful perspective of the underlying operating performance of the Company s current business and enables investors to better understand and evaluate the Company s historical and prospective operating performance. The Company believes that these metrics are important supplemental measures of operating performance because they highlight trends in the Company s business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. The Company believes investors, analysts and other interested parties use these metrics in evaluating issuers and that the presentation of these measures facilitates a comparative assessment of the Company s operating performance. With respect to same-restaurant sales, systemwide sales and franchised restaurant average unit volumes, the Company also believes that the data is useful in assessing consumer demand for the Company s products and the overall success of the Wendy s brand. 
 
 The non-GAAP financial measures discussed above do not replace the presentation of the Company s financial results in accordance with GAAP. Because all companies do not calculate non-GAAP financial measures in the same way, these measures as used by other companies may not be consistent with the way the Company calculates such measures.

 New Restaurant Development

In addition, the Company has development agreements in place with a number of franchisees that contractually obligate such franchisees to open additional Wendy s restaurants over a specified timeframe. During 2022, the Company and its franchisees added 146 net new restaurants across the Wendy s system. 
 
 Organizational Redesign 
 
 On February 16, 2023, the Board of Directors approved a plan to redesign the Company s organizational structure to better support the execution of the Company s long-term growth strategy by maximizing organizational efficiency and streamlining decision making. As a result of the redesign, the Company expects to hold its general and administrative expense in 2023 and 2024 relatively flat compared with 2022. The Company expects to incur total costs of approximately 11 million to 13 million related to these savings, of which approximately 9 million to 11 million will be cash expenditures. The cash expenditures are expected to continue into 2025, with approximately two-thirds of the total cash expenditures occurring in 2023. Costs related to the plan are recorded to Reorganization and realignment costs. The total costs expected to be incurred are comprised of (1) severance and related employee costs of approximately 8 million, (2) recruitment and relocation costs of approximately 1 million, (3) third-party and other costs of approximately 1 million and (4) share-based compensation of approximately 2 million. The Company expects costs to be recognized during 2023 and continue into 2026, with approximately three-fourths to be recognized during 2023.

The table below presents details regarding the change in restaurant counts of the Wendy s system from 2020 to 2022. 
 U.S. Company-operated U.S. Franchised International Company-operated International Franchised Systemwide Restaurant count: Restaurant count at January 3, 2021 
 361 5,520 947 6,828 Opened 7 116 5 82 210 Closed (8) (58) (23) (89) Net purchased from (sold by) franchisees 43 (43) Restaurant count at January 2, 2022

 403 5,591 12 1,089 7,095 
 
 Sales 2022 2021 2020 Amount Change Amount Change Amount Sales 896.6 162.5 734.1 11.3 722.8 
 
 The increase in sales during 2022 was primarily due to (1) the Company s acquisition of 93 franchise-operated restaurants in Florida during the fourth quarter of 2021 of 162.7 million, (2) a 4.4 increase in Company-operated same-restaurant sales of 27.9 million and (3) net new restaurant development of 11.4 million. The increase in sales during 2022 was partially offset by the sale of 47 Company-operated restaurants in New York during the second quarter of 2021 of 42.9 million. Company-operated same-restaurant sales increased due to higher average check, partially offset by a decrease in customer count. Company-operated same-restaurant sales during 2021 benefited from government stimulus payments to consumers during the first quarter of 2021, which did not recur in 2022. 
 
 Franchise Royalty Revenue and Fees 2022 2021 2020 Amount Change Amount Change Amount Franchise royalty revenue 485.5 24.8 460.7 44.2 416.5 Franchise fees 72.7 (3.3) 76.0 47.8 28.2 558.2 21.5 536.7 92.0 444.7 
 
 Franchise royalty revenue during 2022 increased 24.8 million, of which (1) 21.8 million was due to a 4.9 increase in global franchise same-restaurant sales and (2) 3.1 million was due to a net increase in the number of franchise restaurants in operation during 2022 compared to 2021. Franchise same-restaurant sales during 2022 increased due to higher average check, partially offset by a decrease in customer count. Franchise same-restaurant sales during 2021 benefited from government stimulus payments to consumers during the first quarter of 2021, which did not recur in 2022. 
 
 The decrease in franchise fees during 2022 was primarily due to the accelerated recognition of franchise agreement revenue in the prior year as a result of franchisee-to-franchisee restaurant transfers of 8.3 million, partially offset by higher fees for providing information technology services to franchisees of 5.8 million. This increase in fees for providing information technology services during 2022 reflects the one-month waiver of technology fees during the first quarter of 2021. 
 
 Franchise Rental Income 2022 2021 2020 Amount Change Amount Change Amount Franchise rental income 234.5 (2.2) 236.7 4.1 232.6 
 
 The decrease in franchise rental income during 2022 was primarily due to the impact of terminating existing leases where the Company was lessor of 5.2 million, primarily in connection with the Company s acquisition of franchise-operated restaurants in Florida during the fourth quarter of 2021. The decrease in franchise rental income was partially offset by (1) the impact of the sale of Company-operated restaurants in New York during the second quarter of 2021 of 1.5 million and (2) assigning certain leases to franchisees of 1.5 million. 
 39 

Advertising Funds Revenue 2022 2021 2020 Amount Change Amount Change Amount Advertising funds revenue 406.2 16.7 389.5 55.8 333.7 
 
 The increase in advertising funds revenue during 2022 was primarily due to an increase in franchise same-restaurant sales in the U.S. and Canada. 
 
 Cost of Sales, as a Percent of Sales 2022 2021 2020 Amount Change Amount Change Amount Food and paper 32.7 2.2 30.5 (0.2) 30.7 Restaurant labor 32.1 0.6 31.5 (0.8) 32.3 Occupancy, advertising and other operating costs 21.4 0.1 21.3 (0.8) 22.1 86.2 2.9 83.3 (1.8) 85.1 
 
 The increase in cost of sales, as a percent of sales, during 2022 was primarily due to (1) higher commodity costs, (2) an increase in restaurant labor rates, (3) a decrease in customer count and (4) the impact of the Company s investments to support the entry into the U.K. market. These impacts were partially offset by higher average check. 
 
 Franchise Support and Other Costs 2022 2021 2020 Amount Change Amount Change Amount Franchise support and other costs 46.7 3.8 42.9 16.4 26.5 
 
 The increase in franchise support and other costs during 2022 was primarily due to an increase in costs incurred to provide information technology and other services to franchisees. 
 
 Franchise Rental Expense 2022 2021 2020 Amount Change Amount Change Amount Franchise rental expense 124.1 (8.3) 132.4 6.8 125.6 
 
 The decrease in franchise rental expense during 2022 was primarily due to (1) the impact of assigning certain leases to franchisees and (2) the impact of the Company s acquisition of franchise-operated restaurants in Florida during the fourth quarter of 2021. 
 
 Advertising Funds Expense 2022 2021 2020 Amount Change Amount Change Amount Advertising funds expense 430.8 19.0 411.8 66.4 345.4 
 
 The increase in advertising funds expense during 2022 was primarily due to (1) an increase in franchise same-restaurant sales in the U.S. and Canada and (2) timing of promotions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the Company s funding of incremental advertising.

General and Administrative 2022 2021 2020 Amount Change Amount (a) Change Amount (a) Employee compensation and benefits 128.5 13.4 115.1 (1.5) 116.6 Professional services 61.8 8.5 53.3 11.3 42.0 Travel-related expenses 11.5 6.0 5.5 0.3 5.2 Share-based compensation 24.5 2.5 22.0 3.9 18.1 Incentive compensation 25.0 (21.5) 46.5 23.5 23.0 Other, net 3.7 3.1 0.6 (1.4) 2.0 255.0 12.0 243.0 36.1 206.9 
 _______________ 
 
 (a) Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year presentation to conform to the current year presentation. 
 
 The increase in general and administrative expenses during 2022 was primarily due to (1) an increase in employee compensation and benefits, reflecting investments in resources to support the Company s development and digital organizations, (2) higher professional fees, primarily as a result of costs associated with the Company s enterprise resource planning ERP system implementation and (3) an increase in travel-related expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation accruals, reflecting higher operating performance as compared to plan in 2021 versus 2022. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization (exclusive of amortization of cloud computing arrangements shown separately below) 2022 2021 2020 Amount Change Amount Change Amount Restaurants 84.0 7.6 76.4 (8.5) 84.9 Technology support, corporate and other 49.4 0.3 49.1 1.2 47.9 133.4 7.9 125.5 (7.3) 132.8 
 
 The increase in depreciation and amortization during 2022 was primarily due to depreciation and amortization on assets acquired from a franchisee in Florida during the fourth quarter of 2021. 
 
 Amortization of Cloud Computing Arrangements 2022 2021 2020 Amount Change Amount Change Amount Amortization of cloud computing arrangements 2.4 2.4

 As part of the Company s system optimization initiative, the Company expects to continue to optimize the Wendy s system through strategic restaurant acquisitions and dispositions, as well as by facilitating Franchise Flips. During 2022, the Company recognized costs associated with its system optimization initiative totaling 0.6 million, which were primarily comprised of professional fees and other costs associated with the Company s acquisition of 93 franchise-operated restaurants in Florida during the fourth quarter of 2021. During 2021, the Company recognized costs totaling 6.9 million, which were primarily comprised of the write-off of certain lease assets, lease termination fees and transaction fees associated with the bankruptcy sale process of NPC Quality Burgers, Inc. NPC ), as well as professional fees and transaction fees associated with the Company s acquisition of 93 franchise-operated restaurants in Florida during the fourth quarter of 2021.

See Note 3 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in Item 8 herein for further information regarding the NPC bankruptcy sale process. 
 
 Costs incurred under the Company s other reorganization and realignment plans were not material during 2022 and 2021.

 The increase in other operating income, net during 2022 was primarily due to (1) a gain from insurance recoveries and (2) lease buyout activity. These impacts were partially offset by a decrease in the equity in earnings from our TimWen joint venture, which included a gain on the sale of a parcel of land during 2021. 
 
 Interest Expense, Net 2022 2021 2020 Amount Change Amount Change Amount Interest expense, net 122.3 13.1 109.2 (8.5) 117.7 
 
 Interest expense, net increased during 2022 primarily due to the impact of completing a debt financing transaction under the Company s securitized financing facility in the first quarter of 2022, partially offset by the impact of completing the refinancing of a portion of the Company s securitized financing facility in the second quarter of 2021.

 The increase in the provision for income taxes and effective tax rate during 2022 was primarily due to (1) an increase in state income taxes, including an increase in state deferred income taxes, (2) a decrease in the tax benefit from share-based compensation and (3) an increase in tax on our foreign operations. The increase in state deferred income taxes from 2021 to 2022 was primarily due to a 2021 change in tax law, which resulted in a one-time release of a previously recorded valuation allowance against our state deferred tax assets.

 2022 2021 2020 Amount Change Amount Change Amount Sales 882.7 152.3 730.4 7.6 722.8 Franchise royalty revenue 424.0 16.7 407.3 34.1 373.2 Franchise fees 63.0 (1.2) 64.2 42.1 22.1 Advertising fund revenue 380.5 14.9 365.6 52.3 313.3 Total revenues 1,750.2 182.7 1,567.5 136.1 1,431.4 Segment profit 480.5 30.4 450.1 56.8 393.3 
 
 43 

The increase in Wendy s U.S. revenues during 2022 was primarily due to (1) the Company s acquisition of 93 franchise-operated restaurants in Florida during the fourth quarter of 2021 and (2) an increase in same-restaurant sales. These increases were partially offset by the sale of 47 Company-operated restaurants in New York during the second quarter of 2021. Same-restaurant sales increased during 2022 primarily due to higher average check, partially offset by a decrease in customer count. 
 
 The increase in Wendy s U.S. segment profit during 2022 was primarily due to (1) higher revenues and (2) a decrease in the Company s funding of incremental advertising. These increases were partially offset by higher cost of sales, as a percent of sales for Company-operated restaurants driven by the same factors as described above for Cost of Sales, as a Percent of Sales (excluding the impact of the U.K. market).

 The increase in Wendy s International revenues during 2022 was primarily due to (1) the opening of Company-operated restaurants in the U.K. beginning in the second quarter of 2021 and (2) an increase in franchise same-restaurant sales. Franchise same-restaurant sales increased during 2022 due to (1) an increase in customer count and (2) higher average check. 
 
 The increase in Wendy s International segment profit during 2022 was primarily due to higher revenues. This increase was partially offset by (1) higher advertising fund expense, reflecting the Company s funding of incremental advertising to support the launch of breakfast in Canada in May 2022, and (2) the Company s investments to support the entry into the U.K. market.

 The decrease in Global Real Estate Development revenues during 2022 was primarily due to (1) the accelerated recognition of franchise agreement revenue in the prior year as a result of franchisee-to-franchisee restaurant transfers and (2) lower franchise rental income. See Franchise Rental Income above for further information. 
 
 The increase in Global Real Estate Development segment profit during 2022 was primarily due to a decrease in franchise rental expense, partially offset by lower revenues. See Franchise Rental Expense above for further information. 
 
 Consolidated Outlook for 2023 
 
 Sales 
 
 We expect sales at our Company-operated restaurants to be favorably impacted primarily by (1) a net increase in the number of Company-operated restaurants, (2) continued growth of our breakfast daypart, (3) our Fast Food Done Right strategy, which includes continuing core menu improvements, product innovation and strategic price increases on our menu items to partially offset commodity and labor inflation pressures, (4) focused execution of operational excellence and (5) continued growth of our digital business. 
 
 44 

Franchise Royalty Revenue and Fees 
 
 We expect sales at franchised restaurants to generally benefit from many of the factors described above under Sales. In addition, we expect franchise royalty revenue and fees to be favorably impacted by (1) a net increase in the number of franchise restaurants in operation due to net new restaurant development and (2) a full year of operating in the breakfast daypart across the Canadian system after the launch of breakfast in Canada in May 2022. 
 
 Cost of Sales 
 
 We expect cost of sales, as a percent of sales to be favorably impacted by many of the same factors described above under Sales, and to also benefit from productivity initiatives. We expect cost of sales, as a percent of sales to be negatively impacted by (1) an increase in commodity costs and (2) higher restaurant labor rates. 
 
 General and Administrative 
 
 We expect general and administrative expenses to be relatively flat, despite elevated inflationary pressures, primarily as a result of the Company s organizational redesign. See Executive Overview above for further information regarding expected costs to be incurred under the plan. 
 
 Reorganization and Realignment Costs 
 
 We expect reorganization and realignment costs to be elevated as a result of the Company s organizational redesign announced in January 2023. See Executive Overview above for further information regarding expected costs to be incurred under the plan. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our securitized financing facility. Our principal uses of cash are operating expenses, capital expenditures, repurchases of common stock, dividends to stockholders and repurchases of debt. 
 
 Cash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities 
 
 The table below summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for each of the past three fiscal years: 
 2022 2021 2020 Amount Change Amount Change Amount Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 259.9 (85.9) 345.8 61.4 284.4 Investing activities (77.8) 76.9 (154.7) (86.4) (68.3) Financing activities 288.7 531.4 (242.7) (84.8) (157.9) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (6.0) (6.3) 0.3 (1.0) 1.3 Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 464.8 516.1 (51.3) (110.8) 59.5 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities consists primarily of net income, adjusted for non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization, deferred income tax and share-based compensation, and the net change in operating assets and liabilities. Cash provided by operating activities was 259.9 million and 345.8 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The change was primarily due to (1) the timing of payments for marketing expenses of the national advertising funds, (2) an increase in payments for incentive compensation for the 2021 fiscal year paid in 2022 and (3) cash paid for cloud computing arrangements, primarily related to the Company s ERP system implementation. 
 
 45 

Investing Activities 
 
 Cash used in investing activities was 77.8 million and 154.7 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The change was primarily due to (1) a decrease in payments for acquisitions of 123.1 million, reflecting the impact of the Company s acquisition of 93 franchise-operated restaurants in Florida during the fourth quarter of 2021 and (2) a payment for an investment in equity securities of 10.0 million during 2021. These changes were partially offset by (1) a decrease in proceeds from dispositions of 46.9 million, reflecting the sale of 47 Company-operated restaurants in New York during the second quarter of 2021 and (2) an increase in capital expenditures of 7.6 million. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was 288.7 million and (242.7) million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The change was primarily due to (1) a net increase in cash provided by long-term debt activities of 354.2 million, reflecting the respective impacts of the completion of the Company s debt financing transaction during the first quarter of 2022 and the Company s debt refinancing transaction during the second quarter of 2021, and (2) a decrease in the repurchases of common stock of 216.6 million. These changes were partially offset by (1) a decrease in proceeds from stock option exercises, net of payments related to tax withholding for share-based compensation, of 23.8 million and (2) an increase in dividends of 11.9 million. 
 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 
 Our anticipated cash requirements for 2023, exclusive of operating cash flow requirements, consist principally of: 
 
 capital expenditures of approximately 75.0 million to 85.0 million as discussed below in Capital Expenditures; 
 
 quarterly cash dividends aggregating approximately 212.6 million as discussed below in Dividends; 
 
 stock repurchases under the Company s January 2023 Authorization as discussed below in Stock Repurchases; and 
 
 debt repurchases of up to 75.0 million as discussed below in Long-Term Debt, Including Current Portion. 
 
 Based on current levels of operations, the Company expects that available cash and cash flows from operations will provide sufficient liquidity to meet operating cash requirements for the next 12 months. 
 
 We currently believe we have the ability to pursue additional sources of liquidity if needed or desired to fund operating cash requirements or for other purposes. However, there can be no assurance that additional liquidity will be readily available or available on terms acceptable to us. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 
 In 2022, cash capital expenditures amounted to 85.5 million. In 2023, we expect that cash capital expenditures will amount to approximately 75.0 million to 85.0 million, principally relating to (1) technology investments, including consumer-facing digital technology, (2) the opening of new Company-operated restaurants and the reimaging of existing Company-operated restaurants, (3) restaurant equipment investments, (4) maintenance capital expenditures for Company-operated restaurants and (5) various other capital projects. 
 
 In addition to the capital expenditures noted above, the Company s cash expenditures related to cloud computing arrangements CCA amounted to 30.2 million during 2022, primarily related to the Company s ERP system implementation. In 2023, we expect to spend approximately 25.0 million on CCA, primarily related to the Company s human capital management system implementation. See Note 1 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in Item 8 herein for further information related to our accounting policy for CCA. 
 
 Dividends 
 
 On March 15, 2022, June 15, 2022, September 15, 2022 and December 15, 2022, the Company paid quarterly cash dividends per share of .125, aggregating 106.8 million. On January 13, 2023, the Company announced a dividend of .25 per share to be paid on March 15, 2023 to stockholders of record as of March 1, 2023. If the Company pays regular quarterly cash dividends for the remainder of 2023 at the same rate as declared in the first quarter of 2023, the Company s total cash requirement for dividends for all of 2023 would be approximately 212.6 million based on the number of shares of its common 
 46 

stock outstanding at February 21, 2023. The Company currently intends to continue to declare and pay quarterly cash dividends; however, there can be no assurance that any additional quarterly dividends will be declared or paid or of the amount or timing of such dividends, if any. 
 
 Stock Repurchases 
 
 In February 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program for up to 100.0 million of our common stock through February 28, 2023, when and if market conditions warranted and to the extent legally permissible (the February 2022 Authorization ). On April 1, 2022, the Company s Board of Directors approved an increase of 150.0 million to the February 2022 Authorization, resulting in an aggregate authorization of 250.0 million that was set to expire on February 28, 2023. During 2022, the Company repurchased 2.8 million shares under the February 2022 Authorization with an aggregate purchase price of 51.9 million, excluding commissions. As of January 1, 2023, the Company had 198.1 million of availability remaining under the February 2022 Authorization. In January 2023, our Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program for up to 500.0 million of our common stock through February 28, 2027, when and if market conditions warrant and to the extent legally permissible (the January 2023 Authorization ). In connection with the January 2023 Authorization, the remaining portion of the February 2022 Authorization was canceled. Subsequent to January 1, 2023 through February 21, 2023, the Company repurchased 0.6 million shares under the January 2023 Authorization with an aggregate purchase price of 12.9 million, excluding commissions. 
 
 In February 2020, our Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program for up to 100.0 million of our common stock through February 28, 2021, when and if market conditions warranted and to the extent legally permissible (the February 2020 Authorization ). In July 2020, the Company s Board of Directors approved an extension of the February 2020 Authorization by one year, through February 28, 2022. In addition, in May 2021, August 2021 and November 2021, the Board of Directors approved increases of 50.0 million, 70.0 million and 80.0 million, respectively, to the February 2020 Authorization, resulting in an aggregate authorization of 300.0 million that continued to expire on February 28, 2022. In November 2021, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the 2021 ASR Agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase common stock as part of the February 2020 Authorization. Under the 2021 ASR Agreement, the Company paid the financial institution an initial purchase price of 125.0 million in cash and received an initial delivery of 4.9 million shares of common stock, representing an estimated 85 of the total shares expected to be delivered under the 2021 ASR Agreement. In February 2022, the Company completed the 2021 ASR Agreement and received an additional 0.7 million shares of common stock. The total number of shares of common stock ultimately purchased by the Company under the 2021 ASR Agreement was based on the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices of the common stock during the term of the 2021 ASR Agreement, less an agreed upon discount. In total, 5.6 million shares were delivered under the 2021 ASR Agreement at an average purchase price of 22.22 per share. With the completion of the 2021 ASR Agreement in February 2022 as described above, the Company completed the February 2020 Authorization. 
 
 Long-Term Debt, Including Current Portion 
 
 As of January 1, 2023, the Company s long-term debt obligations totaled 2,851.4 million, including 29.3 million payable within 12 months. In addition, the Company is party to a revolving financing facility of Series 2021-1 Variable Funding Senior Secured Notes, Class A-1 (the Class A-1 Notes ), which allows for the drawing of up to 300.0 million on a revolving basis using various credit instruments, including a letter of credit facility. No amounts were borrowed under the Class A-1 Notes during 2022. 
 
 Subsequent to January 1, 2023, Wendy s repurchased 25.0 million in principal of its 7 debentures at par value. 
 
 We may from time to time seek to repurchase additional portions of our outstanding long-term debt, including our 7 debentures and/or our senior secured notes, through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. In February 2023, our Board of Directors authorized additional debt repurchases of up to 50.0 million through February 28, 2024, resulting in total debt repurchases of up to 75.0 million in 2023. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. Whether or not to repurchase any debt and the size and timing of any such repurchases will be determined at our discretion. 
 
 See Note 12 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in Item 8 herein for further information related to our long-term debt obligations and the timing of expected payments. 
 
 47 

Leases 
 
 The Company operates restaurants that are located on sites owned by us and sites leased by us from third parties. In addition, the Company owns sites and leases sites from third parties, which it leases and/or subleases to franchisees. The Company also leases restaurant, office and transportation equipment. As of January 1, 2023, the Company s future minimum rental payments for non-cancelable leases were 2,159.5 million, including 148.5 million payable within 12 months. See Note 20 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in Item 8 herein for further information related to our finance and operating lease obligations and the timing of expected payments. 
 
 Purchase Obligations 
 
 The Company s purchase obligations include payment obligations to a third-party global IT consultant, purchase requirements under a beverage agreement and other obligations related primarily to marketing and information technology. As of January 1, 2023, the Company s purchase obligations were 252.9 million, including 117.4 million payable within 12 months. 
 
 Guarantees and Other Contingencies 
 Year End 2022 Lease guarantees (a) 102.6 Letters of credit (b) 28.6 Total 131.2 
 _______________ 
 
 (a) Wendy s has guaranteed the performance of certain leases and other obligations, primarily from former Company-operated restaurant locations now operated by franchisees. These leases extend through 2045. 
 
 (b) The Company has outstanding letters of credit with various parties. The Company does not expect any material loss to result from these letters of credit because we do not believe performance will be required. 
 
 General Inflation, Commodities and Changing Prices 
 
 Inflationary pressures on labor and commodity price increases directly impacted our consolidated results of operations during 2022, and we expect this to continue into 2023. We attempt to manage any inflationary costs and commodity price increases through selective menu price increases and product mix. Delays in implementing such menu price increases and competitive pressures may limit our ability to recover such cost increases in the future. Inherent volatility experienced in certain commodity markets, such as those for beef, chicken, pork, cheese and grains, could have a significant effect on our results of operations and may have an adverse effect on us in the future. The extent of any impact will depend on our ability to manage such volatility through product mix and selective menu price increases. 
 
 Seasonality 
 
 Wendy s restaurant operations are moderately seasonal. Wendy s average restaurant sales are normally higher during the summer months than during the winter months. Because our business is moderately seasonal, results for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for any other quarter or for the full fiscal year. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 Other than the obligations for guarantees described above in Guarantees and Other Contingencies, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are, in the opinion of management, reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions in applying our critical accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated 
 48 

financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our estimates and assumptions affect, among other things, impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, impairment of long-lived assets, realizability of deferred tax assets and federal and state income tax uncertainties. We evaluate those estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis based on historical experience and on various other factors which we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. 
 
 We believe that the following represent our more critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: 
 
 Impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets: 
 
 Our goodwill totaled 773.1 million as of January 1, 2023, of which 620.6 million, 30.0 million and 122.5 million was allocated to our U.S. Company-operated and franchise restaurants reporting unit, Canada franchise restaurants reporting unit and global real estate and development operations reporting unit, respectively. 
 
 We test goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Our annual impairment test of goodwill may be completed through a qualitative assessment to determine if the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount. If we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting units, or if a qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the estimated carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. Under the quantitative test, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value (including goodwill). If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined by management and is based on the results of (1) estimates we made regarding the present value of the anticipated cash flows associated with each reporting unit (the income approach and/or (2) the indicated value of the reporting units based on a comparison and correlation of the Company and other similar companies (the market approach ). 
 
 The income approach, which considers factors unique to each of our reporting units and related long range plans that may not be comparable to other companies and that are not yet publicly available, is dependent on several critical management assumptions. These assumptions include estimates of future sales growth, operating profit, income tax rates, terminal value growth rates, capital expenditures and the weighted average cost of capital (discount rate). Anticipated cash flows used under the income approach are developed every fourth quarter in conjunction with our annual budgeting process and also incorporate amounts and timing of future cash flows based on our long range plan. 
 
 The discount rates used in the income approach are an estimate of the rate of return that a market participant would expect of each reporting unit. To select an appropriate rate for discounting the future earnings stream, a review is made of short-term interest rate yields of long-term corporate and government bonds, as well as the typical capital structure of companies in the industry. The discount rates used for each reporting unit may vary depending on the risk inherent in the cash flow projections, as well as the risk level that would be perceived by a market participant. A terminal value is included at the end of the projection period used in our discounted cash flow analysis to reflect the remaining value that each reporting unit is expected to generate. The terminal value represents the present value in the last year of the projection period of all subsequent cash flows into perpetuity. The terminal value growth rate is a key assumption used in determining the terminal value as it represents the annual growth of all subsequent cash flows into perpetuity. 
 
 Under the market approach, we apply the guideline company method in estimating fair value. The guideline company method makes use of market price data of corporations whose stock is actively traded in a public market. The corporations we select as guideline companies are engaged in a similar line of business or are subject to similar financial and business risks, including the opportunity for growth. The guideline company method of the market approach provides an indication of value by relating the equity or invested capital (debt plus equity) of guideline companies to various measures of their earnings and cash flow, then applying such multiples to the business being valued. The result of applying the guideline company approach is adjusted based on the incremental value associated with a controlling interest in the business. This control premium represents the amount a new controlling stockholder would pay for the benefits resulting from synergies and other potential benefits derived from controlling the enterprise. 
 
 49 

For the annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2022, we elected to perform a qualitative assessment for the U.S. Company-operated and franchise restaurants and the Canada franchise restaurants, and we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test for the global real estate and development operations. The qualitative assessment indicated the fair value of our U.S. Company-operated and franchise restaurants and our Canada franchise restaurants reporting units was more likely than not greater than the carrying amount. Our quantitative goodwill impairment test for our global real estate and development operations indicated that there had been no impairment and the fair value of this reporting unit of approximately 1,400.0 million was approximately 21 in excess of its carrying value. 
 
 Our indefinite-lived intangible assets represent trademarks and totaled 903.0 million as of January 1, 2023. We test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. Our annual impairment test may be completed through a qualitative assessment to determine if the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount. If we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment, or if a qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the estimated carrying value exceeds the fair value, we test for impairment using a quantitative process. Our quantitative process includes comparing the carrying value to the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, with any excess recognized as an impairment loss. Our critical estimates in the determination of the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets include the anticipated future revenues of Company-operated and franchised restaurants and the resulting cash flows. 
 
 For the annual impairment test of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2022, we elected to perform a qualitative assessment. The qualitative assessment indicated the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets was more likely than not greater than the carrying amount. 
 
 The estimated fair values of our goodwill reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to change as a result of many factors including, among others, any changes in our business plans, changing economic conditions and the competitive environment. Should actual cash flows and our future estimates vary adversely from those estimates we use, we may be required to recognize impairment charges in future years. 
 
 Impairment of long-lived assets: 
 
 As of January 1, 2023, the total net carrying value of our long-lived tangible and definite-lived intangible assets was 2,230.6 million. Our long-lived assets include (1) properties and related definite-lived intangible assets (e.g., favorable leases) that are leased and/or subleased to franchisees, (2) Company-operated restaurant assets and related definite-lived intangible assets, which include reacquired rights under franchise agreements, and (3) finance and operating lease assets. 
 
 We review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of our long-lived assets by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated through leases and/or subleases or by our individual Company-operated restaurants. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, then impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value and is included in Impairment of long-lived assets. Our critical estimates in this review process include the anticipated future cash flows from leases and/or subleases or individual Company-operated restaurants, which is used in assessing the recoverability of the respective long-lived assets. Our impairment losses principally reflect impairment charges resulting from the deterioration in operating performance of certain Company-operated restaurants. 
 
 Our fair value estimates are subject to change as a result of many factors including, among others, any changes in our business plans, changing economic conditions and the competitive environment. Should actual cash flows and our future estimates vary adversely from those estimates we used, we may be required to recognize additional impairment charges in future years. 
 
 50 

Our ability to realize deferred tax assets: 
 
 We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. A deferred tax asset or liability is recognized whenever there are (1) future tax effects from temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and (2) operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. 
 
 Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent the Company believes these assets will more likely than not be realized. In evaluating the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including the interaction and the timing of future reversals of existing temporary differences, recent operating results, tax-planning strategies and projected future taxable income. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results from continuing operations and incorporate assumptions including future operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage our underlying business. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income. 
 
 When considered necessary, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of the deferred tax assets to their anticipated realizable value. Our evaluation of the realizability of our deferred tax assets is subject to change as a result of many factors including, among others, any changes in our business plans, changing economic conditions, the competitive environment and the effect of future tax legislation. Should future taxable income vary from projected taxable income, we may be required to adjust our valuation allowance in future years. 
 
 Net operating loss and credit carryforwards are subject to various limitations and carryforward periods. As of January 1, 2023, we have foreign tax credits of 18.2 million and state tax credits of 0.4 million. The foreign tax credits begin to expire in 2027 and the state tax credits begin to expire in 2023. In addition, as of January 1, 2023, we have deferred tax assets for foreign net operating loss carryforwards of 3.5 million and state and local net operating loss carryforwards of 35.9 million that will begin to expire in 2023. We believe it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits will not be realized. In recognition of this risk, we have provided a valuation allowance of 35.7 million. 
 
 Income tax uncertainties: 
 
 We measure income tax uncertainties in accordance with a two-step process of evaluating a tax position. We first determine if it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is then measured, for purposes of financial statement recognition, as the largest amount that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon effective settlement. We have unrecognized tax benefits of 17.4 million, which if resolved favorably would reduce our tax expense by 13.7 million as of January 1, 2023. 
 
 We accrue interest related to uncertain tax positions in Interest expense, net. As of January 1, 2023, we had 0.9 million accrued for interest. 
 
 The Company participates in the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS Compliance Assurance Process CAP ). As part of CAP, tax years are examined on a contemporaneous basis so that all or most issues are resolved prior to the filing of the tax return. As such, our U.S. federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2009 through 2020 have been settled. The statute of limitations for the Company s state tax returns vary, but generally the Company s state income tax returns from its 2018 fiscal year forward remain subject to examination. We believe that adequate provisions have been made for any liabilities, including interest and penalties that may result from the completion of these examinations. 
 
 New Accounting Standards 
 
 See Note 1 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in Item 8 herein for a summary of new or amended accounting standards applicable to us. 
 
 51 

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 
 
 Certain statements the Company makes under this Item 7A constitute forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Projections in Part I preceding Item 1. Business. 
 
 We are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, changes in commodity prices and foreign currency fluctuations primarily related to the Canadian dollar. In the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to these changes using financial instruments we deem appropriate. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 Our objective in managing our exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact on our earnings and cash flows. Our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes, and we had no outstanding derivative instruments as of January 1, 2023. 
 
 Our long-term debt, including the current portion, aggregated 2,895.8 million as of January 1, 2023 (excluding unamortized debt issuance costs and the effect of purchase accounting adjustments). The Company s predominantly fixed-rate debt structure has reduced its exposure to interest rate increases that could adversely affect its earnings and cash flows. The Company could be exposed to interest rate increases under its Class A-1 Notes and other lines of credit; however, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Class A-1 Notes or its other lines of credit as of January 1, 2023. See Note 12 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in Item 8 herein for further information on the Company s debt structure and its securitized financing facility. 
 
 In addition, certain of the Company s loan documents determine interest based on LIBOR, and we currently intend to renegotiate such loan documents prior to LIBOR being discontinued. At this time, we cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with our lenders or the resulting impact on our interest expense. 
 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 
 Commodity price increases directly impacted our consolidated results of operations during 2022, and we expect this to continue into 2023. We purchase certain food products, such as beef, chicken, pork, cheese and grains, that are affected by changes in commodity prices and, as a result, we are subject to variability in our food costs. QSCC, our independent supply chain purchasing co-op, negotiates contracts with approved suppliers on behalf of the Wendy s system in the U.S. and Canada to ensure favorable pricing for its major food products, as well as maintain an adequate supply of fresh food products. While price volatility can occur, which would impact profit margins, the purchasing contracts seek to limit the variability of these commodity costs without establishing any firm purchase commitments by us or our franchisees. In addition, we believe that alternative suppliers are generally available. Our ability to recover increased commodity costs through higher pricing is, at times, limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. 
 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 
 Our exposures to foreign currency risk are primarily related to fluctuations in the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar for our Canadian operations. We monitor these exposures and periodically determine our need for the use of strategies intended to lessen or limit our exposure to these fluctuations. We have exposure related to our investment in a Canadian subsidiary which is subject to foreign currency fluctuations. The exposure to Canadian dollar exchange rates on the Company s cash flows primarily includes imports paid for by Canadian operations in U.S. dollars and payments from the Company s Canadian operations to the Company s U.S. operations in U.S. dollars. Revenues from our Canadian operations for the year ended January 1, 2023 represented approximately 5 of our total revenues. An immediate 10 change in Canadian dollar exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar from their levels at January 1, 2023 would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Wendy s Company 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Wendy s Company and subsidiaries (the Company as of January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended January 1, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 1, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 1, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Goodwill - Global Real Estate and Development Operations Reporting Unit Refer to Notes 1 and 10 to the financial statements 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 The Company s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. 
 
 The Company used both an income approach and a market approach to estimate fair value of the global real estate and development operations reporting unit. The income approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions including future sales growth, operating profit, terminal value growth rate and the weighted average cost of capital (discount rate). The market approach requires use of market price data of guideline public companies to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both. The goodwill balance was 773.1 million as of January 1, 2023, of which 122.5 million 
 56 

was allocated to the global real estate and development operations reporting unit. The fair value of the global real estate and development operations reporting unit exceeded its carrying value as of the measurement date and, therefore, no impairment was recognized. 
 
 We identified the Company s income approach in the impairment evaluation of goodwill for the global real estate and development operations reporting unit as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair value of this reporting unit. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management s estimates and assumptions, particularly related to future sales growth, operating profit, terminal value growth rate and the selection of the discount rate. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 
 Our audit procedures related to the estimates of future sales growth, operating profit and discount rate used by management to estimate the fair value of the global real estate and development operations reporting unit included the following, among others: 
 
 We tested the effectiveness of controls over management s goodwill impairment evaluation, including those over the determination of the fair value of the global real estate and development operations reporting unit, such as controls related to management s forecasts of future sales growth, operating profit, terminal value growth rate and selection of the discount rate. 
 We evaluated management s ability to accurately forecast future sales growth and operating profit by comparing actual results to management s historical forecasts. 
 We evaluated the reasonableness of management s sales and operating profit forecasts by comparing the forecasts to (1) historical sales and operating profit and (2) internal communications to management and the Board of Directors. We also considered the impact of changes in management s forecasts from the annual measurement date in the fourth quarter to January 1, 2023. 
 With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the terminal value growth rate and the discount rate, including testing the underlying source information and the mathematical accuracy of the calculation, and by developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rate selected by management.

 The Company reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. Our annual impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets may be completed through a qualitative assessment to determine if the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount. If we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment, or if a qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the estimated carrying value exceeds the fair value, we test for impairment using a quantitative process. If the Company determines that impairment of its intangible assets may exist, the amount of impairment loss is measured as the excess of carrying value over fair value. Our critical estimates in the determination of the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets include the anticipated future revenues of Company-operated and franchised restaurants and the resulting cash flows. 
 
 share in a partnership in a Canadian restaurant real estate joint venture TimWen with a subsidiary of Restaurant Brands International Inc., a quick-service restaurant company that owns the Tim Hortons brand (Tim Hortons is a registered trademark of Tim Hortons USA Inc.). In addition, the Company has a share in a joint venture in Brazil (the Brazil JV ). The Company has significant influence over these investees. Such investments are accounted for using the equity method, under which our results of operations include our share of the income (loss) of the investees in Other operating income, net. Cash distributions and dividends received that are determined to be returns of capital are recorded as a reduction of the carrying value of our investments and returns on our investments are recorded to Investment income (loss), net. 
 
 The difference between the carrying value of our TimWen equity investment and the underlying equity in the historical net assets of the investee is accounted for as if the investee were a consolidated subsidiary. Accordingly, the carrying value difference is amortized over the estimated lives of the assets of the investee to which such difference would have been allocated if the equity investment were a consolidated subsidiary. To the extent the carrying value difference represents goodwill, it is not amortized. 
 
 Other investments in equity securities in which the Company does not have significant influence, and for which there is not a readily determinable fair value, are recorded at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Realized gains and losses are reported as income or loss in the period in which the securities are sold or otherwise disposed.

and years and, in most cases, provide for rent escalations and renewal options. 
 
 Operating Leases 
 
 For operating leases, minimum lease payments or receipts, including minimum scheduled rent increases, are recognized as rent expense where the Company is a lessee, or income where the Company is a lessor, as applicable, on a straight-line basis Straight-Line Rent over the applicable lease terms. There is a period under certain lease agreements referred to as a rent holiday Rent Holiday that generally begins on the possession date and ends on the rent commencement date. During a Rent Holiday, no cash rent payments are typically due under the terms of the lease; however, expense is recorded for that period on a straight-line basis. The excess of the Straight-Line Rent over the minimum rents paid is included in the ROU asset where the Company is a lessee. The excess of the Straight-Line Rent over the minimum rents received is recorded as a deferred lease asset and is included in Other assets where the Company is a lessor. Certain leases contain provisions, referred to as contingent rent Contingent Rent ), that require additional rental payments based upon restaurant sales volume. Contingent Rent is recognized each period as the liability is incurred or the asset is earned. 
 
 Lease cost for operating leases includes the amortization of the ROU asset and interest expense related to the operating lease liability. Variable lease cost for operating leases includes Contingent Rent and payments for executory costs such as real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance, which are excluded from the measurement of the lease liability. Short-term lease cost for operating leases includes rental expense for leases with a term of less than 12 months. Lease costs are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations based on the nature of the underlying lease as follows: (1) rental expense related to leases for Company-operated restaurants is recorded to Cost of sales, (2) rental expense for leased properties that are subsequently subleased to franchisees is recorded to Franchise rental expense and (3) rental expense related to leases for corporate offices and equipment is recorded to General and administrative.

customers which accounted for 10 or more of consolidated revenues in 2022, 2021 or 2020. As of January 1, 2023, Wendy s had main in-line distributor of food, packaging and beverage products, excluding breads, that serviced approximately of Wendy s restaurants in the U.S. and additional in-line distributors that, in the aggregate, serviced approximately of Wendy s restaurants in the U.S. We believe that our vulnerability to risk concentrations related to significant vendors and sources of our raw materials is mitigated as we believe that there are other vendors who would be able to service our requirements. However, if a disruption of service from any of our main in-line distributors was to occur, we could experience short-term increases in our costs while distribution channels were adjusted. 
 
 Wendy s restaurants are principally located throughout the U.S. and to a lesser extent, in foreign countries and U.S. territories, with the largest number in Canada. Wendy s U.S. restaurants are located in states and the District of Columbia,

 Company-operated restaurants in Canada and less than of Wendy s franchised restaurants are in Canada. 
 
 The Company is subject to credit risk through its accounts receivable consisting primarily of amounts due from franchisees for royalties, franchise fees and rent. In addition, we have notes receivable from certain of our franchisees. The financial condition of these franchisees is largely dependent upon the underlying business trends of the Wendy s brand and market conditions within the quick-service restaurant industry. This concentration of credit risk is mitigated, in part, by the number of franchisees and the short-term nature of the franchise receivables.

 -year term and a -year renewal subject to certain conditions. The initial term may be extended up to years and the renewal extended up to years for qualifying restaurants under certain new restaurant development and reimaging programs. 
 
 The franchise agreement requires that the franchisee pay a royalty based on a percentage of sales at the franchised restaurant, as well as make contributions to the Advertising Funds based on a percentage of sales. Wendy s may offer development incentive programs from time to time that provide for a discount or lesser royalty amount or Advertising Fund contribution for a limited period of time.

 (a) The fair value of our other investments in equity securities is based on our review of information provided by the investment manager, which is based on observable price changes in orderly transactions for a similar investment of the same issuer. 
 
 (b) The fair values were based on quoted market prices in markets that are not considered active markets. 
 
 The carrying amounts of cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of those items. The carrying amounts of accounts and notes receivable, net (both current and non-current) approximate fair value due to the effect of the related allowance for doubtful accounts. Our cash equivalents are the only financial assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. 
 
 Non-Recurring Fair Value Measurements 
 
 Assets and liabilities remeasured to fair value on a non-recurring basis resulted in impairment that we have recorded to Impairment of long-lived assets in our consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 Total impairment losses may reflect the impact of remeasuring long-lived assets held and used (including land, buildings, leasehold improvements, favorable lease assets and ROU assets) to fair value as a result of (1) the deterioration in operating performance of certain Company-operated restaurants and (2) the Company s decision to lease and/or sublease the land and/or buildings to franchisees in connection with the sale or anticipated sale of restaurants, including any subsequent lease modifications. The fair values of long-lived assets held and used presented in the tables below represent the remaining carrying value and were estimated based on either discounted cash flows of future anticipated lease and sublease income or discounted cash flows of future anticipated Company-operated restaurant performance.

 years and vest ratably over or cliff vest after . The exercise price of options granted is equal to the market price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of stock options on the date of grant is calculated using the Black-Scholes Model. The aggregate intrinsic value of an option is the amount by which the fair value of the underlying stock exceeds its exercise price. 
 
 Granted Exercised ) Forfeited and/or expired ) Outstanding at January 1, 2023

 Expected option life in years Expected volatility Expected dividend yield 
 
 The risk-free interest rate represents the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bond yield correlating to the expected life of the stock options granted. The expected option life represents the period of time that the stock options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical exercise trends for similar grants. The expected volatility is based on the historical market price volatility of the Company over a period equivalent to the expected option life. The expected dividend yield represents the Company s annualized average yield for regular quarterly dividends declared prior to the respective stock option grant dates. 
 
 The Black-Scholes Model has limitations on its effectiveness including that it was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable and that the model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions, such as expected stock price volatility. Employee stock option awards have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates.

The quantity of shares awarded ranges from to of Target, as defined in the award agreement as the midpoint number of shares, based on the level of achievement of the performance and market conditions. 
 
 The fair values of the performance condition awards granted in 2022, 2021 and 2020 were determined using the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the date of grant, as set forth in the applicable plan document. Share-based compensation expense recorded for performance condition awards is reevaluated at each reporting period based on the probability of the achievement of the goal. 
 
 The fair value of market condition awards granted in 2022, 2021 and 2020 were estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The Monte Carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables to estimate the probability that the market conditions will be achieved and is applied to the trading price of our common stock on the date of grant.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The management of the Company, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), as of January 1, 2023. Based on such evaluations, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of January 1, 2023, the disclosure controls and procedures of the Company were effective at a reasonable assurance level in (1) recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act and (2) ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in such reports is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act). The management of the Company, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an assessment of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting for the Company as of January 1, 2023. The assessment was performed using the criteria for effective internal control reflected in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 
 Based on the assessment of the system of internal control for the Company, the management of the Company believes that as of January 1, 2023, internal control over financial reporting of the Company was effective. 
 
 Our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte Touche LLP, has issued an attestation report dated March 1, 2023 on the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in the internal control over financial reporting of the Company during the fourth quarter of 2022 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 
 There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any control system, including the potential for human error and the possible circumvention or overriding of controls and procedures. Additionally, judgments in decision-making can be faulty and breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. An effective control system can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control objectives of the system are adequately met. Accordingly, the management of the Company, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the control system can prevent or detect all error or fraud. Finally, projections of any evaluation or assessment of effectiveness of a control system to future periods are subject to the risks that, over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in an entity s operating environment or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Wendy s Company 
 
 Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Wendy s Company and subsidiaries (the Company as of January 1, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 
 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended January 1, 2023, of the Company and our report dated March 1, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
