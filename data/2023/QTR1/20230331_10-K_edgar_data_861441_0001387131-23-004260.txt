to assist in the making of offers and sales of Class A, A2, B, I and R Units. The Fund currently has approximately 100 selling
agents. The selling agents are not required to purchase any Class A, A2, B, I or R Units, or sell any specific number or dollar

Description of Current Charges 

Charges 
 Amount 
 
 Trading Advisor Management Fees 
 
 Each class of Units incurs monthly trading advisor management
 fees, payable monthly or quarterly in arrears, to the Trading Advisors (based on the assets under their management). The fees range
 from 0 to 3 annually. 

Trading Advisor Incentive Fees 
 
 Each class of Units incurs quarterly or annual trading advisor
 incentive fees, payable in arrears to the Trading Advisors, for any Net New Trading Profits generated on the portion
 of the Fund the respective Trading Advisor manages. The incentive fees range from 0 to 30 . 
 
 Net New Trading Profits are calculated
 based on formulas defined in each Trading Advisor s trading agreement. In determining Net New Trading Profits, any trading
 losses generated by the respective Trading Advisor for the Fund in prior periods are carried forward, so that the incentive fee
 is assessed only if and to the extent the profits generated by the Trading Advisor for the period exceed any losses from prior
 periods. The loss carry-forward is proportionally reduced if and to the extent the Fund reduces the amount of assets allocated
 to the Trading Advisor. 

Brokerage Commissions and Trading Expenses 
 
 The Fund incurs brokerage commissions and
 expenses on U.S. futures exchanges at an average of 2.79 per round-turn futures transaction (includes NFA, execution,
 clearing and exchange fees). Brokerage commissions and expenses may be higher for trades executed on certain foreign exchanges. 

Cash Manager Fees

 in arrears to the Cash Manager, equal to approximately 1/12 th of 0.14 of the investments in securities and certificates
 of deposit. 

General Partner Management Fee 
 
 The Fund incurs a monthly fee on Class A, A2, B, and R Units
 equal to 1/12 th of 1.5 of the month-end net asset value of the Class A, A2, B and R Units, payable in arrears. The
 Fund incurs a monthly fee on Class I Units equal to 1/12 th of 0.75 of the month-end net asset value of the Class I
 Units, payable in arrears. 

General Partner Performance Fee 
 
 The Fund incurs a monthly fee on Class I Units equal to 7.5 
 of any Net Profits of the Class I Units calculated monthly. The general partner performance fee is payable quarterly in arrears. 
 
 In determining Net Profits, any net losses incurred by the Class
 I Units in prior periods are carried forward, so that the incentive fee is assessed only if and to the extent the profits generated
 by the Class I units exceed any losses from prior periods. 

General Partner 1 percent allocation 
 
 Each year, the General Partner receives an annual allocation
 of 1 of net income earned by the Fund or pays to the Fund 1 of any net loss incurred by the Fund. 

Selling Agent Fees and Broker Dealer Servicing Fees 
 
 The General Partner charges monthly selling agent fees and/or
 broker dealer servicing fees to certain classes of units, as follows: 
 
 Class A Units pay a 2 per annum selling agent fee. 
 Class A2 Units may pay an up-front sales commission of up to 3 of the offering price and a 0.6 per annum selling agent
fee. 
 Class
B Units pay a 0.2 per annum broker dealer servicing fee. 
 
 The General Partner, in turn, pays selling agent fees and broker
 dealer servicing fees to the respective selling agents. If selling agent fees are not paid to the selling agents, such portions
 of the selling agent fees may be retained by the General Partner.

Market Sectors 

The Fund trades speculatively, through the
allocation of its assets to Trading Advisors, in U.S. and international futures markets, and may trade or hold futures, forwards,
swaps or options. Specifically, the Fund trades futures on agricultural commodities, currencies, energy products, equity indices,
interest rate instruments, metals and single stock futures. The Fund also trades forward currency contracts and may trade options,
swaps and other forwards other than currencies in the future. 

5 

Market Types 

The Fund trades on a variety of U.S. and international futures
exchanges. As in the case of its market sector allocations, the Fund s commitments to different types of markets - U.S. and
non-U.S., regulated and non-regulated - differ substantially from time to time, as well as over time, and may change at any time
if a Trading Advisor, with the approval of the General Partner, determines such change to be in the best interests of the Fund. 

Regulations 

The Fund is a registrant with the SEC pursuant to
the 1934 Act. As a registrant, the Fund is subject to the regulations of the SEC and the reporting requirements of the 1934 Act.
As a commodity pool, the Fund is subject to the regulations of the CFTC, an agency of the U.S. government, which regulates most
aspects of the commodity futures industry; rules of the NFA, an industry self-regulatory organization; and the requirements of
commodity exchanges where the Fund executes transactions. Additionally, the Fund is subject to the requirements of futures commission
merchants, futures brokers and Interbank market makers through which the Fund trades. 

Commodity exchanges in the U.S.
are subject to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act CEAct ), by the CFTC, the governmental agency having responsibility
for regulation of commodity exchanges and commodity interest trading conducted thereon. The function of the CFTC is to implement
the objectives of the CEAct of preventing price manipulation and excessive speculation and promoting orderly and efficient commodities
markets. In addition, the various commodity exchanges themselves exercise regulatory and supervisory authority over their members. 

The CFTC has exclusive authority
to designate exchanges for the trading of specific futures contracts and options on futures contracts and physicals and to prescribe
rules and regulations for the marketing of each. The CFTC also possesses exclusive jurisdiction to regulate the activities of commodity
trading advisors, commodity pool operators, introducing brokers, futures commodity merchants, swap dealers and floor brokers, among
others, and may suspend, modify or terminate the registration of any registrant for failure to comply with CFTC rules or regulations.
Furthermore, the CEAct establishes an administrative procedure under which commodity customers may institute complaints for damages
arising from alleged violations of the CEAct by persons registered with the CFTC reparations ). The CEAct also gives
the states certain powers to enforce its provisions and the regulations of the CFTC. 

Pursuant to authority in the
CEAct, the NFA has been formed and registered with the CFTC as a registered futures association. At the present time,
the NFA is the only non-exchange self-regulatory organization for commodities professionals. The CFTC has delegated to the NFA
responsibility for certain registration processing. The General Partner, the Fund s futures brokers and swap dealers are
members of the NFA (the Fund itself is not required to become a member of the NFA). As members, they are subject to NFA standards
relating to fair trade practices, financial condition and consumer protection. As the self-regulatory body of the commodities industry,
the NFA promulgates rules governing the conduct of commodity professionals and disciplines those professionals which do not comply
with such standards. The NFA also arbitrates disputes between members and their customers and conducts registration and fitness
screening of applicants for membership and audits of its existing members. 

The regulations of the CFTC and
the NFA prohibit any representation by a person registered with the CFTC or by any member of the NFA that such registration or
membership, respectively, in any respect indicates that the CFTC or the NFA, as the case may be, has approved or endorsed such
person or such person s trading program or objectives. The registrations and memberships described above must not be considered
as constituting any such approval or endorsement. No commodity exchange has given or will give any such approval or endorsement. 

The regulation of commodity trading
in the U.S. and other countries is an evolving area of law, particularly in the context of implementing various aspects of Dodd-Frank
and similar laws being implemented in other countries. The various statements made herein are subject to modification by legislative
action and changes in the rules and regulations of the CFTC, NFA, and commodity exchanges or other regulatory bodies. 

Competition 

The Fund operates in a competitive environment in
which it faces several forms of competition, including, without limitation, the following: 

The
Fund competes with other commodity pools and other investment vehicles for investors. 

The
Trading Advisors may compete with other traders in the markets in establishing or liquidating positions on behalf of the Fund.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

No Limitations on Trading Policies 

The Fund s Partnership Agreement places no limitation
on the trading policies the General Partner may pursue for the Fund. 

Potential Increase in Leverage 

The General Partner may increase the leverage used with a particular
Trading Advisor by the use of notional funds. Notional funds are used when a Trading Advisor is instructed to trade an account
according to its trading system under the assumption that the account is larger than the actual cash or securities on hand. This
additional leverage, while creating additional profit potential which the General Partner feels may be appropriate with certain
Trading Advisors in light of the Fund s multi-trader diversification, also increases the risk of loss to the Fund. It is
anticipated that the General Partner will allocate between 1 and 2 to the Trading Advisors for every 1 of equity in the Fund.
Throughout 2022, the Fund maintained a notional trading level of approximately 1.60 for every 1 of equity in the Fund. 

Volatility 

The volatility of the Fund is expected to be similar to what
it has been in the past, although it could be more or less volatile in the future depending upon the volatility of the market,
the success of the Trading Advisors and the level of notional funding used by the General Partner in its allocations to the Trading
Advisors. 

Liquidity 

Although the Fund offers monthly redemptions, the Fund may delay
payment if special circumstances require, such as a market emergency that prevents the liquidation of commodity positions or a
delay or default in payment to the Fund by a futures broker or a counterparty. 

Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic 

The ongoing coronavirus situation could cause unpredictable
rapid market changes and increased volatility, which could negatively affect the trading programs of the Trading Advisors. 

Fund Expenses Will Be Substantial 

The Fund is obligated to pay brokerage expenses, Trading Advisor
management and incentive fees, General Partner management and incentive fees, ongoing selling agent fees, Cash Manager fees and
other administrative fees, regardless of whether it realizes profits. The Fund will need to make substantial trading profits to
avoid depletion of its assets from these expenses. 

Reliance on General Partner 

The Fund s success depends significantly on the General
Partner s ability to select Trading Advisors and support the operations of the Fund. 

7 

Dependence on Key Personnel 

The General Partner is dependent on the services of key management
personnel. 

Reliance on the Trading Advisors 

The Fund s success depends largely on the ability of its
Trading Advisors. There can be no assurance that their trading methods will produce profits (or not generate losses). Past performance
is not necessarily indicative of future results. 

Reliance on Futures Brokers Financial Condition 

If one of the futures brokers becomes insolvent, the Fund might
incur a loss of all or a portion of the funds it had deposited directly or indirectly with such futures broker. There is no government
insurance for commodity brokerage accounts. Such a loss could occur if one of the futures brokers unlawfully failed to segregate
its customers funds or if a customer failed to pay a deficiency in its account. 

Use of Cash Manager 

A significant percentage of the Fund s assets not placed
as margin with the futures brokers are managed by PGI. Using investment guidelines established by the General Partner, PGI may
invest the excess margin in U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. and foreign government sponsored enterprise notes, commercial paper,
corporate notes, asset backed securities and certificates of deposit. Although these investments are considered to be high quality,
some of the securities purchased are neither guaranteed by the U.S. government nor supported by the full faith and credit of the
U.S. government. There is some risk that a security issuer may fail to pay the interest and principal in a timely manner, or that
negative perceptions about the issuer s ability to make such payments will cause the price of these instruments to decline
in value. 

Investment in Other Investment Pools 

The Fund invests in other pools. The Fund expects to be liable
to those pools (e.g., limited partners), only for the amount of its investment plus any undistributed profits. However, there can
be no assurance in this regard, and the Fund might invest as a general partner if the situation warranted, and thus be liable for
additional amounts. If the Fund does invest in other pools, investors in the Fund could be subject to additional fees, as the Fund
would be charged fees by the other pools. 

Investment in pools (or similar investment vehicles), as distinguished
from direct participation in the markets, has several potential disadvantages. Those investments may increase the Fund s
expenses, since the Fund will have to pay its pro rata share of the expenses borne by the investors in the pools, and the pools
may have higher expenses. The Fund will generally be a minority investor in those pools and thus lack control over the pools. The
pools might (a) change trading policies, strategies and trading advisors without prior notice to the Fund; (b) substantially restrict
the ability of their investors to withdraw their capital from the pools; (c) be new ventures with little or no operating history;
(d) be general rather than limited partnerships, thus increasing the Fund s liability; and/or (e) use aggressive leveraging
policies. 

Use of Electronic Trading 

The Trading Advisors may
use electronic trading while implementing their strategies on behalf of the Fund. Electronic trading differs from traditional methods
of trading. Electronic system transactions are subject to the rules and regulations of the exchanges offering the system or listing
the specific contracts. Attributes of electronic trading may vary widely among the various electronic trading systems with respect
to order requirements, processes and administration. There may also be differences regarding conditions for access and reasons
for termination and limitations on the types of orders that may be placed into the system. These factors may present various risk
factors with respect to trading on or using a specific system. Electronic trading systems may also possess particular risks related
to system access, varying response times and security procedures. Internet enabled systems may also have additional risks associated
with service providers and the delivery and monitoring of electronic communications. 

Electronic trading may also
be subject to risks associated with system or component failure. In the event of system or component failure, it is possible that
a Trading Advisor may not be able to initiate new orders, fill existing orders or modify or cancel orders that were previously
entered, as well as exit existing positions. System or component failure may also result in loss of orders or order priority. Some
contracts offered on an electronic trading system may also be traded electronically and through open outcry during the same trading
hours. Exchanges offering an electronic trading system which lists contracts may have implemented rules to limit their liability,
the liability of futures brokers, as well as software and communication system vendors and the damages that may be collected for
system inoperability and delays. These limitations of liability provisions may vary among the various exchanges. 

8 

Changes in Trading Strategies 

The trading strategies of the Trading Advisors are continually
developing. The Trading Advisors are free to make any changes in their trading strategies, without notice, if they feel that doing
so will be in the Fund s best interest. The General Partner will notify the limited partners of any such changes that the
General Partner considers material. Changes in commodities or the markets traded shall not be deemed a change in trading strategy. 

Disadvantages of Periodic Incentive Fees 

Because the Trading Advisor incentive fees (if any) are paid
on a quarterly or annual basis, they could receive incentive fees for a period even though their trading for the year was unprofitable.
Once an incentive fee is paid, the Trading Advisors retain the fee regardless of their subsequent performance, but no new incentive
fees will be paid until after all previous losses have been recovered. 

Disadvantages of Multi-Trader Structure 

The Fund s use of multiple Trading Advisors to conduct
its trading has several potential disadvantages. Each Trading Advisor is paid incentive fees solely on the basis of its trading
for the Fund. The Fund, therefore, could have periods in which it pays fees to one or more Trading Advisors even though the Fund,
as a whole, has a loss for the period (because the losses incurred by the Fund from unprofitable Trading Advisors exceed the profits
earned by the Fund from profitable Trading Advisors). 

Because the Trading Advisors trade independently of each other,
they may establish offsetting positions for the Fund. For example, one Trading Advisor may sell 12 March wheat contracts at the
same time another Trading Advisor buys 12 March wheat contracts. The net effect for the Fund will be the incurring of two brokerage
commissions without the potential for earning a profit (or incurring a loss). 

Under certain unusual circumstances, the Fund might have to
direct a Trading Advisor to liquidate positions in order to generate funds needed to meet margin calls, to fund the redemption
of Units, or to permit the reallocation of funds to another Trading Advisor. Such liquidations could disrupt the Trading Advisor s
trading system or method. 

Disadvantages of Replacing Trading Advisors 

The General Partner has the authority to reallocate the Fund s
assets among the Trading Advisors, terminate Trading Advisors and allocate assets to new Trading Advisor(s), or invest the Fund s
assets in other investment funds or commodity pools. 

Trading Advisors generally have to make up previous
trading losses incurred by the Fund on portions of the Fund the Trading Advisors are managing, before they can earn an incentive
fee. However, a Trading Advisor might terminate its services to the Fund or the General Partner might decide to replace a Trading
Advisor when it has such a loss carry-forward. The Fund might have to pay a new Trading Advisor higher advisory fees than are currently
being paid to the current Trading Advisor. In addition, the Fund would lose the potential benefit of not having to pay the Trading
Advisor an incentive fee during the time that the Trading Advisor was generating profits that made up for the prior losses. The
replacement Trading Advisor would start from scratch, that is, the Fund would have to pay a new Trading Advisor an
incentive fee for each dollar of profit it generated for the Fund, regardless of the Fund s previous experience. 

Limited Partners Do Not Participate in Management 

Limited partners are not entitled to participate in the management
of the Fund or the conduct of its business. 

Non-Transferability of Units 

Investors may acquire Units only for investment and not for
resale, and the Units are transferable only with the General Partner s consent, provided that the economic benefits of ownership
of a limited partner may be transferred or assigned without the consent of the General Partner. There will be no resale market
for the Units. However, limited partners may redeem all or (subject to certain limitations) any portion of their Units at the end
of any month, on five business days written notice to the General Partner. 

9 

Possible Adverse Effect of Large Redemptions 

The Trading Advisors trading strategies could be disrupted
by large redemptions by limited partners. For example, such redemptions could require the Trading Advisors to prematurely liquidate
futures positions they had established for the Fund. 

Mandatory Redemptions 

The General Partner may require a limited partner to redeem
from the Fund if the General Partner deems the redemption (a) necessary to prevent or correct the occurrence of a nonexempt prohibited
transaction under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
(b) beneficial to the Fund or (c) necessary to comply with state, federal, or other self-regulatory organization regulations. 

Cybersecurity Breaches 

The Fund and Traders are subject to risks associated with a
breach in their cybersecurity. Cybersecurity is a generic term used to describe the technology, processes and practices designed
to protect networks, systems, computers, programs and data from hacking by other computer users, other unauthorized
access and the resulting damage and disruption of hardware and software systems, loss or corruption of data as well as misappropriation
of confidential information. If a cybersecurity breach occurs, the Fund may incur substantial costs, including (without limitation)
those associated with: forensic analysis of the origin and scope of the breach; increased and upgraded cybersecurity; investment
losses from sabotaged trading systems; identity theft; unauthorized use of proprietary information; litigation; adverse investor
reaction; the unauthorized dissemination of confidential and proprietary information; and reputational damage. Any such breach
could expose each of the General Partner, the applicable Trader, and/or the Fund to civil liability as well as regulatory inquiry
and/or action. In addition, any such breach could cause substantial withdrawals from the Fund. 

Indemnification 

The Fund is required to indemnify the General Partner, the Trading
Advisors and the futures brokers, and their affiliates, against various liabilities they may incur in providing services to the
Fund, provided the indemnified party met the standard of conduct specified in the applicable indemnification clause. The Fund s
indemnification obligations could require the Fund to make substantial indemnification payments. 

Termination of Fund 

The Fund will have an indefinite lifetime, unless terminated
earlier as provided in the Partnership Agreement. For example, the General Partner can withdraw as general partner on 90 days 
prior written notice, and such a withdrawal could result in termination of the Fund. The General Partner has no present intention
of withdrawing and intends to continue the Fund business as long as it believes that it is in the best interest of all partners
to do so. In addition, certain other events may occur which could result in early termination. 

Lack of Regulation 

The Fund is not an investment company under the federal securities
laws. Thus, limited partners will not have the benefits of federal regulation of investment companies. 

Conflicts of Interest 

The General Partner and its principals have organized and are
involved in other business ventures and may have incentives to favor certain of these ventures over the Fund. The Fund will not
share in the risks or rewards of such other ventures. However, such other ventures will compete for the General Partner s
and its principals time and attention, which might create other conflicts of interest. The Partnership Agreement does not
require the General Partner to devote any particular amount of time to the Fund. 

The General Partner or any of its affiliates or any person connected
with it may invest in, directly or indirectly, or manage or advise other investment funds or accounts which invest in assets which
may also be purchased or sold by the Fund. Neither the General Partner nor any of its affiliates nor any person connected with
it is under any obligation to offer investment opportunities of which any of them becomes aware to the Fund or to account to the
Fund in respect of (or share with the Fund or inform the Fund of) any such transaction or any benefit received by any of them from
any such transaction, but will allocate such opportunities on an equitable basis between the Fund and other clients. 

10 

Payment of Incentive Fees to the Trading Advisors 

 The Trading Advisors are entitled to incentive fees, therefore
the Trading Advisors may have an incentive to cause the Fund to make riskier or more speculative investments than it otherwise
would. 

Personal Trading 

 The Trading Advisors, the futures brokers, the General Partner
and the principals and affiliates thereof may trade commodity interests for their own account. In such trading, positions might
be taken which are opposite those of the Fund, or that compete with the Fund s trades. 

Trades by the Trading Advisors and their Principals 

 The Trading Advisors and their principals may trade for their
own accounts in addition to directing trading for client accounts. Therefore, the Trading Advisors and their principals may be
deemed to have a conflict of interest concerning the sequence in which orders for transactions will be transmitted for execution.
Additionally, a potential conflict may occur when the Trading Advisors and their principals, as a result of a neutral allocation
system, testing a new trading system, trading their own proprietary account(s) more aggressively, or any other actions that would
not constitute a violation of fiduciary duties, take positions in their own proprietary account(s) which are opposite, or ahead
of, the position(s) taken for a client. Proprietary accounts, in trading a new or experimental system, may enter the same markets
earlier than (either days before or on the same day) client accounts traded at the same or other futures commission merchants.
Since the principals of the Trading Advisors trade futures and foreign exchange for their own accounts, there is potentially a
conflict of interest between these principals and the Trading Advisors clients when allocating prices on trades that are
executed by a futures commission merchant at multiple prices. In such instances, the Trading Advisors use a non-preferential method
of fill allocation. The clients of the Trading Advisors will not be permitted to inspect the personal trading records of the Trading
Advisors, futures brokers and forward currency counterparties, or their respective principals, or the written policies relating
to such trading. Client records are not available for inspection due to their confidential nature. 

Effects of Speculative Position Limits 

 The CFTC and domestic exchanges have established speculative
position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures position which any person, or group of persons, or group of persons
acting in concert, may hold or control in particular futures contracts or options on futures traded on U.S. commodity exchanges.
All commodity accounts owned or controlled by the Trading Advisors and their principals are combined for speculative position limits.
Because speculative position limits allow the Trading Advisors and their principals to control only a limited number of contracts
in any one commodity, the Trading Advisors and their principals are potentially subject to a conflict among the interests of all
accounts the Trading Advisors and their principals control which are competing for shares of that limited number of contracts.
There exists a conflict between the Trading Advisors interest in maintaining a smaller position in an individual client s
account in order to also provide positions in the specific commodity to other accounts under management and the personal accounts
of the Trading Advisors and their principals. The General Partner does not believe, however, that the position limits are likely
to impair the Trading Advisors trading for the Fund, although it is possible the issue could arise in the future. 

To the extent that position limits restrict the total number
of commodity positions which may be held by the Fund and those other accounts, the Trading Advisors will allocate the orders equitably
between the Fund and such other accounts. Similarly, where orders for the same commodity given on behalf of both the Fund and other
accounts managed by the Trading Advisors cannot be executed in full, the Trading Advisors will equitably allocate between the Fund
and such other accounts that portion of the total quantity able to be executed. 

Other Activities of the Principals of the Advisors 

 Certain principals of the Trading Advisors are currently engaged,
and expect in the future to be engaged, in other activities, some of which may involve other business activities in the futures
industry. In addition, each principal of the Trading Advisors may be engaged in trading for his own personal account. The principals
will have a conflict of interest between their obligations to devote all of their attention to client accounts and their interests
in engaging in other activities. However, the principals of the Trading Advisors intend to devote substantial attention to the
operation and activities of the Trading Advisors consistent with the division of responsibilities among them as is described herein. 

Fiduciary Responsibility of the General Partner 

 The General Partner has a fiduciary duty to the Fund to exercise
good faith and fairness in all dealings affecting the Fund. If a limited partner believes this duty has been violated, he/she may
seek legal relief under applicable law, for himself/herself and other similarly situated partners, or on behalf of the Fund. However,
it may be difficult for limited partners to obtain relief because of the changing nature of the law in this area, the vagueness
of standards defining required conduct and the broad discretion given the General Partner in the Partnership Agreement and the
exculpatory provisions therein. 

11 

Selling Agents 

 The receipt by the selling agents and their registered representatives
of continued sales commissions and/or servicing fees for outstanding Units may give them an incentive to advise limited partners
to remain investors in the Fund. These payments cease to the extent the limited partners withdraw from the Fund. 

The General Partner Serving as Selling Agent 

 The General Partner also serves as a selling agent for the Fund.
As a result, the fees and other compensation received by the General Partner as selling agent have not been independently negotiated. 

Futures Brokers 

 The futures brokers affect transactions for customers (including
public and private commodity pools), including the Fund, who may compete with the Fund s transactions including with respect
to priorities or order entry. Since the identities of the purchaser and seller are not disclosed until after the trade, it is possible
that the futures brokers could affect transactions for the Fund in which the other parties to the transactions are the futures
brokers officers, directors, employees, customers or affiliates. Such persons might also compete with the Fund in making
purchases or sales of commodities without knowing that the Fund is also bidding on such commodities. Since orders are filled in
the order in which they are received by a particular floor broker, transactions for any of such persons might be executed when
similar trades for the Fund are not executed or are executed at less favorable prices. However, in entering orders for the Fund
and other customer accounts, including with respect to priorities of order entry and allocations of executed trades, CFTC regulations
prohibit a futures commission merchant from utilizing its knowledge of one customer s trades for its own or its other customer s
benefit.

Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Current Positioning 

The outcome of the ongoing coronavirus
situation is uncertain and could have a positive or negative impact on the performance of the Fund. In addition to the tragic human
impacts of the virus, the resulting economic fallout appears recessionary. The past two U.S. recessions, in 2000 and 2008, were
two of the best performing periods for the Fund. However, the future will not unfold exactly like the past and the Fund s
performance in the future is unknowable. 

The Fund s exposures evolve dynamically
based on the tactical opportunities perceived by the underlying systematic trading programs. As macroeconomic trends change course,
for example becoming more bearish, we would expect the portfolio s exposures to adapt accordingly. For example, the Fund s
current positioning has changed substantially from year end.

Results from past periods are not
necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any future period. Monthly analysis of the trading gains and losses
is provided below. 

2022 

 January 

As the new COVID-19 variant s control and impact on financial
markets lessened, fears of an aggressive Federal Reserve and inflation took hold. These events drove the S P 500 Index down
by about -9.7 in the opening weeks of 2022. The January Federal Reserve meeting saw a continuation of the hawkish stance set forth
by the central bank, indicating the need to begin raising interest rates and winding down its 9 billion balance sheet. This drove
yields higher as investors rotated out of fixed income securities. The U.S. 10-Year Treasury rose 0.27 in January, to close the
month at 1.78 . Much to the surprise of economists, the U.S. added half a million new jobs in the month, showing the resilience
of the labor market through the Omicron variant wave. Against the backdrop of geopolitical tensions with Russia and Ukraine, along
with rising global demand, oil prices continued their upward trend as West Texas Intermediate surged over +17 to start the year. 

Futures Portfolio Fund s modest negative returns in
January were driven by interest rates and equity indices, while energy and agricultural commodities contributed positively to
performance. Despite the overall negative return for the month, the Fund s ability to go both long and short helped
mitigate losses relative to major bond and equity indices. In fixed income, mixed bond positioning detracted as yields
finished the month significantly higher. Also detracting was long equity positioning, as volatility in the U.S. and abroad
proved difficult for the Fund s managers. In energy trading, consistent long oil and oil product positioning
contributed the most, as prices rose sharply due to the aforementioned reasons. The Fund finished with a net loss of (0.36) ,
(0.25) , (0.26) , (0.21) , (0.14) and (0.20) for Class A, A2, A3, B, I, and R Units, respectively. 

17 

February 

 COVID-19 related market shocks continue to fall by the wayside
as rising interest rates and geopolitical tensions dominated the headlines in February. The combination of these events drove the
S P 500 Index down -2.99 in February, bringing year-to-date 2022 performance down to -8.01 . The continued hawkish stance
by the Federal Reserve, coupled with persistent high inflation metrics drove bond yields higher for much of the month. This upward
trend in bonds quickly shifted on reports of the invasion of Ukraine by Russia. The U.S. 10-Year Treasury fell from highs around
2 as investors quickly shifted to risk-off assets. This level of rates marks a new high since late 2019. Against the backdrop
of geopolitical tensions with Russia and Ukraine, oil prices continued their blistering upward trend as West Texas Intermediate
surged over +9 in February, bringing the year-to-date increase up over +28 . 

Futures Portfolio Fund s positive returns in February
were driven by energy, agricultural commodities, and interest rates, while currencies and stock indices modestly detracted from
performance. The strong month highlighted the Fund s ability to be sizably invested in different themes, which has helped
mitigate losses relative to major bond and equity indices. In energy, consistent long oil and oil product positioning contributed
positively as supply fears stemmed from aforementioned reasons. Also contributing were long agricultural positioning which benefited
from supply constraints. Detracting from performance was short dollar and long equity positioning, as volatility in those markets
proved difficult for the Fund s managers. The Fund finished with a net gain of 1.97 , 2.09 , 2.07 , 2.12 , 2.20 and 2.14 
for Class A, A2, A3, B, I, and R Units, respectively. 

March 

 Rising interest rates and the war in Ukraine dominated news
headlines in March. While the S P 500 Index finished the month up +3.71 , these events contributed to a significant amount
of volatility, bringing year-to-date performance for the equity index down -4.60 . Renewed hawkish comments by the Federal Reserve,
coupled with relentless higher inflation metrics drove bond yields up during the month. Most notably, on the last day of March,
the U.S. 2-year Treasury yield briefly rose above the U.S. 10-year yield, also known as an inversion , which was last
seen in 2019. Investors view this market phenomenon as a potential warning signal of a looming recession. Against the backdrop
of Russia s attack on Ukraine, oil prices continued their blistering upward trend as West Texas Intermediate surged over
+7 in March, bringing the year-to-date increase up over +38 , reaching its highest level since 2008. 

Futures Portfolio Fund s strong return in March (+9.37 received positive contributions from all sectors with energy, currencies, and interest rates leading the way. The strong month
highlighted the Fund s ability to be sizably invested in different themes, which has helped mitigate losses relative to major
bond and equity indices in 2022. In energy, deceasing long positioning contributed positively as supply fears stemmed from the
aforementioned reasons. Also contributing was long dollar/short foreign currency positioning, which benefited from a flight-to-quality
early in the month. Consistent short bond positioning also contributed as yields rose across the globe on the back of rising inflation.
While metals, agricultural commodities, and stock indices lagged the other sectors, we are still pleased with their contribution
to overall portfolio performance and diversification. The Fund finished with a net gain of 9.12 , 9.25 , 9.24 , 9.29 , 9.37 and
9.30 for Class A, A2, A3, B, I, and R Units, respectively. 

April 

 As Russia s invasion of Ukraine entered its 3rd month,
investors continued to size up daily news flow out of the region along with the increasing pressures of inflation. The S P
500 Index added to its negative 2022 performance as April proved to be the worst month for the index since March of 2020, bringing
the YTD return to down -12.92 . Continued hawkish comments by the Federal Reserve, coupled with relentless higher inflation metrics
drove bond yields higher during the month. Most notably, the U.S. 10-year yield encroached on a critical 3 level, a point not
seen since late 2018. Against the backdrop of Russia s attack on Ukraine and the uncertainty of supply, oil prices continued
their upward trend as West Texas Intermediate surged over +3 in April, bringing the year-to-date increase up over +43 . 

Futures Portfolio Fund added to its strong start in 2022
with contributions from currencies, interest rates, energy products, and agricultural commodities, while equities modestly
detracted. The strong month highlighted the Fund s ability to be sizably invested in different themes, which has helped
provide positive performance against the losses by major bond and equity indices in 2022. In currency trading, long U.S.
dollar positioning throughout the month contributed positively as real yields moved into positive territory along with a
boost from the flight to safety. Also contributing was consistent short bond positioning as yields rose across the globe on
the back of rising inflation. Choppy equity markets (as opposed to more sustained trends) provided a difficult environment
for the Fund s managers to take advantage of. As we enter the second quarter of 2022, we are pleased with the portfolio
performance and diversification it is providing investors. The Fund finished with a net gain of 5.88 , 6.00 , 5.99 , 6.04 ,
6.12 and 6.06 for Class A, A2, A3, B, I, and R Units, respectively. 

May 

 Rising inflation and concerns surrounding China s zero
COVID policy drove financial markets in May as investors assessed their subsequent impact on global economic growth. The S P
500 Index posted modestly positive performance in May, bringing year-to-date performance to down -12.76 . The Index s slight
gain did not come without its fair share of volatility as numerous companies issued cautious outlooks, raising questions about
economic growth and health of the consumer. Additionally, U.S. 10-year yields encroached on a critical 3 level, a point not seen
since late 2018. Against the backdrop of Russia s attack on Ukraine and the uncertainty of supply, oil prices continued their
upward trend as West Texas Intermediate surged over +11 in May, bringing the year-to-date increase up over +60 . 

18 

Futures Portfolio Fund the Fund had a
small net loss in May, as currencies, interest rates, and agricultural commodities gave back some of their sizable gains from
earlier in the year. In currency trading, long U.S. dollar positioning throughout the month detracted as the extended rally
stalled on the back of slowing U.S. yield increases. Also detracting from performance was fixed income as range-bound markets
provided a difficult trading environment for the Fund s managers. Energy trading was a positive contributor during the
month, however, as consistent long exposure was able to capture the general upward trend due to aforementioned reasons. The
Fund finished with a net loss of (0.98) , (0.86) , (0.88) , (0.83) , (0.75) , and (0.81) for Class A, A2, A3, B, I, and R
Units, respectively. 

June 

 While the macro drivers from earlier in the year continued
into June, market participants focus shifted to the Federal Reserve s response to these events. The S P 500 Index
added to its negative year-to-date return as June, down -8.25 , proved to be the second worst month this year. This brought the
2022 return to down -19.96 for the Index. Continued hawkish comments by the Federal Reserve, coupled with relentless higher inflation
metrics drove bond yields higher during the month. Most notably, the U.S. 10-year treasury yield rose to 3.49 , before retreating
and closing the month below 3 . 

Futures Portfolio Fund the Fund had a small
net loss in June, as agricultural commodities and energy products gave back some of their sizable gains from earlier in the year.
Gains in interest rates and currency trading were not enough to offset the aforementioned losses. Agricultural commodities, specifically
grains markets, detracted most from performance as persistently long positions were hurt by better-than-expected news regarding
weather, crop conditions, and exports from Ukraine. Contributing the most to performance was short fixed income positioning as
volatile markets provided ample trading opportunities to the Fund s trading advisors. The Fund finished with a net loss of
(0.98) , (0.87) , (0.83) , (0.76) , and (0.82) for Class A, A2, B, I, and R Units, respectively. 

July 

 Both stocks and bonds rebounded in July. While employment metrics
remain robust, falling energy prices and slowing economic growth boosted hopes that inflation is potentially peaking. Accordingly,
market participants became more optimistic that the Fed s interest rate hiking cycle may end sooner than previously thought
which contributed to the rally in equities and fixed income. The S P 500 Index posted its best month since 2020, up +9.22 ,
bringing year-to-date performance to down -12.58 . Bond yields fell steadily, with the U.S. 10-year treasury yield finishing July
at 2.64 , down from a high of 3.5 , earlier in the year. 

While Futures Portfolio Fund the Fund has
been able to capitalize on most of the dominant trends in the markets this year, the Fund had a negative return in July, with
all major sectors experiencing losses. As persistent trends reversed, the largest losses were realized in interest rates,
where long duration fixed income, specifically in Europe, detracted most from performance. Additionally, within the equity
sector, short European positioning turned unprofitable as quickly reversing and volatile markets created a difficult
environment for the Fund s trading advisors. The Fund finished with a net loss of (4.59) , (4.48) , (4.45) , (4.37) 
and (4.43) for Class A, A2, B, I, and R Units, respectively. 

August 

 Both stocks and bonds resumed their year-to-date downward trend
in August. While employment metrics remained historically robust, a hawkish Federal Reserve, to combat inflation, signaled to markets
the aggressive interest rate hikes were not over. The S P 500 Index was down -4.08 for the month, bringing year-to-date performance
to down -16.14 . August signaled the seventh month, out of eight so far in 2022, in which broad-based stock and bond indices moved
in the same direction. The Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index was down -2.83 as bond yields rose quickly. The U.S. 10-year Treasury
yield finished August at 3.15 , down from a high of 3.5 , earlier in the year. 

Futures Portfolio Fund added to its strong performance in 2022
with contributions from currencies and interest rates, while equities and agricultural commodities modestly detracted. The strong
month highlighted the Fund s ability to be sizably invested in different themes, which has helped provide a positive return
against the losses sustained by major bond and equity indices. In currency trading, long U.S. dollar positioning throughout the
month contributed positively as relatively high interest rates in the U.S. attracted foreign investment along with a boost from
flight to safety. Also contributing was short bond positioning as yields rose across the globe on the back of rising inflation.
Choppy equity markets, however, provided a difficult environment for the Fund s managers. As we enter the latter part of
2022, we are pleased with the portfolio s performance and diversification it is providing investors. The Fund finished with
a net gain of 3.58 , 3.70 , 3.73 , 3.81 and 3.75 for Class A, A2, B, I, and R Units, respectively. 

19 

September 

 Both stocks and bonds continued their downward trend in September.
The Federal Reserve maintained its hawkish stance amid elevated inflation reports, signaling to markets the aggressive rate hikes
were far from over. The S P 500 Index was down -9.21 in September, its worst month since March of 2020, bringing the year-to-date
return to negative -23.87 . The Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index was also down, -4.32 , its worst month since February 1980.
This marked the eighth month out of nine in 2022 in which broad-based stock and bond indices moved in the same direction. Oil markets
fell as recessionary fears, sparked by a Federal Reserve misstep, overwhelmed supply concerns relating to geopolitical tensions. 

Futures Portfolio Fund added to its solid performance in 2022
with contributions from currencies and interest rates, while energies and agricultural commodities modestly detracted. The strong
month again highlighted the Fund s ability to be sizably invested in different themes, which has helped provide a positive
return versus the losses sustained by major bond and equity indices. In currency trading, long U.S. dollar positioning contributed
positively as relatively high interest rates in the U.S. attracted foreign investment along with a boost from flight to safety.
Also contributing was short bond positioning as yields rose across the globe on the back of rising inflation. Volatile energy prices,
however, provided a difficult environment for the Fund s managers, resulting in small losses. As we enter the latter part
of 2022, we are pleased with the portfolio s performance and the diversification it is providing investors. The Fund finished
with a net gain of 5.10 , 5.22 , 5.26 , 5.34 and 5.27 for Class A, A2, B, I, and R Units, respectively. 

October 

 Stocks rebounded in October, in
sharp contrast to the prior month, while bonds did not fare so well, continuing the yearlong downward trend in fixed income. Optimism
of a potential pause in interest rate hikes buoyed global equity markets. The S P 500 Index was up +8.10 in October, its second-best
month in 2022, bringing the year-to-date return to -17.70 . The Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index was down -1.30 , bringing the
year-to-date return to -15.72 . Oil markets climbed as recessionary fears cooled, supporting demand expectations, and OPEC announced
production cuts to support falling prices. 

Futures Portfolio Fund added to its solid performance in 2022
with contributions from energy products and stock indices, while agricultural commodities modestly detracted. The positive month
once again highlighted the Fund s ability to be sizably invested in different themes, which has helped provide a positive
return versus the losses sustained by major bond and equity indices. In energy trading, long positioning in oil and oil-related
products contributed positively as markets rose for the aforementioned reasons. Also profitable in October were equities, particularly
long Asian indices, as prices rose amid anticipation that economic conditions were improving. Volatile agricultural commodity prices
provided a difficult environment for the Fund s managers, resulting in small losses. The Fund finished with a net gain of
0.97 , 1.09 , 1.12 , 1.20 and 1.14 for Class A, A2, B, I, and R Units, respectively. 

November 

 Stocks continued to recover in November,
adding to last month s gains, bringing the year-to-date return for the S P 50 Index to -13.10 . Bonds posted their first
positive month since July, up +3.68 , and best month since December 2008. Despite the positive month, the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate
Bond Index continues to be in its most difficult performance period since its inception in 1980, down -12.62 year-to-date. Positively
impacting both equity and fixed income was optimism surrounding a potential peak in inflation and possible pause in rate hikes.
As a result, the U.S. Dollar had its largest monthly loss since July 2010, down -5 , bringing its year-to-date return to +10.40 . 

Futures Portfolio Fund (the Fund fell in November,
posting its first monthly loss since July as many major trends, which had heavily contributed to year-to-date performance, sharply
reversed course. While all major sectors detracted, the Fund s managers were able to adjust for heightened market volatility
and adjust position sizing accordingly. This nimble approach, inherent in managing risk, allowed the Fund to stay well in positive
territory when it comes to the largest positive contributing markets thus far in 2022. Despite the negative performance, this month
highlighted the Fund s ability to be sizably invested in different themes, which has helped provide a positive return versus
the losses sustained by major bond and equity indices thus far in 2022. The Fund finished with a net loss of (9.01) , (8.90) ,
(8.87) , (8.80) and (8.85) for Class A, A2, B, I, and R Units, respectively. 

December 

 The S P 500 Index resumed its
downward trend in December, dropping -5.76 and capping off its largest annual loss since 2008, down -18.11 for the year. In addition,
bonds failed to protect investor capital, selling off -0.45 during the month and finishing the year down -13.01 , which was the
worst year on record for the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index. Negatively impacting equity and fixed income markets was pessimism
surrounding potential Federal Reserve policy missteps in the central bank s pursuit to stifle elevated inflation. The U.S.
Dollar, which had gained for much of the year, but reversed course in October, continued to slide, down over -2 , bringing its
year-to-date return to just over +7.50 . 

20 

Futures Portfolio Fund (the Fund fell modestly
in December as low volatility and range-bound markets provided limited trading opportunities for the Fund s managers. While
a majority of the Fund s sectors detracted from performance, the Fund was profitable in fixed income trading. Despite the
negative performance, this month highlighted the Fund s ability to be sizably invested in different themes, which has helped
provide a positive return versus the losses sustained by major bond and equity indices in 2022. The Fund finished with a net loss
of (1.63) , (1.52) , (1.48) , (1.41) and (1.47) for Class A, A2, B, I, and R Units, respectively. 

2021 

 January 

 Much of January was marked by increasing confidence in a post-pandemic
global recovery along with ongoing accommodative monetary policy which helped lift equities for the greater part of the month.
Ultimately global stocks finished down in January, however, as COVID variants and unusual retail activity in several highly shorted
stocks rattled investor confidence late in the month. Global bond yields rose (prices fell) with the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield
surging above 1 , buoyed by expectations for additional stimulus. Commodity prices also moved higher led by gains in energy and
agricultural markets. In oil markets, Saudi Arabia unexpectedly cut production helping to boost prices. Finally, the U.S. Dollar
strengthened on higher Treasury yields and expectations for fiscal stimulus. 

The Fund was profitable for most of January, continuing to build
on bullish trends in agricultural products and equities. However, the volatility of the markets in the last few days of the month
(the VIX spiked 62 on Jan. 27th) worked to offset those gains, resulting in a loss for the Fund that could not recovered before
month-end. Overall, during the month unprofitable trading in currency and fixed income markets more than offset positive contributions
from positions in agricultural commodities and, to a lesser extent, equities. Long foreign currency positions including the Euro
and Yen were hurt by the rallying dollar, which clawed back some of its losses from last year. In fixed income trading, long exposure
in the U.S. and Europe were hurt by rising rates. Long positions in agricultural commodities provided a lift, particularly in corn
and soybean. 

The Fund finished with a net loss of (2.02) , (1.90) , (1.92) ,
(1.87) , (1.80) and (1.86) for Class A, A2, A3, B, I, and R Units, respectively. 

February 

 In February, the reflation trade remained the dominant
theme for investors as encouraging economic data along with surging vaccination rates and declining COVID
cases/hospitalization helped spur optimism. Against this backdrop, global equities moved higher with the rotation towards
 re-opening stocks continuing. Commodities prices soared as oil surged nearly 20 on the improving economic
outlook along with constrained production. Copper moved above 4 per pound, its highest level since 2011. The bond market, as
measured by the Bloomberg Barclay s U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, was also impacted by the reflation trade and is now down
-2.15 in 2021. These concerns led to a jump of approximately 50 basis-point in the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, to 1.4 . 

The Fund had a positive return for February, bringing its YTD
return back into the black. Profitable trading in equity and commodity markets were the largest contributors as long positions
benefitted from the upward push in risk assets. Within commodities, the largest gains stemmed from long exposure in energy, notably
oil, while trading in metals and agricultural markets was also profitable. Fixed income produced losses, as rates seemed to have
found a bottom, and the uptick hurt the Fund s long positions. Trading models responded accordingly, and as a result, long
exposure fell sharply with long- and medium-term instruments shifting short by the end of the month. The Fund finished with a net
gain of 2.91 , 3.03 , 3.02 , 3.07 , 3.15 and 3.08 for Class A, A2, A3, B, I, and R Units, respectively. 

March 

 In March, the Fed communicated its intention to maintain easy
monetary policy until the economy is further along in its recovery. Market participants, however, were increasingly concerned about
building inflationary pressure in the U.S. from improving economic growth, the rapid acceleration in vaccinations, and implications
of the massive proposed 2 trillion infrastructure package and the recently passed 1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.
Accordingly, the 10-Year U.S. Treasury yield climbed to 1.75 intramonth as investors fear the Fed may need to act sooner than
it is currently communicating. Yields in Europe were little changed, however, as the increasing number of COVID cases and potential
for further lockdowns weighed on economic growth expectations. Global equities moved higher as the rotation toward cyclical recovery 
stocks continued. Commodity prices retreated with oil correcting on demand worries from European lockdowns/vaccine rollout along
with the stronger dollar. 

21 

The Fund had a positive return in March. Profitable trading
in equity and foreign currency positions were the largest contributors. Long positions in equities were buoyed by the continued
strength in stocks, led by gains in European markets and, to a lesser extent, in the United States. Rising yields in the U.S. contributed
to USD strength, which benefitted long dollar/short foreign currency positions, particularly in the Yen. The largest losses during
the month were from commodities, particularly long silver positions as precious metals were pressured by rising yields and the
strengthening dollar. The Fund finished with a net gain of 0.07 , 0.19 , 0.17 , 0.22 , 0.30 and 0.24 for Class A, A2, A3, B,
I, and R Units, respectively. 

April 

 Investor apprehension toward building inflationary pressure
seemed to relax in April as the Federal Reserve maintained its easy monetary policy and Chairman Powell indicated it was too early
to taper. This helped foster a positive environment for risk assets as market participants instead focused on the continued improvement
in global economic activity. Concurrently, the worsening COVID-19 situation in India coupled with Europe s slow progress
in their vaccine rollout tempered growth expectations and contributed to the view that growth/inflation would not spiral out-of-control
to the upside. Against this backdrop, global stock prices continued to climb. U.S. Treasury yields and dollar declined in April
after moving higher in the first quarter. Eurozone bond yields, however, climbed during the month. The improving economic growth
outlook and the weak dollar helped fuel the continued rally in commodities which saw prices for many markets set new multi-year
highs. 

The Fund had a positive return in April, benefitting from the
reflationary trade driving risk assets higher, especially in the commodity and equity markets. In commodities, long exposure benefitted
from higher prices in agricultural, energy, and base metal markets with notable contributors including corn, brent crude, and copper.
The Fund s long equity positions were also profitable, particularly in the U.S. while in fixed income, long European exposure
accounted for the bulk of the losses as rates pushed higher. Unprofitable trading in currency markets was led by short positions
in the Euro and Yen which reversed course by moving higher versus the U.S. dollar in April. The Fund finished with a net gain of
3.98 , 4.10 , 4.09 , 4.13 , 4.22 and 4.15 for Class A, A2, A3, B, I, and R Units, respectively. 

May 

 Strengthening economic conditions helped push global stock prices
modestly higher in May as the ongoing vaccine roll-out and supportive fiscal/monetary policy fueled the recovery. Evidence of the
improving economic environment included the strong April 60.7 U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Manager s Index reading. In Europe,
the Eurozone Manufacturing PMI was 62.9, also indicative of an expanding economy. While the global growth outlook strengthened,
inflationary pressure continued to build with the CPI rising a larger than expected +4.2 in April, its fastest pace since 2008
and raising concerns of Fed tapering. These fears were alleviated in part by the disappointing non-farm payroll numbers which fell
well short of expectations and helped soften concerns that the economy may overheat. Against this backdrop, commodity prices were
generally mixed, though oil (West Texas Intermediate crude) prices moved to their highest level since 2018. Global bond yields
were little changed while the U.S. dollar weakened. 

The Fund s positive return in May was driven by long positions
in commodity markets. The largest gains in the sector were from long energy exposure, including oil and oil products along with
power markets. Long exposure in metals was also profitable while long positions in agricultural commodities had losses, particularly
grains where prices retreated from multi-year highs. Foreign currency trading was profitable, led by long positions in emerging
market currencies which benefitted from rising commodity prices. The Fund also had gains from long positions in equities, particularly
in the U.S. and Europe. Trading in fixed income produced small losses. The Fund finished with a gain loss of 2.05 , 2.17 , 2.15 ,
2.20 , 2.28 , and 2.22 for Class A, A2, A3, B, I, and R Units, respectively. 

June 

 Economic conditions in the U.S. remain robust as recent data
suggests the recovery continues to strengthen. The U.S. added a better-than-expected 850,000 jobs in June while wages were up +3.6 
year-over-year. Consumer prices (CPI) jumped +5 in May, its fastest pace since August 2008 and higher-than-expected. The economic
recovery outside the U.S. generally remains at a slower pace, with rising concerns regarding the spread of the delta variant, particularly
in regions with lower vaccination rates. At the June meeting, the Fed s stance shifted more hawkish as it projected two rate
hikes in 2023. This contributed to the yield curve flattening as yields at the front end of the curve moved higher while longer
duration yields moved lower as the Fed s more hawkish comments tampered long-term inflation and growth expectations. Against
this backdrop the U.S. dollar moved higher against other major currencies. Stocks and commodities also moved higher, with oil prices
breaking out to the upside. 

Futures Portfolio Fund returns were slightly positive in June,
capping off a strong first half of the year. The Fund capitalized on rising oil prices as long exposure in oil and oil products
boosted returns, led by gains from WTI positions. Trading elsewhere in commodities was slightly unprofitable with small losses
in agricultural and metal markets. The largest losses were from currency trading as long foreign currency positions were hurt by
the strengthening U.S. dollar. Trading in Fixed Income produced small losses as gains from long exposure in long-term instruments,
where rates generally fell in June, were more than offset by losses from long positions in short-term fixed income where rates
rose. Long equity exposure produced modest gains. The Fund finished with a net gain of 0.14 , 0.26 , 0.24 , 0.29 , 0.37 and 0.31 
for Class A, A2, A3, B, I, and R Units, respectively. 

22 

July 

 Markets provided conflicting signals in July as the S P
500 reached a new all-time high while global bond yields moved lower and, in the U.S., the yield curve flattened. The rapid spread
of the Delta variant along with the more hawkish rhetoric from the Federal Reserve has shifted the economic outlook narrative.
While fiscal and monetary policy remain supportive, market participants perhaps increasingly anticipate that future economic growth
will not spiral out of control. This view was reinforced by the +6.5 rise in the second quarter U.S. GDP growth, well below the
+8.5 consensus expectation. Commodity markets were mixed during the month as energy and industrial metals prices generally rose
while agricultural commodity prices declined. The U.S. dollar declined slightly versus other major currencies. 

Futures Portfolio Fund returns were slightly positive in July
as positive contributions from fixed income trading more than offset losses by currency markets. In fixed income, long exposure
in the U.S. and Europe benefitted from the downward move in global bond yields with the strongest contributions from the U.S. Treasury
Bond, Australian 10-year, and the Euro Bund. Trading in foreign currency markets versus the U.S. dollar was unprofitable with the
largest losses from short Euro and Yen positions. Commodity markets had small gains led by profitable long energy exposure, partially
offset by small losses in agricultural and metal markets. Equity trading was slightly unprofitable led by losses from long positions
in Asian markets, notably the Nikkei and Hang Seng. The Fund finished with a net gain of 0.18 , 0.30 , 0.28 , 0.33 , 0.41 and
0.35 for Class A, A2, A3, B, I, and R Units, respectively. 

August 

 Global equity prices advanced during the month, supported
by strong second quarter earnings and dovish comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The Fed Chair reiterated his view that
recent high inflation is likely transitory and that the Fed needs to be mindful of risks of tapering too aggressively while
reassuring investors that rate hikes are not expected for some time. Meanwhile, economic growth showed signs of stalling,
culminating in the jobs report that showed August nonfarm payroll growth of only 235,000 versus expectations for 720,000.
Consumer confidence also slumped to its lowest level since February of this year. Global bond yields moved higher in August,
both in the U.S. and international markets, while the U.S. Dollar slipped from a nine-month high on the dovish Fed comments.
Commodity prices were down slightly in August, as oil prices declined sharply on concerns that the spike in COVID-19 cases
globally would threaten the recovery in demand. 

Futures Portfolio Fund s returns were negative in August
as the positive contributions from equity trading were offset by losses in fixed income and, to a lesser extent, commodities, and
currency markets. In equities, persistent long U.S. exposure during the month produced the largest gains. Fixed income losses were
primarily attributable to trading in European markets, particularly long positions in the Euro Bund and Buxl. Foreign currency
trading was mixed, but overall had a small loss with a long Canadian Dollar position the most notable detractor. In commodities,
gains from trading softs, natural gas, power, and precious metals were more than offset by losses in oil oil products, grains,
and base metal markets. The Fund finished with a net loss of (1.26) , (1.14) , (1.16) , (1.11) , (1.03) and (1.09) for Class
A, A2, A3, B, I, and R Units, respectively. 

September 

 Many global markets reversed course in September, leaving investors
unsure about future Central Bank policy, world-wide economic growth, and the pandemic s lasting impact. The S P 500 Index
was down -4.65 during the month of September. This pullback was concentrated in large cap technology names as represented by the
NASDAQ which was down -5.31 during September. This sell off was heavily influenced by upward moving yields due to widespread inflation
fears. Yields on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note finished the month at 1.53 , up from 1.30 at the end of August, a level not seen
since June of this year. Initial unemployment claims ticked upward to 362,000 during the last week of September, up from 310,000
claims at the start of the month, a record low since the start of the pandemic. The U.S. Dollar continued its upward trend versus
most major currencies against the backdrop of hawkish comments by the Federal Reserve. Oil prices remained at elevated levels as
global travel continues to slowly return, closing the month at 75.03 a barrel, up over +50 this year. 

Futures Portfolio Fund returns were slightly negative in September
as positive contributions from Energy trading were offset by losses in fixed income and, to a lesser extent, equities. In energy,
persistent long European natural gas and power markets contributed the most as gas supply concerns drove prices higher. Fixed income
losses were primarily attributable to trading in U.S. and European markets, particularly long positions on the mid to long end
of the U.S. Treasury yield curve. In foreign currency trading, relatively small gains came from long U.S. Dollar positioning, particularly
against the Euro and Yen. The Fund finished with a net loss of (0.98) , (0.86) , (0.88) , (0.83) , (0.75) and (0.81) for Class
A, A2, A3, B, I, and R Units, respectively. 

23 

October 

 After a brief pause in September, the S P 500 Index resumed
its upward trend, up +7.01 in October, and up +26.56 for the year. Strong corporate earnings combined with robust economic growth
and accommodative Federal Reserve actions pushed the S P 500 and NASDAQ to all time highs. Amidst higher equity prices, rising
inflation continued to be on the minds of investors as labor shortages and supply bottlenecks have the potential to magnify issues
during the busy Holiday shopping season. Movement on the U.S. 10-year note was modest, edging higher 0.02 . The U.S. economy added
531,000 jobs in October, bringing the unemployment rate down to 4.6 , a change of -0.2 . Oil prices continued to climb, reflecting
the rising demand for global manufacturing and travel. The price of West Texas Intermediate, soared over 11 in October to 83.57
per barrel, up from 75.03 per barrel at the end of September. So far in 2021, WTI has exploded over 70 . 

Futures Portfolio Fund s positive returns in
October were driven by energy, currency, and equity trading, while metals modestly detracted. In energy, persistent long oil
and oil product positioning contributed the most as higher demand coupled with supply concerns drove prices higher. In
foreign currency trading, gains came from long U.S. Dollar positioning, particularly against the Euro and Yen. In metals
trading, short positioning in precious metals detracted as prices rallied. Overall, the Fund finished the month with a net
loss of 4.32 , 4.44 , 4.42 , 4.47 , 4.55 and 4.49 for Class A, A2, A3, B, I and R Units, respectively. 

November 

 Despite a strong start to November for global markets, a new
COVID-19 variant emerged, spooking investors late in the month and causing reversals in many of the prevailing market trends. The
S P 500 Index finished down -0.69 as investors transitioned to risk-off assets. Amongst the resurfacing virus concerns, inflation
fears also weighed on investors as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged elevated prices may not be transitory and that
the Fed may need to accelerate its tapering program. Bond yields ended November modestly lower as rising yields earlier in the
month reversed sharply following the emergence of the Omicron variant. Despite the U.S. economy adding just half as many jobs as
expected, the unemployment rate continued to drop and reached its lowest level since the pandemic began. Oil prices broke their
year-long upward trend, as West Texas Intermediate plummeted over 20 in November to 66.18 per barrel, down from 83.57 at the
end of October. 

Futures Portfolio Fund s negative returns in November
were driven by energy, equities, and agricultural commodities, while interest rates contributed positively to performance. Despite
the overall negative return for the month, the Fund s diversified approach helped mitigate losses as trend-following strategies
were hit hard by the reversal in markets while short-term and systematic macro strategies performed better. In energy, persistent
long oil and oil product positioning detracted the most as demand concerns surrounding the new variant and the potential for oversupply
pushed prices lower. Also detracting was long equity positioning, specifically in the U.S., which was positive for the fund until
the Thanksgiving Holiday. In fixed income, long positions in European bonds contributed as investors fled to risk-off assets, driving
bond prices higher. Overall, the Fund finished the month with a net gain of (2.87) , (2.76) , (2.77) , (2.73) , (2.65) and (2.71) 
for Class A, A2, A3, B, I and R Units, respectively. 

December 

 The new COVID-19 variant, Omicron, dominated global markets
in the early days of December. As many unanswered questions about the variant were resolved, and fears of another economic shutdown
diminished, market participants returned to risk-on assets in the latter half of the month, as shown by the S P 500 Index,
finishing December up +4.48 . All eyes then turned to the Fed and the plan to accelerate the taper along with the ensuing path
of interest rates. The seemingly milder variant, along with persistent inflation, reduced the chances of a dovish Fed. This perceived
hawkishness by the market drove yields on the US 10-Year Treasury to 1.52 at the end of December, up from 1.43 a month earlier.
Despite the U.S. unemployment rate continuing to drop since pandemic highs, investors have begun to scrutinize labor shortages
and the subsequent impact on the economic recovery. Oil prices resumed their year-long upward trend, as West Texas Intermediate
rose over +13 in December. 

Futures Portfolio Fund s modest negative returns in
December were driven by interest rates and metals, while equity indices and agricultural commodities contributed positively
to performance. In fixed income, persistent long bond positioning detracted as yields rose significantly into the end of the
month against the backdrop of the more hawkish Fed. Also modestly detracting was short precious metal positioning, as prices
ticked higher in December amid lingering inflation worries. In equity indices, long positions in U.S. equities contributed
positively as investors shifted back to risk-on assets. Overall, the Fund finished the month with a net gain of (0.43) ,
(0.32) , (0.33) , (0.28) , (0.20) and (0.27) for Class A, A2, A3, B, I and R Units, respectively. 

2020 

 January 

 In January, capital markets were impacted by two significant
developments. Early in the month, Iranian General Qassem Soleimani was killed in a U.S. airstrike. Iran responded with their own
missile attack against a U.S. military base in Iraq, though tensions de-escalated from there. While global equity markets shrugged
off these events, they fell later in the month as mounting concerns regarding the coronavirus outbreak fueled a risk-off stance
by market participants. Speculation regarding the virus future effect on Chinese and global economic growth helped drive
rates lower/bond prices higher. Gold also continued to surge as investors sought safe haven assets while oil prices sold-off sharply. 

24 

The Fund enjoyed a strong start to the year with the largest
gains from long fixed income positions, which were boosted by falling rates. Foreign currency trading was profitable as long U.S.
Dollar positions benefitted from the greenback s strength. Long positions in equities were unprofitable, as stocks were hurt
by the coronavirus fears during the second half of January. In commodities, long precious metals exposure was profitable. Energy
trading also enjoyed gains as plunging natural gas prices provided a lift to short positions. Trading in agricultural commodities
was not a significant factor. The Fund finished with a net gain of 3.19 , 3.31 , 3.30 , 3.34 , 3.43 and 3.36 for Class A, A2,
A3, B, I, and R Units, respectively. 

February 

 After the S P 500 reached a new high in mid-February, intensifying
coronavirus fears contributed to a massive sell-off in equities while the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield fell to an all-time low.
The rapidity of the correction in the S P 500 was historic as the Index experienced its fastest ever 10 sell-off. With the
outbreak spreading outside of China and cases in Italy, Iran, and South Korea soaring, investors fled risk assets in droves as
they grappled with how deeply and for how long quarantines, reduced travel, factories shutting down, school closures, etc. will
negatively impact economic growth and corporate profitability. While the severity of the economic toll may be unknowable at this
time, some recent datapoints, like the official Chinese PMI indicator which plunged to an all-time low of 35.7 in February, are
certainly worrisome. As expectations for the Fed to take action quickly ramped, bond yields plunged. The U.S. dollar weakened and
failed to act as a traditional safe haven asset. Meanwhile, the Japanese Yen and Euro rallied. In commodities, oil prices continued
their collapse while gold, another traditional safe haven asset, declined during the market correction. 

The Fund finished with a negative return for the month as the
massive risk-off move by investors hurt long exposure in equities. Overall, foreign currency trading was not a significant factor
during February though during the market correction a long U.S. dollar position was hurt by softness in the greenback. In commodities,
short energy positions benefitted from declining oil and natural gas prices as economic growth concerns weighed heavily. Fixed
income trading was the largest positive contributor for the Fund as weakening growth and rate cut expectations fueled the collapse
in yields which benefitted long positions. The Fund finished with a net loss of (6.57) , (6.46) , (6.48) , (6.43) , (6.36) and
(6.42) for Class A, A2, A3, B, I, and R Units, respectively. 

March 

 As the COVID-19 global pandemic worsened and the world economy
was brought to its knees, the stock market continued to plummet. At the steepest point of its drawdown, the S P 500 fell -33.8 
from its high before recovering late in the month. The actions taken to stem the advance of the virus are having an unprecedented
effect on business activity. Second quarter GDP growth estimates are as dire as -40 while unemployment is expected to exceed the
post-World War II high of 10.8 . In response to the crisis, massive stimulus measures have been undertaken by central banks and
governments around the globe to inject liquidity and stabilize markets. U.S. Treasury yields reached historical lows in March.
Briefly during the month, bonds failed to act as a safe haven asset as yields unexpectedly moved higher when bond prices fell.
Meanwhile, oil prices collapsed as OPEC failed to reach a production cut agreement with Russia, resulting in an oil price war that
coincided with an historic collapse in demand. 

Positive returns during the 2 nd half of March, were
not enough to offset losses during the first two weeks of the month. While equity exposure had shifted neutral by the end of the
month, the Fund was hurt by long positions during that transition as stock prices continued their collapse. Fixed income trading
has been highly profitable in 2020, but had small losses in March as gains from positions in U.S. Treasuries were offset by losses
from overseas trading. Foreign currency trading was unprofitable while in commodities, short positions in energy were highly profitable
as oil prices plummeted. The Fund finished with a net loss of (6.99) , (6.88) , (6.89) , (6.85) , (6.77) and (6.83) for Class
A, A2, A3, B, I, and R Units, respectively. 

April 

 Optimism regarding the potential for re-opening the economy
sparked a massive relief rally in equities during April. After reaching its 2020 low on March 23 rd , the S P 500
continued its recovery in April by gaining +12.8 and recouping much of its year-to-date losses. For now, market participants are
looking past the disruption to the economy that has seen the number of individuals filing unemployment claims reach 33.5 million
since mid-March, wiping out all of the post-Global Financial Crisis job creation. Instead, positive news on the COVID-19 treatment
front, including Gilead s Remdesivir and the push to re-open in the U.S. and abroad, buoyed investor spirits. U.S. bond yields
were relatively stable during the month while yields in international instruments like the UK Gilt and German Bund declined. In
an unprecedented development, the May 2020 West Texas Intermediate crude contract closed at - 37.63 the day prior to expiration
as a collapse in demand and oil storage at capacity caused companies to pay buyers to take oil off their hands. 

The Fund posted a positive return during April. While positioning
fluctuated between long and short, trading in equities generated the largest profits. Long positions in fixed income also produced
gains led by positions in U.S. Treasuries and the Euro Bund. Trading in commodities was also profitable, as long positions in precious
metals and short positions in agricultural markets provided a boost. Trading in energy was not a significant performance driver
as falling prices in the first half of the month reversed course during the latter half. Foreign currency trading was unprofitable
in April, particularly a short position in the Australian Dollar. The Aussie dollar s rally is likely attributable to the
relative success that country has had containing the coronavirus and accordingly, a faster timeline to successfully reopening its
economy. The Fund finished with a net gain of 2.08 , 2.20 , 2.19 , 2.23 , 2.31 , and 2.25 for Class A, A2, A3, B, I, and R Units,
respectively. 

25 

May 

 May saw a continuation of the shift back toward risk assets
as investors looked past the current economic weakness and the climbing number of COVID-19 cases. Instead, investors focused on
the reopening of the global economy and path towards a return to normal . Continued responsiveness by central banks
to support asset prices and indications that more can be done if necessary, further buoyed investor confidence. With investor enthusiasm
surging, equities, as measured by the S P 500, have now rallied nearly +40 off their March 23 rd low. In commodities,
West Texas Intermediate WTI oil had its best monthly gain in its history, climbing an astounding ~90 in May to
approximately 35/barrel. Bond yields were relatively unchanged at the shorter end of the curve which are anchored by the Fed.
Yields for longer duration instruments pushed higher reflecting improving optimism regarding the economic outlook. The U.S. Dollar
weakened, notably against the Euro which moved higher on improving risk appetite and passage of the 825 billion Coronavirus Recovery
Fund by the EU. 

The Fund had a slightly positive return in May led by profitable
trading in equities, though exposure shifted between long and short during the month. In commodities, there were losses from short
positions in the energy and agricultural sectors as prices rallied on hopes that the economy had bottomed. The Fund had small losses
in fixed income and currency trading, as declining bond prices and a depreciation of the safe haven U.S. Dollar negatively impacted
long positions in these markets. The Fund finished with a net gain of 0.21 , 0.32 , 0.31 , 0.35 , 0.43 , and 0.37 for Class A,
A2, A3, B, I, and R Units, respectively. 

June 

 Indications that economic conditions are bottoming helped buoy
risk assets during June. Early in the month, equities surged following a remarkable U.S. employment report showing 2.5 million
jobs added in May. Volatility returned intra-month, however, as concerns regarding a resurgence in COVID-19 cases as lock-downs
were relaxed and heightened U.S./China trade tension ramped. Risk assets resumed their upward trajectory in the second half of
June as accommodative monetary policy, improving economic data, and a belief that politicians would not re-impose strict lock-downs
again, buoyed risk appetite. With investors looking at a global recovery, the world s reserve currency (U.S. Dollar) weakened
while cyclical commodity prices moved higher. Within fixed income markets, yields were relatively unchanged. 

The Fund had slight losses in June led by unprofitable trading
in currencies. While positioning shifted mid-month, long U.S. dollar exposure in the first half of the month detracted as the greenback
weakened versus other major currencies. Long positions in fixed income and equities were profitable but were largely offset by
losses from trading in commodities. While trading in energy has generated robust gains in 2020, short positions during June were
unprofitable. The Fund finished with a net loss of (1.27) , (1.15) , (1.16) , (1.12) , (1.04) , and (1.10) for Class A, A2, A3,
B, I, and R Units, respectively. 

July 

 Despite Q2 U.S. GDP plunging -32.9 on an annualized basis,
investors in July remained optimistic. Instead, focusing on the recovery in economic data from its Q2 bottom and progress toward
a COVID-19 vaccine. While economic activity continued to rebound, the daily number of new COVID-19 cases has been rising since
mid-June. Accordingly, a growing number of states in the U.S. have paused or reversed their re-openings, threatening to slow or
derail the fledgling recovery. Against this backdrop, however, risk assets including global stocks moved higher. Bond yields were
lower with the U.S. 3- and 5-year Treasuries reaching historic lows. The U.S. Dollar Index had its largest monthly drop since 2010,
as lower U.S. rates, lack of progress on additional fiscal stimulus, and the increasing number of COVID-19 cases weighed on the
greenback. The weakening dollar and risk-on sentiment spurred cyclical commodity prices higher. Despite the move in risk assets,
gold surged to an all-time high as dollar weakness, political tension and worsening U.S./China relations provided a lift to the
safe haven asset. 

The Fund had positive returns in July led by gains from equities
and metals trading. In equities, long positions in the U.S. and developed Asian markets more than offset losses from short positions
in Europe. In metals trading, the bulk of the gains were from long precious metal exposure, notably positions in gold and silver.
Trading in fixed income was also profitable during the month, primarily attributable to long exposure in the U.S. In currency trading,
long FX vs. U.S. dollar positions were slightly profitable, benefiting from the weakness in the greenback. Trading in energy and
agricultural markets were slightly unprofitable during July. The Fund finished with a net gain of 2.95 , 3.07 , 3.06 , 3.11 , 3.19 ,
and 3.12 for Class A, A2, A3, B, I, and R Units, respectively. 

26 

August 

 Buoyed by solid economic data, strong corporate earnings, and
a decline in new COVID-19 cases in the U.S., stock prices surged in August as the S P 500 again reached an all-time high. Against
this backdrop, government bond yields rose (bond prices fell) and the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield moved back above 0.70 before
settling at 0.67 at the end of the month. Late in the month, the Fed announced a major policy shift, targeting a 2 average inflation
rate, signaling that easy monetary policy will remain in place for the foreseeable future. As a result, the U.S. dollar continued
its decline, reaching its lowest level since April 2018. The weakening dollar and improving economic sentiment helped lift commodity
prices during the month, evidenced by strong gains in metals and in most agricultural commodities. In energy markets, natural gas
prices surged as hot weather increased the demand for cooling, and Hurricane Laura shut down much of the Gulf Coast s production. 

The Fund finished the month with a negative return, as long
bond positions in the U.S. and Europe were hurt by the rise in rates. Energy trading was also unprofitable, with short positions
in natural gas impacted by the rise in demand and supply interruption. Somewhat offsetting these losses however were gains in long
U.S. equity positions, and long exposure in base and precious metals, particularly silver and iron ore. Finally, long foreign currency
positions, notably the Euro, Australian and New Zealand dollars, were profitable as the greenback continued to weaken versus other
major currencies. The Fund finished with a net loss of (2.12) , (2.01) , (2.02) , (1.98) , (1.90) , and (1.96) for Class A, A2,
A3, B, I, and R Units, respectively. 

September 

 Investor appetite for risk was negatively impacted by economic
growth concerns as the rising number of COVID-19 cases in Europe sparked fears of the potential for new lockdown measures. The
likelihood of additional fiscal stimulus measures in the U.S. were dampened as Democrats and Republicans sparred over a replacement
on the Supreme Court following the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg. Finally, AstraZeneca s Phase 3 COVID-19
vaccine trial was put on hold following an adverse reaction by a participant in the UK. Against this backdrop, the S P 500
fell nearly 10 from September 3 rd to September 23 rd while the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite reached an official
correction during that period. With stimulus efforts stalled and investors seeking safe-haven assets, the U.S. dollar rallied to
a two-month high contributing to weakness in commodity prices which were also impacted by economic growth concerns. Yields in Europe
generally declined slightly during the month while U.S. yields ended September little changed. 

The Fund had negative returns during September. With investors
migrating toward safe-haven assets, the Fund s largest losses were from long foreign currency exposure versus the U.S. dollar
which rallied off its August low. In precious metals, long silver positions were hurt as prices retreated sharply from multi-year
highs on the strengthening dollar and increased uncertainty regarding the economic outlook. Finally, in equities the sell-off in
stocks led to losses from long positions in Europe which were partially offset by gains from trading in U.S. markets. Long exposure
in fixed income was profitable led by gains from positions in European markets. Short positions in oil and oil product also helped
offset the aforementioned losses. The Fund finished with a net loss of (1.51) , (1.39) , (1.40) , (1.36) , (1.28) and (1.34) 
for Class A, A2, A3, B, I, and R Units, respectively. 

October 

 During October, investors were focused on the U.S. presidential
election and rising COVID-19 cases in both the U.S. and Europe which set new record daily highs. Market participants anxiety
increased as the surging case count caused several European countries to reintroduce national lockdown measures which will likely
stifle economic growth. As the U.S. drew closer to the presidential election, stimulus negotiations broke down once again, creating
additional uncertainty with respect to the sustainability of economic growth. Against this backdrop, the S P 500 finished down
-2.7 during October. This modest decline masked considerable volatility during the month, however, as the Index declined -7.4 
from October 13th through October 30th. In fixed income markets, the U.S. 10-year yield moved higher, though yields in Europe fell
as lockdown measures were implemented. The escalating coronavirus case count in Europe contributed to a move toward safe-haven
currencies including the Japanese Yen and the U.S. dollar toward the end of the month. In commodities, oil prices declined as the
outlook for economic growth weakened. 

The Fund posted a negative return for October as losses during
the back half of the month more than offset gains experienced in the first half. Long exposure in equities was the primary culprit,
as positions were hurt by the sell-off in stocks that began mid-October. Losses were most acute in U.S. and European equity indices.
Trading in currency markets produced the largest gains as short Euro and long Yen exposure benefited from the move towards safe-haven
currencies. Elsewhere, trading in fixed income was profitable as long exposure in European markets where yields generally declined
more than offset losses in the U.S where yields rose. In commodities, gains were made from short energy positions while long precious
metals exposure detracted. Overall, the Fund finished the month with a net loss of (1.42) , (1.31) , (1.32) , (1.27) , (1.20) 
and (1.26) for Class A, A2, A3, B, I and R Units, respectively. 

November 

 News of the Pfizer Phase 3 study showing its COVID-19 vaccine
had more than 90 efficacy helped propel risk assets higher in November. This positive development helped assuage investor anxiety
regarding new lockdown measures introduced by some states in the U.S. and in Europe as cases surged. This bullish sentiment suggested
market participants were increasingly looking toward the other side of the pandemic and a recovery in the global economy. Despite
the ongoing challenge by the Trump campaign, the conclusion of the U.S. Presidential election also seemed to reduce investor anxiety.
Against this backdrop, global stock prices surged, enjoying double-digit percentage gains. Global bond yields also moved higher
on prospects for an improving economy. The lack of progress on fiscal stimulus in the U.S., a rising COVID-19 case count in the
U.S. versus Europe, and increased risk appetite all contributed to U.S. dollar weakness. Finally, prospects for an improving economy
contributed to a surge in commodity prices, particularly oil, as West Texas Intermediate crude jumped to nearly 45 per barrel. 

27 

The Fund posted a positive return for November as long positions
in equities benefitted from the big risk-on rally. Gains were particularly robust in the U.S., but also included solid contributions
from positions in Japan and continental Europe. Though short positions in energy were significantly reduced during the month, trading
in energy generated the largest losses. Long exposure in fixed income, particularly the long end of the curve also detracted. Finally,
long positions in grain and base metal markets were profitable but were offset by losses from trading in currencies and precious
metals. Overall, the Fund finished the month with a net gain of 2.88 , 3.00 , 2.99 , 3.03 , 3.12 and 3.05 for Class A, A2, A3,
B, I and R Units, respectively. 

December 

 In December, investor sentiment was buoyed by approvals of the
first COVID-19 vaccines and optimism toward a post-pandemic economic recovery. Market participants looked past political uncertainty
caused by President Trump s ongoing challenge of the U.S. Presidential election as well as the surge in COVID-19 cases and
increased lockdown measures. With investor sentiment toward risk assets remaining favorable, global stocks climbed higher. Commodity
prices also advanced on recovery hopes with agricultural markets particularly strong due to dry weather in South America and an
Argentinian export ban. Optimism regarding a global economic recovery, heightened appetite for risk, and progress toward a Brexit
trade deal between the EU and UK contributed to U.S. dollar weakness. 

The Fund posted a positive return for December as profitable
trading in agricultural, metals, and equity indices more than offset losses from fixed income. Gains from trading in agricultural
commodities were led by long soybean positions which were aided by dry weather in South America and strong demand which helped
lift prices. In metals, a rebound in gold prices boosted long positions while long copper positions were buoyed by hopes for a
cyclical recovery which led to copper prices reaching their highest level since 2012. In equity trading, the largest contributors
were from long U.S. and Asian positions. Losses in fixed income were primarily from positions in the longer end of the curve, particularly
in the US and Europe. Overall, the Fund finished the month with a net gain of 4.67 , 4.79 , 4.78 , 4.82 , 4.91 and 4.84 for
Class A, A2, A3, B, I and R Units, respectively. 

Liquidity 

There are no known material trends, demands, commitments, events,
or uncertainties at the present time that are reasonably likely to result in the Fund s liquidity increasing or decreasing
in any material way. 

Capital Resources 

The Fund intends to raise
additional capital through the continued sale of Units and does not intend to raise capital through borrowing. Due to the nature
of the Fund s business, the Fund does not contemplate making capital expenditures. The Fund does not have, nor does it expect
to have, any capital assets. Redemptions, exchanges and sales of Units in the future will affect the amount of funds available
for investment in futures contracts, etc. in subsequent periods. It is not possible to estimate the amount, and therefore the impact,
of future inflows and outflows funds related to the sale and redemption of Units. There are no known material trends, favorable
or unfavorable, that would affect, nor any expected material changes to, the Fund s capital resource arrangements at the
present time. 

Contractual Obligations 

The Fund does not have any contractual obligations
of the type contemplated by Item 303(a)(5) of Regulation S-K. The Fund s sole business is trading futures and forward currency
contracts, both long (contracts to buy) and short (contracts to sell). 

Off-Balance Sheet Risk 

The term off-balance sheet
risk refers to an unrecorded potential liability that, even though it does not appear on the balance sheet, may result in
future obligation or loss. The Fund trades in futures and forward currency contracts and is therefore a party to financial instruments
with elements of off-balance sheet market and credit risk. In entering these contracts there exists a risk to the Fund that such
contracts may be significantly influenced by market conditions, such as interest rate volatility, resulting in such contracts being
less valuable. If the markets should move against all of the futures interests positions of the Fund at the same time, and if the
trading advisors were unable to offset futures interest positions of the Fund, the Fund could lose all of its assets and the limited
partners would realize a 100 loss. The General Partner minimizes market risk through diversification of the portfolio allocations
to multiple trading advisors and strategies, and maintenance of a margin-to-equity ratio that rarely exceeds 35 . 

28 

In addition to subjecting the Fund
to market risk, upon entering into futures and forward currency contracts there is a risk that the counterparty will not be able
to meet its obligations to the Fund. The counterparty for futures contracts traded in the U.S. and on most foreign exchanges is
the clearinghouse associated with such exchange. In general, clearinghouses are backed by the corporate members of the clearinghouse
who are required to share any financial burden resulting from the non-performance by one of their members and, as such, should
significantly reduce this risk. In cases where the clearinghouse is not backed by the clearing members, as is the case with some
foreign exchanges, it is normally backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions. 

In the case of forward currency
contracts, which are traded on the interbank market rather than on exchanges, the counterparty is generally a single bank or other
financial institution, rather than a group of financial institutions, thus there may be a greater counterparty risk. The General
Partner utilized only those counterparties that it believes to be creditworthy for the Fund. All positions of the Fund are valued
each day on a mark-to-market basis. There can be no assurance, however, that any clearing member, clearinghouse or other counterparty
will be able to meet its obligations to the Fund. 

The Fund may invest in U.S. Treasury
securities, U.S. and foreign government sponsored enterprise notes, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, asset backed securities
and corporate notes. Should an issuing entity default on its obligation to the Fund and such entity is not backed by the full faith
and credit of the U.S. government, the Fund bears the risk of loss of the amount expected to be received. The Fund minimizes this
risk by only investing in securities and certificates of deposit of firms with high quality debt ratings. 

Significant Accounting Policies 

A summary of the Fund s significant
accounting policies is included in Note 1 to the financial statements. 

The Fund s most significant accounting policy is the valuation
of its assets invested in U.S. and foreign futures and forward currency contracts, and fixed income instruments. The Fund s
futures contracts are exchange-traded, with the fair value of these contracts based on exchange settlement prices. The fair values
of non-exchange-traded contracts, such as forward currency contracts, are based on third-party quoted dealer values on the interbank
market. The fair value of money market funds is based on quoted market prices for identical shares. U.S. Treasury securities are
stated at fair value based on quoted market prices for identical assets in an active market. Notes of U.S. and foreign government
sponsored enterprises, as well as certificates of deposit, commercial paper, asset backed securities and corporate notes, are stated
at fair value based on quoted market prices for similar assets in an active market. Given the valuation sources, there is little
judgment or uncertainty involved in the valuation of these assets, and it is unlikely that materially different amounts would be
reported under different valuation methodologies or assumptions. The Fund s investment in a private investment company is
valued at net asset value as provided by the private fund s administrator. This use of net asset value as the practical expedient
to approximate fair value under ASC 820 is advisable due to the investment not having a readily determinable fair value. 

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Introduction 

The Fund is a speculative commodity pool. The market-sensitive
instruments held by it are acquired for speculative trading purposes, and all or a substantial amount of the Fund s assets are
subject to the risk of trading loss. Unlike an operating company, the risk of market sensitive instruments is integral, not incidental,
to the Fund s main line of business. 

Market movements result in frequent changes in the fair value
of the Fund s open positions and, consequently, in its earnings and cash flow. The Fund s market risk is influenced by a wide variety
of factors, including the level and volatility of exchange rates, interest rates, equity price levels, the market value of financial
instruments and contracts, the diversification effects among the Fund s open positions and the liquidity of the markets in which
it trades. 

The Fund acquires and liquidates both long and short positions
in a wide range of different markets. Consequently, it is not possible to predict how a particular future market scenario will
affect performance, and the Fund s past performance cannot be relied on as indicative of its future results. 

29 

Standard of Materiality 

Materiality as used in this section, Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, is based on an assessment of reasonably possible market movements and the potential
losses caused by such movements, taking into account the leverage, and multiplier features of the Fund s market sensitive instruments. 

Quantifying the Fund s Trading Value at Risk 

The following quantitative disclosures regarding the Fund s
market risk exposures contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995 and other federal securities laws. All quantitative disclosures in this section are deemed to be forward-looking statements
for purposes of the safe harbor, except for statements of historical fact. 

Value at Risk is a measure of the maximum amount which the Fund
could reasonably be expected to lose in a given market sector. However, the inherent uncertainty of the Fund s speculative trading
and the recurrence in the markets traded by the Fund to market movements far exceeding expectations could result in actual trading
or non-trading losses far beyond the indicated Value at Risk or the Fund s experience to date (i.e., risk of ruin ).
Risk of ruin is defined to be no more than a 5 chance of losing 20 or more on a monthly basis. In light of the foregoing as well
as the risks and uncertainties intrinsic to all future projections, the inclusion of the quantification included in this section
should not be considered to constitute any assurance or representation that the Fund s losses in any market sector will be limited
to Value at Risk or by the Fund s attempts to manage its market risk. 

The Fund s risk exposure in the various market sectors traded
by the Fund s Trading Advisors is quantified below in terms of Value at Risk. Due to mark-to-market accounting, any loss
in the fair value of the Fund s open positions is directly reflected in the Fund s earnings. 

Exchange margin requirements have been used by the Fund as the
measure of its Value at Risk. Margin requirements are set by exchanges to equal or exceed the maximum losses reasonably expected
to be incurred in the fair value of any given contract in 95 - 99 of any one-day interval. The margin levels are established
by dealers and exchanges using historical price studies as well as an assessment of current market volatility and economic fundamentals
to provide a probabilistic estimate of the maximum expected near-term one-day price fluctuation. 

In the case of market sensitive instruments that are not exchange-traded
(includes currencies, certain energy products and metals), the margin requirements required by the forward counterparty is used
as Value at Risk. 

In quantifying the Fund s Value at Risk, 100 positive correlation
in the different positions held in each market risk category has been assumed. Consequently, the margin requirements applicable
to the open contracts have simply been aggregated to determine each trading category s aggregate Value at Risk. The diversification
effects resulting from the fact that the Fund s positions are rarely, if ever, 100 positively correlated, have not been reflected. 

Value at Risk as provided may not be comparable to similarly
titled measures used by others. 

Material Limitations on Value at Risk as an Assessment of
Market Risk 

The face value of the market sector instruments held by the
Fund is typically many times the applicable margin requirement (margin requirements generally range between approximately 1 and
15 of contract face value) as well as many times the capitalization of the Fund. The magnitude of the Fund s open positions creates
a risk of ruin not typically found in most other investment vehicles. Because of the size of its positions, certain market conditions
- unusual, but historically recurring from time to time - could cause the Fund to incur severe losses over a short period of time.
The past performance of the Fund gives no indication of this risk of ruin. 

Non-Trading Risk 

The Fund has non-trading market risk on its foreign cash balances
not needed for margin. However, these balances (as well as the market risk they represent) are immaterial to the Fund as a whole.
The Fund also has non-trading market risk as a result of investing a substantial portion of its available assets in U.S. Treasury
securities, U.S. government sponsored enterprise notes, commercial paper, corporate notes, asset backed securities and certificates
of deposit. Although these investments are considered to be high quality, some of the securities purchased are neither guaranteed
by the U.S. government nor supported by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. There is some risk that a security issuer
may fail to pay the interest and principal in a timely manner, or that negative perceptions about the issuer s ability to
make such payments will cause the price of these instruments to decline in value. 

30 

Qualitative Disclosures Regarding Primary Trading Risk Exposures 

The following qualitative disclosures regarding the Fund s market
risk exposures - except for those disclosures that are statements of historical fact and the descriptions of how the Fund manages
its primary market risk exposures - constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act
of 1933, 1933 Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 1934 Act ). The Fund s
primary market risk exposures as well as the strategies used and to be used by the Fund s Trading Advisors for managing such
exposures are subject to numerous uncertainties, contingencies and risks, any one of which could cause the actual results of the
Fund s risk controls to differ materially from the objectives of such strategies. Government interventions, defaults and expropriations,
illiquid markets, the emergence of dominant fundamental factors, political upheavals, changes in historical price relationships,
an influx of new market participants, increased regulation and many other factors could result in material losses as well as in
material changes to the risk exposures and the risk management strategies of the Fund. There can be no assurance that the Fund s
current market exposure and/or risk management strategies will not change materially or that any such strategies will be effective
in either the short- or long-term. Investors must be prepared to lose all or substantially all of their investment in the Fund. 

The following were the primary trading risk exposures of the
Fund as of December 31, 2021, by market sector. 

Agricultural Commodities 

 The Fund takes positions in a broad range of agricultural futures,
including soybeans, wheat, corn, sugar, and cotton among others. Prices in these markets can be affected by changes in demand,
as well changes in supply factors such as weather and inventory levels. 

Currencies 

 The Fund trades in foreign exchange markets by taking positions
in currency futures and forward contracts for a large number of developed and emerging market currencies. Exposures may take the
form of direct exchange rates against the U.S. dollar, or cross-rates between two foreign currencies. Exchange rates can be impacted
by economic differences between regions (such as interest rate differentials or economic growth differentials), political events,
as well as investor risk sentiment. 

Energy 

 The Fund gains trading exposure in energy markets through oil
and gas futures, which include WTI crude oil, Brent crude oil, distillates such as heating oil, and natural gas. Prices have historically
been highly volatile, driven by demand side factors such as global economic growth and weather conditions, as well as supply side
factors such as Middle East conflicts, OPEC production agreements, and shale production. 

Equity Indices 

 The Fund has exposure to major stock market indices around the
world through equity index futures. Primary exposures are in developed markets such as the U.S., the UK, Germany, Japan, Hong Kong
and Australia, but there can also be exposure to smaller developing market stock indices. Equity index price movements can be affected
by microeconomic factors such as corporate earnings, by macroeconomic factors such as government fiscal and monetary policy, as
well as by investor sentiment. 

Interest Rate Instruments 

 The Fund has exposure to global fixed income markets through
bond futures and interest rate futures in countries such as the U.S., the UK, Germany, Japan and Australia. The Fund has exposure
across the yield curve with positions in the futures for both short term and long-term instruments. The yield curve (and futures
prices) can be affected by economic growth, inflation expectations, monetary policy and investor risk aversion. 

Metals 

 The Fund has exposure to metals futures, including both precious
metals such as gold, silver and platinum, as well as industrial metals such as copper, aluminum and zinc. Metals prices can be
volatile. Precious metals prices are often driven by inflation expectations, risk aversion, and mining output. Industrial metals
prices tend to be impacted by industrial demand relative to production. 

Single Stock Futures 

 The Fund has a small exposure to single stock futures, with
positions primarily in companies that trade on U.S. exchanges. The price drivers here tend to be more microeconomic with corporate
earnings and industry trends being important. However, macroeconomic and market-wide factors can also affect single stock futures
prices. 

31 

Qualitative Disclosures Regarding Non-Trading Risk Exposure

The following were the significant non-trading risk exposures
of the Fund as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

Foreign Currency Balances 

 The Fund s primary foreign currency balances are in euros, Japanese
yen, British pounds, Australian dollars, Hong Kong dollars and Canadian dollars. The Fund controls the non-trading risk of these
balances by regularly converting these balances back into dollars (no less frequently than once a week). 

U.S. Treasury Securities, U.S. and Foreign Government Sponsored
Enterprise Notes, Commercial Paper, Corporate Notes, Asset Backed Securities and Certificates of Deposit 

 Monies in excess of margin requirements are generally invested
in fixed income instruments, including U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. and foreign government sponsored enterprise notes, commercial
paper, corporate notes, asset backed securities and certificates of deposit. Fluctuations in prevailing interest rates could cause
mark-to-market gains or losses on the Fund s investments, although substantially all of these investments are held to maturity. 

Qualitative Disclosures Regarding Means of Managing Risk
Exposure 

The means by which the Fund and the Fund s Trading Advisors,
severally, attempt to manage the risk of the Fund s open positions is essentially the same in all market sectors traded. The Fund s
Trading Advisors apply risk management policies to their respective trading which generally limit the total exposure that may be
taken. In addition, the Trading Advisors generally follow proprietary diversification guidelines (often formulated in terms of
the balanced volatility between markets and correlated groups). 

The Fund is unaware of any (i) anticipated known demands, commitments
or capital expenditures; (ii) material trends, favorable or unfavorable, in its capital resources; or (iii) trends or uncertainties
that will have a material effect on operations. From time to time, certain regulatory agencies have proposed increased margin requirements
on futures contracts. Because the Fund generally will use a small percentage of assets as margin, the Fund does not believe that
any increase in margin requirements, as proposed, will have a material effect on the Fund s operations. 

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 

Financial statements meeting the requirements of Regulation
S-X appear in Part IV of this report. The supplementary financial information specified by Item 302 of Regulation S-K is included
in this report under the heading Selected Financial Data above. 

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosures 

None. 

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The General Partner of the Fund, with the participation of the
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Fund s
disclosure controls and procedures at December 31, 2022 (the Evaluation Date ). Based on their evaluation, the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the General Partner concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, the Fund s
disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Any control system, no matter how well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable (not absolute) assurance that its objectives will be met. Furthermore, no evaluation of controls
can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. 

Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting 

The management of the General Partner is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting by the Fund. 

The Fund s internal control over financial reporting is
a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The Fund s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Fund; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and that receipts and expenditures of the Fund are being made only
in accordance with authorizations of management of the Fund; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Fund s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. 

32 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations,
including the possibility of human error and the circumvention of overriding controls. Accordingly, even effective internal control
over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Fund s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework published in 2013. Based on that assessment, management
concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the Fund s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on the criteria
established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework published in 2013. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There has been no change in internal control over financial
reporting that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Fund s internal control over financial reporting. 

Item 9B. Other Information 

None. 

PART III 

Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance 

Directors and Executive Officers 

The Fund itself has no directors or officers and has no employees.
It is managed by the General Partner in its capacity as General Partner. The General Partner is a wholly owned subsidiary of Octavus
Group, LLC. The directors and executive officers of the General Partner are Kevin Kinzie and Jon Essen. Their respective biographies
are set forth below.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To
the Partners of Futures Portfolio Fund, Limited Partnership 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying statements of financial condition, including
the condensed schedules of investments, of Futures Portfolio Fund, Limited Partnership (the Fund), as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the
related statements of operations, and cash flows, and changes in partners capital (net asset value) for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes to the financial statements. In our opinion, the financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Fund as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis for opinion 

 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Fund s management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Fund s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm
registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect
to the Fund in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether
due to error or fraud. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation
of the financial 

 statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

 Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit
of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts
or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.
We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

At December 31, 2020, the Fund no longer owned any Class I
shares of the Steben Managed Futures Strategy Fund SMFSF after liquidating its position in January 2020. SMFSF
was a non-diversified series of shares of beneficial interest of Steben Alternative Investment Fund (the Trust ),
a statutory trust organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, and was registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended (the 1940 Act ), as an open-end investment company. SMFSF had a similar investment strategy to the
Fund, using commodity trading advisors to engage in the speculative trading of futures contracts, forward currency contracts and
other financial instruments. 

Until January 2020, the Fund held an investment in SMFSF and
any changes in the fair value of its investment in SMFSF are reported on the Statement of Operations. The investment in SMFSF
is reported on the statements of financial condition as investment in SMFSF. For financial reporting purposes, SMFSF is treated
as a related party. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Fund redeemed million and million, respectively,
of its investment in SMFSF. In January 2020 SMFSF was merged into the LoCorr Macro Strategies Fund and the Fund fully redeemed
its investment following the merger. 

Significant Accounting Policies 

The investment in a money market fund and futures contracts
are valued using quoted market prices for identical assets in active markets and are classified within Level 1. The money market
fund is included in cash and cash equivalents in the statements of financial condition. The fair values of forward currency contracts
are based upon third-party quoted dealer values on the interbank market and are classified within Level 2. The Fund s valuation
policy for swaps is that fair value is based on the terms of the contracts (such as the notional amount and the contract maturity)
and current market data and counterparty credit risk. Swaps are generally categorized as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
The Fund s investment in a private investment company is valued at net asset value as provided by the private fund s
administrator. This use of net asset value as the practical expedient to approximate fair value under ASC 820 is advisable due
to the investment not having a readily determinable fair value. Investments measured at fair value using the new asset value practical
expedient are not categorized in the fair value hierarchy.

 Class I Units equal to 1/12th of of the month-end net asset value of the Class I Units,
 payable in arrears. 

General
 Partner Performance Fee the Fund incurs a monthly fee on Class I Units equal
 to of any Net New Trading Profits of the Class I Units calculated monthly. In determining
 Net New Trading Profits, any trading losses incurred by the Class I Units in prior periods
 is carried forward, so that the incentive fee is assessed only if and to the extent the
 profits generated by the Class I units exceed any losses from prior periods. The general
 partner performance fee is payable quarterly in arrears. 

Selling
 Agent Fees the Class A Units incur a monthly fee of the Class A Units. Class A2 Units may pay an up-front Class A3 Units
 may pay an up-front The General Partner, in turn, pays the selling agent fees to the respective
 selling agents. If there is no designated selling agent or the General Partner was the selling
 agent, such portions of the selling agent fees are retained by the General Partner. 

Broker
 Dealer Servicing Fees the Class B Units incur a monthly fee of the Class B Units. The General Partner,
 in turn, pays the fees to the respective selling agents. If there is no designated selling
 agent or the General Partner was the selling agent, such portions of the broker dealer
 servicing fees are retained by the General Partner. 

Administrative
 Fee the Fund incurs a monthly fee of the Fund, payable in arrears to the General Partner. In return, the General Partner
 provides operating and administrative services, including accounting, audit, legal, marketing,
 and administration (exclusive of extraordinary costs and administrative expenses charged
 by other funds in which the Fund may have investments). 

Pursuant
to the terms of the Partnership Agreement, 

to per annum of allocated net assets (as defined in each respective advisory agreement as the amount of
Fund assets deposited in the account maintained with the broker plus any notional funds which may be allocated to the Trading
Advisor, which, in aggregate, is typically greater than the Fund s net assets), paid monthly or quarterly in arrears. Additionally,
the Fund incurs advisor incentive fees, payable quarterly in arrears, ranging from to of net new trading profits (as defined
in each respective advisory agreement).

payable in arrears to the Cash Manager, equal to approximately 1/12th of and 1/12th of of the investments in securities
and certificates of deposit as of the period ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

for Class A, A2, A3, B and R units and for
Class I units. Units are sold at the respective net asset value per unit for Class A, A2, A3, B, I or R interests as of the close
of business on the last day of the month in which the subscription is accepted. Investors whose subscriptions are accepted are
admitted as limited partners as of the beginning of the month following the month in which their subscriptions were accepted.
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Fund received advance subscriptions of and , respectively, which were recognized
as subscriptions to the Fund subsequent to period-end. 

The
Fund is not required to make distributions but may do so at the sole discretion of the General Partner. A limited partner may
request and receive redemption of Class A, A2, A3, B, I or R Units owned at the end of any month, subject to five business days 
prior written notice to the General Partner, and in certain circumstances, restrictions in the Partnership Agreement. 

The
General Partner may require a limited partner to redeem from the Fund if the General Partner deems the redemption (a) necessary
to prevent or correct the occurrence of a non-exempt prohibited transaction under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (b) beneficial to the Fund, or (c) necessary to comply
with applicable government or other self-regulatory organization regulations. 

Purchase
and sale of futures contracts requires margin deposits with the futures brokers. Additional deposits may be necessary for any
loss of contract value. The Commodity Exchange Act CEAct requires a broker to segregate all customer transactions
and assets from such broker s proprietary activities. A customer s cash and other property (for example, U.S. Treasury
securities) deposited with a broker are considered commingled with all other customer funds subject to the broker s segregation
requirements. In the event of a broker s insolvency, recovery may be limited to a pro rata share of segregated funds available.
It is possible that the recovered amount could be less than (or none of) the total cash and other property deposited. The Fund
uses SG Americas Securities, LLC and Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. as its futures brokers. The Fund uses Goldman Sachs 
Company, LLC and Deutsche Bank AG as its forward currency counterparties. 

For
futures contracts, risks arise from changes in the fair value of the contracts. Theoretically, the Fund is exposed to a market
risk equal to the value of futures and forward currency contracts purchased, and unlimited liability on such contracts sold short. 

In
addition to market risk, upon entering into commodity interest contracts there is a credit risk that a counterparty will not be
able to meet its obligations to the Fund. The counterparty for futures and options on futures contracts traded in the U.S. and
on most non-U.S. futures exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with such exchanges. In general, clearinghouses are backed
by the corporate members of the clearinghouse who are required to share any financial burden resulting from the non-performance
by one of their members and, as such, should significantly reduce this credit risk. In cases where the clearinghouse is not backed
by the clearing members, like some non-U.S. exchanges, it is normally backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions. 

In
the case of forward currency contracts, which are traded on the interbank or other institutional market rather than on exchanges,
the counterparty is generally a single bank or other financial institution, rather than a clearinghouse backed by a group of financial
institutions; thus, there likely will be greater counterparty credit risk. While the Fund trades only with those counterparties
that it believes to be creditworthy, there can be no assurance that any clearing member, clearinghouse or other counterparty will
be able to meet its obligations to the Fund. 

The
Fund trades forward currency contracts in unregulated markets between principals and assumes the risk of loss from counterparty
non-performance. Accordingly, the risks associated with forward currency contracts are generally greater than those associated
with exchange-traded contracts because of the greater risk of counterparty default. Additionally, the trading of forward currency
contracts typically involves delayed cash settlement. 

The
Fund has a portion of its assets on deposit with interbank market makers and other financial institutions in connection with its
trading of forward currency contracts and its cash management activities. In the event of an interbank market maker s or
financial institution s insolvency, recovery of Fund assets on deposit may be limited to account insurance or other protection
afforded such deposits. 

Entering
into swap agreements involves, to varying degrees, credit, market, and counterparty risk in excess of the amounts recognized on
the statement of financial condition. 

The
Cash Managers manage the Fund s cash and excess margin through investments in fixed income instruments, pursuant to investment
parameters established by the General Partner. Fluctuations in prevailing interest rates could cause mark-to-market losses on
the Fund s fixed income instruments. 

Through
its investments in debt securities and certificates of deposit, the Fund has exposure to U.S. and foreign enterprises.
