 FORWARD-LOOKI NG STATEMENTS 
 Certain portions of this report, and particularly the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Sections 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Sections 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which represent the Company s expectations or beliefs concerning future events. The Company cautions that these statements are further qualified by important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, the following: the ability of the Company to generate adequate amounts of cash; the collectability of the excess of straight-line over contractual rent when due over the terms of the long-term leases; the commencement of additional long-term land leases; changes in economic conditions that may affect either the current or future development on the Company s parcels; the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy, parking operations, and the Company s financial performance, and exposure to remediation and other costs associated with its former ownership of a petroleum storage facility. The Company does not undertake the obligation to update forward-looking statements in response to new information, future events or otherwise. 
 Item 1. Business 
 Organizational History 
 The Company was organized as a business corporation under the laws of Rhode Island in 1983 as Providence and Worcester Company and is the successor by merger in 1983 to a corporation also named Providence and Worcester Company which was organized under the laws of Delaware in 1979. In 1984, the Company s name was changed to Capital Properties, Inc. 
 Business: 
 The Company s principal business is the leasing of Company-owned land in Capital Center Capital Center and property adjacent to Capital Center (Parcel 20) in downtown Providence, Rhode Island under long-term ground leases with terms of 99 years or more. (Hereinafter, the land in Capital Center and Parcel 20 are referred to as parcels within the Capital Center Area ). The Company owns approximately 18 acres in Capital Center consisting of 13 individual parcels. Capital Center (approximately 77 acres of land) is the result of a development project undertaken by the State of Rhode Island, the City of Providence, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation Amtrak and the Company during the 1980 s in which two rivers, the Moshassuck and the Woonasquatucket, were moved, Amtrak s Northeast Corridor rail line was relocated, a new Amtrak/commuter railroad station was constructed and significant public improvements were made to improve pedestrian and vehicular traffic in the area. The Company has not acted, and does not intend to act, as a developer with respect to any Company-owned parcels. 
 Under the Company s standard Ground Leases, the tenant is responsible for all property related operating expenses, such as real estate taxes, maintenance and insurance as well as all costs associated with the development and construction of the related improvements. Each Ground Lease contains provisions permitting the tenant to develop the parcel under certain terms and conditions and provides for periodic rent increases based on either a specific percentage, consumer price index CPI ), appraisal or combination thereof and sometimes includes percentage rent participation (contingent rent). The Ground Leases also provide that the tenants are responsible for insuring the Company against various hazards and events as well as indemnifying the Company with respect to all of the tenant s activities on the land. The Ground Leases contain other terms and conditions customary to such instruments. 
 While seeking developers, the Company also leases Parcels 3E, 3W, 4E, 4W and a portion of Parcel 20 in the Capital Center Area for public parking purposes to Metropark, Ltd. 

Generally speaking, a ground lease is a lease by the owner of the land (in this case, the Company) to the owners/operators of the real estate improvements built thereon by such owners/operators Ground Leases ). 
 
 3 
 
 Parcel 20 
 Parcel 20 consists of a parcel of land adjacent to the Capital Center, part of which is undeveloped and part of which contains a three/four-story 20,000 square foot building (the Steeple Street Building ). 
 In May 2018, the Company and a tenant entered into an Amended and Restated Ground Lease for Parcel 20. On December 1, 2018, the tenant took possession of Parcel 20 and the Company conveyed title to the Steeple Street Building to the tenant. Effective October 31, 2021 the lease with the tenant was terminated due to the tenant's failure to pay the first and second quarter real estate taxes along with any related penalties and interest. 
 The Parcel 20 Steeple Street Building Building lease was originally accounted for as a sales-type lease due to the transfer of the Building to the tenant. The land directly under the Building was allocated in the determination of the value of the property transferred in accordance with ASC 360-20, Property, Plant and Equipment Real Estate Sales . Since the initial investment by the tenant was insufficient to recognize the transaction as a sale, in accordance with ASC 360-20, the Company reported the acquisition period rent and an allocable portion of the ground rent collected as deferred revenue on its consolidated balance sheets. Upon termination of the lease, the 293,000 of deferred revenue through October 31, 2021 was recognized as leasing revenue in the consolidated statements of income and retained earnings. With the termination of the Parcel 20 lease, the Company became obligated for the real property taxes. 
 	 
 All of the properties described above are shown on the map contained in Exhibit 20. 
 Billboard Lease 
 The Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Tri-State Displays, Inc. leases 23 outdoor advertising locations containing 44 billboard faces along interstate and primary highways in Rhode Island and Massachusetts to Lamar Outdoor Advertising, LLC Lamar under a lease which expires in 2049 (the Lamar Lease ). All but one of these locations are controlled by the Company through permanent easements granted to the Company pursuant to an agreement between the Company and the Providence Worcester Railroad Company Railroad ); the remaining location is leased by the Company from a third party with a remaining term of two years. 
 Lamar has a right of first refusal for additional billboard location sites acquired by the Company in New England and Metropolitan New York City. 
 The Lamar lease provides, among other things, for annual base rent increases of 2.75 in June for each leased billboard location and participation in the revenue generated by each billboard, as defined in the agreement. The Lamar lease contains other terms and conditions customary to such instruments.

 Environmental 
 Prior to February 2017, the Company operated a petroleum storage facility Terminal through two of its wholly owned subsidiaries. On February 10, 2017, the Terminal was sold to Sprague Operating Resources, LLC Sprague which results in the Terminal s operations being classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. As part of the Terminal Sale Agreement, the Company agreed to complete the environmental remediation and pay for the costs related to a 1994 storage tank fuel oil leak which allowed the escape of a small amount of fuel oil. In February 2020, the Company filed a revised Remediation Action Work Plan RAWP with Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management RIDEM to incorporate technical details associated with the preferred remedial activities and to update the 2018 RAWP. During 2022, the remediation system was modified to address operational issues which impeded remediation activities. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred costs of 112,000 and increased the environmental remediation liability by 160,000 resulting in a liability of 406,000 at December 31, 2022. Any subsequent increases or decreases to the expected cost of remediation will be recorded in Company s consolidated income statements as gain or loss on sale of discontinued operations. 
 Insurance 
 The Company maintains what management believes to be adequate levels of insurance. 
 Item 2. P roperties 
 The Company owns approximately 18 acres and a historic building in the Capital Center Area of Providence, Rhode Island. With the exception of Parcel 6C and the Steeple Street Building, all of the Company s real property is leased either under long-term leases or short-term leases as more particularly described in Item 1, Business. Effective October 31, 2021, the Parcel 20 lease was terminated by the Company. The Company also owns or controls 23 locations in Rhode Island and Massachusetts on which 44 billboard faces have been constructed. All but one of these locations are owned by the Company under permanent easements from the Railroad; the remaining location is leased from an unrelated third party with a remaining term of two years. 
 Item 3. Legal Pr oceedings 
 In connection with the sale of the Company s petroleum storage terminal in 2017, the Company and the buyer, Sprague, entered into an agreement relating to the construction of a breasting dolphin pursuant to which any construction costs incurred in excess of the contract cost of the construction would be shared equally between the Company and Sprague subject to certain limitations. In November 2019, Sprague asserted that it was owed 427,000 and the Company asserted that its obligation under the Agreement could not exceed 104,000. Mediation efforts were unsuccessful and in July 2021, Sprague commenced an action against the Company in the Rhode Island Superior Court (Superior Court) seeking monetary damages of 427,000, interest and attorney s fees. In December 2022, the Superior Court denied Sprague s Motion for Summary Judgment filed in September 2022 and granted in part and denied in part the Company s Cross Motion for Summary Judgment also filed in September 2022. The Company anticipates that the matter will go to trial late in 2023 or early in 2024. The Company intends to vigorously defend against the claims being asserted by Sprague.

 Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ). The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations excludes the results of our discontinued operations unless otherwise noted. See Note 8, Discontinued operations and environmental incident in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these operations. 
 1. Overview: 

Critical accounting policies: 
 The Securities and Exchange Commission SEC has issued guidance for the disclosure of critical accounting policies. The SEC defines such policies as those that require application of management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. 
 The Company s significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates. Management believes that the Company s revenue recognition policy for long-term leases with scheduled rent increases meets the SEC definition of critical. 
 The Company s long-term leases (land and billboard) have original terms of 30 to 149 years. The Company follows GAAP in accounting for its leases by recognizing rental income on the straight-line basis over the term of the leases. Where the straight-line income exceeds the actual contractual payments Excess ), the Company evaluates the collectability of the entire stream of remaining lease payments on a lease-by-lease basis. If the remaining lease payments are not deemed to be probable of collection, in accordance with GAAP, lease revenue is recorded at the lower of straight-line rental income or the contractual amount paid. 
 The number of years remaining on the Company s leases range from twenty-seven (27) years to one hundred-thirty-one (131) years with total rents yet to be collected from tenants (without regard to CPI and appraisal adjustments) under the lease ranging from 19.5 million to 363.4 million. Given the length of the remaining lease term and the magnitude of the amount yet to be collected, along with the consideration of other factors, the Company has concluded that the remaining stream of lease payments is not probable of collection and as such, reports lease revenue based on the contractual amount paid. 
 2. Liquidity and capital resources: 

Historically, the Company generates adequate liquidity to fund its operations. 
 Cash and cash commitments: 
 The Company had cash and cash equivalents of 1,476,000 and 1,443,000 at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, inclusive of a money market account totaling 1,273,000 and 1,355,000 in each of the aforementioned years. The Company and its subsidiary each maintain checking accounts and one money market account in a financial institution which is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to a maximum of 250,000. The Company periodically evaluates the financial stability of the financial institutions at which the Company s funds are held. 
 Under the terms of each applicable long-term land lease, the contractual adjustments for the last two years were: 

Parcel Number 
 
 Monthly Increase 
 
 Effective Date of Increase 
 
 Type of Adjustment 

Parcel 9

 Base ground rent increase 

The City of Providence City conducted a City-wide property revaluation for 2022. This revaluation increased the assessed value of the Company s parcels that are available for lease by 26.5 , resulting in an annual property tax increase of 139,000 that was to be borne entirely by the Company. The Company's appeal of the assessed values for certain of its parcels was successful and resulted in a reduction of the assessed value to an amount less than the 2021 assessed value and in an annual property tax reduction in 2022 taxes as originally assessed of 165,000, which amount was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022. 
 Through February 17, 2023 all tenants have paid their monthly rent in accordance with their lease agreements except for Metropark, the tenant that operates public parking on the Company s undeveloped parcels other than Parcel 6C. The Company continues to report revenue from Metropark on a cash basis as the move by many companies to a hybrid workplace model has reduced demand for parking spaces. Metropark has not fully paid the rent per the original lease agreement executed in 2017 since April 2020. On July 31, 2020, Metropark and the Company entered into an agreement for 
 8 
 
 revenue sharing at various percentages until parking revenues received by Metropark equal or exceed 70,000 per month whereupon Metropark would be obligated to resume regularly scheduled rental payments under the 2017 lease. Upon resumption of regularly scheduled rent payments, Metropark and the Company will share fifty (50) percent of the monthly revenue in excess of 70,000 until the arrearage has been paid in full. If prior to payment in full of the arrearage one or more of the lots is removed from the Metropark lease for development, the amount of the then unpaid arrearage in the ratio of the number of parking spaces on the removed lot to the total parking spaces on all lots prior to such lot s removal shall be deemed paid in full. At December 31, 2022 the total rent arrearage is 1,031,000 and has been fully reserved. The Company does not know when or if Metropark s operations will return to pre-pandemic levels. 
 The Company expects that revenue from Metropark will continue to be recognized on a cash basis for a significant portion of 2023. 
 The Terminal Sale Agreement and related documentation provides that the Company is required to secure an approved remediation plan and to remediate contamination caused by a leak in 1994 from a storage tank at the Terminal. At December 31, 2022, the Company s accrual for the remaining cost of remediation was 406,000 of which 132,000 is expected to be expended in 2023. The Terminal Sale Agreement also contained a cost sharing provision for a breasting dolphin whereby any construction costs in excess of the contract cost of construction would be borne equally by Sprague and the Company subject to certain limitations, including, in the Company s opinion, a 20 cap on the increase from the initial estimate subject to the sharing arrangement. In November 2019, Sprague asserted that it was owed 427,000 and the Company asserted that its obligation under the Agreement could not exceed 104,000. Mediation efforts were unsuccessful and in July 2021, Sprague commenced an action against the Company in the Rhode Island Superior Court (Superior Court) seeking monetary damages of 427,000, plus interest and attorney s fees. In December 2022, the Superior Court denied Sprague s Motion for Summary Judgment filed in September 2022 and granted in part and denied in part the Company s Cross Motion for Summary Judgment also filed in September 2022. The Company anticipates that the matter will go to trial late in 2023 or early in 2024. The Company intends to vigorously defend against the claims being asserted by Sprague. See Note 8, Discontinued operations and environmental incident in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 In 2022, the Company declared and paid dividends of 1,848,000 or 0.28 per share. 
 The declaration of future dividends will depend on future earnings and financial performance.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGIST ERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of 
 Capital Properties, Inc. 
 Providence, Rhode Island 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Capital Properties, Inc. (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income and retained earnings, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Revenue Recognition Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 The Company derives revenue from long-term leases with original terms ranging from 30 years to 149 years. Effective January 1, 2019 the Company adopted ASC 842, Leases, and elected the package of practical expedients which permits the Company not to reassess under the new standard prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification, and initial indirect costs and determined that all pre-existing leases were properly accounted for as operating. The long-term leases contain periodic rent increases based on either a specific percentage, market appraisals, changes in the consumer price index or combination thereof. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, lease income should be recognized on a straight-line basis. Where straight-line income exceeds the actual contractual payments (the Excess ), the Excess should only be recognized to the extent it 
 11 
 
 is collectable. In accordance with ASC 842, if collectability of the lease payments is not probable, lease income shall be limited to the lesser of the income that would be recognized in accordance with ASC 842 (straight-line basis) or the actual lease payment, including variable payments that have been collected from the lessee. The Company evaluates the entire stream of remaining lease payments on a lease-by-lease basis. Analysis of collectability from the lessee (tenant) is subjective and complex and is dependent on many factors including historical experience and the creditworthiness of the tenant. The creditworthiness of the tenant can, and often is, significantly influenced by major factors including the creditworthiness of multiple sub-tenants. The inability to access reliable credit information on all parties impacting the probability of collection creates a collectability constraint. Management updates its collectability analysis of long-term leases annually and has determined that collection of the entire remaining stream of remaining lease payments is not probable. Accordingly lease revenue, including variable payments, is recorded when received from the lessee. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit 
 
 Our audit procedures related to the recognition of long-term lease revenue on a straight-line basis included the following, among others: 
 We evaluated the effectiveness of controls over lease revenue recognition, including managements analysis of and conclusions regarding collection probability. 

We evaluated the application of the Company s accounting policies in the context of the applicable accounting standards (ASC842) as adopted on January 1, 2019. 

We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of methods and assumptions used by management to determine and support its collection probability conclusion. 

We considered changes in the lease terms, including tenant payment patterns or other information, and determined such information was properly considered by management in its analysis.

The Company and its subsidiary each maintain a checking account and one money market account in a bank, all of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to a maximum of . The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts. 
 
 Certain of the Company s long-term leases (land and billboard) provide for presently known scheduled rent increases over the remaining terms to ). The Company follows GAAP in accounting for leases whereby revenue is recognized on straight-line basis over the terms of the leases when management is able to conclude that all remaining lease payments are collectable. To date, management has recognized revenue on a contractual basis as it has been unable to conclude that the remaining lease payments are realizable (collectable) due to the magnitude of the remaining lease payments to be collected, the length of the lease terms and other related uncertainties. The Company reports contingent revenue in the period in which the factors occur on which the contingent payments are predicated.

 long-term land leases, all of which have completed construction of improvements thereon. The leases generally have a term of years or more, are triple net, and provide for periodic adjustment in rent of various types depending on the particular lease, and otherwise contain terms and conditions normal for such instruments. In September 2021, the Company sent a Notice of Default Default Notice to the tenant of Parcel 20 for the nonpayment of September s rent and the 2021 first quarter property taxes. Subsequently, the tenant cured the rent default. On October 6, 2021 the tenant was sent a Notice of Lease Termination Termination Notice informing the tenant that the lease would terminate on October 18, 2021 unless the failure to pay the first quarter real estate taxes along with any related penalties and interest was cured. Subsequently, it was agreed that, provided the first and second quarter real estate taxes and any related penalties and interest were paid in full by October 31, 2021, the lease would not be terminated. Since payment was not made, the lease was terminated effective October 31, 2021. The Parcel 20 Steeple Street Building Building lease was originally accounted for as a sales-type lease due to the transfer of the Building to the tenant. The land directly under the Building was allocated in the determination of the value of the property transferred in accordance with ASC 360-20, Property, Plant and Equipment - Real Estate Sales . Since the initial investment by the tenant was insufficient to recognize the transaction as a sale, in accordance with ASC 360-20, the Company reported the acquisition period rent and an allocable portion of the ground rent collected as deferred revenue on its consolidated balance sheet. Upon termination of the lease, deferred revenue of through October 31, 2021 was recognized as leasing revenue in the consolidated statements of income and retained earnings. With the termination of the Parcel 20 lease, the Company became obligated for the real property taxes associated with the parcel. Under the land leases, the tenants may negotiate tax stabilization treaties or other arrangements, appeal any changes in real property assessments, and pay real property taxes assessed on land and improvements under these arrangements. Accordingly, real property taxes payable by the tenants are excluded from leasing revenues and leasing expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of income and retained earnings. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the real property taxes attributable to the Company s land under leases, exclusive of Parcel 2 which is a condominium, were and , respectively. Under of the long-term land leases, the Company receives contingent rentals (based on a fixed percentage of gross revenue received by the tenants) which totaled and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The City of Providence City conducted a City-wide property revaluation for 2022. This revaluation increased the assessed value of the Company s parcels that are available for lease by , resulting in an annual property tax increase of . The Company s appeal of the assessed values for certain of its parcels was successful and resulted in a reduction of the assessed value to an amount less than the 2021 assessed value and in an annual property tax reduction in 2022 taxes as originally assessed of , which amount was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022. Property tax expense associated with the Company's parcels that are available for lease was and , respectively, which amounts are included in operating expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of income and retained earnings for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Lamar lease: Tri-State Display s, Inc., leases outdoor advertising locations containing billboard faces along interstate and primary highways in Rhode Island and Massachusetts to Lamar under a lease which expires in . The Lamar lease provides, among other things, for the following: (1) the base rent will increase annually at the rate of for each leased billboard location on June 1 of each year, and (2) in addition to base rent, for each -month period commencing each June 1, Lamar must pay to the Company within after the close of the lease year of the gross revenues from each standard billboard and of the gross revenues from each electronic billboard for such 12-month period, reduced by the sum of (a) commissions paid to third parties and (b) base monthly rent for each leased billboard display for each 12-month period. For the lease years ended May 31, 2022 and 2021, the percentage rent totaled and , respectively, which amounts are included in operating revenues on the accompanying consolidated statements of income and retained earnings for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Parking lease: The Company leases the undeveloped parcels of land in or adjacent to the Capital Center area (other than Parcel 6C) for public parking purposes to Metropark under a lease. The lease is cancellable as to all or any portion of the leased premises at any time on s written notice in order for the Company or any new tenant of the Company to develop all or any portion of the leased premises. The parking lease provides for contingent rent based on a fixed percentage of gross revenue in excess of the base rent as defined in the agreement. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have an adverse impact on Metropark s parking operations as the move by many companies to a hybrid workplace model (one that mixes in-office and remote work) has resulted in lower demand for parking spaces. The Company and Metropark continue to operate under the June 30, 2020 revenue sharing agreement that provides for revenue sharing at various percentages until parking revenues received by Metropark equal or exceed per month whereupon Metropark would be obligated to resume regularly scheduled rental payments under its lease. Upon resumption of regularly scheduled rent payments, Metropark and the Company will share fifty percent of the revenue in excess of until the arrearage has been paid in full. If prior to payment in full of the arrearage one or more of the lots is removed from the Metropark lease for development, the amount of the then unpaid arrearage in the ratio of the number of parking spaces on the removed lot to the total parking spaces on all lots prior to such lot s removal shall be deemed paid in full. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the receivable from Metropark equaled and , respectively, and was fully reserved in both years. The Company will continue to recognize Metropark s rent on a cash basis for the foreseeable future.

Consistent with prior conclusions, the Company has determined that, at this time, the excess of straight-line rentals over contractual payments is not probable of collection. Accordingly, the Company has not included any part of that amount in revenue. As a matter of information only, as of December 31, 2022 the excess of straight-line rentals (calculated by excluding variable payments) over contractual payments was . In the event of tenant default, the Company has the right to reclaim its leased land together with any improvements thereon, subject to the right of any leasehold mortgagee to enter into a new lease with the Company with the same terms and conditions as the lease in default.

In accordance with ASC 205-20, Presentation of Financial Statements Discontinued Operations , the sale of the Terminal is accounted for as a discontinued operation. As part of the Terminal Sale Agreement, the Company agreed to retain and pay for the environmental remediation costs associated with a 1994 storage tank fuel oil leak which allowed the escape of a small amount of fuel oil. The Company continues the remediation activities set forth in the Remediation Action Work Plan RAWP filed with the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management RIDEM ).

 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Acco untants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure 
 There were no changes in, or disagreements with, accountants on accounting or financial disclosure as defined by Item 304 of Regulation S-K. 
 Item 9A. Control s and Procedures 
 Under the supervision of the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of such date, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in making them aware on a timely basis of the material information relating to the Company required to be included in the Company s periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). The Company s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of its financial reporting and the preparation of published financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. 
 However, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies may deteriorate. 
 Management conducted its evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO as of December 31, 2022. 
 Based on this assessment, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer believe that as of December 31, 2022, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on criteria set forth by COSO in 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework. 
 This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this annual report. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, there has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
