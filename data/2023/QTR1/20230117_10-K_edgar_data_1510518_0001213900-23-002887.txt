ii 

ITEM 1.
BUSINESS 

The discussion of the business of Genufood Energy Enzymes Corp. and
its wholly-owned subsidiary Genufood we or the Company ), is as of the date of filing this report,
unless otherwise indicated. 

Original
Business 

During
our historic period, we were a start-up company whose main focus was to promote, market, distribute and export a range of enzyme products
manufactured in the United States for sale for human and animal consumption in certain Asian markets, including the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations ASEAN ). Our objective was to commence marketing and distribution of a range of enzyme products for human
and animal consumption to sole country distributors, wholesalers, dealers and retailers, as well as to the general public following a
Multi-Level Marketing Franchise Investor Dealer Related (MLM-FIDR) concept, beginning in Taiwan, and then China, Hong Kong, Macau,
Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Sri Lanka. 

At
some point, which we believe may have occurred approximately mid- to late-2016, Oliver Lin s management ceased operating our original
business. We have not generated any revenue from operations since that time. 

Recent
Developments 

In
2019 and through the end of fiscal 2021, we explored plans to restart our enzyme products business or develop a new business. In 2019
and through early 2020, we had planned to restart our original enzyme products business, by importing enzyme supplements from the United
States for sale in Taiwan. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all non-COVID-19 related matters, including obtaining an import license
from Taiwan s Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration FDA ), were delayed or were
taking longer than usual in Taiwan beginning in late-January 2020. For various reasons, including the fact that, without a reasonably
foreseeable end of the pandemic and Taiwan government resources being shifted to dealing with the pandemic, we decided to abandon the
plan to restart our enzyme products business. 

During
fiscal year 2020, we announced that we were in the preliminary stage of developing a new business plan to sell and distribute physiological
sea water and nasal spray in Taiwan and the United States. However, after exploring this possible business as a result of several factors,
including but not limited to difficulties in commencing a new business during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we decided not to pursue
the nasal spray business. 

In
September 2020, we announced that we were exploring business opportunities for medical mask, medical-grade gloves and possibly other
PPE. During fiscal 2021, due to lack of sufficient funding, we decided not to pursue the PPE business. We continued to explore other
products with high demand since the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically rapid test kits. However, due to lack of funding and
other factors, including the size of enterprise needed to successfully carry out such a business, we no longer intend to pursue this
business. 

On August 1, 2022, the board of directors (the Board of the Company unanimously approved to expand our business in the area of electric vehicle supply equipment EVSE and will
direct the management team to implement our new business plan in such industry. On August 16, 2022, we formally announced our intention
to reposition as EVSE solutions provider, seeking to grow business in EVSE industry, including building, owning, and operating the next
generation of electric vehicle charging stations in the U.S. We intend to bring convenient, reliable, and accessible charging experience
to electric vehicle drivers, utilizing frictionless technology and carbon-neutral vehicle-charging infrastructure. 

On October 26, 2022, we entered into three Charging Station Site Host
Agreements (the Agreements with two institutions (the Site Hosts ), respectively, pursuant to which the Site
Hosts agree to allow us to install our electric vehicle charging stations at the locations set forth in the Agreements (the Charging
Stations ). Under the Agreements, we have agreed to share our revenue generated by the sales of electricity at the Charging Stations
with the Site Hosts in accordance with the schedules set forth therein. 

At
this time, we reserve the right to further change our business plan at any time. 

1 

Hukui
Investment 

In
late September 2020, we announced that we and Hukui Biotechnology Corporation Hukui had entered into a Series C Preferred
Shares Subscription Agreement dated September 23, 2020 (the Hukui Agreement ), pursuant to which we have agreed to purchase an
aggregate 200,000 shares of Hukui s Series C Preferred Stock Series C Preferred Shares at 10.00 per share, for
an aggregate investment of 2,000,000. 

The
Hukui Agreement provided that we would purchase the Series C Preferred Shares in three tranches, through a date on or before June 30,
2022, as follows: 

The
 first tranche is 80,000 Series C Preferred Shares in the amount of 800,000 (the First
 Tranche Investment ), such shares having been purchased by us on December 15, 2020
 (the First Tranche Closing 

The
 second tranche is 60,000 Series C Preferred Shares in the amount of 600,000 (the Second
 Tranche Investment ), such shares having been purchased by us on June 25, 2021 (the
 Second Tranche Closing and 

The
 third tranche is 60,000 Series C Preferred Shares in the amount of 600,000 (the Third
 Tranche Investment ), such shares to have been purchased on or before June 30, 2022
 (the Third Tranche Closing ). 

Following
the end of our 2021 fiscal year, an individual and resident of the Republic of China (the Purchaser ), Hukui and us entered
into a Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of November 17, 2021 (the Stock Purchase Agreement ), pursuant to which we agreed
to sell the 140,000 shares of Hukui s Series C Preferred Stock that we had purchased in the First Tranche Closing and the Second
Tranche Closing (the Hukui Shares to the Purchaser for 350,000 in cash, or 2.50 per share. The sale of the Hukui Shares
closed on November 19, 2021. 

As
a result of our original purchase of the first 80,000 of the Hukui Shares on December 15, 2020, together with certain other factors,
we may have been deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company
Act ). To the extent that we may have been deemed to be an investment company, we have been relying on Rule 3a-2 promulgated under
the Investment Company Act, allowing us to terminate our investment company status on or before December 15, 2021, the first anniversary
of our purchase of the first 80,000 of the Hukui Shares, without having to register and be regulated as an investment company. 

Believing
that it is not in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to register and be regulated as an investment company under
the Investment Company Act, we explored different lawful means by which we could terminate our potential investment company status. We
determined that the only viable option to terminate our potential investment company status and lawfully avoid registration and regulation
under the Investment Company Act was to sell the Hukui Shares on or before the December 15, 2021 deadline. 

After
making diligent efforts to seek a purchaser of the Hukui Shares, we received three all-cash offers to purchase the Hukui Shares. We accepted
the offer of the Purchaser, which was the highest of the three all-cash offers that we received. 

We
had purchased the Hukui Shares in two tranches, on December 15, 2020 and June 30, 2021, pursuant to the Hukui Agreement, at 10.00 per
share, for an aggregate purchase price of 1,400,000. We sold the Hukui Shares at 2.50 per share, for a total price of 350,000,
resulting in loss of 1,050,000. We recognized impairment loss of the market value of the shares of 1,050,000 for the year ended September
30, 2021. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

On
December 17, 2021, Hukui and us entered into an Agreement (the Termination Agreement ), pursuant to which our obligation
to make the Third Tranche Investment was terminated and the Hukui Agreement was terminated. As a result, we have no continuing contractual
obligation to make any investment in Hukui. 

2 

With
the sale of the Hukui Shares, we believe that we are no longer deemed to be an investment company as defined in the Investment Company
Act and, accordingly, we are not required to register and be regulated as an investment company thereunder. Additionally, with the execution
of the Termination Agreement, the possibility that we could again become an inadvertent investment company under the Investment Company
Act has been removed. 

We
have decided to expand our business in the area of electric vehicle supply equipment EVSE ), and we will need to raise
capital to pursue such a business. There are no commitments in place to fund such business and no guarantee can be given that we will
be able to secure such funding on terms that are favorable to us, or at all . 

Certain
Regulatory Matters 

Blank
Check Company 

Based
on the current and proposed business activities described above, the Company is a blank check company pursuant to Rule
419(a)(2) under the Securities Act. The Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC defines a blank check company as any
development stage company that is issuing a penny stock, within the meaning of Section 3 (a)(51) of the Exchange Act, and that has no
specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies. 

Rule
419 requires, among other things, that the proceeds of any public offering of penny stock securities by a blank check company, and all
securities issued by a blank check company in such an offering, must be placed in a formal escrow or trust account until certain conditions
specified in Rule 419 have been satisfied. In addition, many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of
securities of blank check companies in their respective jurisdictions. 

Shell
Company 

Pursuant
to Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, we are also a shell company because we have no or nominal assets (other than cash)
and no or nominal operations. As such, we are subject to a variety of regulations. As we have also previously disclosed, certain specific
rules and regulations of the SEC apply to shell companies, including the following: 

Shell companies may not
 register securities in connection with an employee benefit plan while they are a shell company and for 60 days after reporting certain
 current public information to the SEC regarding transactions or events resulting in the termination of shell company status. 

Stockholders of shell companies
 may not rely on the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144, until the following primary requirements have been satisfied:
 (i) one year has elapsed since the company ceases to be a shell company and certain current information has been timely filed with
 the SEC regarding the cessation of the company s status as a shell company; (ii) the company is subject to the reporting requirements
 under the Exchange Act; and (iii) the company has been current in all of its periodic SEC filings for the 12 months preceding the
 contemplated sale of stock. 

3 

Reporting shell companies
 are required to disclose transactions and events that result in a shell company ceasing to be a shell company. Such disclosure is
 typically made on a Current Report on Form 8-K, which requires extensive information about the transactions and events in issue.

discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial statements, including the Notes thereto, for
the years ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2022, beginning on Page F-1. 

Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Overview 

During
our historic period, we were a start-up company whose main focus was to promote, market, distribute and export a range of enzyme products
manufactured in the United States for sale for human and animal consumption in certain Asian markets, including ASEAN. Our objective
was to commence marketing and distribution of a range of enzyme products for human and animal consumption to sole country distributors,
wholesalers, dealers and retailers, as well as to the general public following a Multi-Level Marketing Franchise Investor Dealer
Related (MLM-FIDR) concept, beginning in Taiwan, and then China, Hong Kong, Macau, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Sri Lanka. 

At
some point, which we believe may have occurred approximately mid- to late-2016, Oliver Lin s management ceased operating our original
business. We have not generated any revenue from operations since that time. 

In
2019 and through the end of fiscal 2021, we explored plans to restart our enzyme products business or develop a new business. In 2019
and through early 2020, we had planned to restart our original enzyme products business, by importing enzyme supplements from the United
States for sale in Taiwan. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all non-COVID-19 related matters, including obtaining an import license
from Taiwan s Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Taiwan FDA, were delayed or were taking longer than usual in Taiwan beginning
in late-January 2020. For various reasons, including the fact that, without a reasonably foreseeable end of the pandemic and Taiwan government
resources being shifted to dealing with the pandemic, we decided to abandon the plan to restart our enzyme products business. 

During
fiscal year 2020, we announced that we were in the preliminary stage of developing a new business plan to sell and distribute physiological
sea water and nasal spray in Taiwan and the United States. However, after exploring this possible business as a result of several factors,
including but not limited to difficulties in commencing a new business during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we decided not to pursue
the nasal spray business. 

In
September 2020, we announced that we were exploring business opportunities for medical mask, medical-grade gloves and possibly other
PPE. During fiscal 2021, due to lack of sufficient funding, we decided not to pursue the PPE business. We continued to explore other
products with high demand since the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically rapid test kits. However, due to lack of funding and
other factors, including the size of enterprise needed to successfully carry out such a business, we no longer intend to pursue this
business. 

On August 1, 2022, the board of directors (the Board of the Company unanimously approved to expand our business in the area of electric vehicle supply equipment EVSE and will
direct the management team to implement our new business plan in such industry. On August 16, 2022, we formally announced our intention
to reposition as EVSE solutions provider, seeking to grow business in EVSE industry, including building, owning, and operating the next
generation of electric vehicle charging stations in the U.S. We intend to bring convenient, reliable, and accessible charging experience
to electric vehicle drivers, utilizing frictionless technology and carbon-neutral vehicle-charging infrastructure. 

On
October 26, 2022, we entered into three Charging Station Site Host Agreements (the Agreements with two institutions (the
 Site Hosts ), respectively, pursuant to which the Site Hosts agree to allow us to install our electric vehicle charging
stations at the locations set forth in the Agreements (the Charging Stations ). Under the Agreements, we agree to share
our revenue generated by the sales of electricity at the Charging Stations with the Site Hosts in accordance with the schedules set forth
therein. 

At
this time, we reserve the right to further change our business plan at any time.

Hukui
Investment 

In
late September 2020, we announced that Hukui and we had entered into the Hukui Agreement, pursuant to which we agreed to purchase an
aggregate 200,000 shares of Hukui s Series C Preferred Shares at 10.00 per share, for an aggregate investment of 2,000,000. 

The
Hukui Agreement provided that we would purchase the Series C Preferred Shares in three tranches, through a date on or before June 30,
2022, as follows: 

The First Tranche Investment
 is 80,000 Series C Preferred Shares in the amount of 800,000, such shares having been purchased by us on December 15, 2020 in the
 First Tranche Closing; 

The Second Tranche Investment
 is 60,000 Series C Preferred Shares in the amount of 600,000, such shares having been purchased by us on June 25, 2021 in the Second
 Tranche Closing; and 

The Third Tranche Investment
 is 60,000 Series C Preferred Shares in the amount of 600,000, such shares to have been purchased on or before June 30, 2022 in the
 Third Tranche Closing. 

Following
the end of our 2021 fiscal year, the Purchaser, Hukui and we entered into the Stock Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which we agreed to
sell the 140,000 Hukui Shares that we had purchased in the First Tranche Closing and the Second Tranche Closing to the Purchaser for
 350,000 in cash, or 2.50 per share. The sale of the Hukui Shares closed on November 19, 2021. 

We
had purchased the Hukui Shares in two tranches, on December 15, 2020 and June 30, 2021, pursuant to the Hukui Agreement, at 10.00 per
share, for an aggregate purchase price of 1,400,000. We sold the Hukui Shares at 2.50 per share, for a total price of 350,000,
resulting in loss of 1,050,000. We recognized impairment loss of the market value of the shares of 1,050,000 for the year ended September
30, 2021. See Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

On
December 17, 2021, Hukui and we entered into the Termination Agreement, pursuant to which our obligation to make the Third Tranche Investment
was terminated and the Hukui Agreement was terminated. As a result, we have no continuing contractual obligation to make any investment
in Hukui. 

As
we are currently pursuing business in the area of electric vehicle supply equipment EVSE ), we will need to raise capital
to pursue such a business. There are no commitments in place to fund any such business and no guarantee can be given that we will be
able to secure such funding on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. 

For
the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, Jui Pin (John) Lin, our former President and Chief Executive Officer, periodically provided
the capital we needed to operate in the form of loans in the aggregate principal amount of 120,410, the principal and accrued and unpaid
interest of which are convertible, at his option, into shares of our Common Stock at 0.05 per share. On December 28, 2020, we repaid
Mr. Lin 65,410 of the principal amount of loans due and payable plus accrued interest in the amount of 1,162, for a total of 66,572.
On January 5, 2021, we repaid Mr. Lin 20,000 of the principal amount of another such loan due and payable plus accrued interest in the
amount of 403, for a total of 20,403. 

On
August 26, 2020, Jui Pin (John) Lin loaned us 35,000 at 4 interest rate and six months maturity. The loan was repaid on February
26, 2021 in the principal amount of 35,000, together with interest in the amount of of 706, for a total of 35,706. 

On
October 9, 2020, another stockholder loaned us 30,000 (the October 2020 Loan ), on substantially the same terms as the
terms of the loans from Mr. Lin. On April 9, 2021, the lender converted the outstanding principal, together with accrued and unpaid interest
in the amount of 598, into 3,059,836 shares of the Company s Common Stock, at a rate of 0.01 per share. 

During
the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, we raised an aggregate 1.8 million in two private offerings, the Fall 2020 Offering and the
Spring 2021 Offering, to raise the capital needed to fund our operations and make the First Tranche Investment and Second Tranche Investment
in Hukui. 

We
may also raise equity, debt, convertible debt or a combination of any of the foregoing, from other parties for the capital we may need
for any of the purposes specified in this report. There is no agreement in place between the Company and anyone for such capital to continue
to be made available to us as needed, and we cannot guarantee that any such capital will continue to be available to us on favorable
terms, or at all, in the future.

Results
of Operations 

Year
Ended September 30, 2022 compared to the Year Ended September 30, 2021 

Revenues 

We
did not generate any revenues during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. 

Operating
Expenses 

We
incurred total operating expenses of 396,311 and 363,637 for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our operating
expenses consist of legal fees, other professional fees, payroll expenses, stock-based compensation, rent, bank charges, and transfer
agent fees. The increase in operating expenses for the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period ended in 2021 was primarily
due to the increase in payroll expenses and stock-based compensation. 

Other
expense 

During the year ended September 30, 2022, we incurred 3,823 other
expenses mainly due to interest incurred for unpaid penalty from IRS. During the year ended September 30, 2021, we had a net other income
of 52,250, which included incurred 78,476 of other income due to liabilities written off, partially offset by a 25,000 penalty plus
interest of 1,226 from the IRS for failing to file Form 5472 timely. During the year ended September 30, 2021 we incurred 1,050,000
impairment loss of investment. We invested 1,400,000 in Hukui s Series C Preferred stock, which was sold on November 17, 2021 for
 350,000, resulting in loss of 1,050,000. We wrote down the investment on September 30, 2021 to reflect fair market value of the investment. 

Net
Loss 

As
a result of the above, our net loss decreased from 1,364,432 in the year ended September 30, 2021 to 400,134 in the same period ended
in 2022. 

Effect
of the COVID-19 Pandemic on our Business 

While
our liquidity and capital resources are severely limited and present serious obstacles to starting a business, these limitations are
unrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global economic crisis. 

Our
personnel are in Taiwan, which has been relatively less affected by the pandemic compared to many other countries in Asia, Europe and
the United States. However, even before an increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 in Taiwan, we experienced delays in obtaining
business licenses and permits, and any other governmental approvals that might have been required for businesses that we previously considered
commencing, since government offices have been working with reduced staff during the pandemic. We expect this situation to continue and
possibly become more challenging depending upon the duration of the pandemic. 

Depending
upon the extent and duration of the pandemic and the resulting global economic crisis, these conditions may have an adverse impact on
our ability to raise capital and commence any business we may pursue.

As
of September 30, 2022, we had current assets of 150,893 and a working deficit of 54,123. In comparison, as of September 30, 2021, we
had current assets of 35,044 and a working capital deficit of 70,302. 

As of September 30, 2022, we
had total assets of 150,893, compared with total assets of 385,044 at September 30, 2021. The decrease in total assets was primarily
due to the sale of investment and cash spent in operating expenses after selling the 140,000 Hukui Shares for cash. 

We
had 205,016 in total current liabilities as of September 30, 2022, consisting of 102,185 in accounts payable and 102,831 due to related
parties. This is compared to total current liabilities of 105,346 in total current liabilities as of September 30, 2021, consisting
of 100,746 in accounts payable, 1,590 in accrued expenses, and 3,010 due to related parties. The increase in due to related parties
was primarily due to unpaid compensation to officers and directors. 

We
had total stockholders deficit of 83,349 and an accumulated deficit of 9,922,955 as of September 30, 2022. In comparison, we
had a total stockholders equity of 253,472 and an accumulated deficit of 9,522,821 as of September 30, 2021. 

On
December 15, 2020, we completed a private offering of our Common Stock. We sold 107,000,000 shares of our Common Stock to 34 individuals
at a purchase price of 0.01 per share, for gross proceeds of 1,070,000 before allocating certain expenses associated with the offering
in the amount of 5,852 as adjusted paid-in capital. 

Effective March 31, 2021, we issued an aggregate 6,399,965 shares of
our Common Stock to some of our directors, officers, employees and independent consultants, who converted accrued and unpaid compensation
in the aggregate amount of 94,398. Of this amount, (i) 37,998 was with respect to amounts accrued during fiscal year 2020 and was converted
at a rate of 0.05 per share into an aggregate 759,965 shares of our Common Stock; and (ii) 56,400 was with respect to amount accrued
during fiscal year 2021 through March 31, 2021 and was converted at a rate of 0.01 per share into an aggregate 5,640,000 shares of our
Common Stock. 

On
April 9, 2021, we issued 3,059,836 shares of our Common Stock to repay the principal and interest accrued upon the maturity of the October
2020 Note. 

On
June 15, 2021, we sold and issued 63,000,000 shares of our Common Stock to 18 individuals at purchase price of 0.01 per share in the
Spring 2021 Offering. Gross proceeds were 630,000, before allocating certain expenses associated with the offering in the amount of
 7,230 as adjusted paid-in capital. 

On
July 15, 2021, the Company completed the Spring 2021 Offering of its Common Stock, on which date it sold and issued additional 10,000,000 shares
of its Common Stock to five individuals at a purchase price of 0.01 per share, for gross proceeds of 100,000, before allocating
certain expenses associated with the offering in the amount of 959 as adjusted paid-in-capital. 

During
the year ended September 30, 2021, one of our shareholders made a loan to us in the principal amount of 30,000 (the October 2020
Loan ), primarily to pay our expenses. The October 2020 Loan bore simple interest at a rate of 4 per annum and was payable as
to both principal and interest on the maturity date of April 9, 2021. On the maturity date, the holder of the note evidencing the
October 2020 Loan converted the outstanding principal, together with accrued and unpaid interest of 598, into 3,059,836 shares of our
Common Stock, at the rate of 0.01 per share.

During
the year ended September 30, 2022, we used 222,828 of cash in operating activities which was attributable primarily to our net loss
of 400,134 offset by change in issuance of stock option and operating assets and liabilities of 177,306. In comparison, during the
year ended September 30, 2021, we used 304,588 of cash in operating activities which was attributable primarily to our net loss of 1,364,432
offset by impairment of 1,050,000 to investment and change in operating assets and liabilities of 9,844. 

With
respect to our investing activities, we received 350,000 in payment for the sale of the 140,000 Hukui Shares during the year ended September
30, 2022. During the year ended September 30, 2021, we used 1,400,000 for investment in Hukui. 

During
the year ended September 30, 2022, we did not have any financing activity. During the year ended September 30, 2021, we had total cash
inflow of 1,695,549 from financing activities. We received 30,000 from the October 2020 Loan. We repaid 120,410 to the notes
from related party, who was our then President and Chief Executive Officer, Jui Pin Lin. We received 1,785,959, net of directly associated
expenses, including legal, transfer agent, and printing and delivery expenses, from two private offerings of our Common Stock, which
were completed in December 2020 and July 2021, respectively. For accounting purpose, we recorded the net proceeds from private offering
instead of the gross amount of 1,800,000. 

There
is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay
our expenses as they become due. We do not anticipate any significant additional revenue until and unless we begin to execute on our
plan of operations involving the start of our new electric vehicle charging station business. There is no assurance that we will ever
reach that stage. The consolidated financial statements presented herein do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability
and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event that we
cannot continue as a going concern. 

Our
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to successfully execute our business plan and generate profitable
operations in the future, and, until and unless we achieve that, to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay
our liabilities arising from normal business operation as and when they become due. To date, our capital requirements have primarily
been funded by shareholders through the purchase of our Common Stock in private offerings and short-term borrowings from a former officer
and another shareholder. 

The
Company sold the 140,000 Hukui Shares for 350,000 cash on November 19, 2021. The proceeds have been used for operation
expenses. 

10 

Contractual
Obligations 

We
do not have material contractual obligations and commitments. We only have one lease that is renewed on a month-to-month basis. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

As of September 30, 2022, we had not entered into any other financial
guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any third parties. As of September 30, 2022, we had not entered
into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our shares and classified as shareholder s equity or that are not reflected in
our consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, as of September 30, 2022, we had not had any retained or contingent interest in assets
transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. As of September 30, 2022,
we had not had any variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support to
us or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us. 

Critical
accounting policies and estimates 

Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated
financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We continually evaluate our estimates, including those related
to income taxes, and the valuation of equity transactions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions
that we believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Any future changes to these estimates and assumptions
could cause a material change to our reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions. For the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, no significant estimates and assumptions
have been made in the consolidated financial statements. The following are some of the critical accounting policies in relation to the
preparation of the consolidated financial statements. For a full summary of our critical accounting policies, please refer to Note 2
to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Foreign
currency translation 

The
financial statements of our subsidiary denominated in currencies other than the USD are translated into USD using the closing rate method.
The balance sheet items are translated into USD using the exchange rates at the respective balance sheet dates. The capital and various
reserves are translated at historical exchange rates prevailing at the time of the transactions while income and expenses items are translated
at the average exchange rate for the period. All exchange differences are recorded in stockholders equity. 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

We
account for stock-based compensation in which we obtain employee services in share-based payment transactions under FASB ASC Topic 718,
Compensation Stock Compensation, which requires us to expense the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award
of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of such instruments over the vesting period. 

Recent
accounting pronouncements 

We
do not expect that the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material impact on our financial position, results
of operations, or cash flows. For a full summary of recent accounting pronouncements, please refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. 

Currency
exchange rates 

Our
functional currency is the USD, and the functional currency of our operations is the TWD. It is anticipated that all of our sales will
be denominated in TWD. As a result, changes in the relative values of USD and TWD affect our reported amounts of revenues and profit
(or loss) as the results of our operations are translated into USD for reporting purposes. In particular, fluctuations in currency exchange
rates could have a significant impact on our financial stability. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the USD and the TWD would also
affect our gross and net profit margins and could result in foreign exchange and operating losses. 

11 

Our
exposure to foreign exchange risk primarily relates to currency gains or losses resulting from timing differences between the signing
of sales contracts and the settling of these contracts. Furthermore, we translate monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other
currencies into TWD, the functional currency of our operations. Our results of operations and cash flow are translated at average exchange
rates during the period, and assets and liabilities are translated at the unified exchange rate at the end of the period. Translation
adjustments resulting from this process are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in our statement of shareholders 
equity. We have not used any forward contracts, currency options or borrowings to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk.
We cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations and may incur net foreign currency losses
in the future. 

To
the extent that we hold assets denominated in USD, any appreciation of the TWD against the USD could result in a charge in our statement
of operations and a reduction in the value of our USD-denominated assets. On the other hand, a decline in the value of the TWD against
the USD could reduce the USD equivalent amounts of our financial results. 

For
financial reporting purposes, the financial statements of the Company s Singapore subsidiary, which are prepared using the SGD,
are translated into the Company s reporting currency, USD. Assets and liabilities are translated using the exchange rate on the
balance sheet date, which was 0.6970 and 0.7368 as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Revenue and expenses are translated
using average exchange rates prevailing during each reporting period. The 0.7293 and 0.7458 average exchange rates were used to translate
revenues and expenses for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Stockholders equity is translated at historical
exchange rates. Adjustments resulting from the translation are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss
in stockholders deficit.

On February 23, 2022, (i) DYH Company DYH resigned
as the independent registered public accounting firm of the Company; and (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company, which acts as the
audit committee, engaged KCCW Accountancy Corp. KCCW as the Company s new independent registered public accounting
firm. 

The
reports of DYH on the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2021 did
not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting
principle. 

During
the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2021 and through February 23, 2022, there were no disagreements with DYH on any matter of accounting
principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the
satisfaction of DYH, would have caused DYH to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in its reports on the Company s
consolidated financial statements for such years. 

The
Company has provided DYH with a copy of the disclosures it is making herein and has requested that DYH furnish it with a letter addressed
to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether or not DYH agrees with the above statements. A copy of such letter is provided
herewith as Exhibit 16.1. 

No
consultations occurred between the Company and KCCW during the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2021 and through February 23, 2022,
regarding either (i) the application of accounting principles to a specific completed or proposed transaction, the type of audit opinion
that might be rendered on the Company s financial statements, or other written or oral information provided that was an important
factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to an accounting, auditing, or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter
that was either the subject of a disagreement, as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions
to Item 304 of Regulation S-K, or a reportable event, as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. 

ITEM 9A.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that the information relating to our Company, including our consolidated subsidiaries,
required to be disclosed in our SEC reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC
rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer,
as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with
the participation of management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer
and chief financial officer concluded that, as of the evaluation date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due
to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, as described below. 

12 

Management s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined
in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our chief executive
officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the design and operating effectiveness of our internal controls over
financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). 

Our
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets; (ii) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,
or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 

Management
assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of evaluation date and identified the
following material weaknesses: 

Inadequate
Segregation of Duties : We have an inadequate number of personnel to properly implement control procedures. 

Comingling
of funds: We do not have adequate control of our petty cash, resulting in the comingling of our petty cash with the nominal account
holder s personal funds. 

Lack
of Adequate Staffing: We do not have adequate in-house accounting personnel and expertise in key positions, resulted in overly
relying on outside consultants in preparing financial statements and other required disclosures by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Ineffective
oversight: We do not exercise effective oversight and monitoring procedures designed and implemented to certain control activities. 

Overly
relied on outside professionals: We are unable to prepare internally financial statements and relied on outside professional consultants
to prepare financial statements and adequate disclosures. 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. As a result of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting identified above,
management concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2022 based
on the criteria set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by COSO. 

Due to the nature of the material weaknesses, there is a more than
remote likelihood that misstatements which could be material to the annual or interim financial statements could occur that would not
be prevented or detected. The material weaknesses identified above either individually or in aggregation did not result in any identified
misstatements or errors in the Company s consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended September 30, 2022. 

13 

Management s
Plan for Remediation 

Management
has discussed the material weaknesses noted above with our independent registered public accounting firm. Management is committed to
improving its internal controls and, subject to having adequate financial resources, intends to: 

increase the frequency
 of independent reconciliations of significant accounts which will mitigate the lack of segregation of duties to monitor and review
 until there are sufficient personnel to segregate duties; 

consider providing professional
 courses for our key position personnel; 

hire additional employees
 to realize segregation of duties; and 

strengthen management monitoring control over accounting
 and financial statements preparation processing. 

However,
due to limitation of funds and personnel, we have so far been unable to begin to implement the plan to remediate the material weaknesses
noted above. 

Inherent
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 

A
control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s
objectives will be met. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all
control issues or misstatements. Accordingly, our controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of our control system are met. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
risk that controls may become adequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate. 

Changes
in Internal Control 

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended September 30, 2022 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

None
of our directors presently serves as a director of any other public companies. We have not entered into indemnification agreements with
our directors, although they have indemnification protection under the laws of the State of Nevada, in which we are incorporated. We
do not currently maintain director and officer liability insurance. 

We
believe that what qualifies each of our directors to serve as such is that each of our directors has a good working relationship with
our shareholders generally, has been engaged in private raises of capital, which we will require, and has a broad background in business,
all of which qualities and attributes could help us in the future. 

Term
of Office 

Directors
hold office until the next annual meeting of our shareholders and until their successors have been duly elected and qualified. Our Bylaws
provide that our Board of Directors will consist of no less than one nor more than nine members, as may be set from time to time by our
shareholders. Our officers are appointed by, and serve at the discretion of, the Board of Directors. 

Director
Independence 

Our
Board of Directors is currently composed of 5 members, neither of whom qualifies as an independent director in accordance with the published
listing requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market. The Nasdaq independence definition includes a series of objective tests, such as that
the director is not, and has not been for at least three years, one of our employees and that neither the director, nor any of his or
her family members has engaged in various types of business dealings with us. 

16 

In
addition, our Board of Directors has not made a subjective determination as to any of our directors that no relationships exist which,
in the opinion of our Board of Directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities
of a director, although such subjective determination is required by Nasdaq requirements. Had our Board of Directors made these determinations,
our Board of Directors would have reviewed and discussed information provided by our directors and us with regard to each director s
business and personal activities and relationships as they may relate to us and our management. 

Involvement
in Certain Legal Proceedings 

During
the past ten years, there have been no events under any bankruptcy act, no criminal proceedings and no judgments, injunctions, orders
or decrees material to the evaluation of the ability and integrity of any director, executive officer, promoter or control person of
the Company, including any allegations (not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated), permanent or temporary injunction, or any other
order of any federal or state authority or self-regulatory organization, relating to activities in any phase of the securities, commodities,
banking, savings and loan, or insurance businesses in connection with the purchase or sale of any security or commodity, or involving
mail or wire fraud in any business. 

Corporate
Governance, Committee Structure and Conflicts of Interest 

We
do not have standing audit, compensation and nominating/corporate governance committees, or committees performing similar functions.
We have not adopted a code of ethics. We anticipate that as we become more familiar with the obligations of U.S. public companies, we
will implement appropriate corporate governance structures to comply with SEC and/or stock exchange requirements. We intend to comply
with all corporate governance requirements applicable to us at this time. 

Since
our Board of Directors does not have standing audit, compensation or nominating/corporate governance committees, or any other committees,
the functions that would have been performed by such committees are performed by our Board of Directors as a whole. We do not currently
have a director who would satisfy the requirements of being an audit committee financial expert. Our Board of Directors has determined
that such committees are not necessary at this time, since the Company is in the early stages of its plan of operations, and there is
no active trading of our Common Stock. It should be noted that since, at most, only one of our directors is independent, there is a risk
of conflicts of interest arising from time to time. During the next fiscal year, our Board of Directors will monitor whether and when
it would be appropriate to diversify the Board of Directors to include independent directors and/or establish Audit, Compensation and/or
Nominating/Corporate Governance Committees. 

Shareholder
Communications with the Board of Directors 

We
have not implemented a formal policy or procedure by which our stockholders can communicate directly with our Board of Directors. Nevertheless,
our directors welcome the views of our shareholders. During the next fiscal year, our Board of Directors will continue to monitor whether
and when it would be appropriate to adopt such a process.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 

Genufood
Energy Enzymes Corporation and subsidiary 

Opinion
on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Genufood Energy Enzymes Corporation
 (the Company as of September 30, 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive
loss, changes in stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for the year then ended and the related notes (collectively referred
to as consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for the year ended September 30, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, as of September 30, 2022, the Company had recurring losses from operations, an accumulated
deficit, and a negative cash flows from operating activities. As such there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going
concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the entity s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due
to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

The
critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements
that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are
material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The
communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole,
and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the
accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Recognition
of Stock-Based Compensation Cost for Stock Options Issued 

As
described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company granted stock options to its Chief Executive Officer and estimated
total stock compensation cost related to the issuance of stock options. The stock compensation cost was valued at the grant date, and
management evaluated the fair value of these stock options at the grant date and recognized based on the vesting schedule. 

We
identified the recognition of stock options as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management when developing
underlying assumptions. 

The
following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We obtained an understanding and evaluated management s
process relating to significant judgments and assumptions developed by management. We evaluated and tested sources of data and assumptions
used by management. In addition, we tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying assumptions used by management.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and 
Stockholders of Genufood Energy Enzymes Corporation and subsidiary 

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Genufood Energy Enzymes Corporation (the Company as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders equity (deficiency), and cash flows for each of the years in the two
year periods ended September 30, 2021, and the related notes (collectively the consolidated financial statements ). In our
opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company
as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its consolidated operations and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year
period ended September 30, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements,
the Company has experienced recurring losses, negative cash flows from operations, has limited capital resources, and recognized a significant
loss for the year. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s
plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and
the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we
engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

F- 3 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below
are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated
to the audit committee or the Board of Directors and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements
and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter
in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below,
providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Investment Impairment Assessment 

As described in Note 4 and Note 12 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company s investment balance was 350,000 at September 30, 2021, after deduction of a significant impairment
to the total original investment cost of 1,400,000 paid for 140,000 shares of the investee s Series C Preferred Stock initiated
in December 2020. Investment is tested for impairment at least annually and the determination of the fair value of the investment requires
management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to the performance of the investee, a private entity. As disclosed by
management, changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value of the reported investment, the amount of any
impairment charge, or both. 

We identified the Company s assessment of
investment impairment as a critical audit matter. Believing that it would not be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders
to register and be regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, the Company sold the entire investment to an individual
subsequently in November 2021 and resulted a significant loss. Management determined that the loss should be recognized as an impairment
to the investment at September 30, 2021. 

Our primary audit procedures to address management s
judgment regarding the impairment and this critical audit matter include: 

Reviewing the investment agreement and understanding
the primary purpose of investment based on inquiries with management and the Board Chairman. 

Considering the Company s internal control
over financial reporting. 

Discussing with the Investee s President/Chief
Executive Officer. 

Consulting with the Company s legal counsel
and evaluating the entire circumstance as well as the options that the Company might have in order to avoid becoming an Investment Company. 

Evaluating the reasonableness of management judgment
and the subsequent events.
