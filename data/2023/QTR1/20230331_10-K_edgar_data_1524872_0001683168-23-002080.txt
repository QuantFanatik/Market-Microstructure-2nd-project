District of Florida against Or-El Ben Simon, individually, Adam Levy (previously the Chief Executive Officer of the Company), individually,
Solange Baruk (previously a bookkeeper of the Company), individually, DVP Distro, LLC, a Florida limited liability company, Custom Graphics
2011, Inc. a Florida corporation, Beso Group, LLC, a Florida limited liability company, and Tops Consulting, LLC a Florida limited liability
company (collectively, the Defendants ). The complaint alleges that the Defendants assumed control of Nature Consulting,
LLC and in doing so: 

(a) 
 Violated the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 U.S.C. ss2511 

(b) 
 Violated the Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. ss2701 

(c) 
 Violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. ss1030 

(d) 
 Committed Conversion in the taking control of Nature Consulting, LLC s premises (Ben Simon, DVP, Custom, Beso and Tops) 

(e) 
 Committed Tortious Interference with Prospective Economic Opportunities 

(f) 
 Committed Breach of Fiduciary Duty of Loyalty (Baruk) 

(g) 
 Committed Civil Conspiracy (Ben Simon, Levy and Baruk) 

(h) 
 Violated the Defend Trade Secrets Act Theft of Trade Secrets, 18 U.S.C. ss1832 

Ben Simon and those in active consort with him
have effectively hijacked Nature s assets under the threat of force and physical violence. Moreover, they have systematically divested
Nature of its assets, moved into its physical location without reason, and have otherwise converted its assets. 

During this time, Defendants also assumed control
of all computers belonging to Nature including its Office365 access and database registered to Nature and using the domains of
 @thpcbd.com, @thehemplug.com, and @natureconsulting.com. 

Additionally, Defendants looted and destroyed
the premises leased by Nature, as follows: 

a. 
 Defendants commandeered all inventory belonging to Nature and refused to distribute to clients; 

b. 
 Defendants commandeered a forklift belonging to Nature; 

c. 
 Defendants have taken possession of all of Nature s furniture, computers, printers, packaging, machineries, office supplies, phone systems, televisions, security cameras and other electronics; 

d. 
 Defendants have discarded in a large trash container Nature s merchandise, customer labels, catalogues, business cards, desks, office decorations and other inventory;

f. 
 Defendants assumed control of all e-mail accounts belonging to Nature and have intercepted Nature s communications sent to the domain @thpcbd.com, @thehemplug.com, and @natureconsulting.com and, 

g. 
 Defendants have terminated Nature s contracts with other vendors to do this, they have used the commandeered @thpcbd.com, @thehemplug.com, and @natureconsulting.com email addresses. 

Furthermore, Defendants conduct has impeded
the fulfillment of orders already paid for by Nature s clients. This has caused Nature s clients to threaten Nature with suit
and to otherwise end their business relationships with Nature due to Nature s failure to satisfy orders. Even if Nature wanted to
operate, due to the unlawful interception of its communications with clients and vendors, it would be impossible. 

Nature Consulting, LLC has demanded a jury trial to adjudicate this
complaint.

the Company recorded an impairment charge of 195,347 during the year ended December 31, 2021 comprised of the following:

Company
Mission 

Our mission
is to protect our investors through a diversified asset base with various asset classes that allow it to stay liquid and self-sufficient.
A diverse balance sheet also helps to head off any unforeseeable market shifts and political changes around the globe, which are critically
important in uncertain times. Our new team of experienced leaders have created an exciting vision that is still in the early stages of
redevelopment and growth, yet one that promises to offer investors an opportunity to take part in an exciting journey right from the start. 

Business Objective 

The principal business objective is to generate
revenue through strategic partnerships and joint ventures that focus on income generation coupled with capital preservation through proactive
portfolio management utilizing a conservative liquidity and investment posture to optimize returns to our shareholders. We achieve this
vision through prudent management of borrowed funds together with our capital and shareholders equity that is invested primarily
in a diversified balance sheet of real estate investments and fixed-income that earns the spread between the yield on our assets and the
cost of our borrowings and hedging activities. The business is financed by an appropriate mix of shareholders equity and the sale
of corporate debt to achieve its primary business objective of an annual return on equity greater than its cost of equity, while maintaining
a sound financial structure. This is achieved by rigorous due diligence to vet assets and investments that have significant upside potential
while minimizing risks through an investment strategy that pursues an absolute return or positive returns to preserve investor
capital and returns to our shareholders. We believe that our business objectives are supported through our long-term conservative financial
vision, the diversity of our investment strategy and comprehensive risk management approach to preserve investor capital for our shareholders. 

Fixed-Income Strategy 

This strategy enables the company to maximize
profitability by taking advantage of different market cycles, while diversifying risk. The company s investment objective is to
generate consistent capital appreciation over the long-term, with relatively low volatility with the pursuit of an absolute return 
or seeking to achieve positive returns, by, for example, taking long and short positions and by engaging in various hedging strategies,
regardless of the performance of the traditional equity and fixed income markets. Additionally, from time to time, the company may use
derivative instruments, such as total return swaps or other structured products and may invest, to a limited extent, in registered investment
companies, including exchange-traded funds. 

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company 

We qualify as an emerging growth company as that
term is used in the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are
otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include: 

A requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related MD 

Exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth company s internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; 

Reduced disclosure about the emerging growth company s executive compensation arrangements; and 

No non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements. 

We have already taken advantage of these reduced
reporting burdens in this Form 10-K, which are also available to us as a smaller reporting company as defined under Rule 12b-2 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). 

6 

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also
provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We are choosing to
utilize the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the JOBS Act.
This election allows our Company to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for
public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements
may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. 

We could remain an emerging growth company for
up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed 1 billion,
(ii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur
if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the last business day of our most recently
completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than 1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding
three year period. 

We are a reporting company and file all reports
required under sections 13 and 15d of the Exchange Act. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

Because we are a Smaller Reporting Company, we
are not required to provide the information required by this item. 

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. 

None. 

Item 2. Properties. 

Our corporate address is PMB 388, 8570 Stirling
Rd., Suite 102, Hollywood, Florida, 33024 

In December 2021, the Company confirmed with the
landlord that as of that time and on a going forward basis, the Company has no rental obligation, or past due rental obligation or any
other related liability on its office/ warehouse space located at 3017 Greene Street, Hollywood, Florida. 

On October 22, 2021, the Company entered into
a lease termination agreement Termination Agreement with Canal Park Office to terminate the Company s North Miami
Beach, Florida office space. The Termination Agreement allows Canal Park Office to retain the security deposit of 24,799 and to be paid
 21,000. The Company was released from any other obligations. 

We believe that our existing facilities are adequate
for our current needs and that we will be able to lease suitable additional or alternative space on commercially reasonable terms if and
when we need it. 

Item 3. Legal Proceedings. 

From time to time, various lawsuits and legal
proceedings may arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and an adverse result
in these, or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. We are currently not aware of any legal proceedings
or claims that it believes will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or operating results except:

a Florida corporation, Beso Group, LLC, a Florida limited liability company, and Tops Consulting, LLC a Florida limited liability company
(collectively, the Defendants ). The complaint alleges that the Defendants assumed control of Nature Consulting, LLC and
in doing so: 

(a) 
 Violated the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 U.S.C. ss2511 

(b) 
 Violated the Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. ss2701 

(c) 
 Violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. ss1030

(e) 
 Committed Tortious Interference with Prospective Economic Opportunities 

(f) 
 Committed Breach of Fiduciary Duty of Loyalty (Baruk) 

(g) 
 Committed Civil Conspiracy (Ben Simon, Levy and Baruk) 

(h) 
 Violated the Defend Trade Secrets Act Theft of Trade Secrets, 18 U.S.C. ss1832 

Ben Simon and those in active consort with him
have effectively hijacked Nature s assets under the threat of force and physical violence. Moreover, they have systematically divested
Nature of its assets, moved into its physical location without reason, and have otherwise converted its assets. 

During this time, Defendants also assumed control
of all computers belonging to Nature including its Office365 access and database registered to Nature and using the domains of
 @thpcbd.com, @thehemplug.com, and @natureconsulting.com. 

8 

Additionally, Defendants looted and destroyed
the premises leased by Nature, as follows: 

a. 
 Defendants commandeered all inventory belonging to Nature and refused to distribute to clients; 

b. 
 Defendants commandeered a forklift belonging to Nature; 

c. 
 Defendants have taken possession of all of Nature s furniture, computers, printers, packaging, machineries, office supplies, phone systems, televisions, security cameras and other electronics;

g.

Furthermore, Defendants conduct have impeded
the fulfillment of orders already paid for by Nature s clients. This has caused Nature s clients to threaten Nature with suit
and to otherwise end their business relationships with Nature due to Nature s failure to satisfy orders. Even if Nature wanted to
operate, due to the unlawful interception of its communications with clients and vendors, it would be impossible. 

Nature Consulting, LLC has demanded a jury
trial to adjudicate this complaint.

hold the shares in street name. The number of both shareholders of record and beneficial shareholders may change on a daily basis and
without the Company s immediate knowledge. 

(c) Dividends 

Holders of common stock are entitled to receive
dividends as may be declared by our board of directors and, in the event of liquidation, to share pro rata in any distribution of assets
after payment of liabilities. The board of directors has sole discretion to determine: (i) whether to declare a dividend; (ii) the dividend
rate, if any, on the shares of any class of series of our capital stock, and if so, from which date or dates; and (iii) the relative rights
of priority of payment of dividends, if any, between the various classes and series of our capital stock. We have not paid any dividends
and do not have any current plans to pay any dividends. 

No established public market for common stock 

Although there have been a few trades of our stock
on the OTC Markets Pink, the quotations have been limited and sporadic and thus, there is presently no established public market for our
common stock. There is no assurance that a trading market will develop, or, if developed, that it will be sustained. A purchaser of our
securities may, therefore, find it difficult to resell our securities should he or she desire to do so.

Company
Mission 

Our mission
is to protect our investors through a diversified asset base with various asset classes that allow it to stay liquid and self-sufficient.
A diverse balance sheet also helps to head off any unforeseeable market shifts and political changes around the globe, which are critically
important in uncertain times. Our new team of experienced leaders have created an exciting vision that is still in the early stages of
redevelopment and growth, yet one that promises to offer investors an opportunity to take part in an exciting journey right from the start. 

Business Objective 

The principal business objective is to generate
revenue through strategic partnerships and joint ventures that focus on income generation coupled with capital preservation through proactive
portfolio management utilizing a conservative liquidity and investment posture to optimize returns to our shareholders. We achieve this
vision through prudent management of borrowed funds together with our capital and shareholders equity that is invested primarily
in a diversified balance sheet of real estate investments and fixed-income that earns the spread between the yield on our assets and the
cost of our borrowings and hedging activities. The business is financed by an appropriate mix of shareholders equity and the sale
of corporate debt to achieve its primary business objective of an annual return on equity greater than its cost of equity, while maintaining
a sound financial structure. This is achieved by rigorous due diligence to vet assets and investments that have significant upside potential
while minimizing risks through an investment strategy that pursues an absolute return or positive returns to preserve investor
capital and returns to our shareholders. We believe that our business objectives are supported through our long-term conservative financial
vision, the diversity of our investment strategy and comprehensive risk management approach to preserve investor capital for our shareholders. 

Fixed-Income Strategy 

This strategy enables the company to maximize
profitability by taking advantage of different market cycles, while diversifying risk. The company s investment objective is to
generate consistent capital appreciation over the long-term, with relatively low volatility with the pursuit of an absolute return 
or seeking to achieve positive returns, by, for example, taking long and short positions and by engaging in various hedging strategies,
regardless of the performance of the traditional equity and fixed income markets. Additionally, from time to time, the company may use
derivative instruments, such as total return swaps or other structured products and may invest, to a limited extent, in registered investment
companies, including exchange-traded funds.

Limited Operating History; Need for Additional
Capital 

There is limited historical financial information
about us on which to base an evaluation of our performance. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our
business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources, and possible
cost overruns due to increases in the cost of services. To become profitable and competitive, we must receive additional capital. We have
no assurance that future financing will materialize. If that financing is not available, we may be unable to continue operations.

General and administrative expenses consist primarily
of personnel costs and professional fees required to support our operations and growth. 

Depending on the extent of our future growth,
we may experience significant strain on our management, personnel, and information systems. We will need to implement and improve operational,
financial, and management information systems. In addition, we are implementing new information systems that will provide better record-keeping,
customer service and billing. However, there can be no assurance that our management resources or information systems will be sufficient
to manage any future growth in our business, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition . 

Results of Operations. 

The results of operations are based on preparation
of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of financial
statements requires management to select accounting policies for critical accounting areas as well as estimates and assumptions that affect
the amounts reported in the financial statements. The Company s accounting policies are more fully described in Note 3 to the Notes
of Financial Statements.

Financing We expect that
our current working capital position, together with our expected future cash flows from operations will be insufficient to fund our operations
in the ordinary course of business, anticipated capital expenditures, debt payment requirements and other contractual obligations for
at least the next twelve months. However, this belief is based upon many assumptions and is subject to numerous risks, and there can be
no assurance that we will not require additional funding in the future. 

We have no present agreements or commitments with
respect to any material acquisitions of other businesses, products, product rights or technologies or any other material capital expenditures.
However, we will continue to evaluate acquisitions of and/or investments in products, technologies, capital equipment or improvements
or companies that complement our business and may make such acquisitions and/or investments in the future. Accordingly, we may need to
obtain additional sources of capital in the future to finance any such acquisitions and/or investments. We may not be able to obtain such
financing on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Due to the ongoing global economic crisis, we believe it may be difficult to obtain
additional financing if needed. Even if we are able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations,
in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in the case of equity financing.

Going Concern 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets
and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had an accumulated deficit of 7,486,937 and 2,020,464
at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, had a working capital deficit of 6,630,894 and 2,583,421 at December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively, had net losses of 5,466,473 and 1,372,550 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, with limited revenue earned
since inception, no current revenue generating operations, and a lack of operational history. These matters raise substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

The Company s financial statements are prepared
using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization
of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues
sufficient to cover its operating cost and allow it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going
concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is
unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations. 

In order to continue as a going concern, the Company
will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management s plan to obtain such resources for the Company include,
obtaining capital from management and significant stockholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses. However, management
cannot provide any assurance that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. 

There is no assurance that the Company will be
able to obtain sufficient additional funds when needed or that such funds, if available, will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to the
Company. In addition, profitability will ultimately depend upon the level of revenues received from business operations. However, there
is no assurance that the Company will attain profitability. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

The consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.

We incur contractual
obligations and financial commitments in the normal course of our operations and financing activities. Contractual obligations include

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-l5(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information that would be required to be disclosed
in Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and
forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including to our Chairman and Principal Accounting
Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Our management, under the supervision and with
the participation of our Chairman and Principal Accounting Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
as defined in SEC Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, management
identified deficiencies that were determined to be a material weakness. 

37 

Management s Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

The Company s management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-l5(f) of the Securities Exchange
Act). Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.
In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO (2013). Based on that assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company s internal
control over financial reporting was ineffective based on the COSO criteria, due to the following material weaknesses listed below. 

The specific material weaknesses identified by
the company s management as of end of the period covered by this report include the following: 

we have not performed a risk assessment and mapped our processes to control objectives; 

we have not implemented comprehensive entity-level internal controls; 

we have not implemented adequate system and manual controls. As such, there was inadequate cross functional review of the debt agreements; and 

we do not have sufficient segregation of duties. As such, the officers approve their own related business expense reimbursements. 

At this time, we do not have a quailed financial expert on our board because we have not been able to hire a qualified candidate. 

Despite the material weaknesses reported above,
our management believes that our consolidated financial statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects our
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented and that this report does not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report. 

This report does not include an attestation report
of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject
to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Commission that permit us to provide only management s
report in this report. 

Management's Remediation Plan 

The weaknesses and their related risks are not
uncommon in a company of our size because of the limitations in the size and number of staff. Due to our size and nature, segregation
of all conflicting duties has not always been possible and may not be economically feasible. 

However,
we plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal control over financial reporting. During the period
covered by this annual report on Form 10-K, we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate
such weaknesses, we plan to implement the following changes in the current fiscal year as resources allow: 

(i) 
 appoint additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and implement modifications to our financial controls to address such inadequacies. 

(ii) 
 appoint a quailed financial expert to our board to address inadequate segregation of duties and financial controls. 

38 

The remediation efforts set out herein will be
implemented in the current 2023 fiscal year. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can
provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include
the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. 

Management believes that despite our material
weaknesses set forth above, our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 are fairly stated, in all material
respects, in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART III 

Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and
Corporate Governance. 

Directors and Executive Officers. 

The names and ages of our directors and executive
officers as of December 31, 2022 are set forth below. Our Bylaws provide for not less than one and not more than seven directors. All
directors are elected annually by the stockholders to serve until the next annual meeting of the stockholders and until their successors
are duly elected and qualified. 

Name 
 
 Age 
 
 Position 
 
 Mr. Ricardo Haynes (1) 
 
 57 
 
 Chairman, Principal Accounting Officer 
 
 __________ 

 (1) Mr. Haynes was appointed Chairman and CEO
on March 1, 2022. Mr. Haynes will serve as a director until the next annual shareholder meeting. 

Mr. Ricardo Haynes, sole Director, CEO
and Chairman of the Board, and the acting sole officer of the Company 

Mr. Haynes is 55 years old. He is a highly
accomplished business development executive with more than 20 years of experience in producing exponential revenue growth, cultivating
enduring relationships within the hospitality and financial industry. Worked for Marriot Corporation for over 15 years in property development,
licensing and investment. Also operated in the financial industry providing corporate bond placement and project financing. Total experience
includes commercial real estate sales and loan origination with regional and nationally based lending institutions, corporate finance
consulting. Grass roots development experience in creating and issuing collateralized bond obligation and related instruments. Over the
last 5 years Mr. Haynes has worked assisting clients in construction financing in both commercial and hospitality markets with Candela
Group, Ltd. In Alberta, Canada. 

Mr. Haynes s qualifications to serve on
our board of directors include his experience in commercial real estate development and financing. 

Director Independence 

We do not have any independent directors. Because
our common stock is not currently listed on a national securities exchange, we have used the definition of independence 
of The NASDAQ Stock Market to make this determination. NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605(a)(2) provides that an independent director 
is a person other than an officer or employee of the company or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion of the
company s board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of
a director. The NASDAQ listing rules provide that a director cannot be considered independent if: 

the director is, or at any time during the past three years was, an employee of the company; 

the director or a family member of the director accepted any compensation from the company in excess of 120,000 during any period of 12 consecutive months within the three years preceding the independence determination (subject to certain exclusions, including, among other things, compensation for board or board committee service); 

a family member of the director is, or at any time during the past three years was, an executive officer of the company; 

the director or a family member of the director is a partner in, controlling stockholder of, or an executive officer of an entity to which the company made, or from which the company received, payments in the current or any of the past three fiscal years that exceed 5 of the recipient s consolidated gross revenue for that year or 200,000, whichever is greater (subject to certain exclusions); 

the director or a family member of the director is employed as an executive officer of an entity where, at any time during the past three years, any of the executive officers of the company served on the compensation committee of such other entity; or 

the director or a family member of the director is a current partner of the Company s outside auditor, or at any time during the past three years was a partner or employee of the Company s outside auditor, and who worked on the company s audit. 

40 

Committees of the Board 

Our Company currently does not have nominating,
compensation, or audit committees or committees performing similar functions nor does our Company have a written nominating, compensation
or audit committee charter. Our directors believe that it is not necessary to have such committees, at this time, because the directors
can adequately perform the functions of such committees. 

In lieu of an audit committee, the Company s
board of directors is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations concerning the selection of outside auditors, reviewing the
scope, results and effectiveness of the annual audit of the Company s consolidated financial statements and other services provided
by the Company s independent public accountants. The board of directors and the Chief Executive Officer of the Company review the
Company s internal accounting controls, practices and policies. 

Audit Committee Financial Expert 

Our board of directors has determined that we
do not have a board member that qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(D)(5) of Regulation
S-K, nor do we have a board member that qualifies as independent as the term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv)(B) of Schedule
14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and as defined by Rule 4200(a)(14) of the FINRA Rules. 

We believe that our directors are capable of analyzing
and evaluating our consolidated financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. The directors
of our Company do not believe that it is necessary to have an audit committee because management believes that the board of directors
can adequately perform the functions of an audit committee. In addition, we believe that retaining an independent director who would qualify
as an audit committee financial expert would be overly costly and burdensome and is not warranted in our circumstances given
the stage of our development and the fact that we have not generated any positive cash flows from operations to date. 

Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings . 

From time to time, various lawsuits and legal
proceedings may arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and an adverse result
in these, or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. We are currently not aware of any legal proceedings
or claims that it believes will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or operating results except: 

First Capital Venture 

On November 3, 2020, First Capital Venture Co.,
a subsidiary of the client, d/b/a Diamond CBD, filed a civil complaint against Thunder Energies Corporation (the Defendants ),

they proceeded on February 9, 2021 to publish false and misleading press releases. 

On November 23, 2022 Settlement Date ),
Mr. Shvo settled with First Capital Venture on behalf of the Defendants for 11,500 to be paid within ten (10) days from the Settlement

Filing
of Complaint Against Certain Former Officers and Other Parties 

On October 14, 2021 Nature
Consulting, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary, filed a complaint in the United States District Court of the Southern District of Florida
against Or-El Ben Simon, individually, Adam Levy (previously the Chief Executive Officer of the Company), individually, Solange Baruk
(previously a bookkeeper of the Company), individually, DVP Distro, LLC, a Florida limited liability company, Custom Graphics 2011, Inc.
a Florida corporation, Beso Group, LLC, a Florida limited liability company, and Tops Consulting, LLC a Florida limited liability company
(collectively, the Defendants ). The complaint alleges that the Defendants assumed control of Nature Consulting, LLC and
in doing so: 

(a) 
 Violated the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 U.S.C. ss2511 

(b) 
 Violated the Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. ss2701 

(c) 
 Violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. ss1030 

(d) 
 Committed Conversion in the taking control of Nature Consulting, LLC s premises (Ben Simon, DVP, Custom, Beso and Tops) 

(e) 
 Committed Tortious Interference with Prospective Economic Opportunities 

(f) 
 Committed Breach of Fiduciary Duty of Loyalty (Baruk) 

(g) 
 Committed Civil Conspiracy (Ben Simon, Levy and Baruk) 

(h) 
 Violated the Defend Trade Secrets Act Theft of Trade Secrets, 18 U.S.C. ss1832 

Ben Simon and those in active consort with him
have effectively hijacked Nature s assets under the threat of force and physical violence. Moreover, they have systematically divested
Nature of its assets, moved into its physical location without reason, and have otherwise converted its assets. 

During this time, Defendants also assumed control
of all computers belonging to Nature including its Office365 access and database registered to Nature and using the domains of
 @thpcbd.com, @thehemplug.com, and @natureconsulting.com. 

Additionally, Defendants looted and destroyed
the premises leased by Nature, as follows: 

a. 
 Defendants commandeered all inventory belonging to Nature and refused to distribute to clients; 

b. 
 Defendants commandeered a forklift belonging to Nature; 

c. 
 Defendants have taken possession of all of Nature s furniture, computers, printers, packaging, machineries, office supplies, phone systems, televisions, security cameras and other electronics; 

d. 
 Defendants have discarded in a large trash container Nature s merchandise, customer labels, catalogues, business cards, desks, office decorations and other inventory; 

e. 
 Defendants destroyed Nature s property by stripping its headquarters of all aesthetic enhancements and signage; 

f. 
 Defendants assumed control of all e-mail accounts belonging to Nature and have intercepted Nature s communications sent to the domain @thpcbd.com, @thehemplug.com, and @natureconsulting.com and, 

g. 
 Defendants have terminated Nature s contracts with other vendors to do this, they have used the commandeered @thpcbd.com, @thehemplug.com, and @natureconsulting.com email addresses. 

42 

Furthermore, Defendants conduct have impeded
the fulfillment of orders already paid for by Nature s clients. This has caused Nature s clients to threaten Nature with suit
and to otherwise end their business relationships with Nature due to Nature s failure to satisfy orders. Even if Nature wanted to
operate, due to the unlawful interception of its communications with clients and vendors, it would be impossible. 

Nature Consulting, LLC has demanded a jury
trial to adjudicate this complaint. 

As a result of the actions of the Defendants,
the Company recorded a net impairment charge of 195,347 during the year ended December 31, 2021 comprised of the following:

Conflicts of Interest 

Certain potential conflicts of interest are inherent in the relationships
between our officers and directors and us. 

From time to time, one or more of our affiliates
may form or hold an ownership interest in and/or manage other businesses both related and unrelated to the type of business that we own
and operate. These persons expect to continue to form, hold an ownership interest in and/or manage additional other businesses which may
compete with our business with respect to operations, including financing and marketing, management time and services and potential customers.
These activities may give rise to conflicts between or among the interests of us and other businesses with which our affiliates are associated.
Our affiliates are in no way prohibited from undertaking such activities, and neither we nor our shareholders will have any right to require
participation in such other activities. 

44 

We may transact business with some of our officers,
directors and affiliates, as well as with firms in which some of our officers, directors or affiliates have a material interest, potential
conflicts may arise between the respective interests of us and these related persons or entities. We believe that such transactions will
be effected on terms at least as favorable to us as those available from unrelated third parties. As of this filing, we have not transacted
business with any officer, director, or affiliate. 

With respect to transactions involving real or
apparent conflicts of interest, we have adopted policies and procedures which require that: (i) the fact of the relationship or interest
giving rise to the potential conflict be disclosed or known to the directors who authorize or approve the transaction prior to such authorization
or approval, (ii) the transaction be approved by a majority of our disinterested outside directors, and (iii) the transaction be fair
and reasonable to us at the time it is authorized or approved by our directors. 

Our policies and procedures regarding transactions
involving potential conflicts of interest are not in writing. We understand that it will be difficult to enforce our policies and procedures
and will rely on and trust our officers and directors to follow our policies and procedures. We will implement our policies and procedures
by requiring the officer or director who is not in compliance with our policies and procedures to remove himself and the other officers
and directors will decide how to implement the policies and procedures, accordingly. 

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting
Compliance 

Our shares of common stock are registered under
the Exchange Act, and therefore our officers, directors and holders of more than 10 of our outstanding shares are subject to the provisions
of Section 16(a) which requires them to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of common stock
and our other equity securities. Officers, directors and greater than 10 beneficial owners are required by SEC regulations to furnish
us with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file. Based solely upon our review of reports submitted to us during the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2022, the following table sets forth the name of any such person that failed to file the required forms on a timely
basis, including the number of late reports, the number of transactions not reported on a timely basis and any known failure to file a
required form.

Code of Ethics 

We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and
Ethics that applies to all of our employees, officers and directors. In addition to the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, our principal
executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer are also subject to written policies and standards that
are reasonably designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote: honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent
conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships; full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports
and documents that are filed with, or submitted to the SEC and in other public communications made by us; compliance with applicable government
laws, rules and regulations; the prompt internal reporting of violations of the code to an appropriate person or persons identified in
the code; and accountability for adherence to the code. We have posted the text of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics on our Internet
website, www.slpc1.com. We intend to disclose future amendments to, or waivers from, certain provisions of our Code of Business Conduct
and Ethics, if any, on our above Internet website within four business days following the date of such amendment or waiver. 

Legal Proceedings. 

To the best of our knowledge, except as set forth
herein, none of the directors or director designees to our knowledge has been convicted in a criminal proceeding, excluding traffic violations
or similar misdemeanors, or has been a party to any judicial or administrative proceeding during the past five years that resulted in
a judgment decree or final order enjoining the person from future violations of, or prohibiting activities subject to, federal or state
securities laws, or finding of any violation of federal or state securities laws, except for matters that were dismissed without sanction
or settlement. 

45 

Meetings and Committees of the Board of
Directors. 

We do not have a nominating committee of the Board
of Directors, or any committee performing similar functions. Nominees for election as a director are selected by the Board of Directors. 

We do not yet have an audit committee or an audit
committee financial expert. We expect to form such a committee composed of non-employee directors when such individuals are added to the
board of directors. We may in the future attempt to add a qualified board member to serve as an audit committee financial expert in the
future, subject to our ability to locate and compensate such a person. Despite the lack of an audit committee, those members of the board
of directors that would otherwise be on our audit committee will continue to analyze and investigate our actual and potential businesses
prospects as members of our board of directors. Furthermore, our entire board of directors is aware of the importance of the financial
and accounting due diligence that must be undertaken in furtherance of our business and they intend to conduct a comprehensive accounting
financial analysis of the Company s business.

Policies and Procedures for Related Party Transactions 

Given our small size and limited financial resources,
we have not adopted formal policies and procedures for the review, approval or ratification of transactions with our executive officer(s),
director(s) and significant shareholders. We rely on our board to review related party transactions on an ongoing basis to prevent conflicts
of interest. Our board reviews a transaction in light of the affiliations of the director, officer or employee and the affiliations of
such person s immediate family. Transactions are presented to our board for approval before they are entered into or, if this is
not possible, for ratification after the transaction has occurred. If our board finds that a conflict of interest exists, then it will
determine the appropriate remedial action, if any. Our board approves or ratifies a transaction if it determines that the transaction
is consistent with the best interests of the Company. We intend to establish formal policies and procedures in the future, once we have
sufficient resources and have appointed additional directors, so that such transactions will be subject to the review, approval or ratification
of our board of directors, or an appropriate committee thereof. 

Director Independence. 

We have not: 

Established our own definition for determining whether our director or nominees for directors are independent nor has it adopted any other standard of independence employed by any national securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system, though our current directors would not be deemed to be independent under any applicable definition given that he is an officer of the Company; nor, 

Established any committees of the Board of Directors. 

Given the nature of our Company, its limited shareholder
base and the current composition of management, the Board of Directors does not believe that we require any corporate governance committees
at this time. The Board of Directors takes the position that management of a target business will establish: 

Its own Board of Directors 

Establish its own definition of independent as related to directors and nominees for directors 

Establish committees that will be suitable for its operations after the Company consummates a business combination

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Thunder Energies Corporation 

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Thunder Energies Corporation and its subsidiary (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit, and cash flows for each of the years in the two
period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company
as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended
December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements,
the Company s significant operating losses and discontinued operations raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as
a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and
the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we
engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

Critical audit matters are matters arising from
the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and
that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,
subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

Filing of Complaint Against Certain Former
Officers and Other Parties 

On October 14, 2021 Nature Consulting, LLC, a
wholly owned subsidiary, filed a complaint in the United States District Court of the Southern District of Florida against Or-El Ben Simon,
individually, Adam Levy (previously the Chief Executive Officer of the Company), individually, Solange Baruk (previously a bookkeeper
of the Company), individually, DVP Distro, LLC, a Florida limited liability company, Custom Graphics 2011, Inc. a Florida corporation,
Beso Group, LLC, a Florida limited liability company, and Tops Consulting, LLC a Florida limited liability company (collectively, the
 Defendants ). The complaint alleges that the Defendants assumed control of Nature Consulting, LLC and in doing so: 

(a) 
 Violated the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 U.S.C. ss2511 

(b) 
 Violated the Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. ss2701 

(c) 
 Violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. ss1030 

(d) 
 Committed Conversion in the taking control of Nature Consulting, LLC s premises (Ben Simon, DVP, Custom, Beso and Tops)

 Committed Breach of Fiduciary Duty of Loyalty (Baruk) 

(g) 
 Committed Civil Conspiracy (Ben Simon, Levy and Baruk) 

(h) 
 Violated the Defend Trade Secrets Act Theft of Trade Secrets, 18 U.S.C. ss1832 

Ben Simon and those in active consort with him
have effectively hijacked Nature s assets under the threat of force and physical violence. Moreover, they have systematically divested
Nature of its assets, moved into its physical location without reason, and have otherwise converted its assets. 

During this time, Defendants also assumed control
of all computers belonging to Nature including its Office365 access and database registered to Nature and using the domains of
 @thpcbd.com, @thehemplug.com, and @natureconsulting.com. 

Additionally, Defendants looted and destroyed
the premises leased by Nature, as follows: 

a. 
 Defendants commandeered all inventory belonging to Nature and refused to distribute to clients; 

b. 
 Defendants commandeered a forklift belonging to Nature; 

c. 
 Defendants have taken possession of all of Nature s furniture, computers, printers, packaging, machineries, office supplies, phone systems, televisions, security cameras and other electronics; 

d. 
 Defendants have discarded in a large trash container Nature s merchandise, customer labels, catalogues, business cards, desks, office decorations and other inventory; 

e. 
 Defendants destroyed Nature s property by stripping its headquarters of all aesthetic enhancements and signage; 

f. 
 Defendants assumed control of all e-mail accounts belonging to Nature and have intercepted Nature s communications sent to the domain @thpcbd.com, @thehemplug.com, and @natureconsulting.com and, 

g. 
 Defendants have terminated Nature s contracts with other vendors to do this, they have used the commandeered @thpcbd.com, @thehemplug.com, and @natureconsulting.com email addresses. 

Furthermore, Defendants conduct have impeded
the fulfillment of orders already paid for by Nature s clients. This has caused Nature s clients to threaten Nature with suit
and to otherwise end their business relationships with Nature due to Nature s failure to satisfy orders. Even if Nature wanted to
operate, due to the unlawful interception of its communications with clients and vendors, it would be impossible. 

Nature Consulting, LLC has demanded a jury trial to adjudicate this
complaint. 

As a result of the actions of the Defendants,
the Company recorded an impairment charge of 195,347 during the year ended December 31, 2021 comprised of the following:

Total impairment charges 

____________________ 

 (1) The Company has included due to
related party of 169,744 within the impairment charge above as these amounts have been used to settle for the assets, as impaired, which
have been commandeered, discarded, destroyed and taken possession of by the defendant. This amount related to the working capital loan
taken from the defendants. 

(2) On October 22, 2021 the Company
entered into a lease termination agreement Termination Agreement with Canal Park Office to terminate the Company s
North Miami Beach, Florida office space. The Termination Agreement allows Canal Park Office to retain the security deposit of 24,799
and to be paid 21,000. The Company was released from any other obligations. 

(3) In December 2021, the Company confirmed
with the landlord that as of that time and on a going forward basis, the Company has no rental obligation, or past due rental obligation
or any other related liability on its office/ warehouse space located at 3017 Greene Street, Hollywood, Florida. 

On February 28, 2022, as part of acquisition of
TNRG Preferred Stock with Bear Village, other than liabilities specifically identified in the acquisition, no debt or liability is assumed
by the Purchaser. 

and 
at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, had a working capital deficit of and at December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively, had net losses of and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, with limited revenue
earned since inception, no current revenue generating operations, and a lack of operational history. These matters raise substantial doubt
about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

The Company s consolidated financial
statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern
which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not
yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating cost and allow it to continue as a going concern.
The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating
losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations. 

In order to continue as a going concern, the Company
will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management s plan to obtain such resources for the Company include,
obtaining capital from management and significant stockholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses. However, management
cannot provide any assurance that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. 

There is no assurance that the Company will be
able to obtain sufficient additional funds when needed or that such funds, if available, will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to the
Company. In addition, profitability will ultimately depend upon the level of revenues received from business operations. However, there
is no assurance that the Company will attain profitability. 

The consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

and (included in discontinued operations) as of December
31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

and 
(included in discontinued operations) for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

and 
(from discontinued operations), respectively. Customer advanced payments were included in current liabilities in the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company s ability to fulfill these orders have been impaired (see Note 1). 

and (from discontinued operations)
as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. See Note 1 for impairment discussion as of December 31, 2021. 

The derivatives are evaluated under the hierarchy
of ASC 480-10, ASC Paragraph 815-25-1 and ASC Subparagraph 815-10-15-74 addressing embedded derivatives. The fair value of the Level 3
financial instruments was performed internally by the Company using the Black Scholes valuation method.

fair value measurements by level at December 31, 2022 for the assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

 Derivative liability 

Convertible debt beneficial conversion
feature If the conversion feature is not treated as a derivative, we assess whether it is a beneficial conversion feature BCF ). A BCF exists if the conversion price of the convertible debt instrument is less than the stock price on the commitment
date. The value of a BCF is equal to the intrinsic value of the feature, the difference between the conversion price and the common stock
into which it is convertible and is recorded as additional paid in capital and as a debt discount in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The
Company amortizes the balance over the life of the underlying debt as amortization of debt discount expense in the statement of operations.
If the debt is retired early, the associated debt discount is then recognized immediately as amortization of debt discount expense in
the Consolidated Statement of Operations. 

If the conversion feature does not qualify for
either the derivative treatment or as a BCF, the convertible debt is treated as traditional debt.

The Company borrows funds from related parties
for working capital purposes from time to time. There are no outstanding amounts as of December 31, 2022. Advances are non-interest

Pursuant to that certain
Loan Authorization and Agreement (the SBA Loan Agreement ), the Company borrowed an aggregate principal amount of the EIDL

events of default and (ii) a Security Agreement, granting the SBA a security interest in all tangible and intangible personal property
of the Company, which also contains customary events of default (the SBA Security Agreement ). As a result of the failure
to repay amounts based on the repayment schedule, on December 21, 2021, the Company was notified that it was in default of the EIDL Loan

prior to the conversion date, representing a discount rate of thirty-five percent (35 ). 

On March
24, 2020, the note obligation of held by Emry was partially sold 35,000 of the face amount to the preferred shareholder Saveene.
On March 24, 2020, Saveene converted the 35,000 purchase into 5,000 shares into series B and 10,000 shares of series C shares. The face
amount of the Company note obligation post the aforementioned conversions and purchases is as of December 31, 2022. 

The Company accounts for an embedded conversion
feature as a derivative under ASC 815-10-15-83 and valued separately from the note at fair value. The embedded conversion feature of the
note is revalued at each subsequent reporting date at fair value and any changes in fair value will result in a gain or loss in those

derivative liability of and during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

As a result of the failure to timely file our
Form 10-Q for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2020, March 31, 2022 and 2021, June 30, 2022, and September 30, 2022, and the
Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Convertible Notes Payable were in default. The Company recorded default
interest of and during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively . 

The Company has not repaid this convertible note
and the convertible note is now in default. The Company is currently in discussions with the note holder to convert the GHS Note into
the Company s common stock upon the Company s Reg A being declared effective. 

220,000 Note 

On September 21, 2020, the Company issued a convertible
promissory note in the principal amount of . The convertible promissory note bears interest at per annum and is due and payable
in twenty-four (24) months. The holder of this note has the right, at the holder's option, upon the consummation of a sale of all or substantially
all of the equity interest in the Company or private placement transaction of the Company's equity securities or securities convertible
into equity securities, exclusive of the conversion of this note or any similar notes, to convert the principal amount of this note, in
whole or in part, plus any interest which accrues hereon, into fully paid and nonassessable shares at a conversion price of per
share. The Note includes customary events of default, including, among other things, payment defaults, covenant breaches, certain representations
and warranties, certain events of bankruptcy, liquidation and suspension of the Company s Common Stock from trading. If such
an event of default occurs, the holders of the Note may be entitled to take various actions, which may include the acceleration of amounts
due under the Note and accrual of interest as described above. 

The Company analyzed the conversion option in
the notes for derivative accounting treatment under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and determined that the instrument
does not qualify for derivative accounting. The Company therefore performed an analysis to determine if the conversion option was subject
to a beneficial conversion feature BCF and determined that the instrument does have a BCF. A BCF exists if the conversion
price of the convertible debt instrument is less than the stock price on the commitment date. This typically occurs when the conversion
price is less than the fair value of the stock on the date the instrument was issued. The value of a BCF is equal to the intrinsic value
of the feature, the difference between the conversion price and the common stock into which it is convertible, and is recorded as additional
paid in capital and as a debt discount in the Balance Sheet. As such, the proceeds of the notes were allocated, based on fair values,
as to the debt discount. The debt discount is accreted over the term of the convertible notes to interest expense in the accompanying consolidated Statements of Operations. The principal balance due at December 31, 2022 is and is presented as a short-term
liability in the balance sheet. 

As a result of the failure to timely file our
Form 10-Q for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2020, March 31, 2022 and 2021, June 30, 2022, and September 30, 2022, and the
Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Convertible Notes Payable were in default. On July 19, 2021, the Company
entered into a Waiver Agreement (the Agreement waiving the default provisions listed in the Notes related to the Company s
failure to timely file its Form 10-Q for the three-month period ended September 30, 2020, the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2020, and the three-month period ended March 31, 2021. In exchange for the Agreement, the Company agreed to pay a one-time interest charge
of in the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company recorded default interest of and during the years ended December
31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

The Company has not repaid this convertible note
and the convertible note is now in default. The Company is currently in discussions with the note holder to convert the Note into the
Company s common stock upon the Company s Reg A being declared effective.

paid in capital and as a debt discount in the Balance Sheet. As such, the proceeds of the notes were allocated, based on fair values,

Operating lease right-of-use ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. ROU assets
represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments
arising from the lease. Generally, the implicit rate of interest in arrangements is not readily determinable and the Company utilizes
its incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company s incremental borrowing rate is a
hypothetical rate based on its understanding of what its credit rating would be. The operating lease ROU asset includes any lease payments
made and excludes lease incentives. Our variable lease payments primarily consist of maintenance and other operating expenses from our
real estate leases. Variable lease payments are excluded from the ROU assets and lease liabilities and are recognized in the period in
which the obligation for those payments is incurred. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably
certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease
term. 

We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease
components. We have elected to account for these lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. We are also electing not
to apply the recognition requirements to short-term leases of twelve months or less and instead will recognize lease payments as expense
on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
