 Management of Wilmington Trust National Association (the Company) is responsible for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)(2)(ii), 1122(d)(2)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(v), 1122(d)(3)(i), 1122(d)(3)(ii), 1122(d)(3)(iii) and 1122(d)(3)(iv) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the servicing of auto related asset-backed transactions initiated or amended for purposes of Regulation AB on or after January 1, 2006, for which the Company provides trustee services (the Platform) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. Management has determined that all other criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are not applicable to the servicing activities performed by the Company with respect to the Platform. Appendix A to this report identifies the auto related asset-backed transactions defined by management as constituting the Platform. 
 
 The Company s management has assessed the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in criterion (d)(2)(ii), (d)(2)(iv), (d)(2)(v), (d)(3)(i), (d)(3)(ii), (d)(3)(iii) and (d)(3)(iv) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. The activities the Company performs with respect to the applicable 1122(d) servicing criteria are listed on the attached Appendix A. 
 
 With respect to the Company s obligation to issue a notification to be included in the client s Form 8-K. Form 10-D and Form 10-K under applicable servicing criterion 1122(d)(3)(i), there were no activities performed during the year ended December 31, 2022, with respect to the Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities. 
 
 Based on such assessment, management believes that, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company has complied in all material respects with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)(2)(ii), 1122(d)(2)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(v), 1122(d)(3)(i), 1122(d)(3)(ii), 1122(d)(3)(iii) and 1122(d)(3)(iv) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the servicing of the Platform.

Exhibit 34.1 
 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 Capital One, National Association 
 
 We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Report on Assessment of Compliance with Servicing Criteria, that Capital One, National Association (the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the asset-backed securities transactions involving motor vehicle receivables portfolios where the related asset backed securities of Capital One Prime Auto Receivables Trusts - COPAR 2019-1, COPAR 2019-2, COPAR 2020-1, and COPAR 2021-1 were outstanding during the period covered by this report as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, for COPAR 2022-1, was outstanding for the period from May 04, 2022 to December 31, 2022 and for COPAR 2022-2, was outstanding for the period from August 10, 2022 to December 31, 2022 which the Company acted as Servicer (the Platform and except for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(ii), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(v), 1122(d)(2)(vi), 1122(d)(3)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii), and 1122(d)(4)(xiii), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities performed by them with respect to the servicing Platform covered by this report. Refer to Appendix A of management s Report on Assessment of Compliance with Servicing Criteria for the asset backed securities covered by the Platform. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 
 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than all of the individual asset backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities related to the Platform and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria and as permitted by Regulation AB Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations of the Division of Corporation Finance, Section 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C&DI 200.06 ). Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. Although the Company is responsible for assessing compliance with servicing criteria (d)(4)(iii) and (d)(4)(xv) of Regulation AB, there were no servicing activities performed by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2022, that required these servicing criteria to be complied with. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 We are required to be independent of Capital One, National Association and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements related to our examination engagement. 
 
 Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 
 
 As described in management s assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(i), 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(ii), and 1122(d)(4)(iv) as applicable, the Company has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria. The Company has determined that these vendors are not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by C&DI 200.06. As permitted by C&DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C&DI 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s eligibility to apply C&DI 200.06. 
 
 In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB, including servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(i), 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(ii), and 1122(d)(4)(iv) for which compliance is determined based on C&DI 200.06 as described above, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 for the COPAR 2019-1, COPAR 2019-2, COPAR 2020-1 and COPAR 2021-1 trusts, for the period from May 04, 2022 to December 31, 2022 for the COPAR 2022-1 trust and, for the period from August 10, 2022 to December 31, 2022 for the COPAR 2022-2 trust is fairly stated, in all material respects.

 To the Management of Wilmington Trust National Association 
 
 We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management Assessment Report, that Wilmington Trust National Association (the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for Items 1122(d) (2)(ii), 1122(d)(2)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(v), 1122(d)(3)(i), 1122(d)(3)(ii), 1122(d)(3)(iii), and 1122(d)(3)(iv) of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation AB for the servicing of auto related asset-backed transactions initiated or amended for purposes of Regulation AB on or after January 1, 2006, for which the Company also provides trustee services (the Platform ), as of December 31, 2022 and for the year then ended. Appendix A to Management s Assessment Report identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities and applicable criteria defined by management as constituting the Platform. Wilmington Trust National Association s management is responsible for its assertion and for the Company's compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assertion about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria based on our examination. 
 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about compliance with the applicable servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all material respects, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides, and that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide, a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 
 
 We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements related to the engagement. 
 
 In our opinion, management s assertion that Wilmington Trust National Association complied with the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 for the Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.
