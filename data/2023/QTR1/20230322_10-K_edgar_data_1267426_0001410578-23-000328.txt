 PART I Item 1. Business Organization BCTC V Assignor Corp., a Delaware corporation, is the assignor limited partner (the Assignor Limited Partner of BF Garden Tax Credit Fund V L.P. (formerly known as Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund V L.P.), a Delaware limited partnership (the "Fund") and does not engage in any other business. Units of beneficial interest in the limited partnership interest of the Assignor Limited Partner have been assigned by the Assignor Limited Partner by means of beneficial assignee certificates BACs to investors and investors are entitled to all the rights and economic benefits of a limited partner of the Fund, including rights to a percentage of the income, gains, losses, deductions, credits and distributions of the Fund. Effective as of December 15, 2020, BF Garden Companion Limited Partnership, a Massachusetts limited partnership formerly known as Boston Capital Companion Limited Partnership Companion replaced John P. Manning as the sole owner of the Assignor Limited Partner. Also effective as of December 15, 2020, BFBC Holdings GP, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and an affiliate of Boston Financial Investment Management, LP, a Delaware limited partnership BFIM ),replaced Boston Capital Partners II Corporation as the general partner of Companion, and BFIM replaced Boston Capital Companion Holdings Limited Partnership as the sole limited partner of Companion. A Registration Statement on Form S-11 and the related prospectus, (the "Prospectus") were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and became effective January 2, 2004 in connection with a public offering ("Offering") in one or more series of a minimum of 250,000 BACs and a maximum of 7,000,000 BACs at 10 per BAC. On August 10, 2004 an amendment to Form S-11, which registered an additional 8,500,000 BACs for sale to the public in one or more series became effective. As of December 31, 2022, subscriptions had been received and accepted by the Fund for 11,777,706 BACs representing capital contributions of 117,777,060. Description of Business The Assignor Limited Partner s sole purpose is to act as a conduit through which all of the economic and tax benefits of an investment in the Fund are passed along to the investor BAC holders. The Assignor Limited Partner does not charge any fees for its services and has no income. The Fund's principal business is to invest as a limited partner in other limited partnerships (the "Operating Partnerships") each of which will own or lease and will operate an apartment complex exclusively or partially for low- and moderate-income tenants. Each Operating Partnership in which the Fund will invest will own apartment complexes which are completed, newly-constructed, under construction or rehabilitation, or to-be constructed or rehabilitated, and which are expected to receive government assistance. Each apartment complex is expected to qualify for the low-income housing tax credit under Section 42 of the Code (the "Federal Housing Tax Credit"), providing tax benefits over a period of ten to twelve years in the form of tax credits which investors may use to offset income, subject to strict limitations, from other sources. Some apartment complexes may also qualify for the historic rehabilitation tax credit under Section 47 of the Code (the "Rehabilitation Tax Credit"). Section 236 (f) (ii) of the National Housing Act, as amended, and Section 101 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965, as amended, each provide for the making by The Department of Housing and Urban Development HUD of rent supplement payments to low income tenants in properties which receive other forms of federal assistance such as tax credits. The payments for each tenant, which are made directly to the owner of their property, generally are in such amounts as to enable the tenant to pay rent equal to 30 of the adjusted family income. Some of the apartment complexes in which the Fund has invested are receiving rent supplements from HUD. HUD has been in the process of converting rent supplement assistance to assistance paid not to the owner of the apartment complex, but directly to the individuals. At this time, the Fund is unable to predict whether Congress will continue rent supplement programs payable directly to owners of the apartment complex. As of December 31, 2022, the Fund had invested in 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 47, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 48, and 3 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 49. 

Table of Contents 
 The business objectives of the Fund are to: (1) provide current tax benefits to investors in the form of Federal Housing Tax Credits and in, limited instances, a small amount of Rehabilitation Tax Credits, which an investor may apply, subject to strict limitations, against the investor's federal income tax liability from active, portfolio and passive income; (2) preserve and protect the Fund's capital and provide capital appreciation and cash distributions through increases in value of the Fund's investments and, to the extent applicable, equity buildup through periodic payments on the mortgage indebtedness with respect to the apartment complexes; (3) provide tax benefits in the form of passive losses which an investor may apply to offset his passive income (if any); and (4) provide cash distributions (except with respect to the Fund's investment in various non-profit Operating Partnerships) from capital transaction proceeds. The Operating Partnerships intend to hold the apartment complexes for appreciation in value. The Operating Partnerships may sell the apartment complexes after a period of time if financial conditions in the future make such sales desirable and if such sales are permitted by government restrictions.

 (b) Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management of the Assignor Limited Partner is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). The Assignor Limited Partner's internal control system over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Assignor Limited Partner's management regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Due to inherent limitations, an internal control system over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. As required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Assignor Limited Partner s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this evaluation, management concluded the Assignor Limited Partner s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. (c) Changes in Internal Controls There were no changes in the Corporation's internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the President and Chief Financial Officer BCTC V Assignor Corp. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of BCTC V Assignor Corp. (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal security laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits of the balance sheets provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to those charged with governance and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters. 

/s/ We have served as the Company s auditor since 2003. March 22, 2023
