 Part I Item 1. Business. What is the Trust and the Trust Series? The United States Commodity Index Funds Trust (the Trust is a Delaware statutory trust formed on December 21, 2009. The Trust is a series trust formed pursuant to the Delaware Statutory Trust Act and is organized into three separate series (each series, a Trust Series and collectively, the Trust Series ). As of December 31, 2022, the Trust includes the United States Commodity Index Fund USCI ), a commodity pool formed on April 1, 2010 and first made available to the public on August 10, 2010, and the United States Copper Index Fund CPER ), a commodity pool formed on November 26, 2010 and first made available to the public on November 15, 2011. USCI and CPER each issues shares shares that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc. NYSE Arca ). The Trust, USCI, and CPER operate pursuant to the Trust s Fourth Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement (the Trust Agreement ), dated as of December 15, 2017. Wilmington Trust Company, a Delaware trust company, is the Delaware trustee of the Trust. The Trust, USCI and CPER are managed and controlled by United States Commodity Funds LLC USCF ). USCF is a limited liability company formed in Delaware on May 10, 2005, that is registered as a commodity pool operator CPO with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and is a member of the National Futures Association NFA ). The Trust and Trust Series maintain their main business offices at 1850 Mt. Diablo Boulevard, Suite 640, Walnut Creek, California 94596. USCI s Investment Objective The investment objective of USCI is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares per share net asset value NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the SummerHaven Dynamic Commodity Index Total Return SM (the SDCI ), less USCI s expenses. USCI seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing so that the average daily percentage change in USCI s NAV for any period of 30 successive valuation days will be within plus/minus 10 percent (10 of the average daily percentage change in the price of the SDCI over the same period. The SDCI is designed to reflect the performance of a diversified group of commodities. The SDCI is owned and maintained by SummerHaven Index Management, LLC SHIM and is calculated and published by Bloomberg L.P. Futures contracts for the commodities comprising the SDCI are traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange NYMEX ), ICE Futures ICE Futures ), Chicago Board of Trade CBOT ), Chicago Mercantile Exchange CME ), London Metal Exchange LME ), and Commodity Exchange, Inc. COMEX together with the NYMEX, ICE Futures, CBOT, CME, LME and COMEX, the Futures Exchanges and are collectively referred to herein as Futures Contracts. The Futures Contracts that at any given time make up the SDCI are referred to herein as Benchmark Component Futures Contracts. The relative weighting of the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts will change on a monthly basis, based on quantitative formulas relating to the prices of the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts developed by SHIM. USCI seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing to the fullest extent possible in the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts. Then, if constrained by regulatory requirements or in view of market conditions, USCI will invest next in other Futures Contracts based on the same commodity as the futures contracts subject to such regulatory constraints or market conditions, and finally, to a lesser extent, in other exchange-traded futures contracts that are economically identical or substantially similar to the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts if one or more other Futures Contracts is not available. When USCI has invested to the fullest extent possible in exchange-traded futures contracts, USCI may then invest in other contracts and instruments based on the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts, other Futures Contracts or the commodities included in the SDCI, such as cash-settled options, forward contracts, cleared swap contracts and swap contracts other than cleared swap contracts. Other exchange-traded futures contracts that are economically identical or substantially similar to the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts and other contracts and instruments based on the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts are collectively referred to as Other Commodity-Related Investments, and together with Benchmark Component Futures Contracts and other Futures Contracts, Commodity Interests.

 USCI seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing so that the average daily percentage change in USCI s NAV for any period of 30 successive valuation days will be within plus/minus 10 percent (10 of the average daily percentage change in the price of the SDCI over the same period. USCF believes that the market arbitrage opportunities will cause the daily changes in USCI s share price on the NYSE Arca on a percentage basis to closely track the daily changes in USCI s per share NAV on a percentage basis. USCF believes that the net effect of this expected relationship and the expected relationship described above between USCI s per share NAV and the SDCI will be that the daily changes in the price of USCI s shares on the NYSE Arca on a percentage basis will closely track the daily changes in the SDCI on a percentage basis, less USCI s expenses. While USCI is composed of Benchmark Component Futures Contracts and is therefore a measure of the prices of the corresponding commodities comprising the SDCI for future delivery, there is nonetheless expected to be a reasonable degree of correlation between the SDCI and the cash or spot prices of the commodities underlying the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts. Investors should be aware that USCI s investment objective is not for its NAV or market price of shares to equal, in dollar terms, the spot prices of the commodities underlying the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts or the prices of any particular group of futures contracts. USCI will not seek to achieve its stated investment objective over a period of time greater than one day. This is because natural market forces called contango and backwardation have impacted the total return on an investment in USCI s shares during the past year relative to a hypothetical direct investment in the various commodities and, in the future, it is likely that the relationship between the market price of USCI s shares and changes in the spot prices of the underlying commodities will continue to be so impacted by contango and backwardation. (It is important to note that the disclosure above ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing the commodities, which could be substantial). As of December 31, 2022, USCI held 911 Futures Contracts on the NYMEX, held 2,499 Futures Contracts on the ICE Futures, held 1,419 Futures Contracts on the CBOT, did not hold any Futures Contracts on the CME, held 1,017 Futures Contracts on the LME and held 191 Futures Contracts on the COMEX. CPER s Investment Objective The investment objective of CPER is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares per share NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the SummerHaven Copper Index Total Return SM (the SCI ), less CPER s expenses. CPER seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing so that the average daily percentage change in CPER s NAV for any period of 30 successive valuation days will be within plus/minus 10 percent (10 of the average daily percentage change in the price of the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts over the same period. The SCI is designed to reflect the performance of the investment returns from a portfolio of copper futures contracts on the Commodity Exchange, Inc. exchange COMEX ). The SCI is owned and maintained by SummerHaven Index Management, LLC SHIM and calculated and published by the NYSE Arca. The SCI is comprised of either one or three Eligible Copper Futures Contracts that are selected on a monthly basis based on quantitative formulas relating to the prices of the Eligible Copper Futures Contracts developed by SHIM. The Eligible Copper Futures Contracts that at any given time make up the SCI are referred to herein as Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts. CPER seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing to the fullest extent possible in the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts. Then, if constrained by regulatory requirements or in view of market conditions, CPER will invest next in other Eligible Copper Futures Contracts based on the same copper as the futures contracts subject to such regulatory constraints or market conditions, and finally to a lesser extent, in other exchange traded futures contracts that are economically identical or substantially similar to the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts if one or more other Eligible Copper Futures Contracts is not available. When CPER has invested to the fullest extent possible in exchange-traded futures contracts, CPER may then invest in other contracts and instruments based on the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts, other Eligible Copper Futures Contracts or other items based on copper, such as cash-settled options, forward contracts, cleared swap contracts and swap contracts other than cleared swap contracts. Other exchange-traded futures contracts that are economically identical or substantially similar to the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts and other contracts and instruments based on the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts, are collectively referred to collectively as Other Copper-Related Investments, and together with Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts and other Eligible Copper Futures Contracts, Copper Interests.

An investment in the shares provides a means for diversifying an investor s portfolio or hedging exposure to changes in commodities prices. An investment in the shares allows both retail and institutional investors to easily gain this exposure to the commodities market in a transparent, cost-effective manner. How USCI Seeks to Achieve Its Investment Objective. USCI seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing to the fullest extent possible in the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts. Then, if constrained by regulatory requirements or in view of market conditions, USCI will invest next in other Futures Contracts based on the same commodity as the futures contracts subject to such regulatory constraints or market conditions, and finally, to a lesser extent, in other exchange-traded futures contracts that are economically identical or substantially similar to the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts if one or more other Futures Contracts is not available. When USCI has invested to the fullest extent possible in exchange-traded futures contracts, USCI may then invest in other contracts and instruments based on the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts, other Futures Contracts or the commodities included in the SDCI, such as cash-settled options, forward contracts, cleared swap contracts and swap contracts other than cleared swap contracts. Other exchange-traded futures contracts that are economically identical or substantially similar to the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts and other contracts and instruments based on the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts are collectively referred to as Other Commodity-Related Investments, and together with Benchmark Component Futures Contracts and other Futures Contracts, Commodity Interests. Market conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause USCI to invest in Other Commodity-Related Investments include those allowing USCI to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing. USCI invests substantially the entire amount of its assets in Futures Contracts while supporting such investments by holding the amounts of its margin, collateral and other requirements relating to these obligations in short-term obligations of the United States of two years or less Treasuries ), cash and cash equivalents. The daily holdings of USCI are available on USCI s website at www.uscfinvestments.com. How CPER Seeks to Achieve Its Investment Objective. CPER seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing to the fullest extent possible in the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts. Then, if constrained by regulatory requirements or in view of market conditions, CPER will invest next in other Eligible Copper Futures Contracts based on the same copper as the futures contracts subject to such regulatory constraints or market conditions, and finally to a lesser extent, in other exchange traded futures contracts that are economically identical or substantially similar to the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts if one or more other Eligible

 Copper Futures Contracts is not available. When CPER has invested to the fullest extent possible in exchange-traded futures contracts, CPER may then invest in other contracts and instruments based on the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts, other Eligible Copper Futures Contracts or other items based on copper, such as cash-settled options, forward contracts, cleared swap contracts and swap contracts other than cleared swap contracts. Other exchange-traded futures contracts that are economically identical or substantially similar to the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts and other contracts and instruments based on the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts, are collectively referred to collectively as Other Copper-Related Investments, and together with Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts and other Eligible Copper Futures Contracts, Copper Interests. Market conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause CPER to invest in Other Copper-Related Investments include those allowing CPER to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing. CPER invests substantially the entire amount of its assets in Eligible Copper Futures Contracts while supporting such investments by holding the amounts of its margin, collateral and other requirements relating to these obligations in Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents. The daily holdings of CPER are available on CPER s website at www.uscfinvestments.com. USCF employs a neutral investment strategy in order to track changes in the Applicable Index regardless of whether the Applicable Index goes up or goes down. A Trust Series neutral investment strategy is designed to permit investors generally to purchase and sell a Trust Series shares for the purpose of investing indirectly in the applicable commodities market in a cost-effective manner, and/or to permit participants in the applicable commodities or other industries to hedge the risk of losses in their applicable commodity-related transactions. Accordingly, depending on the investment objective of an individual investor, the risks generally associated with investing in the commodities market and/or the risks involved in hedging may exist. In addition, an investment in a Trust Series involves the risks that the daily changes in the price of the Trust Series shares, in percentage terms, will not accurately track the daily changes in the Applicable Index, in percentage terms, and that daily changes in the Applicable Index, in percentage terms, will not closely correlate with daily changes in the spot prices of the applicable commodities underlying the Applicable Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts, in percentage terms. The shares issued by a Trust Series may only be purchased by Authorized Participants and only in blocks of 50,000 shares called Creation Baskets through the Marketing Agent. The amount of the purchase payment for a Creation Basket is equal to the aggregate NAV of the shares in the Creation Basket. Similarly, only Authorized Participants may redeem shares and only in blocks of 50,000 shares called Redemption Baskets . The amount of the redemption proceeds for a Redemption Basket is equal to the aggregate NAV of shares in the Redemption Basket. The purchase price for Creation Baskets and the redemption price for Redemption Baskets are the actual per share NAV calculated at the end of the business day when a request for a purchase or redemption is received by the applicable Trust Series. The NYSE Arca publishes an approximate per share NAV intra-day based on the prior day s per share NAV and the current price of the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts, but the price of Creation Baskets and Redemption Baskets is determined based on the actual per share NAV calculated at the end of each trading day. While each Trust Series only issues shares in Creation Baskets, shares are listed on the NYSE Arca and investors may purchase and sell shares at market prices like any security. What is the Investment Strategy for each Trust Series? In managing a Trust Series assets, USCF does not use a technical trading system that automatically issues buy and sell orders, other than to address monthly changes in the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts, on a percentage basis. Instead, each time one or more baskets are purchased or redeemed, USCF will purchase or sell Applicable Interests with an aggregate market value that approximates the amount of Treasuries and/or cash received or paid upon the purchase or redemption of the basket(s). Each Trust Series endeavors to place trades in Applicable Interests and otherwise manage its investments so that A will be within plus/minus ten percent (10 of B , where: A is the average daily percentage change in such Trust Series per share NAV for any period of 30 successive valuation days; i.e., any NYSE Arca trading day as of which the Trust Series calculates its per share NAV; and B is the average daily percentage change in the price of the Applicable Index over the same period. 
 USCF believes that market arbitrage opportunities will cause the daily changes in each Trust Series share price on the NYSE Arca on a percentage basis to closely track the daily changes in such Trust Series per share NAV on a percentage basis. USCF further believes that the net effect of this expected relationship and the expected relationship described above between a Trust Series per share NAV and the Applicable Index will be that the daily changes in the price of a Trust Series shares on the NYSE Arca on a percentage basis will closely track the daily changes in the Applicable Index on a percentage basis, less such Trust Series expenses. While the Applicable

 Index is composed of Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts and is therefore a measure of the prices of the applicable commodities comprising the Applicable Index for future delivery, there is nonetheless expected to be a reasonable degree of correlation between the Applicable Index and the cash or spot prices of the commodities underlying the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts. Commodity Interests. The specific Commodity Interests purchased depend on various factors, including a judgment by USCF as to the appropriate diversification of USCI s investments. While USCF has made significant investments in Benchmark Component Futures Contracts on the Futures Exchanges, for various reasons, including the ability to enter into the precise amount of exposure to the commodities market and position limits on Futures Contracts, it may also invest in economically equivalent Futures Contracts other than those that compose the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts and Other Commodity-Related Investments. To the extent that USCI invests in Other Related Investments, it would prioritize investments in contracts and instruments that are economically equivalent to the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts, including cleared swaps that satisfy such criteria, and then to a lesser extent, it would invest in other types of cleared swaps and other contracts, instruments and non-cleared swaps, such as swaps in over-the-counter market (or commonly referred to as the market ). If USCI is required by law or regulation, or by one of its regulators, including a Futures Exchange, to reduce its position in one or more Benchmark Component Futures Contracts to the applicable position limit or to a specified accountability level, a substantial portion of USCI s assets could be invested in Other Commodity-Related Investments that are intended to replicate the return on the SDCI or particular Benchmark Component Futures Contracts. As USCI s assets reach higher levels, USCI is more likely to exceed position limits, accountability levels or other regulatory limits and, as a result, it is more likely that it will invest in Other Commodity-Related Investments at such higher levels. In addition, market conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause USCI to invest in Other Commodity-Related Investments include those allowing USCI to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing. See Item 1. Business Commodities Regulation in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the potential impact of regulation on USCI s ability to invest in OTC transactions and cleared swaps. Copper Interests. The specific Copper Interests purchased will depend on various factors, including a judgment by USCF as to the appropriate diversification of CPER s investments. USCF anticipates, particularly while CPER has lesser amounts of assets, that it will make significant investments in Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts on the COMEX. In addition, for various reasons, including the ability to enter into the precise amount of exposure to the copper market or due to market conditions regarding liquidity or pricing of differing futures contracts, it may invest in other exchange-traded futures contracts that are economically identical or substantially similar to, the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts. USCF further anticipates that as CPER grows larger, due to position limits on futures contracts or other regulatory requirements limiting CPER s holdings, and market conditions, it may also invest in Other Copper-Related Investments. To the extent that CPER invests in Other Copper-Related Investments, it would prioritize investments in contracts and instruments that are economically equivalent to the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts. In considering the use of Other Copper-Related Investments, USCF anticipates that it would first make use of swaps that clear through derivatives clearing organizations that satisfy CPER s criteria if such swaps are available with respect to the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts or the copper futures contracts included in the SCI. Then, and to a lesser extent, it would invest in other types of contracts, instruments and swaps, including uncleared swaps in the OTC market. If CPER is required by law or regulation, or by one of its regulators, including the COMEX, to reduce its position in one or more Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts to applicable position limit or to a specified accountability level or if market conditions dictate it would be more appropriate to invest in Other Copper-Related Investments, a substantial portion of CPER s assets could be invested in accordance with such priority in Other Copper-Related Investments that are intended to replicate the return on the SCI or particular Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts. As CPER s assets reach higher levels, CPER is more likely to exceed position limits, accountability levels or other regulatory limits and, as a result, it is more likely that it will invest in accordance with such priority in Other Copper-Related Investments at such higher levels. In addition, market conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause CPER to invest in Other Copper-Related Investments include those allowing CPER to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing. See Item 1. Business Commodities Regulation in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the potential impact of regulation on CPER s ability to invest in OTC transactions and cleared swaps. USCF may not be able to fully invest a Trust Series assets in Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts having an aggregate notional amount exactly equal to that Trust Series NAV. For example, as standardized contracts, the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts included in an Applicable Index are for a specified amount of a particular commodity, and the applicable Trust Series NAV and the proceeds from the sale of a Creation Basket in a particular Trust Series is unlikely to be an exact multiple of the amounts of those contracts. As a result, in such circumstances, a Trust Series may be better able to achieve the exact amount of exposure to changes in price of the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts through the use of Other Related Investments, such as OTC contracts that have better correlation with changes in price of the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts. Each Trust Series anticipates that, to the extent it invests in Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts other than the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts and Other Related Investments that are not economically equivalent to the

Table of Contents 
 Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts, it will enter into various non-exchange-traded derivative contracts to hedge the short-term price movements of such Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts and Other Related Investments against the current Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts. USCF does not anticipate letting its Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts expire and taking delivery of any commodities. Instead, USCF closes existing positions, e.g., in response to ongoing changes in the Applicable Index or if it otherwise determines it would be appropriate to do so and reinvests the proceeds in new Applicable Interests. Positions may also be closed out to meet orders for Redemption Baskets, in which case the proceeds from closing the positions will not be reinvested. What are Futures Contracts? Futures contracts are agreements between two parties. One party agrees to buy a commodity such as natural gas or copper from the other party at a later date at a price and quantity agreed-upon when the contract is made. Generally, futures contracts traded on the NYMEX and the COMEX are priced by floor brokers and other exchange members both through an open outcry of offers to purchase or sell the contracts and through an electronic, screen-based system that determines the price by matching electronically offers to purchase and sell. Futures contracts may also be based on commodity indices, in that they call for a cash payment based on the change in the value of the specified index during a specified period. Additional risks of investing in futures contracts are included in Item 1A. Risk Factors in this annual report on Form 10-K. Accountability Levels, Position Limits and Price Fluctuation Limits. Designated contract markets DCMs ), such as the NYMEX and ICE Futures, have established accountability levels and position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons under common trading control (other than as a hedge, which is not applicable to the Trust Series investments) may hold, own or control. These levels and position limits apply to the futures contracts that the Trust invests in to meet its investment objective. In addition to accountability levels and position limits, the NYMEX and ICE Futures also set daily price fluctuation limits on futures contracts. The daily price fluctuation limit establishes the maximum amount that the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous day s settlement price. Once the daily price fluctuation limit has been reached in a particular futures contract, no trades may be made at a price beyond that limit. The accountability levels for the commodities comprising an Applicable Index and other futures contracts traded on U.S.-based futures exchanges are not a fixed ceiling, but rather a threshold above which such exchanges may exercise greater scrutiny and control over an investor s positions. As of December 31, 2022, USCI held 911 Futures Contracts on the NYMEX, held 2,499 Futures Contracts on the ICE Futures, held 1,419 Futures Contracts on the CBOT, did not hold any Futures Contracts on the CME, held 1,017 Futures Contracts on the LME and held 191 Futures Contracts on the COMEX. As of December 31, 2022, CPER held 1,779 Futures Contracts on the COMEX. No Trust Series exceeded accountability levels imposed by the NYMEX, COMEX, CME, CBOT, LME or ICE Futures. Position limits differ from accountability levels in that they represent fixed limits on the maximum number of futures contracts that any person may hold and cannot allow such limits to be exceeded without express CFTC authority to do so. In addition to accountability levels and position limits that may apply at any time, the Futures Exchanges may impose position limits on contracts held in the last few days of trading in the near month contract to expire. It is unlikely that a Trust Series will run up against such position limits. A Trust Series does not typically hold the near month contract in its Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts. In addition, each Trust Series investment strategy is to close out its positions during each Rebalancing Period in advance of the period right before expiration and purchase new contracts. As such, none of the Trust Series anticipates that position limits that apply to the last few days prior to a contract s expiration will impact it. For the year ended December 31, 2022, no Trust Series exceeded position limits imposed by the NYMEX, COMEX, CME, CBOT, LME or ICE Futures. On October 15, 2020, the CFTC approved a final rule that amends the existing federal position limits regime set forth in Part 150 of the CFTC s regulations as well as the framework for exchange-set position limits and exemptions (such final rule, the Position Limits Rule ). The Position Limits Rule establishes federal position limits for 25 core referenced futures contracts (comprised of agricultural, energy and metals futures contracts), futures and options linked to the core referenced futures contracts, and swaps that are economically equivalent to the core referenced futures contracts. Certain Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts are subject to position limits under the Position Limits Rule, and the Trust Series trading does not qualify for an exemption therefrom. Accordingly, the Position Limits Rule could negatively impact the ability of the Trust Series to meet their investment objectives by inhibiting USCF s ability to effectively invest the proceeds from sales of Creation Baskets of the Trust Series in particular amounts and types of its permitted investments.

 Price Volatility. The price volatility of futures contracts generally has been historically greater than that for traditional securities such as stocks and bonds. Price volatility often is greater day-to-day as opposed to intra-day. Because each Trust Series invests a significant portion of its assets in futures contracts, the assets of each Trust Series, and therefore the price of each Trust Series shares, may be subject to greater volatility than traditional securities. Marking-to-Market Futures Positions. Futures contracts are marked to market at the end of each trading day and the margin required with respect to such contracts is adjusted accordingly. This process of marking-to-market is designed to prevent losses from accumulating in any futures account. Therefore, if a Trust Series futures positions have declined in value, such Trust Series may be required to post variation margin to cover this decline. Alternatively, if a Trust Series futures positions have increased in value, this increase will be credited to such Trust Series account. What is the SDCI? The SDCI is a commodity sector index designed to broadly represent major commodities while overweighting the components that are assessed to be in a low inventory state and underweighting the components assessed to be in a high inventory state. The SDCI is designed to reflect the performance of a fully margined or collateralized portfolio of 14 eligible commodity futures contracts with equal weights, selected each month from a universe of 27 eligible commodity futures contracts. The SDCI is rules-based and rebalanced monthly based on observable price signals. In this context, the term rules-based is meant to indicate that the composition of the SDCI in any given month will be determined by quantitative formulas relating to the prices of the futures contracts that relate to the commodities that are eligible to be included in the SDCI. Such formulas are not subject to adjustment based on other factors. The overall return on the SDCI is generated by two components: (i) uncollateralized returns from the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts comprising the SDCI and (ii) a daily fixed income return reflecting the interest earned on a hypothetical 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill collateral portfolio, calculated using the weekly auction rate for the 3-Month U.S. Treasury Bills published by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. SHIM is the owner of the SDCI. Currently, the SDCI is composed of physical non-financial commodity futures contracts with active and liquid markets traded upon futures exchanges in major industrialized countries. The futures contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars and weighted equally by notional amount. The SDCI currently reflects commodities in five commodity sectors: petroleum (e.g., crude oil, heating oil, etc.), precious metals (e.g., gold, silver platinum), industrial metals (e.g., zinc, nickel, aluminum, copper, etc.), grains (e.g., wheat, corn, soybeans, etc.), and non-primary sector (e.g., sugar, cotton, coffee, cocoa, natural gas, live cattle, lean hogs, feeder cattle).

Values of the SDCI are computed by Bloomberg and disseminated approximately every fifteen (15) seconds from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, which also publishes a daily SDCI value at approximately 5:30 p.m., New York City time, under the index ticker symbol SDCITR:IND. Only settlement and last-sale prices are used in the SDCI s calculation, bids and offers are not recognized including limit-bid and limit-offer price quotes. Where no last-sale price exists, typically in the more deferred contract months, the previous days settlement price is used. This means that the underlying SDCI may lag its theoretical value. This tendency to lag is evident at the end of the day when the SDCI value is based on the settlement prices of the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts, and explains why the underlying SDCI often closes at or near the high or low for the day. Composition of the SDCI The composition of the SDCI on any given day, as determined and published by SHIM, is determinative of the benchmark for USCI. However, it is not possible to anticipate all possible circumstances and events that may occur with respect to the SDCI and the methodology for its composition, weighting and calculation. Accordingly, a number of subjective judgments must be made in connection with the operation of the SDCI that cannot be adequately reflected in this description of the SDCI. All questions of interpretation with respect to the application of the provisions of the SDCI methodology, including any determinations that need to be made in the event of a market emergency or other extraordinary circumstances, will be resolved by SHIM.

 The composition of the SDCI was revised beginning with the commodity selection process that commenced on December 24, 2020. SHIM revised the composition of the SDCI to consolidate the six commodity sectors that comprised the index into five sectors. Specifically, prior to December 24, 2020, the SDCI reflected commodities in six commodity sectors: energy (e.g., crude oil, natural gas, heating oil, etc.), precious metals (e.g., gold, silver platinum), industrial metals (e.g., zinc, nickel, aluminum, copper, etc.), grains (e.g., wheat, corn, soybeans, etc.), softs (e.g., sugar, cotton, coffee, cocoa), and livestock (e.g., live cattle, lean hogs, feeder cattle). During the year ended December 31, 2021, the composition of SDCI reflected the five commodity sectors: petroleum (e.g., crude oil, heating oil, etc.), precious metals (e.g., gold, silver platinum), industrial metals (e.g., zinc, nickel, aluminum, copper, etc.), grains (e.g., wheat, corn, soybeans, etc.), and non-primary sector (e.g., sugar, cotton, coffee, cocoa, natural gas, live cattle, lean hogs, feeder cattle), discussed above and utilized the commodity selection as described below. Contract Expirations Because the SDCI is comprised of actively traded contracts with scheduled expirations, it can be calculated only by reference to the prices of contracts for specified expiration, delivery or settlement periods, referred to as contract expirations. The contract expirations included in the SDCI for each commodity during a given year are designated by SHIM, provided that each contract must be an active contract. An active contract for this purpose is a liquid, actively-traded contract expiration, as defined or identified by the relevant trading facility or, if no such definition or identification is provided by the relevant trading facility, as defined by standard custom and practice in the industry. If a Futures Exchange ceases trading in all contract expirations relating to a particular Futures Contract, SHIM may designate a replacement contract on the commodity. The replacement contract must satisfy the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the SDCI. To the extent practicable, the replacement will be effected during the next monthly review of the composition of the SDCI. If that timing is not practicable, SHIM will determine the date of the replacement based on a number of factors, including the differences between the existing Futures Contract and the replacement Futures Contract with respect to contractual specifications and contract expirations. If a contract is eliminated and there is no replacement contract, the underlying commodity will necessarily be dropped from the SDCI. The designation of a replacement contract, or the elimination of a commodity from the SDCI because of the absence of a replacement contract, could affect the value of the SDCI, either positively or negatively, depending on the price of the contract that is eliminated and the prices of the remaining contracts. It is impossible, however, to predict the effect of these changes, if they occur, on the value of the SDCI. Commodity Selection Fourteen of the 27 eligible Futures Contracts are selected for inclusion in the SDCI for the next month, subject to the constraint that each of the four commodity sectors (excluding non-primary sector) is represented by at least one commodity. The methodology used to select the 14 Futures Contracts is based solely on quantitative data using observable futures prices and is not subject to human bias. Monthly commodity selection is a two-step process based upon examination of the relevant futures prices for each commodity: 1) The annualized percentage price difference between the closest-to-expiration Futures Contract and the next closest-to-expiration Futures Contract is calculated for each of the 27 eligible Futures Contracts on USCI s Selection Date. 2) The 14 commodities with the highest percentage price difference are selected. 
 When evaluating the data from the first step, all four primary commodity sectors must be represented (Petroleum, Grains, Industrial Metals and Precious Metals). If the selection of the 14 commodities with the highest percentage price difference fails to meet the overall diversification requirement that all four primary commodity sectors are represented in the SDCI, the commodity with the highest percentage price difference among the commodities of the omitted primary sector(s) would be substituted for the commodity with the lowest percentage price difference among the fourteen commodities. The 14 commodities selected are included in the SDCI for the next month on an equally-weighted basis. Due to the dynamic monthly commodity selection, the sector weights will vary from approximately 7 to 43 over time, depending on the price observations each month. The Selection Date for the SDCI is the fifth business day prior to the end of that calendar month.

SDCI Commodity Weights as of December 31, 2022 Source: Summerhaven Index Management, Bloomberg Contract Selection For each commodity selected for inclusion into the SDCI for a particular month, the SDCI selects a specific Benchmark Component Futures Contract with a tenor (i.e., contract month) among the eligible tenors (the range of contract months) based upon the relative prices of the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts within the eligible range of contract months. The previous notwithstanding, the contract expiration is not changed for such month if a contract remains in the SDCI, as long as the contract does not expire or enter its notice period in the subsequent month. Portfolio Construction The portfolio rebalancing takes place during the Rebalancing Period. At the end of each of the days in the Rebalancing Period, one fourth of the prior month portfolio positions are replaced by an equally-weighted position in the commodity contracts determined on USCI s Selection Date. At the end of the Rebalancing Period, the SDCI takes an equal-weight position of approximately 7.14 in each of the selected commodity contracts.

 SDCI Total Return Calculation The value of the SDCI on any business day is equal to the product of (i) the value of the SDCI on the immediately preceding business day multiplied by (ii) one plus the sum of the day s returns for another version of the SDCI known as the SummerHaven Dynamic Commodity Index Excess Return SDCI ER (explained below) and one business day s interest from hypothetical Treasuries. The value of the SDCI is calculated and published by Bloomberg. SDCI Base Level The SDCI was set to 100 on January 2, 1991. SDCI ER Calculation The total return of the SDCI ER reflects the percentage change of the market values of the underlying commodity futures. During the Rebalancing Period, the SDCI changes its contract holdings during a four day period. The value of the SDCI ER at the end of a business day t is equal to the SDCI ER value on day t -1 multiplied by the sum of the daily percentage price changes of each commodity future factoring in each respective commodity future s notional holding on day t -1 . Rebalancing Period During the Rebalancing Period, existing positions are replaced by new positions based on the signals used for contract selection as outlined above. At the end of Selection Date, the signals are observed and on the first day following Selection Date a new portfolio is constructed that is equally weighted in terms of notional positions in the newly selected contracts. What is the SCI? The SCI is a single-commodity index designed to be an investment benchmark for copper as an asset class. The SCI is composed of copper futures contracts on the COMEX exchange. The SCI attempts to maximize backwardation and minimize contango while utilizing contracts in liquid portions of the futures curve. The SCI is rules-based and is rebalanced monthly based on observable price signals described below in the section Contract Selection and Weighting. In this context, the term rules-based is meant to indicate that the composition of the SCI in any given month will be determined by quantitative formulas relating to the prices of the futures contracts that are included in the SCI. Such formulas are not subject to adjustment based on other factors. The overall return on the SCI is generated by two components: (i) uncollateralized returns from the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts comprising the SCI, and (ii) a daily fixed income return reflecting the interest earned on hypothetical 3-month Treasuries, calculated using the weekly auction rate for 3-Month Treasuries published by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. SHIM is the owner of the SCI. Table 1 below lists the Futures Exchange on which the Eligible Copper Futures Contracts are listed and quotation details.

 Prior to the end of each month, SHIM determines the composition of the SCI and provides such information to the NYSE Arca. Values of the SCI are computed by the NYSE Arca and disseminated approximately every fifteen (15) seconds from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, which also publishes a daily SCI value at approximately 5:30 p.m., New York City time, under the index ticker symbol SCI. Only settlement and last-sale prices are used in the SCI s calculation, bids and offers are not recognized including limit-bid and limit-offer price quotes. Where no last-sale price exists, typically in the more deferred contract months, the previous days settlement price is used. This means that the underlying SCI may lag its theoretical value. This tendency to lag is evident at the end of the day when the SCI value is based on the settlement prices of the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts, and explains why the underlying SCI often closes at or near the high or low for the day. Composition of the SCI The composition of the SCI on any given day, as determined and published by SHIM, is determinative of the benchmark for CPER. Neither the index methodology for the SCI nor any set of procedures, however, are capable of anticipating all possible circumstances and events that may occur with respect to the SCI and the methodology for its composition, weighting and calculation. Accordingly, a number of subjective judgments must be made in connection with the operation of the SCI that cannot be adequately reflected in this description of the SCI. All questions of interpretation with respect to the application of the provisions of the index methodology for the SCI, including any determinations that need to be made in the event of a market emergency or other extraordinary circumstances, will be resolved by SHIM. Beginning with the commodity selection process that was scheduled to occur on December 31, 2020, the rebalancing period for the SCI changed from the first four business days of each month to the 11th-14th business days of each month, based on signals used for contract selection on the 10th business day of each month, rather than the last business day of each month. In addition, commencing with the first commodity selection date occurring after the change, the SCI was revised as follows: the number of Eligible Copper Futures Contracts was reduced, and the SCI itself is now comprised of one or three Eligible Copper Futures Contracts. Previously, the SCI could have been comprised of two or three Eligible Copper Futures Contracts. These revisions to the composition of the SCI are intended to ensure that the SCI components at any given time represent copper futures contracts for which there is an active and liquid trading market. Contract Expirations Because the SCI is comprised of actively traded contracts with scheduled expirations, it can be calculated only by reference to the prices of contracts for specified expiration, delivery or settlement periods, referred to as contract expirations. The contract expirations included in the SCI for each commodity during a given year are designated by SHIM, provided that each contract must be an active contract. An active contract for this purpose is a liquid, actively-traded contract expiration, as defined or identified by the relevant trading facility or, if no such definition or identification is provided by the relevant trading facility, as defined by standard custom and practice in the industry. If a futures exchange, such as the COMEX, ceases trading in all contract expirations relating to an Eligible Copper Futures Contract, SHIM may designate a replacement contract. The replacement contract must satisfy the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the SCI. To the extent practicable, the replacement will be effected during the next monthly review of the composition of the SCI. If that timing is not practicable, SHIM will determine the date of the replacement based on a number of factors, including the differences between the existing Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contract and the replacement contract with respect to contractual specifications and contract expirations. The designation of a replacement contract could affect the value of the SCI, either positively or negatively, depending on the price of the contract that is eliminated and the prices of the replacement contract. It is impossible, however, to predict the effect of these changes, if they occur, on the value of the SCI. Contract Selection and Weighting Weights for each of the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts are determined for the next month. The methodology used to calculate the SCI weighting is based solely on quantitative data using observable futures prices and is not subject to human bias.

 The monthly weighting selection is a process based upon examination of the relevant futures prices for copper: 1) On CPER s Selection Date CPER s Selection Date ): 
 a) the copper futures curve is assessed to be in either backwardation or contango (as discussed below); and b) the Three Eligible Copper Futures Contracts are identified. For each month, the Three Eligible Copper Futures Contracts are as follows 
 Month January February March April May June July August September October November December Closest to Expiration Futures Contract Mar Mar May May Jul Jul Sep Sep Dec Dec Dec Mar Eligible Futures Contracts Mar May May Jul Jul Sep Sep Dec Dec Dec Mar Mar May July July Sep Sep Dec Dec Mar Mar Mar May May July Sep Sep Dec Dec Mar Mar May May May Jul Jul A futures curve in backwardation occurs when the price of the closest-to-expiration Eligible Copper Futures Contract is greater than or equal to the price of the next closest-to-expiration Eligible Copper Futures Contract. These contracts will have expirations that are approximately two or three months apart. A curve not in backwardation is defined as being in contango, which occurs when the price of the closest-to-expiration contract is less than the price of the next closest-to-expiration contract. 2a) Backwardation: If the copper futures curve is in backwardation on the Selection Date, the SCI takes positions in the first Eligible Copper Futures Contract, weighted at 100 . A hypothetical example is included below, with the selected Eligible Copper Futures Contract shaded below: 

Contract Copper Futures Contract Expiration Date Price Nearest-to-maturity December-10 374.70 Next nearest-to-maturity March-11 365.20 

Eligible Copper Futures Contracts Price December-10 374.70 2b) Contango: If the copper futures curve is in contango, then the SCI takes positions in the first three Eligible Copper Futures Contracts, each position is weighted at 33.33 . A hypothetical example is included below, with the three selected Eligible Copper Futures Contracts indicated below: 

Copper Futures Contract Expiration Date Contract Price Nearest-to-maturity December-10 374.00 Next nearest-to-maturity March-11 375.70 

Eligible Copper Futures Contracts Price December-10 374.00 March-11 375.70 May-11 376.30 Due to the dynamic monthly weighting calculation, the individual weights will vary-over time, depending on the price observations each month. CPER s Selection Date for the SCI is the 10th business day of the calendar month.

 The following graph shows the weights of the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts selected for inclusion in the SCI as of December 31, 2022. Source: Summerhaven Index Management, Bloomberg Portfolio Construction The portfolio rebalancing takes place during the Rebalancing Period. At the end of each of the days in the Rebalancing Period one fourth of the prior month portfolio positions are replaced by the new weights for the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts determined on CPER s Selection Date. SCI Total Return Calculation The value of the SCI on any business day is equal to the product of (i) the value of the SCI on the immediately preceding business day multiplied by (ii) one plus the sum of the day s returns for another version of the SCI known as the SummerHaven Dynamic Copper Index Excess Return SCI ER (explained below) and one business day s interest from the hypothetical Treasury Bill portfolio. The value of the SCI will be calculated and published by the NYSE Arca. SCI Base Level The SCI was set to 100 on January 2, 1991.

Table of Contents 
 SCI ER Calculation The total return of the SCI ER reflects the percentage change of the market values of the underlying commodity futures. During the Rebalancing Period, the SCI changes its contract holdings and weightings during a four day period. The value of the SCI ER at the end of a business day t is equal to the SCI ER value on day t -1 multiplied by the sum of the daily percentage price changes of each commodity future factoring in each respective commodity future s notional holding on day t -1 . Rebalancing Period The SCI is rebalanced during the 11th-14th business days of each month, based on signals used for contract selection on the 10th business day of each month, when existing positions are placed by new positions and weightings based on the signals used for contract selection on the prior calendar month as outlined above. Treasuries, Cash and Cash Equivalents Each Trust Series seeks to have the aggregate notional amount of the Applicable Interests it holds approximate at all times its aggregate NAV. At any given time, however, most of the Trust Series holdings are in short-term Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents that support such Trust Series positions in Applicable Interests. For example, the purchase of an Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contract with a stated or notional amount of 10 million would not require a Trust Series to pay 10 million upon entering into the contract; rather, only a margin deposit, generally of 5 to 30 of the notional amount, would be required. To secure its obligations under Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts, a Trust Series would deposit the required margin with the FCM and would separately hold its remaining assets through its Custodian in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents. Such remaining assets may be used to meet future margin payments that a Trust Series is required to make on its Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts. Other Related Investments typically also involve collateral requirements that represent a small fraction of their notional amounts, so most of a Trust Series assets dedicated to Other Related Investments will also be held in Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents. Each of the Trust Series earns income from the Treasuries and/or cash equivalents that it purchases and on the cash it holds through the Custodian. USCF anticipates that the earned income will increase each Trust Series NAV. Each Trust Series applies the earned income to the acquisition of additional investments or uses it to pay its expenses. If a Trust Series reinvests the earned income, it makes investments that are consistent with its investment objective. What are the Trading Policies of the Trust Series? Liquidity Each Trust Series invests only in Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts that, in the opinion of USCF, are traded in sufficient volume to permit the ready taking and liquidation of positions in these financial interests and in OTC Applicable Interests that, in the opinion of USCF, may be readily liquidated with the original counterparty or through a third party assuming a Trust Series position. Spot Commodities While certain futures contracts can be physically settled, none of the Trust Series intends to take or make physical delivery. However, a Trust Series may from time to time trade in Other Related Investments based on the spot price of the applicable commodities comprising the Applicable Index. Leverage USCF endeavors to have the value of a Trust Series Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents, whether held by a Trust Series or posted as margin or other collateral, at all times approximate the aggregate market value of its obligations under its Applicable Interests and Other Related Investments. Commodity pools trading positions in Futures Contracts or Other Related Investments are typically required to be secured by the deposit of margin funds that represent only a small percentage of a futures contract (or other commodity interest s) entire market value. While USCF does not intend to leverage the assets of any Trust Series, it is not prohibited from doing so under the Trust Agreement.

Table of Contents 
 Although permitted to do so under the Trust Agreement, the Trust Series do not intend to leverage their assets by making investments beyond their potential ability to meet the potential margin and collateral obligations relating to such investments. Consistent with this, each Trust Series investment decisions will take into account the need for the relevant Trust Series to make permitted investments that also allow it to maintain adequate liquidity to meet its margin and collateral requirements and to avoid, to the extent reasonably possible, the Trust Series becoming leveraged, including by its holding of assets that have a high probability of having a value of less than zero. Borrowings Borrowings are not used by any Trust Series unless it is required to borrow money in the event of physical delivery, if it trades in cash commodities, or for short-term needs created by unexpected redemptions. None of the Trust Series plans to establish credit lines. OTC Derivatives (Including Spreads and Straddles) In addition to Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts, derivative contracts that are tied to various commodities are entered into outside of public exchanges. These OTC contracts are usually entered into between two parties in private contracts. Unlike most of the exchange-traded futures contracts or exchange-traded options on futures contracts, each party to such a contract bears the credit risk of the other party, i.e., the risk that the other party may not be able to perform its obligations under its contract. To reduce the credit risk that arises in connection with such contracts, each Trust Series may enter into an agreement with each counterparty based on the Master Agreement published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. ISDA that provides for the netting of its overall exposure to its counterparty. USCF assesses or reviews, as appropriate, the creditworthiness of each potential or existing counterparty to an OTC contract pursuant to guidelines approved by USCF s Board. Each Trust Series may enter into certain transactions where an OTC component is exchanged for a corresponding futures contract Exchange for Related Position or EFRP transactions). These EFRP transactions may expose a Trust Series to counterparty risk during the interim period between the execution of the OTC component and the exchange for a corresponding futures contract. Generally, the counterparty risk from the EFRP transaction will exist only on the day of execution. Each Trust Series may employ spreads or straddles in its trading to mitigate the differences in its investment portfolio and its goal of tracking the price of the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts. Each Trust Series would use a spread when it chooses to take simultaneous long and short positions in futures written on the same underlying asset, but with different delivery months. During the 12 month reporting period ended December 31, 2022, each Trust Series limited its derivatives activities to Futures Contracts. Pyramiding None of the Trust Series has, and will not employ, the technique, commonly known as pyramiding, in which the speculator uses unrealized profits on existing positions as variation margin for the purchase or sale of additional positions in the same or another commodity interest. Who are the Service Providers? Custodian, Registrar, Transfer Agent, and Administrator USCF engaged The Bank of New York Mellon BNY Mellon ), a New York corporation authorized to do a banking business BNY Mellon ), to provide each Trust Series and each of the Related Public Funds with certain custodial, administrative and accounting, and transfer agency services, pursuant to the following agreements with BNY Mellon dated as of March 20, 2020 (together, the BNY Mellon Agreements ), which were effective as of April 1, 2020: (i) a Custody Agreement; (ii) a Fund Administration and Accounting Agreement; and (iii) a Transfer Agency and Service Agreement. USCF pays the fees of BNY Mellon for its services under the BNY Mellon Agreements and such fees are determined by the parties from time to time.

 Brown Brothers Harriman and Co. BBH Co. previously served as the Administrator, Custodian, Transfer Agent and Fund Accounting Agent for each Trust Series and the Related Public Funds prior to BNY Mellon commencing such services on April 1, 2020. Certain fund accounting and fund administration services rendered by BBH Co. to each Trust Series and the Related Public Funds terminated on May 31, 2020 to allow for the transition to BNY Mellon. Each Trust Series also employs ALPS Distributors as its marketing agent USCF pays the Marketing Agent an annual fee. In no event may the aggregate compensation paid to the Marketing Agent and any affiliate of USCF for distribution-related services in connection with the offering of shares exceed ten percent (10 of the gross proceeds of the offering. Marketing Agent ALPS Distributors principal business address is 1290 Broadway, Suite 1100, Denver, CO 80203. ALPS Distributors is a broker-dealer registered with the SEC and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA and Securities Investor Protection Corporation. Futures Commission Merchants RBC Capital Markets, LLC On June 25, 2018, the Trust on behalf of USCI and CPER entered into a Futures and Cleared Derivatives Transactions Customer Account Agreement with RBC Capital Markets, LLC RBC Capital or RBC to serve as the futures commission merchant FCM for USCI and CPER. This agreement requires RBC Capital to provide services to USCI and CPER, in connection with the purchase and sale of Oil Futures Contracts and Other Oil-Related Investments for USCI and Futures Contracts and other Copper-Related Investments for CPER, in each case that may be purchased or sold by or through RBC Capital for USCI s or CPER s account, as applicable. For the period June 25, 2018 and after, USCI and CPER pay RBC Capital commissions for executing and clearing trades on their behalf. RBC Capital s primary address is 200 Vesey St., New York, NY 10281. As of June 25, 2019, RBC Capital became the primary futures clearing broker for USCI and CPER. RBC Capital is registered in the United States with FINRA as a broker-dealer and with the CFTC as an FCM. RBC Capital is a member of various U.S. futures and securities exchanges. RBC Capital is a large broker dealer subject to many different complex legal and regulatory requirements. As a result, certain of RBC Capital s regulators may from time to time conduct investigations, initiate enforcement proceedings and/or enter into settlements with RBC Capital with respect to issues raised in various investigations. RBC Capital complies fully with its regulators in all investigations being conducted and in all settlements it reaches. In addition, RBC Capital is and has been subject to a variety of civil legal claims in various jurisdictions, a variety of settlement agreements and a variety of orders, awards and judgments made against it by courts and tribunals, both in regard to such claims and investigations. RBC Capital complies fully with all settlements it reaches and all orders, awards and judgments made against it. RBC Capital has been named as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation including those described below, arising in connection with its activities. Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. RBC Capital is also involved, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding RBC Capital s business, including among other matters, accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. RBC Capital contests liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages or where investigations and proceedings are in the early stages, RBC Capital cannot predict the loss or range of loss, if any, related to such matters; how or if such matters will be resolved; when they will ultimately be resolved; or what the eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief, if any, might be. Subject to the foregoing, RBC Capital believes, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that the outcome of such pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of RBC Capital.

 On April 27, 2017, pursuant to an offer of settlement, a Panel of the Chicago Board of Trade Business Conduct Committee Panel found that RBC Capital engaged in EFRP transactions which failed to satisfy the Rules of the Chicago Board of Trade (the Chicago Board of Trade in one or more ways. Specifically, the Panel found that RBC Capital traders entered into EFRP trades in which RBC Capital accounts were on both sides of the transactions. While the purpose of the transactions was to transfer positions between the RBC Capital accounts, the Panel found that the manner in which the trades occurred violated the Chicago Board of Trade s prohibition on wash trades. The Panel found that RBC Capital thereby violated CBOT Rules 534 and (legacy) 538.B. and C. In accordance with the settlement offer, the Panel ordered RBC Capital to pay a 175,000 fine. On October 1, 2019, the CFTC issued an order filing and settling charges against RBC Capital for the above activity, as well as related charges. The order required that RBC Capital cease and desist from violating the applicable regulations, pay a 5 million civil monetary penalty, and comply with various conditions, including conditions regarding public statements and future cooperation with the Commission. Various regulators are conducting inquiries regarding potential violations of antitrust law by a number of banks and other entities, including RBC Capital, regarding foreign exchange trading. Beginning in 2015, putative class actions were brought against RBC Capital and/or Royal Bank of Canada, RBC Capital s indirect parent, in the U.S. and Canada. These actions were each brought against multiple foreign exchange dealers and allege, among other things, collusive behavior in global foreign exchange trading. In August 2018, the U.S. District Court entered a final order approving RBC Capital s settlement with class plaintiffs. In November 2018, certain institutional plaintiffs who had previously opted-out of participating in the settlement filed their own lawsuit in U.S. District Court. In May 2020, the U.S. District Court dismissed RBC Capital from the opt-out action, but granted the plaintiffs motion to amend the complaint. The Canadian class actions remain pending and RBC Capital has reached a settlement for an immaterial amount with respect to an action brought by a class of indirect purchasers. RBC Capital is awaiting the court s final approval of the settlement. In October 2020, RBC Capital and Royal Bank of Canada moved to dismiss the amended complaint. On July 28, 2021, the court dismissed Royal Bank of Canada from the case but denied the motion as to RBC. Based on the facts currently known, it is not possible at this time for management to predict the ultimate outcome of these collective matters or the timing of their ultimate resolution. On April 13, 2015, RBC Capital s affiliate, Royal Bank of Canada Trust Company (Bahamas) Limited RBC Bahamas ), was charged in France with complicity in tax fraud. RBC Bahamas believes that its actions did not violate French law and contested the charge in the French court. The trial of this matter has concluded and a verdict was delivered on January 12, 2017, acquitting the company and the other defendants and on June 29, 2018, the French appellate court affirmed the acquittals. On January 6, 2021, the French Supreme Court issued a judgment reversing the decision of the French Court of Appeal dated June 29, 2018 and sent the case back to the French Court of Appeal for rehearing and therefore the proceeding is currently awaiting a new trial with the French Court of Appeal. Royal Bank of Canada and other panel banks for the setting of the U.S. dollar London interbank offered rate LIBOR have been named as defendants in private lawsuits filed in the U.S. with respect to the setting of U.S. dollar LIBOR including a number of class action lawsuits which have been consolidated before the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. RBC Capital has also been named as a defendant in one of those lawsuits. The complaints in those private lawsuits assert claims under various U.S. laws, including U.S. antitrust laws, the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act, and state law. In addition to the LIBOR actions, in January 2019, a number of financial institutions, including RBC Capital, were named in a purported class action in New York alleging violations of the U.S. antitrust laws and common law principles of unjust enrichment in the setting of LIBOR after the Intercontinental Exchange took over administration of the benchmark interest rate from the British Bankers Association in 2014 (the ICE LIBOR action ). On March 26, 2020, the defendants motion to dismiss the ICE LIBOR action was granted. The plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of that ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on April 24, 2020 and, thereafter, sought to substitute named plaintiffs. The Second Circuit permitted substitution, but has not yet ruled on the merits of the appeal. In August 2020, Royal Bank of Canada and other financial institutions were named as defendants in a separate, individual (i.e., non-class) action filed in California alleging that the usage and setting of LIBOR constitutes per se collusive conduct. In November 2020 and May 2021, plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction with respect to the setting of ICE LIBOR; defendants opposed these motions and sought to transfer the matter to New York. On June 3, 2021, the court denied defendants motion to transfer. Defendants then moved to dismiss. Plaintiffs motions for a preliminary injunction and defendants motion to dismiss remain pending. Based on the facts currently known, it is not possible at this time to predict the ultimate outcome of these proceedings or the timing of their resolution. Please see RBC Capital s Form BD, which is available on the FINRA BrokerCheck program, for more details. RBC Capital will act only as clearing broker for a Trust Series and as such will be paid commissions for executing and clearing trades on behalf of a Trust Series. RBC Capital has not passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this annual report on Form 10-K. RBC Capital will not act in any supervisory capacity with respect to USCF or participate in the management of USCF or a Trust Series. RBC Capital is not affiliated with any Trust Series or USCF.

 Marex North America, LLC On August 23, 2021, the Trust, on behalf of USCI and CPER, entered into a Commodity Futures Customer Agreement with Marex North America, LLC MNA to serve as an additional FCM for USCI and CPER.

Commodity Trading Advisor Currently, USCF employs SummerHaven as a commodity trading advisor. SummerHaven provides advisory services to USCF with respect to the SDCI, the SCI and investment decisions for each of USCI and CPER. Its advisory services include, but are not limited to, general consultation regarding the calculation and maintenance of the SDCI and the SCI and the nature of the SDCI s and the SCI s component investments.

On May 18, 2021, without admitting or denying the CFTC s findings or conclusions, SummerHaven settled a CFTC administrative action arising out of certain trades executed in or around July of 2018 for the commodity futures portfolio of a third-party. Such trades were intended to move positions from one FCM to another. The CFTC alleged that the trades constituted wash trades, which are prohibited under the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations promulgated thereunder. The CFTC also alleged that the trades were non-competitive transactions and, therefore, violated CFTC regulation 1.38, and that their entry evidenced a supervisory failure. In connection with the settlement, SummerHaven has agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of 500,000 and to cease and desist from further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations, as charged. USCF has also entered into a licensing agreement with SummerHaven. Under this licensing agreement, SummerHaven has sub-licensed to each of USCI and CPER the use of certain names and marks, including the SDCI with respect to USCI and the SCI with respect to CPER, which SummerHaven licensed from SHIM, the owner of the SDCI and the SCI. For this license, USCF pays a fee to SummerHaven as set forth in the table below. SHIM s principal business address is 1266 East Main Street, Soundview Plaza, Fourth Floor, Stamford, CT 06902.

 Summary of Risk Factors Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the information in Item 1A. Risk Factors , including, but not limited to, the following risks: COVID-19 and other infectious disease outbreaks could negatively affect the valuation and performance of a Trust Series investments. The NAV of a Trust Series shares relates directly to the value of its assets invested in accordance with the Applicable Index and other assets held by a Trust Series and fluctuations in the prices of these assets could materially adversely affect an investment in a Trust Series shares. An investment in a Trust Series may provide little or no diversification benefits. Thus, in a declining market, a Trust Series may have no gains to offset losses from other investments, and an investor may suffer losses on an investment in a Trust Series while incurring losses with respect to other asset classes. Historical performance of a Trust Series and its Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts is not indicative of future performance. The market price at which investors buy or sell shares may be significantly more or less than NAV. Daily percentage changes in a Trust Series NAV may not correlate with daily percentage changes in the price of the Applicable Index. An investment in a Trust Series is not a proxy for investing in the commodities markets, and the daily percentage changes in the price of the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts, or the NAV of the Trust Series, may not correlate with daily percentage changes in the spot price of the physical commodities that underlie the Applicable Index. Daily percentage changes in the price of the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contract may not correlate with daily percentage changes in the spot price of the corresponding commodity. The price relationship between each Applicable Index at any point in time and the Futures Contracts that will become the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts on the next rebalancing date will vary and may impact both a Trust Series total return and the degree to which its total return tracks that of commodity price indices. Accountability levels, position limits, and daily price fluctuation limits set by the exchanges have the potential to cause tracking error, which could cause the price of shares to substantially vary from the Applicable Index. Risk mitigation measures imposed by the Trust Series FCMs have the potential to cause tracking error by limiting a Trust Series investments, including its ability to fully invest in the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contract and other Futures Contracts, which could cause the price of the Trust Series shares to substantially vary from the price of the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts. An investor s tax liability may exceed the amount of distributions, if any, on its shares. An investor s allocable share of taxable income or loss may differ from its economic income or loss on its shares. Items of income, gain, deduction, loss and credit with respect to shares could be reallocated, and for taxable periods beginning after December 31, 2017, the Trust Series could be liable for U.S. Federal income tax, if the U.S. Internal Revenue Service IRS does not accept the assumptions and conventions applied by the Trust Series in allocating those items, with potential adverse consequences for an investor. Each Trust Series could be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, which may substantially reduce the value of the shares. The Trust is organized as a Delaware statutory trust, but each Trust Series is taxed as a limited partnership in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement and applicable state law, and therefore, each Trust Series has a more complex tax treatment than traditional mutual funds. If a Trust Series is required to withhold tax with respect to any Non-U.S. shareholders, the cost of such withholding may be borne by all shareholders. The impact of U.S. tax reform on the Trust Series is uncertain. Each Trust Series will be subject to credit risk with respect to counterparties to OTC contracts entered into by the Trust on behalf of a Trust Series or held by special purpose or structured vehicles. Valuing OTC derivatives may be less certain that actively traded financial instruments.

In addition, as of July 8, 2011, CPER became responsible for paying the fees and expenses of the independent directors who also serve as audit committee members of CPER, the other Trust Series and the Related Public Funds. CPER shares the fees and expenses on a pro rata basis with the other Trust Series and with each Related Public Fund, as described above, based on the relative assets of each fund on a daily basis. These fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 were approximately 1,258,000 for the Trust Series and the Related Public Funds. CPER s portion of such fees and expenses was 80,390. Form of Shares Registered Form . Shares are issued in registered form in accordance with the Trust Agreement. The Administrator has been appointed registrar and transfer agent for the purpose of transferring shares in certificated form. The Administrator keeps a record of all shareholders and holders of the shares in certificated form in the registry. The beneficial interests in such shares are held in book-entry form through participants and/or accountholders in the Depository Trust Company DTC ). Book Entry. Individual certificates are not issued for the shares. Instead, shares are represented by one or more global certificates, which are deposited by the Administrator with DTC and registered in the name of Cede Co., as nominee for DTC. The global certificates

 evidence all of the shares outstanding at any time. Shareholders are limited to: (1) participants in DTC such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies DTC Participants ), (2) those who maintain, either directly or indirectly, a custodial relationship with a DTC Participant Indirect Participants ), and (3) those banks, brokers, dealers, trust companies and others who hold interests in the shares through DTC Participants or Indirect Participants, in each case who satisfy the requirements for transfers of shares. DTC Participants acting on behalf of investors holding shares through such participants accounts in DTC will follow the delivery practice applicable to securities eligible for DTC s Same-Day Funds Settlement System. Shares are credited to DTC Participants securities accounts following confirmation of receipt of payment. DTC . DTC has advised the Trust Series as follows: It is a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York and is a member of the Federal Reserve System, a clearing corporation within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a clearing agency registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC holds securities for DTC Participants and facilitates the clearance and settlement of transactions between DTC Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of DTC Participants. Inter-Series Limitation on Liability Because the Trust was established as a Delaware statutory trust, each Trust Series will be operated so that it will be liable only for obligations attributable to such series and will not be liable for obligations of any other series or affected by losses of any other series. If any creditor or shareholder of any particular series asserts against the series a valid claim with respect to its indebtedness or shares, the creditor or shareholder will only be able to obtain recovery from the assets of that series and not from the assets of any other series or the Trust generally. The assets of each Trust Series will include only those funds and other assets that are paid to, held by or distributed to the series on account of and for the benefit of that series, including, without limitation, amounts delivered to the Trust for the purchase of shares in a series. This limitation on liability is referred to as the Inter-Series Limitation on Liability. The Inter-Series Limitation on Liability is expressly provided for under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, which provides that if certain conditions (as set forth in Section 3804(a)) are met, then the debts of any particular series will be enforceable only against the assets of such series and not against the assets of any other series or the Trust generally. In furtherance of the Inter-Series Limitation on Liability, every party providing services to the Trust, any Trust Series or USCF on behalf of the Trust or any Trust Series, will acknowledge and consent in writing to the Inter-Series Limitation on Liability with respect to such party s claims. The existence of a Trustee should not be taken as an indication of any additional level of management or supervision over any Trust Series. To the greatest extent permissible under Delaware law, the Trustee acts in an entirely passive role, delegating all authority for the management and operation of each Trust Series and the Trust to USCF. The Trustee does not provide custodial services with respect to the assets of any Trust Series. Calculating Per Share NAV Each Trust Series per share NAV is calculated by: Taking the current market value of its total assets; Subtracting any liabilities; and Dividing that total by the total number of outstanding shares.

Table of Contents 
 The Administrator calculates the per share NAV of each Trust Series once each NYSE Arca trading day. The per share NAV for a normal trading day is released after 4:00 p.m. New York time. Trading during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca typically closes at 4:00 p.m. New York time. The Administrator uses the closing prices on the relevant Futures Exchanges of the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts (determined at the earlier of the close of such exchange or 2:30 p.m. New York time) for the Futures Contracts traded on the Futures Exchanges, but calculates or determines the value of all other investments of a Trust Series (including Other Related Investments) using market quotations, if available, or other information customarily used to determine the fair value of such investments as of the earlier of the close of the NYSE Arca or 4:00 p.m. New York time, in accordance with the Administrative Agency Agreement among the Administrator, the Trust Series and USCF. Other information customarily used in determining fair value includes information consisting of market data in the relevant market supplied by one or more third parties including, without limitation, relevant rates, prices, yields, yield curves, volatilities, spreads, correlations or other market data in the relevant market; or information of the types described above from internal sources if that information is of the same type used by a Trust Series in the regular course of its business for the valuation of similar transactions. The information may include costs of funding, to the extent costs of funding are not and would not be a component of the other information being utilized. Third parties supplying quotations or market data may include, without limitation, dealers in the relevant markets, end-users of the relevant product, information vendors, brokers and other sources of market information. In addition, in order to provide updated information relating to each Trust Series for use by investors and market professionals, the NYSE Arca calculates and disseminates throughout the core trading session on each trading day an updated indicative fund value. The indicative fund value is calculated by using the prior day s closing per share NAV of a Trust Series as a base and updating that value throughout the trading day to reflect changes in the most recently reported price level of the Applicable Index as reported by Bloomberg or other reporting service. The indicative fund value share basis disseminated during NYSE Arca core trading session hours should not be viewed as an actual real time update of the per share NAV, because the per share NAV is calculated only once at the end of each trading day based upon the relevant end of day values of each Trust Series investments. The indicative fund value is disseminated on a per share basis every 15 seconds during regular NYSE Arca core trading session hours of 9:30 a.m. New York time to 4:00 p.m. New York time. The normal trading hours of the Futures Exchanges vary, with some Futures Exchanges ending their trading hours before the close of the core trading session on the NYSE Arca (for example, the normal trading hours of the NYMEX are 9:00 a.m. New York time to 2:30 p.m. New York time). When a Trust Series holds Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts from Futures Exchanges with different trading hours than the NYSE Arca, there will be a gap in time at the beginning and/or the end of each day during which such Trust Series shares are traded on the NYSE Arca, but real-time Futures Exchange trading prices for Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts traded on such Futures Exchanges are not available. During such gaps in time the indicative fund value will be calculated based on the end of day price of such Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts from Futures Exchanges immediately preceding trading session. In addition, Other Related Investments and Treasuries held by a Trust Series will be valued by the Administrator, using rates and points received from client-approved third party vendors (such as Reuters and WM Company) and advisor quotes. These investments will not be included in the indicative fund value. The NYSE Arca disseminates the indicative fund value through the facilities of CTA/CQ High Speed Lines. In addition, the indicative fund value is published on the NYSE Arca s website and is available through on-line information services such as Bloomberg and Reuters. Dissemination of the indicative fund value provides additional information that is not otherwise available to the public and is useful to investors and market professionals in connection with the trading of the shares of a Trust Series on the NYSE Arca. Investors and market professionals are able throughout the trading day to compare the market price of a Trust Series and the indicative fund value. If the market price of shares of a Trust Series diverges significantly from the indicative fund value, market professionals will have an incentive to execute arbitrage trades. For example, if a Trust Series appears to be trading at a discount compared to the indicative fund value, a market professional could buy shares of such Trust Series on the NYSE Arca and sell short Futures Contracts. Such arbitrage trades can tighten the tracking between the market price of such Trust Series and the indicative fund value and thus can be beneficial to all market participants. In addition, other Futures Contracts, Other Related Investments and Treasuries held by a Trust Series are valued by the Administrator, using rates and points received from client-approved third party vendors (such as Reuters and WM Company) and advisor quotes. These investments are not included in the indicative value. The indicative fund value is based on the prior day s per share NAV and moves up and down solely according to changes in the price of the Applicable Index as reported on Bloomberg or another reporting service.

 The Trust reserves the right to adjust the share price of USCI or CPER in the future to maintain convenient trading ranges for investors. Any adjustments would be accomplished through stock splits or reverse stock splits. Such splits would decrease (in the case of a split) or increase (in the case of a reverse split) the proportionate NAV per share, but would have no effect on the net assets of the relevant Trust Series or the proportionate voting rights of shareholders. Creation and Redemption of Shares Each Trust Series creates and redeems shares from time to time, but only in one or more Creation Baskets or Redemption Baskets. The creation and redemption of baskets are only made in exchange for delivery to a Trust Series or the distribution by a Trust Series of the amount of Treasuries and/or cash represented by the baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which is equal to the combined NAV of the number of shares included in the baskets being created or redeemed determined as of 4:00 p.m. New York time on the day the order to create or redeem baskets is properly received. Authorized Participants are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem baskets. Authorized Participants must be (1) either registered broker-dealers or other securities market participants, such as banks and other financial institutions, that are not required to register as broker-dealers to engage in securities transactions as described below, and (2) DTC Participants. To become an Authorized Participant, a person must enter into an Authorized Participant Agreement with USCF on behalf of a Trust Series (each such agreement, an Authorized Participant Agreement ). The Authorized Participant Agreement provides the procedures for the creation and redemption of baskets and for the delivery of the Treasuries and/or cash required for such creations and redemptions. The Authorized Participant Agreement and the related procedures attached thereto may be amended by USCF, without the consent of any shareholder or Authorized Participant. Effective January 1, 2016, USCF permanently lowered the management fee to 0.80 (80 basis points) per annum of average daily total net assets for USCI and 0.65 (65 basis points) per annum of average daily total net assets for CPER. Authorized Participants pay each Trust Series a 350 transaction fee for each order placed to create one or more Creation Baskets or to redeem one or more Redemption Baskets. The transaction fee may be reduced, increased or otherwise changed by USCF. Authorized Participants who make deposits with a Trust Series in exchange for baskets receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either the Trust or USCF, and no such person will have any obligation or responsibility to the Trust or USCF to effect any sale or resale of shares. As of December 31, 2022, 10 Authorized Participants had entered into agreements with USCF on behalf of USCI. During the year ended December 31, 2022, USCI issued 43 Creation Baskets and redeemed 60 Redemption Baskets. As of December 31, 2022, 10 Authorized Participants had entered into agreements with USCF on behalf of CPER. During the year ended December 31, 2022, CPER issued 87 Creation Baskets and redeemed 108 Redemption Baskets. Certain Authorized Participants are expected to be capable of participating directly in the applicable physical commodity and the Applicable Interest markets. Some Authorized Participants or their affiliates may from time to time buy or sell applicable commodities or Applicable Interests and may profit in these instances. USCF believes that the size and operation of the applicable commodities market make it unlikely that Authorized Participants direct activities in the applicable commodities or securities markets will significantly affect the price of applicable commodities, Applicable Interests, or the price of shares. Each Authorized Participant is required to be registered as a broker-dealer under the Exchange Act and is a member in good standing with FINRA, or exempt from being or otherwise not required to be registered as a broker-dealer or a member of FINRA, and qualified to act as a broker or dealer in the states or other jurisdictions where the nature of its business so requires. Certain Authorized Participants may also be regulated under federal and state banking laws and regulations. Each Authorized Participant has its own set of rules and procedures, internal controls and information barriers as it determines is appropriate in light of its own regulatory regime. Under the Authorized Participant Agreement, USCF, and the Trust under limited circumstances, have agreed to indemnify the Authorized Participants against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and to contribute to the payments the Authorized Participants may be required to make in respect of those liabilities. The following description of the procedures for the creation and redemption of baskets is only a summary and an investor should refer to the relevant provisions of the Trust Agreement and the form of Authorized Participant Agreement for more detail, each of which is incorporated by reference into this annual report on Form 10-K.

Table of Contents 
 Creation Procedures On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Marketing Agent to create one or more baskets. For purposes of processing purchase and redemption orders, a business day means any day other than a day when the NYSE Arca, the New York Stock Exchange, or any of the Futures Exchanges upon which an Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contract is traded is closed for regular trading. Purchase orders must be placed by 10:30 a.m. New York time or the close of regular trading on the NYSE Arca, whichever is earlier. The day on which the Marketing Agent receives a valid purchase order is referred to as the purchase order date. By placing a purchase order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deposit Treasuries, cash or a combination of Treasuries and cash with the Trust, as described below. Prior to the delivery of baskets for a purchase order, the Authorized Participant must also have wired to the Custodian the non-refundable transaction fee due for the purchase order. Authorized Participants may not withdraw a Creation Basket request, except as otherwise set forth in the procedures in the Authorized Participant Agreement. The manner by which creations are made is dictated by the terms of the Authorized Participant Agreement. By placing a purchase order, an Authorized Participant agrees to (1) deposit Treasuries, cash, or a combination of Treasuries and cash with the Custodian, and (2) if required by USCF in its sole discretion, enter into or arrange for a block trade, an exchange for physical or exchange for swap, or any other OTC energy transaction (through itself or a designated acceptable broker) with a Trust Series for the purchase of a number and type of futures contracts at the closing settlement price for such contracts on the purchase order date. If an Authorized Participant fails to consummate (1) and (2), the order shall be cancelled. The number and types of contracts specified shall be determined by USCF, in its sole discretion, to meet a Trust Series investment objective and shall be purchased as a result of the Authorized Participant s purchase of shares. Determination of Required Deposits The total deposit required to create each Creation Basket Creation Basket Deposit is the amount of Treasuries and/or cash that is in the same proportion to the total assets of a Trust Series (net of estimated accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and other liabilities) on the purchase order date as the number of shares to be created under the purchase order is in proportion to the total number of shares outstanding on the purchase order date. USCF determines, directly in its sole discretion or in consultation with the Administrator, the requirements for Treasuries and cash, including the remaining maturities of the Treasuries and proportions of Treasuries and cash that may be included in deposits to create baskets. The Marketing Agent will publish an estimate of the Creation Basket Deposit requirements at the beginning of each business day. The amount of cash deposit required is the difference between the aggregate market value of the Treasuries required to be included in a Creation Basket Deposit as of 4:00 p.m. New York time on the date the order to purchase is properly received and the total required deposit. Delivery of Required Deposits An Authorized Participant who places a purchase order is responsible for transferring to a Trust Series account with the Custodian the required amount of Treasuries and/or cash by noon New York time on the second business day following the purchase order date. Upon receipt of the deposit amount, the Administrator directs DTC to credit the number of baskets ordered to the Authorized Participant s DTC account on the second business day following the purchase order dates. The expense and risk of delivery and ownership of Treasuries until such Treasuries have been received by the Custodian on behalf of each Trust Series shall be borne solely by the Authorized Participant. Because orders to purchase baskets must be placed by 10:30 a.m., New York time, but the total payment required to create a basket during the continuous offering period will not be determined until 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the date the purchase order is received, Authorized Participants will not know the total amount of the payment required to create a basket at the time they submit an irrevocable purchase order for the basket. A Trust Series NAV and the total amount of the payment required to create a basket could rise or fall substantially between the time an irrevocable purchase order is submitted and the time the amount of the purchase price in respect thereof is determined. Rejection of Purchase Orders USCF acting by itself or through the Marketing Agent shall have the absolute right, but shall have no obligation, to reject any purchase order or Creation Basket Deposit if USCF determines that: the purchase order or Creation Basket Deposit is not in proper form; it would not be in the best interest of the shareholders of a Trust Series;

 due to position limits or otherwise, investment alternatives that will enable a Trust Series to meet its investment objective are not available to such Trust Series at that time; the acceptance of the purchase order or the Creation Basket Deposit would have adverse tax consequences to a Trust Series or its shareholders; the acceptance or receipt of which would, in the opinion of counsel to USCF, be unlawful; or circumstances outside the control of USCF, the Marketing Agent or the Custodian make it, for all practical purposes, not feasible to process creations of Creation Baskets (including if USCF determines that the investments available to a Trust Series at that time will not enable it to meet its investment objective). 
 None of USCF, the Marketing Agent or the Custodian will be liable for the rejection of any purchase order or Creation Basket Deposit. Redemption Procedures The procedures by which an Authorized Participant can redeem one or more baskets mirror the procedures for the creation of baskets. On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Marketing Agent to redeem one or more baskets. Redemption orders must be placed by 10:30 a.m. New York time or the close of regular trading on the NYSE Arca, whichever is earlier. A redemption order so received will be effective on the date it is received in satisfactory form by the Marketing Agent Redemption Order Date ). The redemption procedures allow Authorized Participants to redeem baskets and do not entitle an individual shareholder to redeem any shares in an amount less than a Redemption Basket, or to redeem baskets other than through an Authorized Participant. By placing a redemption order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deliver the baskets to be redeemed through DTC s book-entry system to a Trust Series, as described below. Prior to the delivery of the redemption distribution for a redemption order, the Authorized Participant must also have wired to USCF s account at the Custodian the non-refundable transaction fee due for the redemption order. An Authorized Participant may not withdraw a redemption order, except as otherwise set forth in the procedures in the Authorized Participant Agreement. The manner by which redemptions are made is dictated by the terms of the Authorized Participant Agreement. By placing a redemption order, an Authorized Participant agrees to (1) deliver the Redemption Basket to be redeemed through DTC s book-entry system to a Trust Series account with the Custodian not later than 3:00 p.m. New York time on the second business day following the effective date of the redemption order Redemption Distribution Date ), and (2) if required by USCF in its sole discretion, enter into or arrange for a block trade, an exchange for physical or exchange for swap, or any other OTC transaction (through itself or a designated acceptable broker) with a Trust Series for the sale of a number and type of futures contracts at the closing settlement price for such contracts on the Redemption Order Date. If an Authorized Participant fails to consummate (1) and (2) above, the order shall be cancelled. The number and type of contracts specified shall be determined by USCF, in its sole discretion, to meet a Trust Series investment objective and shall be sold as a result of the Authorized Participant s sale of shares. Determination of Redemption Distribution The redemption distribution from a Trust Series consists of a transfer to the redeeming Authorized Participant of an amount of Treasuries and/or cash that is in the same proportion to the total assets of such Trust Series (net of estimated accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and other liabilities) on the date the order to redeem is properly received as the number of shares to be redeemed under the redemption order is in proportion to the total number of shares outstanding on the date the order is received. USCF, directly or in consultation with the Administrator, determines the requirements for Treasuries and cash, including the remaining maturities of the Treasuries and proportions of Treasuries and cash that may be included in distributions to redeem baskets. The Marketing Agent will publish an estimate of the redemption distribution per basket as of the beginning of each business day.

Table of Contents 
 Delivery of Redemption Distribution The redemption distribution due from a Trust Series will be delivered to the Authorized Participant on the second business day following the redemption order date if, by 3:00 p.m., New York time on such second business day, such Trust Series DTC account has been credited with the baskets to be redeemed. If such Trust Series DTC account has not been credited with all of the baskets to be redeemed by such time, the redemption distribution will be delivered to the extent of whole baskets received. Any remainder of the redemption distribution will be delivered on the next business day to the extent of remaining whole baskets received if USCF receives the fee applicable to the extension of the redemption distribution date which USCF may, from time to time, determine and the remaining baskets to be redeemed are credited to a Trust Series DTC account by 3:00 p.m., New York time on such next business day. Any further outstanding amount of the redemption order shall be cancelled. Pursuant to information from USCF, the Custodian will also be authorized to deliver the redemption distribution notwithstanding that the baskets to be redeemed are not credited to a Trust Series DTC account by 3:00 p.m., New York time on the second business day following the redemption order date if the Authorized Participant has collateralized its obligation to deliver the baskets through DTC s book-entry system on such terms as USCF may from time to time determine. Suspension or Rejection of Redemption Orders USCF may, in its discretion, suspend the right of redemption, or postpone the redemption settlement date, (1) for any period during which the NYSE Arca or any of the Futures Exchanges upon which an Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contract is traded is closed other than customary weekend or holiday closings, or trading on the NYSE Arca or the Futures Exchanges is suspended or restricted, (2) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which delivery, disposal or evaluation of Treasuries is not reasonably practicable, or (3) for such other period as USCF determines to be necessary for the protection of the shareholders. For example, USCF may determine that it is necessary to suspend redemptions to allow for the orderly liquidation of a Trust Series assets at an appropriate value to fund a redemption. If USCF has difficulty liquidating a Trust Series positions, e.g., because of a market disruption event in the futures markets or an unanticipated delay in the liquidation of a position in an over the counter contract, it may be appropriate to suspend redemptions until such time as such circumstances are rectified. None of USCF, the Marketing Agent, the Administrator or the Custodian will be liable to any person or in any way for any loss or damages that may result from any such suspension or postponement. Redemption orders must be made in whole baskets. USCF will reject a redemption order if the order is not in proper form, as described in the Authorized Participant Agreement, or the fulfillment of the order in the opinion of its counsel may be illegal under applicable laws and regulations, or if circumstances outside the control of USCF, the Marketing Agent or the Custodian make it for all practical purposes not feasible for the shares to be delivered under the Redemption Order. USCF may also reject a redemption order if the number of shares being redeemed would reduce the remaining outstanding shares to 100,000 shares (i.e., two baskets) or less, unless USCF has reason to believe that the placer of the redemption order does in fact possess all the outstanding shares and can deliver them. Creation and Redemption Transaction Fee To compensate each Trust Series for its expenses in connection with the creation and redemption of baskets, an Authorized Participant is required to pay a transaction fee to each Trust Series per order to create or redeem baskets, regardless of the number of baskets in such order. Authorized Participants pay each Trust Series a 350 transaction fee for each order placed to create one or more Creation Baskets or to redeem one or more Redemption Baskets. The transaction fee may be reduced, increased or otherwise changed by USCF. USCF shall notify DTC of any change in the transaction fee and will not implement any increase in the fee for the redemption of baskets until thirty (30) days after the date of the notice. Tax Responsibility Authorized Participants are responsible for any transfer tax, sales or use tax, stamp tax, recording tax, value added tax or similar tax or governmental charge applicable to the creation or redemption of baskets, regardless of whether or not such tax or charge is imposed directly on the Authorized Participant, and agree to indemnify USCF and each Trust Series if they are required by law to pay any such tax, together with any applicable penalties, additions to tax and interest thereon.

 Secondary Market Transactions As noted, each Trust Series creates and redeems shares from time to time, but only in one or more Creation Baskets or Redemption Baskets. The creation and redemption of baskets are only made in exchange for delivery to a Trust Series or the distribution by a Trust Series of the amount of Treasuries and/or cash equal to the aggregate NAV of the number of shares included in the baskets being created or redeemed determined on the day the order to create or redeem baskets is properly received. As discussed above, Authorized Participants are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem baskets. Authorized Participants must be registered broker-dealers or other securities market participants, such as banks and other financial institutions that are not required to register as broker-dealers to engage in securities transactions. An Authorized Participant is under no obligation to create or redeem baskets, and an Authorized Participant is under no obligation to offer to the public shares of any baskets it does create. Authorized Participants that do offer to the public shares from the baskets they create will do so at per-share offering prices that are expected to reflect, among other factors, the trading price of the shares on the NYSE Arca, the NAV of a Trust Series shares at the time the Authorized Participant purchased the Creation Baskets, the per share NAV of the shares at the time of the offer of the shares to the public, the supply of and demand for shares at the time of sale, and the liquidity of the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contract market and the market for Other Related Investments. Baskets are generally redeemed when the price per share is at a discount to the per share NAV. Shares initially comprising the same basket but offered by Authorized Participants to the public at different times may have different offering prices. An order for one or more baskets may be placed by an Authorized Participant on behalf of multiple clients. Authorized Participants who make deposits with a Trust Series in exchange for baskets receive no fees, commissions or other forms of compensation or inducement of any kind from either a Trust Series or USCF and no such person has any obligation or responsibility to USCF or a Trust Series to effect any sale or resale of shares. Shares trade in the secondary market on the NYSE Arca. Shares may trade in the secondary market at prices that are lower or higher relative to their per share NAV. The amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the per share NAV may be influenced by various factors, including the number of investors who seek to purchase or sell shares in the secondary market and the liquidity of the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contract market and the market for Other Related Investments. While the shares trade during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca until 4:00 p.m. New York time, liquidity in the market for Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts and Other Related Investments may be reduced after the close of the Futures Exchanges upon which the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts are traded. As a result, during this time, trading spreads, and the resulting premium or discount, on the shares may widen. Who is the Trustee? Wilmington Trust, N.A. (the Trustee serves as the Trust s corporate trustee as required under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act DSTA ). USCF pays the Trustee 3,000 annually for its services to the Trust. The Trustee is the sole trustee of the Trust. The rights and duties of the Trustee and USCF with respect to the offering of the shares and management of the Trust Series and the shareholders are governed by the provisions of the DSTA and by the Trust Agreement. The Trustee will accept service of legal process on the Trust in the State of Delaware and will make certain filings under the DSTA. The Trustee does not owe any other duties to the Trust, USCF or the shareholders of the Trust Series. The Trustee s principal offices are located at 1100 North Market Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19890. The Trustee is unaffiliated with USCF. The Trustee is permitted to resign upon at least sixty (60) days notice to the Trust, provided, that any such resignation will not be effective until a successor Trustee is appointed by USCF. USCF has the discretion to replace the Trustee. Only the assets of the Trust and USCF are subject to issuer liability under the federal securities laws for the information contained in this prospectus and under federal securities laws with respect to the issuance and sale of the shares. Under such laws, neither the Trustee, either in its capacity as Trustee or in its individual capacity, nor any director, officer or controlling person of the Trustee is, or has any liability as, the issuer or a director, officer or controlling person of the issuer of the shares. The Trustee s liability in connection with the issuance and sale of the shares is limited solely to the express obligations of the Trustee set forth in the Trust Agreement.

 Under the Trust Agreement, USCF has exclusive management and control of all aspects of the Trust s business. The Trustee has no duty or liability to supervise the performance of USCF, nor will the Trustee have any liability for the acts or omissions of USCF. The shareholders have no voice in the day to day management of the business and operations of the Trust Series and the Trust, other than certain limited voting rights as set forth in the Trust Agreement. In the course of its management of the business and affairs of the Trust Series and the Trust, USCF may, in its sole and absolute discretion, appoint an affiliate or affiliates of USCF as additional sponsors and retain such persons, including affiliates of USCF, as it deems necessary to effectuate and carry out the purposes, business and objectives of the Trust. Because the Trustee has no authority over the Trust s operations, the Trustee itself is not registered in any capacity with the CFTC. Use of Proceeds USCF will cause the Trust Series to transfer the proceeds of the sale of Creation Baskets to the Custodian or another custodian for use in trading activities. USCF will invest each Trust Series assets in Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts and Other Related Investments, short-term Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents. When a Trust Series purchases Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts and certain Other Related Investments that are exchange-traded, the Trust Series is required to deposit with the FCM on behalf of the exchange a portion of the value of the contract or other interest as security to ensure payment for the obligation under the Applicable Interests at maturity. This deposit is known as initial margin. Counterparties in transactions in OTC Applicable Interests generally impose similar collateral requirements on a Trust Series. USCF invests a Trust Series assets that remain after margin and collateral is posted in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents. Subject to these margin and collateral requirements, USCF has sole authority to determine the percentage of assets that will be: held as margin or collateral with FCMs or other custodians; used for other investments; and held in bank accounts to pay current obligations and as reserves. 
 Approximately 5 to 30 of a Trust Series assets have normally been committed as margin for commodity futures contracts. However, from time to time, the percentage of assets committed as margin may be substantially more, or less, than such range. An FCM, counterparty, government agency or commodity exchange could increase margin or collateral requirements applicable to each Trust Series to hold trading positions at any time. Ongoing margin and collateral payments will generally be required for both exchange-traded and OTC Applicable Interests based on changes in the value of the Applicable Interests. Furthermore, ongoing collateral requirements with respect to OTC Applicable Interests are negotiated by the parties, and may be affected by overall market volatility, volatility of the underlying commodity or index, the ability of the counterparty to hedge its exposure under the Applicable Interest, and each party s creditworthiness. Margin is merely a security deposit and has no bearing on the profit or loss potential for any positions held. In light of the differing requirements for initial payments under exchange-traded and OTC Applicable Interests and the fluctuating nature of ongoing margin and collateral payments, it is not possible to estimate what portion of a Trust Series assets will be posted as margin or collateral at any given time. The Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents held by a Trust Series constitute reserves that are available to meet ongoing margin and collateral requirements. All interest income is used for a Trust Series benefit. Each Trust Series assets posted as margin for Futures Contracts will be held in segregated accounts pursuant to CEA and CFTC regulations. Collateral posted in connection with OTC contracts held with a Trust Series FCM will be similarly segregated and if held with other counterparties will be segregated pursuant to a contract between such Trust Series and its counterparties. If a Trust Series enters into a swap agreement, it must post both collateral and independent amounts to its swap counterparty(ies). The amount of collateral The Trust Series posts changes according to the amounts owed by the Trust Series to its counterparty on a given swap transaction, while independent amounts are fixed amounts posted by the Trust Series at the start of a swap transaction. Collateral and independent amounts posted to swap counterparties will be held by a third party custodian.

 The Commodity Interest Markets General The CEA governs the regulation of commodity interest transactions, markets and intermediaries. The CEA provides for varying degrees of regulation of commodity interest transactions depending upon: (1) the type of instrument being traded (e.g., contracts for future delivery, forwards, options, swaps or spot contracts), (2) the type of commodity underlying the instrument (distinctions are made between instruments based on agricultural commodities, energy and metals commodities and financial commodities), (3) the nature of the parties to the transaction (e.g., retail or eligible contract participant), (4) whether the transaction is entered into on a principal-to-principal or intermediated basis, (5) the type of market on which the transaction occurs, and (6) whether the transaction is subject to clearing through a clearing organization. The offer and sale of shares of each Trust Series as well as shares of each Related Public Fund, is registered under the Securities Act. Each Trust Series and the Related Public Funds are subject to the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder as administered by the SEC. Firms participation in the distribution of shares is regulated as described above, as well as by the self-regulatory association, FINRA. Futures Contracts A futures contract is a standardized contract traded on, or subject to the rules of, an exchange that calls for the future delivery of a specified quantity and type of a commodity at a specified time and place. Futures contracts are traded on a wide variety of commodities, including agricultural products, bonds, stock indices, interest rates, currencies, energy and metals. The size and terms of futures contracts on a particular commodity are identical and are not subject to any negotiation, other than with respect to price and the number of contracts traded between the buyer and seller. The contractual obligations of a buyer or seller may generally be satisfied by taking or making physical delivery of the underlying commodity or by making an offsetting sale or purchase of an identical futures contract on the same or linked exchange before the designated date of delivery. The difference between the price at which the futures contract is purchased or sold and the price paid for the offsetting sale or purchase, after allowance for brokerage commissions, constitutes the profit or loss to the trader. Some futures contracts, such as stock index contracts, settle in cash (reflecting the difference between the contract purchase/sale price and the contract settlement price) rather than by delivery of the underlying commodity. In market terminology, a trader who purchases a futures contract is long in the market and a trader who sells a futures contract is short in the market. Before a trader closes out his long or short position by an offsetting sale or purchase, his outstanding contracts are known as open trades or open positions. The aggregate amount of open positions held by traders in a particular contract is referred to as the open interest in such contract. Forward Contracts A forward contract is a contractual obligation to purchase or sell a specified quantity of a commodity at or before a specified date in the future at a specified price and, therefore, is economically similar to a futures contract. Unlike futures contracts, however, forward contracts are typically traded in the OTC markets and are not standardized contracts. Forward contracts for a given commodity are generally available for various amounts and maturities and are subject to individual negotiation between the parties involved. Moreover, generally there is no direct means of offsetting or closing out a forward contract by taking an offsetting position as one would a futures contract on a U.S. exchange. If a trader desires to close out a forward contract position, he generally will establish an opposite position in the contract but will settle and recognize the profit or loss on both positions simultaneously on the delivery date. Thus, unlike in the futures contract market where a trader who has offset positions will recognize profit or loss immediately, in the forward market a trader with a position that has been offset at a profit will generally not receive such profit until the delivery date, and likewise a trader with a position that has been offset at a loss will generally not have to pay money until the delivery date. Nevertheless, in some instances forward contracts now provide a right of offset or cash settlement as an alternative to making or taking delivery of the underlying commodity. In general, the CFTC does not regulate the interbank and forward foreign currency markets with respect to transactions in contracts between certain sophisticated counterparties such as a Trust Series or between certain regulated institutions and retail investors. Although U.S. banks are regulated in various ways by the Federal Reserve Board, the Comptroller of the Currency and other U.S. federal and state banking officials, banking authorities do not regulate the forward markets to the same extent that the swap markets are regulated by the CFTC and SEC.

 Regulation exempts both foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards from the definition of swap and, by extension, certain regulatory requirements applicable to swaps (such as clearing and margin). The exemption does not extend to other foreign exchange derivatives, such as foreign exchange options, currency swaps, and non-deliverable forwards. While the U.S. government does not currently impose any restrictions on the movements of currencies, it could choose to do so. The imposition or relaxation of exchange controls in various jurisdictions could significantly affect the market for that and other jurisdictions currencies. Trading in the interbank market also exposes the Trust Series to a risk of default since failure of a bank with which a Trust Series had entered into a forward contract would likely result in a default and thus possibly substantial losses to the Trust Series. Options on Futures Contracts Options on futures contracts are standardized contracts traded on an exchange. An option on a futures contract gives the buyer of the option the right, but not the obligation, to take a position at a specified price (the striking, strike, or exercise price) in the underlying futures contract or underlying interest. The buyer of a call option acquires the right, but not the obligation, to purchase or take a long position in the underlying interest, and the buyer of a put option acquires the right, but not the obligation, to sell or take a short position in the underlying interest. The seller, or writer, of an option is obligated to take a position in the underlying interest at a specified price opposite to the option buyer if the option is exercised. The seller of a call option must stand ready to take a short position in the underlying interest at the strike price if the buyer should exercise the option. The seller of a put option, on the other hand, must stand ready to take a long position in the underlying interest at the strike price. A call option is said to be in-the-money if the strike price is below current market levels and out-of-the-money if the strike price is above current market levels. Conversely, a put option is said to be in-the-money if the strike price is above the current market levels and out-of-the-money if the strike price is below current market levels. Options have limited life spans, usually tied to the delivery or settlement date of the underlying interest. Some options, however, expire significantly in advance of such date. The purchase price of an option is referred to as its premium, which consists of its intrinsic value (which is related to the underlying market value) plus its time value. As an option nears its expiration date, the time value shrinks and the market and intrinsic values move into parity. An option that is out-of-the-money and not offset by the time it expires becomes worthless. On certain exchanges, in-the-money options are automatically exercised on their expiration date, but on others unexercised options simply become worthless after their expiration date. Regardless of how much the market swings, the most an option buyer can lose is the option premium. The option buyer deposits his premium with his broker, and the money goes to the option seller. Option sellers, on the other hand, face risks similar to participants in the futures markets. For example, since the seller of a call option is assigned a short futures position if the option is exercised, his risk is the same as someone who initially sold a futures contract. Because no one can predict exactly how the market will move, the option seller typically posts margin to demonstrate his ability to meet any potential contractual obligations. Options on Forward Contracts or Commodities Options on forward contracts or commodities operate in a manner similar to options on futures contracts. An option on a forward contract or commodity gives the buyer of the option the right, but not the obligation, to take a position at a specified price in the underlying forward contract or commodity. However, unlike options on futures contracts, options on forward contracts or on commodities are individually negotiated contracts between counterparties and are typically traded in the OTC market. Therefore, options on forward contracts and physical commodities possess many of the same characteristics of forward contracts with respect to offsetting positions and credit risk that are described above. Swap Contracts Swap transactions generally involve contracts between two parties to exchange a stream of payments computed by reference to a notional amount and the price of the asset that is the subject of the swap. Swap contracts are principally traded off-exchange, although certain swap contracts are also being traded in electronic trading facilities and cleared through clearing organizations.

Table of Contents 
 Swaps are usually entered into on a net basis, that is, the two payment streams are netted out in a cash settlement on the payment date or dates specified in the agreement, with the parties receiving or paying, as the case may be, only the net amount of the two payments. Swaps do not generally involve the delivery of underlying assets or principal. Accordingly, the risk of loss with respect to swaps is generally limited to the net amount of payments that the party is contractually obligated to make. In some swap transactions one or both parties may require collateral deposits from the counterparty to support that counterparty s obligation under the swap agreement. If the counterparty to such a swap defaults, the risk of loss consists of the net amount of payments that the party is contractually entitled to receive less any collateral deposits it is holding. Some swap transactions are cleared through central counterparties. Clearing refers to the process by which a trade that is bilaterally executed by two parties is submitted to a central clearing counterparty, via a clearing member (i.e., an FCM), and replaced by two mirror swaps, with the central clearing counterparty becoming the counterparty to both of the initial parties to the swap. These transactions, known as cleared swaps, involve two counterparties first agreeing to the terms of a swap transaction, then submitting the transaction to a clearing house that acts as the central counterparty. Once accepted by the clearing house, the original swap transaction is terminated and replaced by two mirror trades, for which the central clearing counterparty becomes the counterparty to each of the original parties based upon the trade terms determined in the original transaction. In this manner each individual swap counterparty reduces its risk of loss due to counterparty nonperformance because the clearing house acts as the counterparty to each transaction. Commodities Regulation Futures exchanges in the United States are subject to varying degrees of regulation under the CEA depending on whether such exchange is a designated contract market, exempt board of trade or electronic trading facility. Clearing organizations are also subject to the CEA and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder and administered by the CFTC. The CFTC is the governmental agency charged with responsibility for regulation of futures exchanges and commodity interest trading. The CFTC s function is to implement the CEA s objectives of preventing price manipulation and excessive speculation and promoting orderly and efficient commodity interest markets. In addition, the various exchanges and clearing organizations themselves exercise regulatory and supervisory authority over their member firms. The CFTC also regulates the activities of commodity trading advisors and commodity pool operators and the CFTC has adopted regulations with respect to certain of such persons activities. Pursuant to its authority, the CFTC requires a CPO, such as USCF, to keep accurate, current and orderly records with respect to each pool it operates. The CFTC may suspend, modify or terminate the registration of any registrant for failure to comply with CFTC rules or regulations. Suspension, restriction or termination of USCF s registration as a CPO would prevent it, until such time (if any) as such registration were to be reinstated, from managing, and might result in the termination of, the Trust Series or the Related Public Funds. Under certain circumstances, the CEA grants shareholders the right to institute a reparations proceeding before the CFTC against USCF (as a registered commodity pool operator), as well as those of their respective employees who are required to be registered under the CEA. Shareholders may also be able to maintain a private right of action for certain violations of the CEA. Pursuant to authority in the CEA, the NFA has been formed and registered with the CFTC as a registered futures association. The NFA is the only self-regulatory association for commodities professionals other than the exchanges. As such, the NFA promulgates rules governing the conduct of commodity professionals and disciplines those professionals that do not comply with such standards. The CFTC has delegated to the NFA responsibility for the registration of commodity pool operators. USCF is a member of the NFA. As a member of the NFA, USCF is subject to NFA standards relating to fair trade practices, financial condition, and consumer protection. The CEA requires all FCMs, i.e., USCI s or CPER s clearing brokers, to meet and maintain specified fitness and financial requirements, to segregate customer funds from proprietary funds and account separately for all customers funds and positions, and to maintain specified books and records open to inspection by the staff of the CFTC. The CFTC has similar authority over introducing brokers, or persons who solicit or accept orders for commodity interest trades but who do not accept margin deposits for the execution of trades. The CEA authorizes the CFTC to regulate trading by FCMs and by their officers and directors, permits the CFTC to require action by exchanges in the event of market emergencies, and establishes an administrative procedure under which customers may institute complaints for damages arising from alleged violations of the CEA. The regulations of the CFTC and the NFA prohibit any representation by a person registered with the CFTC or by any member of the NFA, that registration with the CFTC, or membership in the NFA, in any respect indicates that the CFTC or the NFA, as the case may be, has approved or endorsed that person or that person s trading program or objectives. The registrations and memberships of the parties described in this summary must not be considered as constituting any such approval or endorsement. Likewise, no futures exchange has given or will give any similar approval or endorsement.

 CFTC regulations require enhanced customer protections, risk management programs, internal monitoring and controls, capital and liquidity standards, customer disclosures and auditing and examination programs for FCMs. These regulations are intended to afford greater assurances to market participants that customer segregated funds and secured amounts are protected, customers are provided with appropriate notice of the risks of futures trading and of the FCMs with which they may choose to do business, FCMs are monitoring and managing risks in a robust manner, the capital and liquidity of FCMs are strengthened to safeguard the continued operations, and the auditing and examination programs of the CFTC and the self-regulatory organizations are monitoring the activities of FCMs in a thorough manner. Each Trust Series investors are afforded prescribed rights for reparations under the CEA against USCF (as a registered commodity pool operator), as well as its respective employees who are required to be registered under the CEA. Investors may also be able to maintain a private right of action for violations of the CEA. The CFTC has adopted rules implementing the reparation provisions of the CEA, which provide that any person may file a complaint for a reparations award with the CFTC for violation of the CEA against a floor broker or an FCM, introducing broker, commodity trading advisor, CPO, and their respective associated persons. The regulation of commodity interest trading in the United States and other countries is an evolving area of the law. Below are discussed several key regulatory items that are relevant to the Funds. The various statements made in this summary are subject to modification by legislative action and changes in the rules and regulations of the CFTC, the NFA, the futures exchanges, clearing organizations and other regulatory bodies. In addition, with regard to any other rules that the CFTC or SEC may adopt in the future, the effect of any such regulatory changes on the Trust and each Trust Series is impossible to predict, but it could be substantial and adverse. Futures Contracts and Position Limits On October 15, 2020, the CFTC approved the Position Limits Rule. The Position Limits Rule establishes federal position limits for 25 core referenced futures contracts (comprised of agricultural, energy and metals futures contracts), futures and options linked to the core referenced futures contracts, and swaps that are economically equivalent to the core referenced futures contracts. Certain Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts will be subject to position limits under the Position Limits Rule, and the Trust Series trading does not qualify for an exemption therefrom. Accordingly, the Position Limits Rule could negatively impact the ability of the Trust Series to meet their investment objectives by inhibiting USCF s ability to effectively invest the proceeds from sales of Creation Baskets of the Trust Series in particular amounts and types of its permitted investments. Margin Requirements Futures and Cleared Swaps Original or initial margin is the minimum amount of funds that must be deposited by a commodity interest trader with the trader s broker to initiate and maintain an open position in futures contracts. Maintenance margin is the amount (generally less than the original margin) to which a trader s account may decline before he must deliver additional margin. A margin deposit is like a cash performance bond. It helps assure the trader s performance of the futures contracts that he or she purchases or sells. Futures contracts are customarily bought and sold on initial margin that represents a very small percentage (ranging upward from 5 of the aggregate purchase or sales price of the contract. Because of such low margin requirements, price fluctuations occurring in the futures markets may create profits and losses that, in relation to the amount invested, are greater than are customary in other forms of investment or speculation. As discussed below, adverse price changes in the futures contract may result in margin requirements that greatly exceed the initial margin. In addition, the amount of margin required in connection with a particular futures contract is set from time to time by the exchange on which the contract is traded and may be modified from time to time by the exchange during the term of the contract. Brokerage firms, such as the Trust Series clearing brokers, carrying accounts for traders in commodity interest contracts may not accept lower, and generally require higher, amounts of margin as a matter of policy to further protect themselves. The clearing brokers require a Trust Series to make margin deposits equal to exchange minimum levels for all commodity interest contracts. This requirement may be altered from time to time in the clearing brokers discretion. Margin requirements are computed each day by the relevant clearing organization and a trader s clearing broker. When the market value of a particular open commodity interest position changes to a point where the margin on deposit does not satisfy maintenance margin requirements, a margin call is made by the broker. With respect to a Trust Series trading, a Trust Series (and not its investors) is subject to margin calls.

 Finally, many major U.S. exchanges have passed certain cross margining arrangements involving procedures pursuant to which the futures and options positions held in an account would, in the case of some accounts, be aggregated and margin requirements would be assessed on a portfolio basis, measuring the total risk of the combined positions. Options When a trader purchases an option, there is no margin requirement; however, the option premium must be paid in full. When a trader sells an option, on the other hand, he or she may be required to deposit margin in an amount determined by the margin requirements established for the underlying interest and, in addition, an amount substantially equal to the current premium for the option. The margin requirements imposed on the selling of options, although adjusted to reflect the probability that out-of-the-money options will not be exercised, can in fact be higher than those imposed in dealing in the futures markets directly. Complicated margin requirements apply to spreads and conversions, which are complex trading strategies in which a trader acquires a mixture of options positions and positions in the underlying interest. OTC Swaps Rules put in place by U.S. federal banking regulators, the CFTC and the SEC require the daily exchange of variation margin and initial margin for swaps between swap dealers, major swap participants, security-based swap dealers, and major security-based swap participants Swap Entities and swaps between Swap Entities and their counterparties that are financial end-users (such rules, the Margin Rules ). The Margin Rules require Swap Entities to exchange variation margin with all of their counterparties who are financial end-users. The minimum variation margin amount is the daily mark-to-market change in the value of the swap, taking into account the amount of variation margin previously posted or collected. Swap Entities are required to exchange initial margin with their financial end-users who have material swaps exposure (i.e., an average daily aggregate notional of 8 billion or more in non-cleared swaps calculated in accordance with the Margin Rules). The Margin Rules specify the types of collateral that may be posted or collected as initial margin or variation margin (generally cash, certain government, government-sponsored enterprise securities, certain liquid debt, certain equity securities, certain eligible publicly traded debt, and gold) and sets forth haircuts for certain collateral asset classes. No Trust Series is a Swap Entity under the Margin Rules, but each is a financial end-user. Accordingly, each Trust Series will be subject to the variation margin requirements of the Margin Rules for any swaps that it enters into. However, no Trust Series has material swaps exposure and, accordingly, no Trust Series will be subject to the initial margin requirements of the Margin Rules. Mandatory Trading and Clearing of Swaps CFTC regulations require that certain swap transactions be executed on organized exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through regulated clearing organizations derivative clearing organizations DCOs )), if the CFTC mandates the central clearing of a particular class of swap and such swap is made available to trade on a swap execution facility. Currently, swap dealers, major swap participants, commodity pools, certain private funds and entities predominantly engaged in activities that are financial in nature are required to execute on a swap execution facility, and clear, certain interest rate swaps and index-based credit default swaps. As a result, if a Trust Series enters into an interest rate or index-based credit default swap that is subject to these requirements, such swap will be required to be executed on a swap execution facility and centrally cleared. Mandatory clearing and made available to trade determinations with respect to additional types of swaps may be issued in the future, and, when finalized, could require each Trust Series to electronically execute and centrally clear certain OTC instruments presently entered into and settled on a bi-lateral basis. If a swap is required to be cleared, initial and variation margin requirements are set by the relevant clearing organization, subject to certain regulatory requirements and guidelines. Additional margin may be required and held by a Trust Series FCM. Other Requirements for Swaps Swaps that are not required to be cleared and executed on a SEF but that are executed bilaterally are also subject to various requirements pursuant to CFTC regulations, including, among other things, reporting and recordkeeping requirements and, depending on the status of the counterparties, trading documentation requirements and dispute resolution requirements. Derivatives Regulations in Non-U.S. Jurisdictions In addition to U.S. laws and regulations, a Trust Series may be subject to non-U.S. derivatives laws and regulations if it engages in futures and/or swap transactions with non-U.S. persons. For example, each Trust Series may be impacted by European laws and regulations to the extent that it engages in futures transactions on European exchanges or derivatives transactions with European entities.

 Other jurisdictions impose requirements applicable to futures and derivatives that are similar to those imposed by the U.S., including position limits, margin, clearing and trade execution requirements. The CFTC is generally prohibited by statute from regulating trading on non-U.S. futures exchanges and markets. The CFTC, however, has adopted regulations relating to the marketing of non-U.S. futures contracts in the United States. These regulations permit certain contracts on non-U.S. exchanges to be offered and sold in the United States. SEC Reports The Trust makes available, free of charge, on its website, its annual reports on Form 10-K, its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, its current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after these forms are filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. These reports are also available from the SEC through its website at: www.sec.gov. CFTC Reports The Trust also makes available its monthly reports and its annual reports required to be prepared and filed with the NFA under the CFTC regulations.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors. The following risk factors should be read in connection with the other information included in this annual report on Form 10-K, including Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and financial statements and the related notes. Each Trust Series investment objective is for the daily percentage changes in the NAV per share to reflect the daily percentage changes of the Applicable Index, less the Trust Series expenses. Each Trust Series seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in a combination of Futures Contracts and Other Commodity Related Investments such that the daily percentage changes in its NAV, measured in percentage terms, will closely track the changes in the daily price of the Applicable Index, also measured in percentage terms. Each Trust Series investment strategy is designed to provide investors with a cost-effective way to invest indirectly in various commodities and to hedge against movements in the spot price of applicable commodities. An investment in a Trust Series therefore, involves investment risk and correlation risk, or the risk that investors purchasing shares to hedge against movements in the price of commodities will have an efficient hedge only if the return from their shares closely correlates with the return of the Applicable Index. In addition to investment risk and correlation risk, an investment in a Trust Series involves tax risks, OTC risks, and other risks. Investment Risk The NAV of a Trust Series shares relates directly to the value of its assets invested in accordance with the Applicable Index and other assets held by a Trust Series and fluctuations in the prices of these assets could materially adversely affect an investment in a Trust Series shares. The net assets of each Trust Series consist primarily of investments in Futures Contracts and, to a lesser extent, in Other Commodity-Related Investments. The NAV of a Trust Series shares relates directly to the value of these assets (less liabilities, including accrued but unpaid expenses), which in turn relates to the market price of the commodities which comprise the Applicable Index. Economic conditions . The demand for commodities, in general, correlates closely with general economic growth rates. The occurrence of recessions or other periods of low or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on commodity prices, demand and, therefore, may have an adverse impact on commodity Other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region, such as changes in population growth rates, periods of civil unrest, military conflicts, war (such as the current war between Russia and Ukraine), pandemics (e.g., COVID-19), government austerity programs, or currency exchange rate fluctuations, can also impact the demand for commodities. Sovereign debt downgrades, defaults, inability to access debt markets due to credit or legal constraints, liquidity crises, the breakup or restructuring of fiscal, monetary, or political systems such as the European Union, and other events or conditions (e.g., pandemics such as COVID-19)that impair the functioning of financial markets and institutions also may adversely impact the demand for commodities. Other demand-related factors . Other factors may affect the demand for certain commodities and therefore their price. For example, with respect to energy commodities, such factors may include technological improvements in energy efficiency; seasonal weather patterns, which affect the demand for commodities associated with heating and cooling; increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources that have so far generally not been competitive with such commodity without the benefit of government subsidies or mandates; and changes in technology or consumer preferences that alter fuel choices, such as toward alternative fueled vehicles. With respect to agricultural commodities, changes in consumer preference may lead to demand for a commodity such as grains. Other supply-related factors . Commodities prices also vary depending on a number of factors affecting supply, including geopolitical risk associated with wars (such as the current war between Russia and Ukraine), terrorist attacks and tensions between countries, including sanctions imposed as a result of the foregoing that can adversely affect commodity trade flows by limiting or disrupting trade between countries or regions. For example, increased supply from the development of hybrid crops (such as corn and soybeans) and technologies for efficient farming tends to reduce prices in such commodity to the extent such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand. Similarly, increases in industry manufacturing capacity may impact the supply of a particular crop. World food supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce available supplies, such as embargoes, the occurrence of geopolitical risk associated with wars, terrorist attacks and tensions between countries, including sanctions imposed as a result of the foregoing that can adversely affect commodity trade flows by limiting or disrupting trade between countries or regions, natural disasters, disruptions in competitors operations, or unexpected unavailability of distribution channels that may disrupt supplies. Technological change can also alter the relative costs for companies to produce, and process and distribute a commodity, which in turn may affect the supply of and demand of such commodity.

 Other market factors . The supply of and demand for agricultural and other commodities may also be impacted by changes in interest rates, inflation, and other local or regional market conditions. Price volatility may possibly cause the total loss of your investment . Futures contracts have a high degree of price variability and are subject to occasional rapid and substantial changes. Consequently, you could lose all or substantially all of your investment in a Trust Series. Significant market volatility has recently occurred in the commodities markets. Such volatility is attributable in part to the COVID-19 pandemic, related supply chair disruptions, war, including the war between Russia and Ukraine, and continuing disputes among oil-producing countries. These and other events could cause continuing or increased volatility in the future, which may affect the value, pricing and liquidity of some investments or other assets, including those held by or invested in by a Trust Series and the impact of which could limit the Trust Series ability to have a substantial portion of its assets invested in the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts. In such a circumstance, the Trust Series could, if it determined it appropriate to do so in light of market conditions and regulatory requirements, invest in other Futures Contracts and/or Other Related Investments. Russia s invasion of Ukraine, and sanctions brought by the United States and other countries against Russia and others, have caused disruptions in many business sectors, resulting in significant market disruptions that have led to increased volatility in the price of certain commodities, and may lead to volatility in a Trust Series NAV or share price. On February 24, 2022, Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine. The extent and duration of the military action, and resulting sanctions, and future market or supply disruptions in the region, are impossible to predict, but could be significant and may have a severe adverse effect on the region. The United States and other countries and certain international organizations have imposed broad-ranging economic sanctions on Russia and certain Russian individuals, banking entities and corporations as a response to Russia s invasion of Ukraine, and additional sanctions may be imposed in the future. Such sanctions (and any future sanctions) will adversely impact the economies of Russia and Ukraine, and certain sectors of each country s economy may be particularly affected, including but not limited to, financials, energy, metals and mining, engineering and defense and defense-related materials sectors. Among other things, the extent and duration of the military action, the responses of countries and political bodies to Russia s actions, including sanctions, future market or supply disruptions, and Ukraine s military response and the potential for wider conflict may increase financial market volatility generally, have severe adverse effects on regional and global economic markets, and cause volatility in the markets for commodities including the price of commodity futures, and the NAV or share price of a Trust Series. A resolution to the war in Ukraine also could impact the markets for certain commodities, and may have collateral impacts, including increased volatility, and cause disruptions to availability of certain commodities, commodity and futures prices and the supply chain globally. The longer-term impact on commodities and futures prices, including the spot price of the commodities that the Trust Series invest in and the prices of the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts, is difficult to predict and depends on a number of factors that may have a negative impact on the Trust Series in the future.

 COVID-19 and other infectious disease outbreaks could negatively affect the valuation and performance of the Trust Series investments. An outbreak of infectious respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus known as COVID-19 was first detected in China in December 2019 and spread globally. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. COVID-19 has resulted in numerous deaths, travel restrictions, closed international borders, enhanced health screenings at ports of entry and elsewhere, disruption of and delays in healthcare service preparation and delivery, prolonged quarantines and the imposition of both local and more widespread work from home measures, cancellations, loss of employment, supply chain disruptions, and lower consumer and institutional demand for goods and services, as well as general concern and uncertainty. The ongoing spread of COVID-19 has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse impact on local economies in the affected jurisdictions and also on the global economy, as cross border commercial activity and market sentiment are impacted by the outbreak and government and other measures seeking to contain its spread. The impact of COVID-19, and other infectious disease outbreaks that may arise in the future, could adversely affect individual issuers and capital markets in ways that cannot necessarily be foreseen. In addition, actions taken by government and quasi-governmental authorities and regulators throughout the world in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, including significant fiscal and monetary policy changes, may affect the value, volatility, pricing and liquidity of some investments or other assets, including those held by or invested in by the Trust Series. Public health crises caused by the COVID-19 outbreak may exacerbate other pre-existing political, social and economic risks in certain countries or globally. The duration of the COVID-19 outbreak and its ultimate impact on the Trust Series and, on the global economy, cannot be determined with certainty. Historical performance of a Trust Series and the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts is not indicative of future performance. Past performance of a Trust Series or the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts is not necessarily indicative of future results. Therefore, past performance of a Trust Series or the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts should not be relied upon in deciding whether to buy shares of a Trust Series. Correlation Risk An investment in a Trust Series may provide little or no diversification benefits. Thus, in a declining market, a Trust Series may have no gains to offset losses from other investments, and an investor may suffer losses on an investment in a Trust Series while incurring losses with respect to other asset classes. Investors purchasing shares to hedge against movements in the price of commodities will have an efficient hedge only if the return from their shares closely correlates with the return from the Applicable Index, which in turn, correlates with the price of commodities that comprise the Applicable Index. Investing in shares of a Trust Series for hedging purposes involves the following risks: The market price at which the investor buys or sells shares may be significantly more or less than NAV. Daily percentage changes in NAV may not closely correlate with daily percentage changes in the price of the Applicable Benchmark. Daily percentage changes in the prices of the Applicable Benchmark may not closely correlate with daily percentage changes in the price of the commodities that comprise the Applicable Index. 
 Historically, Futures Contracts and Other Commodity-Related Investments have generally been non-correlated to the performance of other asset classes such as stocks and bonds. Non-correlation means that there is a low statistically valid relationship between the performance of futures and other commodity interest transactions, on the one hand, and stocks or bonds, on the other hand. However, there can be no assurance that such non-correlation will continue during future periods. If, contrary to historic patterns, a Trust Series performance were to move in the same general direction as the financial markets, investors will obtain little or no diversification benefits from an investment in a Trust Series shares. In such a case, a Trust Series may have no gains to offset losses from other investments, and investors may suffer losses on their investment in a Trust Series at the same time they incur losses with respect to other investments. Variables such as drought, floods, weather military conflicts, pandemics (such as COVID-19), embargoes, tariffs and other political events may have a larger impact on commodity prices and commodity-linked instruments, including Futures Contracts and Other

 Commodity-Related Investments, than on traditional securities. These additional variables may create additional investment risks that subject a Trust Series investments to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities. Non-correlation should not be confused with negative correlation, where the performance of two asset classes would be opposite of each other. There is no historical evidence that the spot price of a commodity and prices of other financial assets, such as stocks and bonds, are negatively correlated. In the absence of negative correlation, a Trust Series cannot be expected to be automatically profitable during unfavorable periods for the stock market, or vice versa. The market price at which investors buy or sell shares may be significantly less or more than NAV. Each Trust Series NAV per share will change throughout the day as fluctuations occur in the market value of such Trust Series portfolio investments. The public trading price at which an investor buys or sells shares during the day from their broker may be different from the NAV of the shares. Generally, price differences may relate primarily to supply and demand forces at work in the secondary trading market for shares that are closely related to, but not identical to, the same forces influencing the prices of the commodities comprising the Applicable Index and the Applicable Index at any point in time. USCF expects that exploitation of certain arbitrage opportunities by Authorized Participants and their clients will tend to cause the public trading price to track NAV per share closely over time, but there can be no assurance of that. The NAV of a Trust Series shares may also be influenced by non-concurrent trading hours between the NYSE Arca and the various futures exchanges on which a commodity comprising the Applicable Index is traded. While the shares trade on the NYSE Arca from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, the trading hours for the futures exchanges on commodities trade may not necessarily coincide during all of this time. For example, while the shares trade on the NYSE Arca until 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, liquidity in the global light sweet crude market will be reduced after the close of the NYMEX at 2:30 p.m. Eastern Time. As a result, during periods when the NYSE Arca is open and the futures exchanges on which sweet, light crude oil is traded are closed, trading spreads and the resulting premium or discount on the shares may widen and, therefore, increase the difference between the price of the shares and the NAV of the shares. Daily percentage changes in a Trust Series NAV may not correlate with daily percentage changes in the price of the Applicable Index . A Trust Series NAV per share will change throughout the day as fluctuations occur in the market value of that Trust Series portfolio investments. The public trading price at which an investor buys or sells shares during the day from their broker may be different from the NAV of the shares. Price, which is also the price shares can be redeemed with the Trust Series by Authorized Participants in Redemption Baskets. Generally, differences may relate to supply and demand forces at work in the secondary trading market for shares that are closely related to, but not identical to, the same forces influencing the prices of the commodities comprising the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts and the Applicable Index at any point in time. USCF expects that exploitation of certain arbitrage opportunities by Authorized Participants, the institutional firms that directly purchase and redeem shares in blocks of 50,000 shares Creation Baskets and Redemption Baskets respectively, together, baskets ), and their clients and customers will tend to cause the public trading price to track NAV per share closely over time, but there can be no assurance of that. For example, a shortage of a Trust Series shares in the market and other factors could cause that Trust Series shares to trade at a premium. Investors should be aware that such premiums can be transitory. To the extent an investor purchases shares that include a premium (e.g., because of a shortage of shares in the market due to the inability of Authorized Participants to purchase additional shares from a Trust Series that could be resold in the market) and the cause of the premium no longer exists causing the premium to disappear (e.g., because more shares are available for purchase from the Trust Series by Authorized Participants that could be resold into the market) such investor s return on its investment would be adversely impacted due to the loss of the premium. The NAV of a Trust Series shares may also be influenced by non-concurrent trading hours between the NYSE Arca and the various futures exchanges on which a commodity comprising the Applicable Index is traded. While the shares trade on the NYSE Arca from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, the trading hours for the futures exchanges on commodities trade may not necessarily coincide during all of this time. Daily percentage changes in the price of the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contract may not correlate with daily percentage changes in the spot price of the corresponding commodity. The correlation between changes in prices of an Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contract and the spot price of the corresponding commodity may at times be only approximate. The degree of imperfection of correlation depends upon circumstances

 such as variations in the speculative commodities market, supply of and demand for Futures Contracts (including the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contract) and Other Commodity-Related Investments, and technical influences in futures trading. In addition, a Trust Series is not able to replicate exactly the changes in the price of the Applicable Index because the total return generated by the Trust Series is reduced by expenses and transaction costs, including those incurred in connection with the Trust Series trading activities, and increased by interest income from the Trust Series holdings of Treasuries. Tracking the Applicable Index requires trading of the relevant Trust Series portfolio with a view to tracking the Applicable Index over time and is dependent upon the skills of USCF and its trading principals, among other factors. An investment in a Trust Series is not a proxy for investing in the commodities markets, and the daily percentage changes in the price of the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts, or the NAV of the Trust Series, may not correlate with daily percentage changes in the spot price of the physical commodities that underlie the Applicable Index. An investment in a Trust Series is not a proxy for investing in the commodities markets. To the extent that investors use a Trust Series as a means of indirectly investing in physical commodities, there is the risk that the daily changes in the price of the Trust Series shares on the NYSE Arca, on a percentage basis, will not closely track the daily changes in the spot price of the commodities on a percentage basis. This could happen if the price of shares traded on the NYSE Arca does not correlate closely with the value of the Trust Series NAV; the changes in the Trust Series NAV do not correlate closely with the changes in the price of the Benchmark Component Futures Contract; or the changes in the price of the Benchmark Component Futures Contract does not closely correlate with the changes in the cash or spot price of the commodities. This is a risk because if these correlations do not exist, then investors may not be able to use the Trust Series as a cost-effective way to indirectly invest in commodities or as a hedge against movements in the spot price of commodities. The degree of correlation among a Trust Series share price, the price of the Benchmark Component Futures Contract and the spot price of commodities depends upon circumstances such as variations in the speculative commodities market, supply of and demand for Futures Contracts (including the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts) and Other Related Investments, and technical influences on trading futures contracts. Investors who are not experienced in investing in futures contracts or the factors that influence that market or speculative trading in futures markets and may not have the background or ready access to the types of information that investors familiar with these markets may have and, as a result, may be at greater risk of incurring losses from trading in a Trust Series shares than such other investors with such experience and resources. The price relationship between each Applicable Index at any point in time and the Futures Contracts that will become the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts on the next rebalancing date will vary and may impact both a Trust Series total return and the degree to which its total return tracks that of commodity price indices. The design of each Applicable Index is such that every month it is made up of different Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts, and a Trust Series investment must be rebalanced on an ongoing basis to reflect the changing composition of the Applicable Index. In the event of a commodity futures market where near month contracts to expire trade at a higher price than next month contracts to expire, a situation described as backwardation in the futures market, then absent the impact of the overall movement in commodity prices, the value of the Applicable Index would tend to rise as it approaches expiration. As a result, a Trust Series may benefit because it would be selling more expensive contracts and buying less expensive ones on an ongoing basis. Conversely, in the event of a commodity futures market where near month contracts trade at a lower price than next month contracts, a situation described as contango in the futures market, then absent the impact of the overall movement in commodity prices, the value of the Applicable Index would tend to decline as it approaches expiration. As a result, a Trust Series total return may be lower than might otherwise be the case because it would be selling less expensive contracts and buying more expensive ones. The impact of backwardation and contango may cause the total return of a Trust Series to vary significantly from the total return of other price references, such as the spot price of the commodities comprising the Applicable Index. Moreover, absent the impact of rising or falling commodity prices, a prolonged period of contango could have a significant negative impact on a Trust Series per share NAV and total return and investors could lose part or all of their investment. Accountability levels, position limits, and daily price fluctuation limits set by the exchanges have the potential to cause tracking error by limiting a Trust Series investments, including its ability to fully invest in the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contract, which could cause the price of shares to substantially vary from the price of the Applicable Index. Designated contract markets, such as the NYMEX and ICE Futures, have established accountability levels and position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons under common trading control (other than as a hedge, which an investment by a Trust Series is not) may hold, own or control. These levels and position limits apply to the futures contracts that the Trust Series invest in to meet their investment objectives. In addition to accountability levels and position limits, the NYMEX and ICE Futures, also set daily price fluctuation limits on futures contracts. The daily price fluctuation limit 
 44 

Table of Contents 
 establishes the maximum amount that the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous day s settlement price. Once the daily price fluctuation limit has been reached in a particular futures contract, no trades may be made at a price beyond that limit. On October 15, 2020, the CFTC approved the Position Limits Rule. The Position Limits Rule establishes federal position limits for 25 core referenced futures contracts (comprised of agricultural, energy and metals futures contracts), futures and options linked to the core referenced futures contracts, and swaps that are economically equivalent to the core referenced futures contracts. Certain of the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts will be subject to position limits under the Position Limits Rule, and the Trust Series trading does not qualify for an exemption therefrom. Accordingly, the Position Limits Rule could negatively impact the ability of the Trust Series to meet their investment objectives by inhibiting USCF s ability to effectively invest the proceeds from sales of Creation Baskets of the Trust Series in particular amounts and types of its permitted investments. These limits may potentially cause a tracking error between the price of a Trust Series shares and the Applicable Index. This may in turn prevent investors from being able to effectively use a Trust Series as a way to hedge against commodity-related losses or as a way to indirectly invest in a commodity. Risk mitigation measures that could be imposed by the Trust Series FCMs have the potential to cause tracking error by limiting a Trust Series investments, including its ability to fully invest in the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contract and other Futures Contracts, which could cause the price of the Trust Series shares to substantially vary from the price of the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts. The Trust Series FCMs have discretion to impose limits on the positions that a Trust Series may hold in the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts as well as certain other months. To date, the Trust Series FCMs have not imposed any such limits. However, were the FCMs to impose limits on a Trust Series, such Trust Series ability to have a substantial portion of its assets invested in the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contract and other Futures Contracts could be severely limited, which could lead the Trust Series to invest in other Futures Contracts or, potentially, Other Related Investments. The Trust Series could also have to more frequently rebalance and adjust the types of holdings in its portfolio than is currently the case. This could inhibit the Trust Series from pursuing its investment objective in the same manner that it has historically and currently. In addition, when offering Creation Baskets for purchase, limitations imposed by exchanges and/or any of the FCMs could limit a Trust Series ability to invest the proceeds of the purchases of Creation Baskets in Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts and other Futures Contracts. If this were the case, the Trust Series may invest in other permitted investments, including Other Related Investments, and may hold larger amounts of Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents, which could impair the Trust Series ability to meet its investment objective. Tax Risk An investor s tax liability may exceed the amount of distributions, if any, on its shares. Cash or property will be distributed at the sole discretion of USCF. USCF has not and does not currently intend to make cash or other distributions with respect to shares. Investors will be required to pay U.S. federal income tax and, in some cases, state, local, or foreign income tax, on their allocable share of a Trust Series taxable income, without regard to whether they receive distributions or the amount of any distributions. Therefore, the tax liability of an investor with respect to its shares may exceed the amount of cash or value of property (if any) distributed with respect to such shares. An investor s allocable share of taxable income or loss may differ from its economic income or loss on its shares. Due to the application of the assumptions and conventions applied by a Trust Series in making allocations for tax purposes and other factors, an investor s allocable share of a Trust Series income, gain, deduction, loss or credit may be different than its economic profit or loss from its shares for a taxable year. This difference could be temporary or permanent and, if permanent, could result in it being taxed on amounts in excess of its economic income.

 Items of income, gain, deduction, loss and credit with respect to shares could be reallocated, for U.S. federal income tax purposes and the Trust Series could be liable for U.S. Federal income tax, if the IRS does not accept the assumptions and conventions applied by the Trust Series in allocating those items, with potential adverse consequences for an investor. The U.S. federal income tax rules pertaining to entities treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes are complex and their application to large, publicly traded entities such as the Trust Series is in many respects uncertain. The Trust Series apply certain assumptions and conventions in an attempt to comply with the intent of the applicable rules and to report taxable income, gains, deductions, losses and credits in a manner that properly reflects shareholders economic gains and losses. It is possible that the IRS could successfully challenge the application by a Trust Series of these assumptions and conventions as not fully complying with all aspects of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code and applicable Treasury ., which would require the Trust Series to reallocate items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit in a manner that adversely affects investors If this occurs, investors may be required to file an amended U.S. federal income tax return and to pay additional taxes plus deficiency interest. The Trust Series may be liable for U.S. federal income tax on any imputed understatement of tax resulting from an adjustment as a result of an IRS audit. The amount of the imputed understatement generally includes increases in allocations of items of income or gain to any investor and decreases in allocations of items of deduction, loss, or credit to any investor without any offset for any corresponding reductions in allocations of items of income or gain to any investor or increases in allocations of items of deduction, loss, or credit to any investor. If the Trust Series is required to pay any U.S. federal income taxes on any imputed understatement, the resulting tax liability would reduce the net assets of the Trust Series and would likely have an adverse impact on the value of the shares. Under certain circumstances, the Trust Series may be eligible to elect to cause the investors to take into account the amount of any imputed understatement, including any interest and penalties. The ability of a publicly traded partnership such as the Trust Series to elect this treatment is uncertain. If the election is made, the Trust Series would be required to provide investors who owned beneficial interests in the shares in the year to which the adjusted allocations relate with a statement setting forth their proportionate shares of the adjustment Adjusted K-1s ). The investors would be required to take the adjustment into account in the taxable year in which the Adjusted K-1s are issued. Each Trust Series could be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which may substantially reduce the value of the shares. The Trust, on behalf of each Trust Series, has received an opinion of counsel that, under current U.S. federal income tax laws, each Trust Series will be treated as a partnership that is not taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, provided that (i) at least 90 percent of the Trust Series annual gross income will be derived from (a) income and gains from commodities (not held as inventory) or futures, forwards, options, swaps and other notional principal contracts with respect to commodities, and (b) interest income, (ii) the Trust and each Trust Series is organized and operated in accordance with its governing agreements and applicable law and (iii) neither the Trust nor the Trust Series elects to be taxed as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Although USCF anticipates that each Trust Series has satisfied and will continue to satisfy the qualifying income requirement for all of its taxable years that result cannot be assured. No Trust Series has requested and will not request any ruling from the IRS with respect to its classification as a partnership taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the IRS were to successfully assert that a Trust Series is taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes in any taxable year, rather than passing through its income, gains, losses, deductions and credits proportionately to its shareholders, the Trust Series would be subject to tax. U.S. federal income imposed at applicable corporate rates on its net income for the year. In addition, although USCF does not currently intend to make distributions with respect to its shares, if a Trust Series were to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, any distributions made with respect to the Trust Series would be taxable to Shareholders as dividend income to the extent of a Trust Series current and accumulated earnings and profits. Taxation of the Trust and each Trust Series as a corporation could materially reduce the after-tax return on an investment in shares and could substantially reduce the value of the shares. The Trust is organized as a Delaware statutory trust, in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement and applicable state law, and therefore, each Trust Series has a more complex tax treatment than traditional mutual funds. The Trust is organized as a Delaware statutory trust in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement and applicable state law., but each Trust Series is taxed as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes No U.S. federal income tax is paid by any Trust Series on its income. Instead, each Trust Series will furnish shareholders each year with tax information on IRS Schedules K-1, K-2, and/or K-3 (Form 1065) and each U.S. shareholder is required to report on its U.S. federal income tax return its allocable share of the income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of each Trust Series. This must be reported without regard to the amount (if any) of cash or property the shareholder receives as a distribution from an applicable Trust Series during the taxable year. A shareholder, therefore, may be allocated income or gain by a Trust Series but receive no cash distribution with which to pay the tax liability resulting from the allocation, or may receive a distribution that is insufficient to pay such liability.

 In addition to U.S. federal income taxes, shareholders may be subject to other taxes, such as state and local income taxes, unincorporated business taxes, business franchise taxes and estate, inheritance or intangible taxes that may be imposed by the various jurisdictions in which the Trust Series do business or own property or where shareholders reside. Although an analysis of those various taxes is not present here, each prospective shareholder should consider their potential impact on its investment in a Trust Series. It is each shareholder s responsibility to file the appropriate U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax returns. If the Trust Series are required to withhold tax with respect to any non-U.S. shareholders, the cost of such withholding may be borne by all shareholders. Under certain circumstances, the Trust Series may be required to pay withholding tax with respect to allocations to non-U.S. shareholders. Although the Trust Agreement provides that any such withholding will be treated as being distributed to the non-U.S. shareholder, the Trust Series may not be able to cause the economic cost of such withholding to be borne by the non-U.S. shareholder on whose behalf such amounts were withheld since it does not generally expect to make any distributions. Under such circumstances, the economic cost of the withholding may be borne by all shareholders, not just the shareholders on whose behalf such amounts were withheld. This could have a material impact on the value of the shares. The impact of changes in U.S. federal income tax laws on each Trust Series is uncertain. In general, legislative or other actions relating to U.S. federal income taxes could have a negative effect on the Trust Series or their investors. The rules dealing with U.S. federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department. On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act (the IRA into law. At this time, the Trust cannot predict with certainty how the provisions of the IRA or any other proposed or future tax legislation might affect the Trust, the Trust Series, investors in the Trust Series or the investments held by the Trust Series. Investors are urged to consult with their tax advisor with respect to the status of legislative, regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in our shares. OTC Contract Risk Each Trust Series will be subject to credit risk with respect to counterparties to OTC contracts entered into by the Trust on behalf of a Trust Series or held by special purpose or structured vehicles. Each Trust Series faces the risk of non-performance by the counterparties to the OTC contracts. Unlike in futures contracts, the counterparty to these contracts is generally a single bank or other financial institution, rather than a clearing organization backed by a group of financial institutions. As a result, there will be greater counterparty credit risk in these transactions. A counterparty may not be able to meet its obligations to a Trust Series, in which case the Trust Series could suffer significant losses on these contracts. If a counterparty becomes bankrupt or otherwise fails to perform its obligations due to financial difficulties, a Trust Series may experience significant delays in obtaining any recovery in a bankruptcy or other reorganization proceeding. The Trust on behalf of a Trust Series may obtain only limited recovery or may obtain no recovery in such circumstances. Valuing OTC derivatives may be less certain than actively traded financial instruments. In general, valuing OTC derivatives is less certain than valuing actively traded financial instruments such as exchange-traded futures contracts and securities or cleared swaps because, for the OTC derivatives, the price and terms on which such OTC derivatives are entered into or can be terminated are individually negotiated, and those prices and terms may not reflect the best price or terms available from other sources. In addition, while market makers and dealers generally quote indicative prices or terms for entering into or terminating OTC contracts, they typically are not contractually obligated to do so, particularly if they are not a party to the transaction. As a result, it may be difficult to obtain an independent value for an outstanding OTC derivatives transaction. Other Risks Neither Trust Series is leveraged, but a Trust Series could become leveraged should it have insufficient assets to completely meet its margin or collateral requirements relating to its investments. Neither Trust Series is leveraged, and neither intends to leverage, its assets through borrowings or otherwise, and each invests accordingly. Consistent with the foregoing, each Trust Series announced investment intentions, and any changes thereto, will take into account the need for the Trust Series to make permitted investments that also allow it to maintain adequate liquidity to meet its margin and collateral requirements and to avoid, to the extent reasonably practicable, the Trust Series becoming leveraged. If market conditions 
 47 

Table of Contents 
 require it, a Trust Series may implement risk reduction procedures, which may include changes to its investments, and such changes may occur on short notice if they occur other than during a roll or rebalance period. Although neither Trust Series borrows or will borrow money or use debt to satisfy its margin or collateral obligations in respect of its investments, it could become leveraged if the Trust Series were to hold insufficient assets that would allow it to meet not only the current, but also future, margin or collateral obligations required for such investments. Such a circumstance could occur if a Trust Series were to hold assets that have a value of less than zero. USCF endeavors to have the value of each Trust Series Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents, whether held by the Trust Series or posted as margin or other collateral, at all times approximate the aggregate market value of its obligations under its Futures Contracts and Other Related Investments. Although permitted to do so under the Trust Agreement, neither Trust Series has, nor does it intend to, leverage its assets by making investments beyond its potential ability to meet the potential margin and collateral obligations relating to such investments. Consistent with this, each Trust Series investment decisions will take into account the need for the Trust Series to make permitted investments that also allow it to maintain adequate liquidity to meet its margin and collateral requirements and to avoid, to the extent reasonably possible, the Trust Series becoming leveraged, including by its holding of assets that have a high probability of having a value of less than zero . A Trust Series may temporarily limit the offering of Creation Baskets. A Trust Series may determine to limit the issuance of its shares through the offering of Creation Baskets to its Authorized Participants in order to allow it to reinvest the proceeds from sales of its Creation Baskets in currently permitted assets in a manner that meets its investment objective. A Trust Series will announce to the market through the filing of a Current Report on Form 8-K if it intends to limit the offering of Creation Baskets at any time. In such case, orders for Creation Baskets will be considered for acceptance in the order they are received by the Trust Series and the Trust Series would continue to accept requests for redemption of its shares from Authorized Participants through Redemption Baskets during the period of the limited offering of Creation Baskets. The Trust Series pay fees and expenses that are incurred regardless of whether they are profitable. Unlike mutual funds, commodity pools or other investment pools that manage their investments in an attempt to realize income and gains and distribute such income and gains to their investors, the Trust Series generally do not distribute cash shareholders. You should not invest in a Trust Series if you will need cash distributions from the Trust Series to pay taxes on your share of income and gains of the Trust Series, if any, or for any other reason. You will have no rights to participate in the management of a Trust Series and will have to rely on the duties and judgment of USCF to manage the Trust Series. The Trust Series is subject to actual and potential inherent conflicts involving USCF, various commodity futures brokers and Authorized Participants, USCF s officers, directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to the Trust Series. USCF s personnel are directors, officers or employees of other entities that may compete with the Trust Series for their services, including other commodity pools (funds) that USCF manages. USCF could have a conflict between its responsibilities to the Trust Series and to those other entities. As a result of these and other relationships, parties involved with the Trust Series have a financial incentive to act in a manner other than in the best interest of the Trust Series and the shareholders. Certain of a Trust Series investments could be illiquid, which could cause large losses to investors at any time or from time to time. Futures positions cannot always be liquidated at the desired price. It is difficult to execute a trade at a specific price when there is a relatively small volume of buy and sell orders in a market. A market disruption, such as war or a foreign government taking political actions that disrupt the market for its currency, its crude oil production or exports, or another major export, can also make it difficult to liquidate a position. Because both Futures Contracts and Other Commodity-Related Investments may be illiquid, a Trust Series Commodity Interests may be more difficult to liquidate at favorable prices in periods of illiquid markets and losses may be incurred during the period in which positions are being liquidated. The large size of the positions that a Trust Series may acquire increases the risk of illiquidity both by making its positions more difficult to liquidate and by potentially increasing losses while trying to do so. OTC contracts that are not subject to clearing may be even less marketable than futures contracts because they are not traded on an exchange, do not have uniform terms and conditions, and are entered into based upon the creditworthiness of the parties and the availability of credit support, such as collateral, and in general, they are not transferable without the consent of the counterparty. These conditions make such contracts less liquid than standardized futures contracts traded on a commodities exchange and could adversely

 impact a Trust Series ability to realize the full value of such contracts. In addition, even if collateral is used to reduce counterparty credit risk, sudden changes in the value of OTC transactions may leave a party open to financial risk due to a counterparty default since the collateral held may not cover a party s exposure on the transaction in such situations. The Trust Series are not actively managed and their investment objectives are for the daily changes in percentage terms of their shares per share NAV for any period of 30 successive valuation days to be within plus/minus 10 percent (10 of the average daily percentage change in the price of the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts over the same period. The Trust Series are not actively managed by conventional methods. Accordingly, if a Trust Series investments are declining in value in the ordinary course, the Trust Series will not close out such positions except in connection with paying the proceeds to an Authorized Participant upon the redemption of a basket or closing out futures positions in connection with the monthly change in the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts. USCF will seek to cause the NAV of the shares of each Trust Series to track the Applicable Index during periods in which the price is flat or declining as well as when the price is rising. The ability of each Trust Series to invest in the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts could be limited as a result of any or all of the following: evolving market conditions, a change in regulatory accountability levels and position limits imposed on the Trust Series with respect to its investment in Futures Contracts, additional or different risk mitigation measures taken by market participants, generally, including a Trust Series, with respect to such Trust Series acquiring additional Futures Contracts, or such Trust Series selling additional shares. A Trust Series may not meet the listing standards of NYSE Arca, which would adversely impact an investor s ability to sell shares. The shares of each Trust Series are listed for trading on the NYSE Arca. NYSE Arca may suspend a Trust Series shares from trading on the exchange with or without prior notice to the Trust Series upon failure of such Trust Series to comply with the NYSE s listing requirements or, when in its sole discretion, the NYSE Arca determines that such suspension of dealings is in the public interest or otherwise warranted. There can be no assurance that the requirements necessary to maintain the listing of each Trust Series shares will continue to be met or will remain unchanged. If a Trust Series were unable to meet the NYSE s listing standards and were to become delisted, an investor s ability to sell its shares would be adversely impacted. The NYSE Arca may halt trading in a Trust Series shares, which would adversely impact an investor s ability to sell shares. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, each Trust Series shares are listed for trading on the NYSE Arca under the market symbols USCI and CPER . Trading in shares may be halted due to market conditions or, in light of NYSE Arca rules and procedures, for reasons that, in the view of the NYSE Arca, make trading in shares inadvisable. In addition, trading is subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to circuit breaker rules that require trading to be halted for a specified period based on a specified market decline. Additionally, there can be no assurance that the requirements necessary to maintain the listing of a Trust Series shares will continue to be met or will remain unchanged. The liquidity of the shares may also be affected by the withdrawal from participation of Authorized Participants, which could adversely affect the market price of the shares. In the event that one or more Authorized Participants which have substantial interests in the shares withdraw from participation, the liquidity of the shares will likely decrease, which could adversely affect the market price of the shares and result in investors incurring a loss on their investment. Shareholders that are not Authorized Participants may only purchase or sell their shares in secondary trading markets, and the conditions associated with trading in secondary markets may adversely affect investors investment in the shares. Only Authorized Participants may directly purchase shares from, or redeem shares with, a Trust Series through Creation Baskets or Redemption Baskets, respectively. All other investors that desire to purchase or sell shares must do so through the NYSE Arca or in other markets, if any, in which the shares may be traded. Shares may trade at a premium or discount relative to NAV per share.

 The lack of an active trading market for a Trust Series shares may result in losses on an investor s investment in a Trust Series at the time the investor sells the shares. Although each Trust Series shares are listed and traded on the NYSE Arca, there can be no guarantee that an active trading market for the shares will be maintained. If an investor needs to sell shares at a time when no active trading market for them exists, the price the investor receives upon sale of the shares, assuming they were able to be sold, likely would be lower than if an active market existed. SummerHaven is leanly staffed and relies heavily on key personnel to manage advisory activities. SummerHaven is leanly staffed and relies heavily on key personnel to manage advisory activities. In providing trading advisory services to each Trust Series with respect to its Applicable Index, SummerHaven relies heavily on Kurt Nelson and Dr. K. Geert Rouwenhorst. Mr. Nelson and Dr. Rouwenhorst intend to allocate their time to managing the assets of each Trust Series in a manner that they deem appropriate. If such key personnel of SummerHaven were to leave or be unable to carry out their present responsibilities, it may have an adverse effect on the management of SummerHaven. USCF s LLC Agreement provides limited authority to the Non-Management Directors, and any Director of USCF may be removed by USCF s parent company, which is wholly owned by The Marygold Companies, Inc., formerly Technologies, Inc. a controlled public company where the majority of shares are owned by Nicholas D. Gerber along with certain of his other family members and certain other shareholders. USCF s Board of Directors currently consists of four Management Directors, who are also executive officers or employees of USCF, and three Non-Management Directors, who are considered independent for purposes of applicable NYSE Arca and SEC rules. Under USCF s LLC Agreement, the Non-Management Directors have only such authority as the Management Directors expressly confer upon them, which means that the Non-Management Directors may have less authority to control the actions of the Management Directors than is typically the case with the independent members of a company s Board of Directors. In addition, any Director may be removed by written consent of USCF Investments, Inc. USCF Investments ), formerly Wainwright Holdings, Inc., which is the sole member of USCF. The sole shareholder of USCF Investments is The Marygold Companies, Inc., formerly Concierge Technologies, Inc., Marygold a company publicly traded under the ticker symbol MGLD . Mr. Nicholas D. Gerber, along with certain of his other family members and certain other shareholders, owns the majority of the shares in Marygold, which is the sole shareholder of USCF Investments, the sole member of USCF. Accordingly, although USCF is governed by the USCF Board of Directors, which consists of both Management Directors and Non-Management Directors, pursuant to the LLC Agreement, it is possible for Mr. Gerber to exercise his indirect control of USCF Investments to effect the removal of any Director (including the Non-Management Directors which comprise the Audit Committee) and to replace that Director with another Director. Having control in one person could have a negative impact on USCF and each Trust Series, including their regulatory obligations. There is a risk that a Trust Series will not earn trading gains sufficient to compensate for the fees and expenses that it must pay and as such a Trust Series may not earn any profit. Each Trust Series pays brokerage charges of approximately 0.10 of average total net assets based on brokerage fees of 3.00 per buy or sell, management fees of 0.65 of NAV on its average net assets in the case of CPER and 0.80 in the case of USCI (in each case, before any applicable voluntary or contractual expense waivers), and OTC spreads and extraordinary expenses (e.g., subsequent offering expenses, other expenses not in the ordinary course of business, including the indemnification of any person against liabilities and obligations to the extent permitted by law and required under the Trust Agreement and under agreements entered into by USCF on each Trust Series behalf and the bringing and defending of actions at law or in equity and otherwise engaging in the conduct of litigation and the incurring of legal expenses and the settlement of claims and litigation) that cannot be quantified. These fees and expenses must be paid in all cases regardless of whether each Trust Series activities are profitable. Accordingly, each Trust Series must earn trading gains sufficient to compensate for these fees and expenses before it can earn any profit. Each Trust Series is subject to extensive regulatory reporting and compliance. Each Trust Series is subject to a comprehensive scheme of regulation under the federal commodities and securities laws. Each Trust Series could be subject to sanctions for a failure to comply with those requirements, which could adversely affect its financial performance (in the case of financial penalties) or ability to pursue its investment objective (in the case of a limitation on its ability to trade).

 Because each Trust Series shares are publicly traded, a Trust Series is subject to certain rules and regulations of federal, state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded. These entities include the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the PCAOB ), the SEC, the CFTC and NYSE Arca and these authorities have continued to develop additional regulations or interpretations of existing regulations. Each Trust Series is in ongoing efforts to comply with these regulations and interpretations have resulted in, and are likely to continue resulting in, a diversion of management s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance related activities. Each Trust Series is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Each Trust Series internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to its management regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective may provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Fewer representative commodities may result in greater Applicable Index volatility. Each Applicable Index is concentrated in terms of the number of commodities represented. Investors should be aware that other commodities indices are more diversified in terms of both the number and variety of commodities included. Concentration in fewer commodities may result in a greater degree of volatility in an Applicable Index and the NAV of a Trust Series which tracks an Applicable Index under specific market conditions and over time. Regulatory changes or actions, including the implementation of new legislation is impossible to predict but may significantly and adversely affect a Trust Series. The futures markets are subject to comprehensive statutes, regulations, and margin requirements. In addition, the CFTC and futures exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of a market emergency, including, for example, the retroactive implementation of speculative position limits or higher margin requirements, the establishment of daily price limits and the suspension of trading. Regulation of commodity interest transactions in the United States is a rapidly changing area of law and is subject to ongoing modification by governmental and judicial action. Considerable regulatory attention has been focused on non-traditional investment pools that are publicly distributed in the United States. In addition, the SEC, CFTC and the exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of a market emergency, including, for example, the retroactive implementation of speculative position limits or higher margin requirements, the establishment of daily price limits and the suspension of trading. Further, various national governments outside of the United States have expressed concern regarding the disruptive effects of speculative trading in the commodities markets and the need to regulate the derivatives markets in general. The effect of any future regulatory change on a Trust Series is impossible to predict, but it could be substantial and adverse. For a more detailed discussion of the regulations to be imposed by the CFTC and the SEC and the potential impacts thereof on a Trust Series, please see Item 1. Business Commodities Regulation in this Annual report on Form 10-K. The Trust is not a registered investment company so shareholders do not have the protections of the 1940 Act. The Trust is not an investment company subject to the 1940 Act. Accordingly, investors do not have the protections afforded by that statute, which, for example, requires investment companies to have a majority of disinterested directors and regulates the relationship between the investment company and its investment manager.

 Trading in international markets could expose a Trust Series to credit and regulatory risk. Each Trust Series invests primarily in Futures Contracts, a significant portion of which are traded on United States exchanges, including the NYMEX. However, a portion of a Trust Series trades may take place on markets and exchanges outside the United States. Trading on such non-U.S. markets or exchanges presents risks because they are not subject to the same degree of regulation as their U.S. counterparts, including potentially different or diminished investor protections. In trading contracts denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, a Trust Series is subject to the risk of adverse exchange-rate movements between the dollar and the functional currencies of such contracts. Additionally, trading on non-U.S. exchanges is subject to the risks presented by exchange controls, expropriation, increased tax burdens and exposure to local economic declines and political instability. An adverse development with respect to any of these variables could reduce the profit or increase the loss earned on trades in the affected international markets. Each Trust Series and USCF may have conflicts of interest, which may permit them to favor their own interests to the detriment of shareholders. Each Trust Series is subject to actual and potential inherent conflicts involving USCF, various commodity futures brokers and any Authorized Participants. USCF s officers, directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to a Trust Series and also are directors, officers or employees of other entities that may compete with each Trust Series for their services. They could have a conflict between their responsibilities to a Trust Series and to those other entities. As a result of these and other relationships, parties involved with a Trust Series have a financial incentive to act in a manner other than in the best interests of such Trust Series and the shareholders. USCF has not established any formal procedure to resolve conflicts of interest. Consequently, investors are dependent on the good faith of the respective parties subject to such conflicts of interest to resolve them equitably. Although USCF attempts to monitor these conflicts, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for USCF to ensure that these conflicts do not, in fact, result in adverse consequences to the shareholders. A Trust Series may also be subject to certain conflicts with respect to its FCMs, including, but not limited to, conflicts that result from receiving greater amounts of compensation from other clients, or purchasing opposite or competing positions on behalf of third party accounts traded through the FCMs. In addition, USCF s principals, officers, directors or employees may trade futures and related contracts for their own account. A conflict of interest may exist if their trades are in the same markets and at the same time as a Trust Series trades using the clearing broker to be used by such Trust Series. A potential conflict also may occur if USCF s principals, officers, directors or employees trade their accounts more aggressively or take positions in their accounts which are opposite, or ahead of, the positions taken by a Trust Series. The Trust Series, USCF and SummerHaven may have conflicts of interest, which may cause them to favor their own interests to the detriment of shareholders. The Trust Series, USCF and SummerHaven may have inherent conflicts to the extent USCF and SummerHaven attempt to maintain each Trust Series asset size in order to preserve its fee income and this may not always be consistent with such Trust Series objective of having the value of its shares NAV track changes in the value of an Applicable Index. USCF s and SummerHaven s officers, directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to each Trust Series. For example, USCF s directors, officers and employees act in such capacity for other entities, including the Related Public Funds that may compete with each Trust Series for their services. They could have a conflict between their responsibilities to each Trust Series and to the Related Public Funds. USCF has sole current authority to manage the investments and operations of each Trust Series. It has delegated management of each Trust Series investments in its Applicable Interests to its commodity trading advisor, SummerHaven. This authority to manage the investments and operations of each Trust Series may allow either USCF or SummerHaven to act in a way that furthers its own interests in conflict with the best interests of investors. Shareholders have very limited voting rights, which will limit the ability to influence matters such as amending the Trust Agreement, changing a Trust Series basic investment objective, dissolving a Trust Series, or selling or distributing a Trust Series assets.

Table of Contents 
 Shareholders have only very limited voting rights and have the power to replace USCF only under specific circumstances. Shareholders do not participate in the management of a Trust Series and do not control USCF, so they do not have any influence over basic matters that affect each Trust Series. Shareholders have very limited voting rights with respect to each Trust Series affairs and have none of the statutory rights normally associated with the ownership of shares of a corporation (including, for example, the right to bring oppression or derivative actions). Shareholders may elect a replacement sponsor only if USCF resigns voluntarily or loses its corporate charter. Shareholders are not permitted to participate in the management or control of any Trust Series or the conduct of its business. Shareholders must therefore rely upon the duties and judgment of USCF to manage each Trust Series affairs. A Trust Series could terminate at any time and cause the liquidation and potential loss of an investor s investment and could upset the overall maturity and timing of an investor s investment portfolio. A Trust Series could terminate at any time, regardless of whether that Trust Series has incurred losses, subject to the terms of the Trust Agreement. In particular, unforeseen circumstances, including the death, adjudication of incompetence, bankruptcy, dissolution, withdrawal or removal of USCF as the sponsor of the Trust could cause the Trust Series to terminate unless a successor is appointed in accordance with the Trust Agreement. Circumstances that could cause the sponsor to resign include, but at not limited to, if USCF determines market conditions, regulatory requirements, risk mitigation measures taken by a Trust Series, third parties, or otherwise that would lead the Trust Series to determine that it could no longer foreseeably meet its investment objective or that the Trust Series aggregate net assets in relation to its operating expenses or its margin or collateral requirements make the continued operation of the Trust Series unreasonable or imprudent. In addition, USCF may terminate a Trust Series if it determines that the Trust Series aggregate net assets in relation to its operating expenses make the continued operation of the Trust Series unreasonable or imprudent. However, no level of losses will require USCF to terminate a Trust Series. A Trust Series termination would the liquidation result of its assets and the distribution of the proceeds thereof, first to creditors and then to shareholders in accordance with their positive book capital account balances, after giving effect to all contributions, distributions, and allocations for all periods, and the Trust Series could incur losses in liquidating its assets in connection with a termination. Termination could also negatively affect the overall maturity and timing of an investor s investment portfolio. The Trust Series do not expect to make cash distributions. No Trust Series has previously made any cash distributions and intends to reinvest any realized gains in additional Commodity Interests rather than distributing cash to shareholders. Therefore, unlike mutual funds, commodity pools or other investment pools that actively manage their investments in an attempt to realize income and gains from their investing activities and distribute such income and gains to their investors, a Trust Series generally does not expect to distribute cash. An investor should not invest in a Trust Series if the investor will need cash distributions from the Trust Series to pay taxes on its share of income and gains of a Trust Series, if any, or for any other reason. Nonetheless, although a Trust Series does not intend to make cash distributions, the income earned from its investments held directly or posted as margin may reach levels that merit distribution, e.g., at levels where such income is not necessary to support its underlying investments in Commodity Interests and investors adversely react to being taxed on such income without receiving distributions that could be used to pay such tax. If this income becomes significant then cash distributions may be made. An unanticipated number of redemption requests during a short period of time could have an adverse effect on a Trust Series NAV. If a substantial number of requests for redemption of Redemption Baskets are received by a Trust Series during a relatively short period of time, such Trust Series may not be able to satisfy the requests from the Trust Series assets not committed to trading. As a consequence, it could be necessary to liquidate positions in a Trust Series trading positions before the time that the trading strategies would otherwise dictate liquidation. The suspension in the ability of Authorized Participants to purchase Creation Baskets could cause a Trust Series NAV to differ materially from its trading price. In the event that there was a suspension in the ability of Authorized Participants to purchase additional Creation Baskets, Authorized Participants and other groups that make a market in shares of a Trust Series would likely still continue to actively trade the shares. However, in such a situation, Authorized Participants and other market makers may seek to adjust the market they make in the shares. Specifically, such market participants may increase the spread between the prices that they quote for offers to buy and sell shares to allow them to adjust to the potential uncertainty as to when they might be able to purchase additional Creation Baskets of shares. In addition, Authorized Participants may be less willing to offer to quote offers to buy or sell shares in large numbers. The potential impact 
 53 

Table of Contents 
 of either wider spreads between bid and offer prices, or reduced number of shares on which quotes may be available, could increase the trading costs to investors in the Trust Series compared to the quotes and the number of shares on which bids and offers are made if the Authorized Participants still were able to freely create new baskets of shares. In addition, there could be a significant variation between the market price at which shares are traded and the shares NAV, which is also the price shares can be redeemed with the Trust Series by Authorized Participants in Redemption Baskets. The foregoing could also create significant deviations from the Trust Series investment objective. Any potential impact to the market for shares of the Trust Series that could occur from the Authorized Participant s inability to create new baskets would likely not extend beyond the time when additional shares would be registered and available for distribution. A Trust Series may determine that to allow it to reinvest the proceeds from sales of its Creation Baskets in currently permitted assets in a manner that meets its investment objective it may limit its offers of Creation Baskets. A Trust Series may determine to limit the issuance of its shares through the offering of Creation Baskets to its Authorized Participants. As a result of certain circumstances described herein, including (1) the need to comply with regulatory requirements (including, but not limited to, exchange accountability levels and position limits); (2) market conditions (including but not limited to those allowing USCI to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing); and (3) risk mitigation measures taken by the Trust Series current and other FCMs that limit the Trust Series and other market participants from investing in particular commodity futures contracts, a Trust Series management can determine that it will limit the issuance of shares and the offerings of Creation Baskets because it is unable to invest the proceeds from such offerings in investments that would permit it to reasonably meet its investment objective. If such a determination is made, the same consequences associated with a suspension of the offering of Creation Baskets, as described in the foregoing risk factor, the suspension in the ability of Authorized Participants to purchase Creation Baskets could cause a Trust Series NAV to differ materially from its trading price could occur. In a rising rate environment, the Trust Series may not be able to fully invest at prevailing rates until any current investments in Treasury Bills mature in order to avoid selling those investments at a loss. When interest rates rise, the value of fixed income securities typically falls. In a rising interest rate environment, a Trust Series may not be able to fully invest at prevailing rates until any current investments in Treasury Bills mature in order to avoid selling those investments at a loss. Interest rate risk is generally lower for shorter term investments and higher for longer term investments. The risk to the Trust Series of rising interest rates may be greater in the future due to the end of a long period of historically low rates, the effect of potential monetary policy initiatives, including actions taken by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other foreign equivalents to curb inflation, and resulting market reaction to those initiatives. When interest rates fall, the Trust Series may be required to reinvest the proceeds from the sale, redemption or early prepayment of a Treasury Bill or money market security at a lower interest rate. A Trust Series may potentially lose money by investing in government money market funds. The Trust Series invests in government money market funds. Although such government money market funds seek to preserve the value of an investment at 1.00 per share, there is no guarantee that they will be able to do so and a Trust Series may lose money by investing in a government money market fund. An investment in a government money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, referred to herein as the FDIC, or any other government agency. The share price of a government money market fund can fall below the 1.00 share price. No Trust Series can rely on or expect a government money market fund s adviser or its affiliates to enter into support agreements or take other actions to maintain the government money market fund s 1.00 share price. The credit quality of a government money market fund s holdings can change rapidly in certain markets, and the default of a single holding could have an adverse impact on the government money market fund s share price. Due to fluctuations in interest rates, the market value of securities held by a government money market fund may vary. A government money market fund s share price can also be negatively affected during periods of high redemption pressures and/or illiquid markets. The failure or bankruptcy of a clearing broker of the Trust Series custodian could result in a substantial loss of the Trust Series assets and could impair the Trust Series in its ability to execute trades. The CEA and CFTC regulations impose several requirements on FCMs and clearing houses that are designed to protect customers, including mandating the implementation of risk management programs, internal monitoring and controls, capital and liquidity standards, customer disclosures, and auditing and examination programs. In particular, the CEA and CFTC regulations require FCMs and clearing houses to segregate all funds received from customers from proprietary assets. There can be no assurance that the requirements imposed by the CEA and CFTC regulations will prevent losses to, or not materially adversely affect, Trust Series or its investors. 
 54 

Table of Contents 
 In particular, in the event of an FCM s or clearing house s bankruptcy, Trust Series could be limited to recovering either a pro rata share of all available funds segregated on behalf of the FCM s combined customer accounts or Trust Series may not recover any assets at all. Trust Series may also incur a loss of any unrealized profits on its open and closed positions. This is because if such a bankruptcy were to occur, Trust Series would be afforded the protections granted to customers of an FCM, and participants to transactions cleared through a clearing house, under the United States Bankruptcy Code and applicable CFTC regulations. Such provisions generally provide for a pro rata distribution to customers of customer property held by the bankrupt FCM or an Exchange s clearing house if the customer property held by the FCM or the Exchange s clearing house is insufficient to satisfy all customer claims. Bankruptcy of a clearing FCM can be caused by, among other things, the default of one of the FCM s customers. In this event, the Exchange s clearing house is permitted to use the entire amount of margin posted by Trust Series (as well as margin posted by other customers of the FCM) to cover the amounts owed by the bankrupt FCM. Consequently, Trust Series could be unable to recover amounts due to it on its futures positions, including assets posted as margin, and could sustain substantial losses. Notwithstanding that Trust Series could sustain losses upon the failure or bankruptcy of its FCM, the majority of Trust Series assets are held in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents with the Custodian and would not be impacted by the bankruptcy of an FCM. The failure or bankruptcy of the Trust Series Custodian could result in a substantial loss of the Trust Series assets. The majority of a Trust Series assets are held in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents with the Custodian. The insolvency of the Custodian could result in a complete loss of a Trust Series assets held by that Custodian, which, at any given time, would likely comprise a substantial portion of such Trust Series total assets. The liability of SummerHaven is limited, and the value of the shares may be adversely affected if USCF and any Trust Series are required to indemnify SummerHaven. Under the licensing agreement among SHIM, SummerHaven and USCF, and the advisory agreement between SummerHaven and USCF, none of SHIM, SummerHaven and its affiliates, nor any of their respective officers, directors, shareholders, members, partners, employees and any person who controls SHIM or SummerHaven is liable to USCF or any Trust Series absent willful misconduct, gross negligence, bad faith, or material breaches of applicable law or the applicable agreement on the part of SHIM or SummerHaven. In addition, SHIM, SummerHaven and its officers, directors, shareholders, members, partners, employees, and any person who controls SHIM or SummerHaven or their representatives, agents, attorneys, service providers, successors and assigns have the right to be indemnified, defended and held harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, obligations, judgments, causes of action, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) (collectively, Losses in connection with or arising out of the licensing agreement or advisory agreement, unless such Losses result from any willful misconduct, gross negligence or bad faith on the part of SHIM or SummerHaven, or a material breach by USCF of applicable law or the applicable agreement. Furthermore, SHIM, SummerHaven will not be liable to USCF or any Trust Series for any indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages, even if SHIM or SummerHaven or an authorized representative of SummerHaven has been advised of the possibility of such damages. The liability of USCF and the Trustee are limited, and the value of the shares will be adversely affected if any Trust Series is required to indemnify the Trustee or USCF. Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee and USCF are not liable, and have the right to be indemnified, for any liability or expense incurred absent gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Trustee or USCF or breach by USCF of the Trust Agreement, as the case may be. As a result, USCF may require the assets of any Trust Series to be sold in order to cover losses or liability suffered by it or by the Trustee. Any sale of that kind would reduce the NAV of such Trust Series and the value of its shares. Although the shares of each Trust Series are limited liability investments, certain circumstances such as bankruptcy or indemnification of a Trust Series by a shareholder will increase the shareholder s liability. The shares of each Trust Series are limited liability investments; shareholders may not lose more than the amount that they invest plus any profits recognized on their investment. However, shareholders could be required, as a matter of bankruptcy law, to return to the estate of a Trust Series any distribution they received at a time when such Trust Series was in fact insolvent or in violation of its Trust Agreement. In addition, a number of states do not have statutory trust statutes such as the Delaware statutes under which the Trust has been formed in the State of Delaware. It is possible that a court in such state could hold that, due to the absence of any statutory provision to the contrary in such jurisdiction, the shareholders, although entitled under Delaware law to the same limitation on personal liability as stockholders in a private corporation for profit organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, are not so entitled in such state. Finally, in the event the Trust or any Trust Series is made a party to any claim, dispute, demand or litigation or otherwise incurs any 
 55 

Table of Contents 
 liability or expense as a result of or in connection with any shareholder s (or assignee s) obligations or liabilities unrelated to the business of the Trust or such Trust Series, as applicable, such shareholder (or assignees cumulatively) is required under the Trust Agreement to indemnify the Trust or such Trust Series, as applicable, for all such liability and expense incurred, including attorneys and accountants fees. Investors cannot be assured of the continuation of the agreement between SummerHaven and USCF for use of an Applicable Index, and discontinuance of an Applicable Index may be detrimental to a Trust Series. Investors cannot be assured that the license agreement between SHIM and USCF for use of an Applicable Index will continue for any length of time. Should the agreement between SHIM and USCF for use of an Applicable Index be terminated, USCF will be required to find a replacement index, which may have an adverse effect on a Trust Series. Investors cannot be assured of SummerHaven s continued services, and discontinuance may be detrimental to a Trust Series. Investors cannot be assured that SummerHaven will be willing or able to continue to service each Trust Series for any length of time. SummerHaven was formed for the purpose of providing investment advisory services, and provides these services to each Trust Series on a contractual basis pursuant to a licensing agreement and an advisory agreement. If SummerHaven discontinues its activities on behalf of any Trust Series, such Trust Series may be adversely affected. If SummerHaven s registration with the CFTC or membership in the NFA were revoked or suspended, SummerHaven would no longer be able to provide services to any Trust Series. All of the Trust Series are series of the Trust and, as a result, a court could potentially conclude that the assets and liabilities of one Trust Series are not segregated from those of another Trust Series, thereby potentially exposing assets in one Trust Series to the liabilities of another Trust Series . Each Trust Series is a series of a Delaware statutory trust and not itself a separate legal entity. The Delaware Statutory Trust Act provides that if certain provisions are included in the formation and governing documents of a statutory trust organized in series and if separate and distinct records are maintained for any series and the assets associated with that series are held in separate and distinct records and are accounted for in such separate and distinct records separately from the other assets of the statutory trust, or any series thereof, then the debts, liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred by a particular series are enforceable against the assets of such series only, and not against the assets of the statutory trust generally or any other series thereof. Conversely, none of the debts, liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred with respect to any other series thereof shall be enforceable against the assets of such series. USCF is not aware of any court case that has interpreted this Inter-Series Limitation on Liability or provided any guidance as to what is required for compliance. USCF intends to maintain separate and distinct records for each Trust Series and account for each Trust Series separately from any other series of the Trust, but it is possible a court could conclude that the methods used do not satisfy the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, which would potentially expose assets in one series to the liabilities of another Trust Series. The Trust Agreement Limits the Forum in Which Claims May be Brought Against USCF, the Trust, the Trustee or their Respective Directors and Officers. The rights of USCF, the Trust, the Trust Series, DTC (as registered owner of the Trust Series global certificate for shares) and the shareholders are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware. USCF, the Trust, the Trust Series and DTC and, by accepting shares, each DTC Participant and each shareholder, consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and any federal courts located in Delaware other than for a person to assert a claim of Delaware jurisdiction over USCF, the Trust or the Trust Series. As a result, any claims, suits, actions or proceedings arising out of or relating in any way to the 1933 Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), the Trust, the Delaware Statutory Trust Act (the Trust Act ), the Trust Agreement or asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs (or similar) doctrine (including, without limitation, any claims, suits, actions or proceedings to interpret, apply or enforce (i) the provisions of the Trust Agreement, or (ii) the duties (including fiduciary duties), obligations or liabilities of the Trust to USCF, the shareholders or the Trustee, or of USCF or the Trustee to the Trust, to the shareholders or each other, or (iii) the rights or powers of, or restrictions on, the Trust, the Trustee or the shareholders, or (iv) any provision of the Trust Act or other laws of the State of Delaware pertaining to trusts made applicable to the Trust pursuant to the Trust Act, or (v) any other instrument, document, agreement or certificate contemplated by any provision of the Trust Act or the Trust Agreement relating in any way to the Trust, shall be exclusively brought in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction thereof, any other court in the State of Delaware with subject matter jurisdiction.

 We believe this provision benefits us and the shareholders: (1) by having disputes resolved by a forum with the experience and established precedent for resolving these types of disputes under Delaware law, (2) by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law in the types of lawsuits to which it applies, and, (3) as a result of the foregoing, limiting the time cost and uncertainty of litigation. However, this provision may limit the right of a Trust Series shareholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum they believe is more favorable for its disputes against USCF, the Trust, or the Trustee. In addition, it may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against USCF, the Trust, the Trustee, or their respective directors and officers. Although the Trust Agreement contains the exclusive choice of forum provision described above and such provisions are expressly permitted under the Trust Act, there are no court cases that we are aware of that have interpreted the Trust Act in this regard and thus, it is possible that a court could rule that such a provision is inapplicable for a particular claim or action or that such provision is unenforceable. With the validity and enforceability of exclusive forum selection provisions still somewhat in question outside of the State of Delaware, there may be increased litigation over such provisions. Challenging shareholders might bring actions in courts outside of Delaware to attack a forum selection clause that specifies Delaware as the exclusive jurisdiction. A non-Delaware court could view negatively a forum selection clause in favor of Delaware, in particular, because such a provision may appear to divest the non-Delaware court of its legal jurisdiction. Section 27 of the Exchange Act vests exclusive federal jurisdiction for all claims brought to enforce any duty or liability created under the Exchange Act. Therefore, any exclusive forum selection clauses will not apply to any such claim. In addition, Section 22 of the 1933 Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the 1933 Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce an exclusive forum selection clause in connection with claims arising under the 1933 Act and/or the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, and in any event, stockholders will not be deemed to have waived the Company s compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. USCF and the Trustee are not obligated to prosecute any action, suit or other proceeding in respect of any Trust Series property. Neither USCF nor the Trustee is obligated to, although each may in its respective discretion, prosecute any action, suit or other proceeding in respect of any Trust Series property. The Trust Agreement does not confer upon shareholders the right to prosecute any such action, suit or other proceeding. Third parties may infringe upon or otherwise violate intellectual property rights or assert that USCF has infringed or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights, which may result in significant costs and diverted attention. It is possible that third parties might utilize a Trust Series intellectual property or technology, including the use of its business methods, trademarks and trading program software, without permission. USCF has a patent for each Trust Series business method and has registered its trademarks. The Trust Series do not currently have any proprietary software. However, if it obtains proprietary software in the future, any unauthorized use of a Trust Series proprietary software and other technology could also adversely affect its competitive advantage. The Trust Series may not have adequate resources to implement procedures for monitoring unauthorized uses of its patents, trademarks, proprietary software and other technology. Also, third parties may independently develop business methods, trademarks or proprietary software and other technology similar to that of USCF or claim that USCF has violated their intellectual property rights, including their copyrights, trademark rights, trade names, trade secrets and patent rights. As a result, USCF may have to litigate in the future to protect its trade secrets, determine the validity and scope of other parties proprietary rights, defend itself against claims that it has infringed or otherwise violated other parties rights, or defend itself against claims that its rights are invalid. Any litigation of this type, even if USCF is successful and regardless of the merits, may result in significant costs, divert its resources from the Trust Series, or require it to change its proprietary software and other technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements.

 Due to the increased use of technologies, intentional and unintentional cyber-attacks pose operational and information security risks. With the increased use of technologies such as the Internet and the dependence on computer systems to perform necessary business functions, the Funds are susceptible to operational and information security risks. In general, cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events such as a cyber-attack against Fund, a natural catastrophe, an industrial accident, failure of the Trust s disaster recovery systems, or consequential employee error. Cyber-attacks include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Cyber-attacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites. Cyber security failures or breaches of a Fund s clearing broker or third party service provider (including, but not limited to, index providers, the administrator and transfer agent, the custodian), have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially resulting in financial losses, the inability of Fund shareholders to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs. Adverse effects can become particularly acute if those events affect Fund s electronic data processing, transmission, storage, and retrieval systems, or impact the availability, integrity, or confidentiality of our data. In addition, a service provider that has experienced a cyber-security incident may divert resources normally devoted to servicing a Trust Series to addressing the incident, which would be likely to have an adverse effect on a Trust Series operations. Cyber-attacks may also cause disruptions to the futures exchanges and clearinghouses through which a Trust Series invests in futures contracts, which could result in disruptions to a Trust Series ability to pursue its investment objective, resulting in financial losses to a Trust Series and its shareholders. In addition, substantial costs may be incurred in order to prevent any cyber incidents in the future. A Trust Series and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result. While USCF and the Related Public Funds, including a Trust Series, have established business continuity plans, there are inherent limitations in such plans, including the possibility that certain risks have not been identified or that new risks will emerge before countervailing measures can be implemented. Furthermore, a Trust Series cannot control cybersecurity plans and systems of its service providers, market makers or Authorized Participants. A Trust Series investment returns could be negatively affected by climate change and greenhouse gas restrictions. Driven by concern over the risks of climate change, a number of countries have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or production and use of oil and gas. These include adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, trade tariffs, minimum renewable usage requirements, restrictive permitting, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. Political and other actors and their agents increasingly seek to advance climate change objectives indirectly, such as by seeking to reduce the availability of or increase the cost for, financial and investment in the oil and gas sector and taking actions intended to promote changes in business strategy for oil and gas companies. Many governments are also providing tax advantages and other subsidies to support transitioning to alternative energy sources or mandating the use of specific fuels other than oil or natural gas. Depending on how policies are formulated and applied, they could have the potential to negatively affect a Trust Series investment returns and make oil and natural gas products more expensive or less competitive. USCF is the subject of class action, derivative, and other litigation. In light of the inherent uncertainties involved in litigation matters, an adverse outcome in this litigation could materially adversely affect USCF s financial condition. USCF and USCF s directors and certain of its officers are currently subject to class action litigation. Estimating an amount or range of possible losses resulting from litigation proceedings to USCF is inherently difficult and requires an extensive degree of judgment, particularly where the matters involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages and are subject to appeal. In addition, because most legal proceedings are resolved over extended periods of time, potential losses are subject to change due to, among other things, new developments, changes in legal strategy, the outcome of intermediate procedural and substantive rulings and other parties settlement posture and their evaluation of the strength or weakness of their case against USCF. For these reasons, we are currently unable to predict the ultimate timing or outcome of, or reasonably estimate the possible losses or a range of possible losses resulting therefrom. In light of the inherent uncertainties involved in such matters, an adverse outcome in this litigation could materially adversely affect USCF s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in any particular reporting period. In addition, litigation could result in substantial costs and divert USCF s management s attention and resources from conducting USCF s operations, including the management of the Trust Series and the other Related Public Funds. For more information, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings in this annual report on Form 10-K.

 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. Not applicable. Item 2. Properties. Not applicable. Item 3. Legal Proceedings . From time to time, a Trust Series may be involved in legal proceedings arising primarily from the ordinary course of its business. None of the Trust Series is currently party to any material legal proceedings. In addition, USCF, as sponsor of the Trust and general partner of the Related Public Funds may, from time to time, be involved in litigation arising out of its operations in the ordinary course of its business. Except as described herein, USCF is not currently party to any material legal proceedings. Optimum Strategies Action On April 6, 2022, USO and USCF were named as defendants in an action filed by Optimum Strategies Fund I, LP, a purported investor in call option contracts on USO (the Optimum Strategies Action ). The action is pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut at Civil Action No. 3:22-cv-00511. The Optimum Strategies Action asserts claims under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act ), Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the Connecticut Uniform Securities Act. It purports to challenge statements in registration statements that became effective in February 2020, March 2020, and on April 20, 2020, as well as public statements between February 2020 and May 2020, in connection with certain extraordinary market conditions and the attendant risks that caused the demand for oil to fall precipitously, including the COVID-19 global pandemic and the Saudi Arabia-Russia oil price war. The complaint seeks damages, interest, costs, attorney s fees, and equitable relief. USCF and USO intend to vigorously contest such claims and have moved for their dismissal. Settlement of SEC and CFTC Investigations On November 8, 2021, USCF and USO announced a resolution with each of the SEC and the CFTC relating to matters set forth in certain Wells Notices issued by the staffs of each of the SEC and CFTC as more fully described below. On August 17, 2020, USCF, USO, and John Love received a Wells Notice from the staff of the SEC (the SEC Wells Notice ). The SEC Wells Notice stated that the SEC staff made a preliminary determination to recommend that the SEC file an enforcement action against USCF, USO, and Mr. Love alleging violations of Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 1933 Act ), and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act ), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Subsequently, on August 19, 2020, USCF, USO, and Mr. Love received a Wells Notice from the staff of the CFTC (the CFTC Wells Notice ). The CFTC Wells Notice stated that the CFTC staff made a preliminary determination to recommend that the CFTC file an enforcement action against USCF, USO, and Mr. Love alleging violations of Sections 4o(1)(A) and (B) and 6(c)(1) of the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936, as amended (the CEA ), 7 U.S.C. 6o(1)(A) and (B) and 9(1) (2018), and CFTC Regulations 4.26, 4.41, and 180.1(a), 17 C.F.R. 4.26, 4.41, 180.1(a) (2019). On November 8, 2021, acting pursuant to an offer of settlement submitted by USCF and USO, the SEC issued an order instituting cease-and-desist proceedings, making findings, and imposing a cease-and-desist order pursuant to Section 8A of the 1933 Act, directing USCF and USO to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of Section 17(a)(3) of the 1933 Act, 15 U.S.C. 77q(a)(3) (the SEC Order ). In the SEC Order, the SEC made findings that, from April 24, 2020 to May 21, 2020, USCF and USO violated Section 17(a)(3) of 1933 Act, which provides that it is unlawful for any person in the offer or sale of any securities to engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the purchaser. USCF and USO consented to entry of the SEC Order without admitting or denying the findings contained therein, except as to jurisdiction. Separately, on November 8, 2021, acting pursuant to an offer of settlement submitted by USCF, the CFTC issued an order instituting cease-and-desist proceedings, making findings, and imposing a cease-and-desist order pursuant to Section 6(c) and (d) of the CEA, directing USCF to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of Section 4o(1)(B) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. 6o(1) (B), and CFTC Regulation 4.41(a)(2), 17 C.F.R. 4.41(a)(2) (the CFTC Order ). In the CFTC Order, the CFTC made findings that, from on or about April 22, 2020 to June 12, 2020, USCF violated Section 4o(1)(B) of the CEA and CFTC Regulation 4.41(a)(2), which make it unlawful for any commodity pool operator CPO to engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any client or participant or prospective client or participant and prohibit a CPO from advertising in a manner which

 operates as a fraud or deceit upon any client or participant or prospective client or participant, respectively. USCF consented to entry of the CFTC Order without admitting or denying the findings contained therein, except as to jurisdiction. Pursuant to the SEC Order and the CFTC Order, in addition to the command to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of Section 17(a)(3) of the 1933 Act, Section 4o(1)(B) of the CEA, and CFTC Regulation 4.14(a)(2), civil monetary penalties totaling two million five hundred thousand dollars 2,500,000) in the aggregate were required to be paid to the SEC and CFTC, of which one million two hundred fifty thousand dollars 1,250,000) was paid by USCF to each of the SEC and the CFTC, respectively, pursuant to the offsets permitted under the orders. In re: United States Oil Fund, LP Securities Litigation On June 19, 2020, USCF, USO, John P. Love, and Stuart P. Crumbaugh were named as defendants in a putative class action filed by purported shareholder Robert Lucas (the Lucas Class Action ). The Court thereafter consolidated the Lucas Class Action with two related putative class actions filed on July 31, 2020 and August 13, 2020, and appointed a lead plaintiff. The consolidated class action is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York under the caption In re: United States Oil Fund, LP Securities Litigation, Civil Action No. 1:20-cv-04740. On November 30, 2020, the lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint (the Amended Lucas Class Complaint ). The Amended Lucas Class Complaint asserts claims under the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act, and Rule 10b-5. The Amended Lucas Class Complaint challenges statements in registration statements that became effective on February 25, 2020 and March 23, 2020 as well as subsequent public statements through April 2020 concerning certain extraordinary market conditions and the attendant risks that caused the demand for oil to fall precipitously, including the COVID-19 global pandemic and the Saudi Arabia-Russia oil price war. The Amended Lucas Class Complaint purports to have been brought by an investor in USO on behalf of a class of similarly-situated shareholders who purchased USO securities between February 25, 2020 and April 28, 2020 and pursuant to the challenged registration statements. The Amended Lucas Class Complaint seeks to certify a class and to award the class compensatory damages at an amount to be determined at trial as well as costs and attorney s fees. The Amended Lucas Class Complaint named as defendants USCF, USO, John P. Love, Stuart P. Crumbaugh, Nicholas D. Gerber, Andrew F Ngim, Robert L. Nguyen, Peter M. Robinson, Gordon L.

The Wang Class Action asserted federal securities claims under the 1933 Act, challenging disclosures in a March 19, 2020 registration statement. It alleged that the defendants failed to disclose to investors in USO certain extraordinary market conditions and the attendant risks that caused the demand for oil to fall precipitously, including the COVID-19 global pandemic and the Saudi Arabia-Russia oil price war. The Wang Class Action was voluntarily dismissed on August 4, 2020. Mehan Action On August 10, 2020, purported shareholder Darshan Mehan filed a derivative action on behalf of nominal defendant USO, against defendants USCF, John P. Love, Stuart P. Crumbaugh, Nicholas D. Gerber, Andrew F Ngim, Robert L. Nguyen, Peter M. Robinson, Gordon L. Ellis, and Malcolm R. Fobes, III (the Mehan Action ).

 The Mehan Action alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to USO and failed to act in good faith in connection with a March 19, 2020 registration statement and offering and disclosures regarding certain extraordinary market conditions that caused demand for oil to fall precipitously, including the COVID-19 global pandemic and the Saudi Arabia-Russia oil price war. The complaint seeks, on behalf of USO, compensatory damages, restitution, equitable relief, attorney s fees, and costs. All proceedings in the Mehan Action are stayed pending disposition of the motion(s) to dismiss in In re: United States Oil Fund, LP Securities Litigation. USCF, USO, and the other defendants intend to vigorously contest such claims. In re United States Oil Fund, LP Derivative Litigation On August 27, 2020, purported shareholders Michael Cantrell and AML Pharm. Inc. DBA Golden International filed two separate derivative actions on behalf of nominal defendant USO, against defendants USCF, John P. Love, Stuart P. Crumbaugh, Andrew F Ngim, Gordon L. Ellis, Malcolm R. Fobes, III, Nicholas D. Gerber, Robert L. Nguyen, and Peter M. Robinson in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York at Civil Action No. 1:20-cv-06974 (the Cantrell Action and Civil Action No. 1:20-cv-06981 (the AML Action ), respectively. The complaints in the Cantrell and AML Actions are nearly identical. They each allege violations of Sections 10(b), 20(a) and 21D of the 1934 Act, Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and common law claims of breach of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, and waste of corporate assets. These allegations stem from USO s disclosures and defendants alleged actions in light of the extraordinary market conditions in 2020 that caused demand for oil to fall precipitously, including the COVID-19 global pandemic and the Saudi Arabia-Russia oil price war. The complaints seek, on behalf of USO, compensatory damages, restitution, equitable relief, attorney s fees, and costs. The plaintiffs in the Cantrell and AML Actions have marked their actions as related to the Lucas Class Action. The Court consolidated the Cantrell and AML Actions under the caption In re United States Oil Fund, LP Derivative Litigation, Civil Action No. 1:20-cv-06974 and appointed co-lead counsel. All proceedings in In re United States Oil Fund, LP Derivative Litigation are stayed pending disposition of the motion(s) to dismiss in In re: United States Oil Fund, LP Securities Litigation.

 Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto of the Trust included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Forward-Looking Information This annual report on Form 10-K, including this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward-looking statements regarding the plans and objectives of management for future operations. This information may involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the Trust s actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. The Trust believes these factors include, but are not limited to, the following: changes in inflation in the United States, movements in U.S. and foreign currencies, market volatility in the commodities markets, in part attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic that began in February 2020 and Russia s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Forward-looking statements, which involve assumptions and describe the Trust s future plans, strategies and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words may, will, should, expect, anticipate, estimate, believe, intend or project, the negative of these words, other variations on these words or comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that may be incorrect, and the Trust cannot assure investors that the projections included in these forward-looking statements will come to pass. The Trust s actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. The Trust has based the forward-looking statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K on information available to it on the date of this annual report on Form 10-K, and the Trust assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Although the Trust undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, investors are advised to consult any additional disclosures that the Trust may make directly to them or through reports that the Trust files in the future with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Introduction Each Trust Series is a commodity pool that issues shares representing fractional undivided beneficial interests in such Trust Series that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca. The Trust Series are series of the Trust, a Delaware statutory trust formed on December 21, 2009. United States Commodity Index Fund USCI invests in futures contracts for commodities that are traded on the Futures Exchanges and, to a lesser extent, in order to comply with regulatory requirements or in view of market conditions, Other Commodity-Related Investments. Market conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause USCI to invest in Other Commodity Related Investments include, but are not limited to, those allowing USCI to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing. The investment objective of USCI is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares per share net asset value NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the SummerHaven Dynamic Commodity Index Total Return SM (the SDCI ), less USCI s expenses. USCI seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing so that the average daily percentage change in USCI s NAV for any period of 30 successive valuation days will be within plus/minus 10 percent (10 of the average daily percentage change in the price of the SDCI over the same period. The SDCI is designed to reflect the performance of a diversified group of commodities. The SDCI is owned and maintained by SummerHaven Index Management, LLC SHIM and is calculated and published by Bloomberg L.P. Futures contracts for the commodities comprising the SDCI are traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange NYMEX ), ICE Futures ICE Futures ), Chicago Board of Trade CBOT ), Chicago Mercantile Exchange CME ), London Metal Exchange LME ), and Commodity Exchange, Inc. COMEX (the NYMEX, ICE Futures, CBOT, CME, LME and COMEX, collectively, the Futures Exchanges and are collectively referred to herein as Futures Contracts. The Futures Contracts that at any given time make up the SDCI are referred to herein as Benchmark Component Futures Contracts. The relative weighting of the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts will change on a monthly basis, based on quantitative formulas relating to the prices of the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts developed by SHIM.

 USCI seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing to the fullest extent possible in the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts. Then, if constrained by regulatory requirements or in view of market conditions, USCI will invest next in other Futures Contracts based on the same commodity as the futures contracts subject to such regulatory constraints or market conditions, and finally, to a lesser extent, in other exchange-traded futures contracts that are economically identical or substantially similar to the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts if one or more other Futures Contracts is not available. When USCI has invested to the fullest extent possible in exchange-traded futures contracts, USCI may then invest in other contracts and instruments based on the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts, other Futures Contracts or the commodities included in the SDCI, such as cash-settled options, forward contracts, cleared swap contracts and swap contracts other than cleared swap contracts. Other exchange-traded futures contracts that are economically identical or substantially similar to the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts and other contracts and instruments based on the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts are collectively referred to as Other Commodity-Related Investments, and together with Benchmark Component Futures Contracts and other Futures Contracts, Commodity Interests. USCI seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing so that the average daily percentage change in USCI s NAV for any period of 30 successive valuation days will be within plus/minus 10 percent (10 of the average daily percentage change in the price of the SDCI over the same period. USCF believes that the market arbitrage opportunities will cause the daily changes in USCI s share price on the NYSE Arca on a percentage basis to closely track the daily changes in USCI s per share NAV on a percentage basis. USCF believes that the net effect of this expected relationship and the expected relationship described above between USCI s per share NAV and the SDCI will be that the daily changes in the price of USCI s shares on the NYSE Arca on a percentage basis will closely track the daily changes in the SDCI on a percentage basis, less USCI s expenses. While USCI is composed of Benchmark Component Futures Contracts and is therefore a measure of the prices of the corresponding commodities comprising the SDCI for future delivery, there is nonetheless expected to be a reasonable degree of correlation between the SDCI and the cash or spot prices of the commodities underlying the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts. Investors should be aware that USCI s investment objective is not for its NAV or market price of shares to equal, in dollar terms, the spot prices of the commodities underlying the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts or the prices of any particular group of futures contracts. USCI will not seek to achieve its stated investment objective over a period of time greater than one day. This is because natural market forces called contango and backwardation have impacted the total return on an investment in USCI s shares during the past year relative to a hypothetical direct investment in the various commodities and, in the future, it is likely that the relationship between the market price of USCI s shares and changes in the spot prices of the underlying commodities will continue to be so impacted by contango and backwardation. (It is important to note that the disclosure above ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing the commodities, which could be substantial.) As of December 31, 2022, USCI held 911 Futures Contracts on the NYMEX, held 2,499 Futures Contracts on the ICE Futures, held 1,419 Futures Contracts on the CBOT, did not hold any Futures Contracts on the CME, held 1,017 Futures Contracts on the LME and held 191 Futures Contracts on the COMEX, totaling 6,037 futures contracts. United States Copper Index Fund CPER invests in Futures Contracts for commodities that are traded on the COMEX and, to a lesser extent, in order to comply with regulatory requirements or in view of market conditions, Other Copper-Related Investments. Market conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause CPER to invest in Other Copper-Related Investments include, but are not limited to, those allowing CPER to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing. The investment objective of CPER is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares per share NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the SummerHaven Copper Index Total Return SM (the SCI ), less CPER s expenses. CPER seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing so that the average daily percentage change in CPER s NAV for any period of 30 successive valuation days will be within plus/minus 10 percent (10 of the average daily percentage change in the price of the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts over the same period. The SCI is designed to reflect the performance of the investment returns from a portfolio of copper futures contracts on the COMEX. The SCI is owned and maintained by SHIM and calculated and published by the NYSE Arca. The SCI is comprised of either one or three Eligible Copper Futures Contracts that are selected on a monthly basis based on quantitative formulas relating to the prices of the Eligible Copper Futures Contracts developed by SHIM. The Eligible Copper Futures Contracts that at any given time make up the SCI are referred to herein as Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts.

 CPER seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing to the fullest extent possible in the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts. Then, if constrained by regulatory requirements or in view of market conditions, CPER will invest next in other Eligible Copper Futures Contracts based on the same copper as the futures contracts subject to such regulatory constraints or market conditions, and finally to a lesser extent, in other exchange traded futures contracts that are economically identical or substantially similar to the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts if one or more other Eligible Copper Futures Contracts is not available. When CPER has invested to the fullest extent possible in exchange-traded futures contracts, CPER may then invest in other contracts and instruments based on the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts, other Eligible Copper Futures Contracts or other items based on copper, such as cash-settled options, forward contracts, cleared swap contracts and swap contracts other than cleared swap contracts. Other exchange-traded futures contracts that are economically identical or substantially similar to the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts and other contracts and instruments based on the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts, are collectively referred to collectively as Other Copper-Related Investments, and together with Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts and other Eligible Copper Futures Contracts, Copper Interests. CPER seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing so that the average daily percentage change in CPER s NAV for any period of 30 successive valuation days will be within plus/minus ten percent (10 of the average daily percentage change in the price of the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts over the same period. USCF believes that market arbitrage opportunities will cause daily changes in CPER s share price on the NYSE Arca on a percentage basis, to closely track the daily changes in CPER s per share NAV on a percentage basis. USCF believes that the net effect of this expected relationship and the expected relationship described above between CPER s per share NAV and the SCI will be that the daily changes in the price of CPER s shares on the NYSE Arca on a percentage basis will closely track the daily changes in the SCI on a percentage basis, less CPER s expenses. While CPER is composed of Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts and is therefore a measure of the prices of the corresponding commodities comprising the SCI for future delivery, there is nonetheless expected to be a reasonable degree of correlation between the SCI and the cash or spot prices of the commodities underlying the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts. Investors should be aware that CPER s investment objective is not for its NAV or market price of shares to equal, in dollar terms, the spot prices of the commodities underlying the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts or the prices of any particular group of futures contracts. CPER will not seek to achieve its stated investment objective over a period of time greater than one day. This is because natural market forces called contango and backwardation have impacted the total return on an investment in CPER s shares during the past year relative to a hypothetical direct investment in various commodities and, in the future, it is likely that the relationship between the market price of CPER s shares and changes in the spot prices of the underlying commodities will continue to be so impacted by contango and backwardation. (It is important to note that the disclosure above ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing the commodities, which could be substantial.) CPER s shares began trading on November 15, 2011. As of December 31, 2022, CPER held 1,779 Futures Contracts on the COMEX. Other Defined Terms The SCI, together with the SDCI, are referred to throughout this annual report on Form 10-K collectively as the Applicable Index or Indices. Benchmark Component Futures Contracts and Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts are referred to throughout this annual report on Form 10-Q collectively as Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts.

Commodity Interests and Copper Interests are collectively referred to herein as Applicable Interests throughout this annual report on Form 10-K. Regulatory Disclosure The regulation of commodity interest trading in the United States and other countries is an evolving area of the law. Below are certain key regulatory requirements that are, or may be, relevant to the Trust Series. The various statements made in this summary are subject to modification by legislative action and changes in the rules and regulations of the SEC, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA ), CFTC, NFA, the futures exchanges, clearing organizations and other regulatory bodies. Pending final resolution of all applicable regulatory requirements, some examples of how new rules and regulations could impact the Trust Series are discussed in Item 1. Business in this annual report on Form 10-K.

 Exchange Accountability Levels, Position Limits and Price Fluctuation Limits. Designated contract markets DCMs ), such as the NYMEX and ICE Futures, have established accountability levels and position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons under common trading control (other than as a hedge, which is not applicable to the Trust Series investments) may hold, own or control. These levels and position limits apply to the futures contracts that each Trust Series invests in to meet the investment objective of such Trust Series. In addition to accountability levels and position limits, the NYMEX and ICE Futures also set daily price fluctuation limits on futures contracts. The daily price fluctuation limit establishes the maximum amount that the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous day s settlement price. Once the daily price fluctuation limit has been reached in a particular futures contract, no trades may be made at a price beyond that limit. The accountability levels for the commodities comprising an Applicable Index and other futures contracts traded on U.S. based futures exchanges are not a fixed ceiling, but rather a threshold above which such exchanges may exercise greater scrutiny and control over an investor s positions. As of December 31, 2022, USCI held 911 Futures Contracts on the NYMEX, held 2,499 Futures Contracts on the ICE Futures, held 1,419 Futures Contracts on the CBOT, did not hold any Futures Contracts on the CME, held 1,017 Futures Contracts on the LME and held 191 Futures Contracts on the COMEX, totaling 6,037 futures contracts. As of December 31, 2022, CPER held 1,779 Futures Contracts on the COMEX. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, no Trust Series exceeded accountability levels imposed by the NYMEX, COMEX, CME, CBOT, LME or ICE Futures. Position limits differ from accountability levels in that they represent fixed limits on the maximum number of futures contracts that any person may hold and cannot allow such limits to be exceeded without express CFTC authority to do so. In addition to accountability levels and position limits that may apply at any time, the Futures Exchanges may impose position limits on contracts held in the last few days of trading in the near month contract to expire. It is unlikely that a Trust Series will run up against such position limits. A Trust Series does not typically hold the near month contract in its Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts. In addition, each Trust Series investment strategy is to close out its positions during each Rebalancing Period in advance of the period right before expiration and purchase new contracts. As such, none of the Trust Series anticipates that position limits that apply to the last few days prior to a contract s expiration will impact it. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, no Trust Series exceeded position limits imposed by the NYMEX, COMEX, CME, CBOT, LME or ICE Futures. Federal Position Limits In October 2020, the CFTC adopted a rule to establish federal position limits for 25 core referenced futures contracts (comprised of agricultural, energy and metals futures contracts), futures and options linked to the core referenced futures contracts, and swaps that are economically equivalent to the core referenced futures contracts (the Position Limits Rule ). The limits for futures contracts are currently in effect; the limits for economically equivalent swaps will become effective in 2023. Certain Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts are subject to position limits under the Position Limits Rule, and the trading by each Trust Series does not qualify for an exemption therefrom. Accordingly, the Position Limits Rule could negatively impact the ability of a Trust Series to meet its investment objectives by inhibiting USCF s ability to effectively invest the proceeds from sales of Creation Baskets of the Trust Series in particular amounts and types of its permitted investments. Margin for OTC Swaps Rules put in place by U.S. federal banking regulators, the CFTC and the SEC require the daily exchange of variation margin and initial margin for swaps between swap dealers, major swap participants, security-based swap dealers, and major security-based swap participants Swap Entities and swaps between Swap Entities and their counterparties that are financial end-users (such rules, the Margin Rules ). The Margin Rules require Swap Entities to exchange variation margin with all of their counterparties who are financial end-users. The minimum variation margin amount is the daily mark-to-market change in the value of the swap, taking into account the amount of variation margin previously posted or collected. Swap Entities are required to exchange initial margin with their financial end-users who have material swaps exposure (i.e., an average daily aggregate notional of 8 billion or more in non-cleared swaps calculated in accordance with the Margin Rules). The Margin Rules specify the types of collateral that may be posted or collected as initial margin or variation margin (generally cash, certain government, government-sponsored enterprise securities, certain liquid debt, certain equity securities, certain eligible publicly traded debt, and gold) and sets forth haircuts for certain collateral asset classes. No Trust Series is a Swap Entity under the Margin Rules, but each is a financial end-user. Accordingly, each Trust Series will be subject to the variation margin requirements of the Margin Rules for any swaps that it enters into. However, no Trust Series has material swaps exposure and, accordingly, no Trust Series will be subject to the initial margin requirements of the Margin Rules.

 Mandatory Trading and Clearing of Swaps CFTC regulations require that certain swap transactions be executed on organized exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through regulated clearing organizations derivative clearing organizations DCOs )), if the CFTC mandates the central clearing of a particular class of swap and such swap is made available to trade on a swap execution facility. Currently, swap dealers, major swap participants, commodity pools, certain private funds and entities predominantly engaged in activities that are financial in nature are required to execute on a swap execution facility, and clear, certain interest rate swaps and index-based credit default swaps. As a result, if a Trust Series enters into an interest rate or index-based credit default swap that is subject to these requirements, such swap will be required to be executed on a swap execution facility and centrally cleared. Mandatory clearing and made available to trade determinations with respect to additional types of swaps may be issued in the future, and, when finalized, could require each Trust Series to electronically execute and centrally clear certain OTC instruments presently entered into and settled on a bi-lateral basis. If a swap is required to be cleared, initial and variation margin requirements are set by the relevant clearing organization, subject to certain regulatory requirements and guidelines. Additional margin may be required and held by a Trust Series FCM. Other Requirements for Swaps Swaps that are not required to be cleared and executed on a SEF but that are executed bilaterally are also subject to various requirements pursuant to CFTC regulations, including, among other things, reporting and recordkeeping requirements and, depending on the status of the counterparties, trading documentation requirements and dispute resolution requirements. Derivatives Regulations in Non-U.S. Jurisdictions In addition to U.S. laws and regulations, a Trust Series may be subject to non-U.S. derivatives laws and regulations if it engages in futures and/or swap transactions with non-U.S. persons. For example, each Trust Series may be impacted by European laws and regulations to the extent that it engages in futures transactions on European exchanges or derivatives transactions with European entities. Other jurisdictions impose requirements applicable to futures and derivatives that are similar to those imposed by the U.S., including position limits, margin, clearing and trade execution requirements. The CFTC is generally prohibited by statute from regulating trading on non-U.S. futures exchanges and markets. The CFTC, however, has adopted regulations relating to the marketing of non-U.S. futures contracts in the United States. These regulations permit certain contracts on non-U.S. exchanges to be offered and sold in the United States. Commodity Markets Commodity Futures Price Movements Year Ended December 31, 2022 As measured by the four major diversified commodity indexes listed below, commodity futures prices exhibited a strong upward trend during the year ended December 31, 2022. The table below compares the total returns of the SDCI to the three major diversified commodity indexes over this time period.

 The value of the SDCI as of January 1, 2022 was 1,468.49. As of December 31, 2022, the value of the SDCI was 1,933.23, up approximately 31.65 over the year ended December 31, 2022. Of the 27 components of SummerHaven Dynamic Commodity Index (SDCI), sixteen had positive returns for first-half 2022. Gas Oil returned 57.7 in the first-half 2022 while Copper declined by -17.4 . The best performing sector was energy (up 57.7 ). Commodities have continued the 2021 rally as inflation grew from 1.4 in 2020 to 9.1 in 2022. Inflation is a headwind for stocks and bonds and a tailwind for real assets such as commodities. Historically, commodities have been a hedge against inflation and positive inflation shocks. In 2022, as the fact of high inflation became more evident, stocks and Bonds suffered losses while commodities continued to perform well. The age-old wisdom of stock-bond diversification has been challenged in an unprecedented way. Since the inception in 1976 of US aggregate bond index, 2022 is the only year where both US stocks and bonds have experience significant negative returns (-20.0 and -10.3 respectively). In contrast, USCI s NAV was up 18.47 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The return of approximately 31.65 on the SDCI listed above is a hypothetical return only and could not actually be achieved by an investor holding Futures Contracts due to the impact of trading costs and other expenses. USCI s per share NAV began the year at 43.43 and ended the year at 56.23 on December 31, 2022, an increase of approximately 29.47 over the year. See Tracking Each Trust Series Benchmark below for information about how expenses and income affect USCI s per share NAV. The war in Ukraine has raised concerns among investors that a global shortage of many commodities is possible. Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus are major producers and exporters of many metals, grains, and energy products that are critical to global supply. Substantial productive capacity has been halted in Ukraine, and Russia may be unable or unwilling to export what it produces. This has put upward pressure on commodity prices globally, beyond the impact of bullish fundamentals that were already in place. Should the war continue or escalate, or if sanctions or retaliation lead to a further reduction in production and exports from Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus, then commodity prices could rise further and prices could become more volatile. Conversely, should concerns about commodity shortages resulting from the war in Ukraine ebb due to an expected or actual resolution of the war, then commodity prices could stabilize or decline. Copper Markets Copper Futures Price Movements Year Ended December 31, 2022 As measured by the two major copper indexes, copper futures prices exhibited an upward trend during the year ended December 31, 2022. The table below compares the total returns of the SCI to the Bloomberg Copper Subindex Total Return over this time period. 

SummerHaven Copper Index Total Return SM SCI (1) (14.03) Bloomberg Copper Subindex Total Return (2) (13.54) (1) The inception date for the SummerHaven Copper Index Total Return TM is November 2010. (2) Source: Bloomberg 
 The value of the SCI as of January 1, 2022 was 1,422.52. As of December 31, 2022, the value of the SCI was 1,222.97, down approximately (14.03) over the year ended December 31, 2022. The return of approximately 14.03 on the SCI listed above is a hypothetical return only and could not actually be achieved by an investor holding Futures Contracts due to the impact of trading costs and other expenses. CPER s per share NAV began the year at 27.24 and ended the year at 23.07 on December 31, 2022, a decrease of approximately (15.31) over the year. See Tracking Each Trust Series Benchmark below for information about how expenses and income affect CPER s per share NAV. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the price of the front month copper futures contract traded in a range between 3.2105 per pound and 4.9290 per pound. Prices decreased by 16.78 between December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022 finishing the period at 3.8105. Copper futures markets rose dramatically from 2020 to mid-April 2022. Copper prices declined sharply from late spring to mid-summer due to concerns about demand from the manufacturing sector, monetary tightening and related concerns about a slowdown in global growth, and COVID-19 flare ups in China. In the second half of 2022, Copper recovered some of it s earlier losses for the year, partially as a result of China reopening its economy. Long-term, copper demand is likely to remain robust and supply is also likely to remain constrained and slow to respond to demand increases. The war in Ukraine has affected many commodities in which Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus are major producers and exports, such as certain metals, grains, and energy products. However, copper is not one of the metals that depends heavily on supply from the region. As a result, copper prices rose only modestly from the outbreak of the war in comparison to other metals, such as Nickel. Copper supply is more affected by events, such as protests and labor strikes, that impact mining in south American nations, including Chile and Peru.

 Meanwhile, copper demand typical depends on the state of the global economy, particularly China, which drives industrial, commercial, and manufacturing use. Valuation of Futures Contracts and the Computation of the Per Share NAV Each Trust Series NAV is calculated once each NYSE Arca trading day. The per share NAV for a particular trading day is released after 4:00 p.m. New York time. Trading during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca typically closes at 4:00 p.m. New York time. The Trust Series Administrator uses the closing prices on the relevant Futures Exchanges of the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts (determined at the earlier of the close of such exchange or 2:30 p.m. New York time) for the contracts held on the Futures Exchanges, but calculates or determines the value of all other investments of such Trust Series using market quotations, if available, or other information customarily used to determine the fair value of such investments. Results of Operations On July 30, 2010, USCI received a notice of effectiveness from the SEC for its registration of 50,000,000 shares on Form S-1 with the SEC. On August 10, 2010, USCI listed its shares on the NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol USCI. USCI established its initial offering per share NAV by setting the price at 50 and issued 100,000 shares to the initial Authorized Participant, Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp., in exchange for 5,000,000 in cash on August 10, 2010. USCI commenced investment operations on August 10, 2010 by purchasing Futures Contracts traded on the Futures Exchanges. In order to satisfy NYSE Arca listing standards that at least 100,000 shares be outstanding at the beginning of the trading day on the NYSE Arca, USCF purchased the initial Creation Basket from the initial Authorized Participant at the initial offering price. The 1,000 fee that would otherwise be charged to the Authorized Participant in connection with an order to create or redeem was waived in connection with the initial Creation Basket. USCF agreed not to resell the shares comprising such basket except that it may require the initial Authorized Participant to repurchase all of these shares at a per share price equal to USCI s per share NAV within five days following written notice from USCF, subject to the conditions that: (i) on the date of repurchase, the initial Authorized Participant must immediately redeem these shares in accordance with the terms of the Authorized Participant Agreement and (ii) immediately following such redemption at least 100,000 shares of USCI remain outstanding. USCF held such initial Creation Basket until September 3, 2010, at which time the initial Authorized Participant repurchased the shares comprising such basket in accordance with the specified conditions noted above. On September 14, 2011, USCF redeemed the 20 Sponsor Shares of USCI, and on September 19, 2011, USCF purchased five shares of USCI in the open market. Since its initial offering of 50,000,000 shares, USCI has registered 10,000,000 additional shares as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, USCI had issued 41,150,000 shares, 4,550,000 of which were outstanding. As of December 31, 2022, there were 18,850,000 shares registered but not yet issued. More shares may have been issued by USCI than are outstanding due to the redemption of shares. Since its initial offering of 30,000,000 shares, CPER has registered 50,000,000 additional shares as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, CPER had issued 23,900,000 shares, 7,350,000 of which were outstanding. As of December 31, 2022, there were 56,100,000 shares registered but not yet issued. More shares may have been issued by CPER than are outstanding due to the redemption of shares. USCF and the Trustee entered into the Fourth Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement effective as of December 15, 2017. Unlike funds that are registered under the 1940 Act, shares that have been redeemed by the Trust Series cannot be resold. As a result, each Trust Series contemplates that additional offerings of its shares will be registered with the SEC in the future in anticipation of additional issuances and redemptions.

USCI s expenses consist of investment management fees, brokerage fees and commissions, certain offering costs, licensing fees, registration fees, the fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF and expenses relating to tax accounting and reporting requirements. The management fee that USCI pays to USCF is calculated as a percentage of the total net assets of USCI. The fee is accrued daily and paid monthly. The increase in the per share NAV for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, was due to increase in values of the Futures Contracts held by USCI. Average interest rates earned on short-term investments held by USCI, including cash, cash equivalents and Treasuries, were higher during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. As a result, the amount of income earned by USCI as a percentage of average daily total net assets was higher during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. To the degree that the aggregate yield is higher, the net expense ratio, inclusive of income, will be lower. The increase in total fees and other expenses excluding management fees for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 was due primarily to an increase in total commissions accrued to brokers and prepaid registration of additional shares. The increase in USCI s total commissions accrued to brokers for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, was due primarily to a higher number of Futures Contracts being held and traded.

CPER s expenses consist of investment management fees, brokerage fees and commissions, certain offering costs, licensing fees, registration fees, the fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF and expenses relating to tax accounting and reporting requirements. The management fee that CPER pays to USCF is calculated as a percentage of the total net assets of CPER. The fee is accrued daily and paid monthly. The decrease in the per share NAV for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, was due to an increase/decrease in the values of the Futures Contracts held by CPER. Average interest rates earned on short-term investments held by CPER, including cash, cash equivalents and Treasuries, were higher during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. As a result, the amount of income earned by CPER as a percentage of average daily total net assets was higher during the year ended December 31, 2022. To the degree that the aggregate yield is higher, the net expense ratio, inclusive of income, will be lower. The increase in total fees and other expenses excluding management fees for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 was due primarily to an increase in professional fees. The decrease in CPER s total commissions accrued to brokers for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, was due primarily to a lower number of Futures Contracts being held and traded. Portfolio Holdings for USCI During the year ended December 31, 2022, USCI s portfolio held at all times Futures Contracts based on at least fourteen different commodities. Due to changes in the composition of the SDCI, each month the list of Benchmark Component Futures Contracts held by USCI changed (see the section The SDCI below).

First, the table below includes a column showing the change in the spot price of each of the 27 commodities for the year ended December 31, 2022. Second, while the tables above list the order of the commodities alphabetically, the table below lists the commodities first by which of the five sectors a commodity falls into and then within each sector from the commodity that had the highest positive change in spot price to the commodity that had the lowest positive change or largest negative change in spot price. Investors are cautioned that the change in the spot price of a given commodity does not represent the actual return that USCI might have earned on any holdings in futures contracts based on that commodity. This is due to two factors. First, the return on a futures contract may be higher, or lower, than the change in the spot price of the commodity due to the impact of backwardation or contango. Second, USCI may not have owned any such futures contract for the entire time period represented in the table below. Thus, USCI s total actual return on its holdings in any of the commodities shown below may be higher, or lower, than the actual change in the spot price of the particular commodity.

Specifically, USCF seeks to manage the portfolio such that over any rolling period of 30-valuation days, the average daily change in a Trust Series per share NAV is within a range of 90 to 110 (0.9 to 1.1) of the average daily change in the price of the Applicable Index. As an example, if the average daily movement of the price of the Applicable Index for a particular 30-valuation daytime period was 0.50 per day, USCF would attempt to manage the portfolio such that the average daily movement of the per share NAV during that same time period fell between 0.45 and 0.55 (i.e., between 0.9 and 1.1 of the Applicable Index s results). Each Trust Series portfolio management goals do not include trying to make the nominal price of its per share NAV equal to the nominal price of the Applicable Index, the nominal price of any particular commodity Futures Contract or the spot price for any particular commodity. USCF believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in listed Futures Contracts and Other-Related Investments. USCI For the 30-valuation days ended December 31, 2022, the simple average daily change in the SDCI was 0.023 , while the simple average daily change in the per share NAV of USCI over the same time period was 0.019 . The average daily difference was (0.004) (or (0.4) basis points, where 1 basis point equals 1/100 of 1 ). As a percentage of the daily movement of the SDCI, the average error in daily tracking by the per share NAV was (7.234) , meaning that over this time period USCI s tracking error was within the plus or minus 10 range established as its benchmark tracking goal.

 PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS An alternative tracking measurement of the return performance of USCI versus the return of its SDCI can be calculated by comparing the actual return of USCI, measured by changes in its per share NAV, versus the expected changes in its per share NAV under the assumption that USCI s returns had been exactly the same as the daily changes in its SDCI. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the actual total return of USCI as measured by changes in its per share NAV was 29.47 . This is based on an initial per share NAV of 43.43 as of December 31, 2021 and an ending per share NAV as of December 31, 2022 of 56.23. During this time period, USCI made no distributions to its shareholders. However, if USCI s daily changes in its per share NAV

 had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily total return of the SDCI, USCI would have had an estimated per share NAV of 57.17 as of December 31, 2022, for a total return over the relevant time period of 31.64 . The difference between the actual per share NAV total return of USCI of 29.47 and the expected total return based on the SDCI of 31.64 was a difference over the time period of (2.17) , which is to say that USCI s actual total return underperformed its benchmark by that percentage. USCI incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses. The impact of these expenses, offset by interest and dividend income, and net of positive or negative execution, tends to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of USCI to track slightly lower or higher than daily changes in the price of the SDCI. By comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2021, the actual total return of USCI as measured by changes in its per share NAV was 33.30 . This is based on an initial per share NAV of 32.58 as of December 31, 2020 and an ending per share NAV as of December 31, 2021 of 43.43. During this time period, USCI made no distributions to its shareholders. However, if USCI s daily changes in its per share NAV had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily total return of the SDCI, USCI would have had an estimated per share NAV of 43.92 as of December 31, 2021, for a total return over the relevant time period of 34.81 . The difference between the actual per share NAV total return of USCI of 33.30 and the expected total return based on the SDCI of 34.81 was a difference over the time period of (1.51) , which is to say that USCI s actual total return underperformed its benchmark by that percentage. USCI incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses. The impact of these expenses, offset by interest and dividend income, and net of positive or negative execution, tends to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of USCI to track slightly lower or higher than daily changes in the price of the SDCI. CPER For the 30-valuation days ended December 31, 2022, the simple average daily change in the SCI was 0.052 , while the simple average daily change in the per share NAV of CPER over the same time period was 0.050 . The average daily difference was (0.002) (or (0.2) basis points, where 1 basis point equals 1/100 of 1 ). As a percentage of the daily movement of the SCI, the average error in daily tracking by the per share NAV was (4.730) , meaning that over this time period CPER s tracking error was within the plus or minus 10 range established as its benchmark tracking goal. Since the commencement of the offering of CPER s shares to the public on November 15, 2011 through December 31, 2022, the simple average daily change in the SCI was 0.010 , while the simple average daily change in the per share NAV of CPER over the same time period was 0.006 . The average daily difference was (0.004) (or (0.4) basis points, where 1 basis point equals 1/100 of 1 ). As a percentage of the daily movement of the SCI, the average error in daily tracking by the per share NAV was (3.020) , meaning that over this time period CPER s tracking error was within the plus or minus 10 range established as its benchmark tracking goal.

 NAV had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily total return of the SCI, CPER would have had an estimated per share NAV of 23.42 as of December 31, 2022, for a total return over the relevant time period of (14.02) . The difference between the actual per share NAV total return of CPER of (15.31) and the expected total return based on the SCI of (14.02) was an error over the time period of (1.29) , which is to say that CPER s actual total return underperformed its benchmark by that percentage. CPER incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses. The impact of these expenses, offset by interest and dividend income, and net of positive or negative execution, tends to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of CPER to track slightly lower or higher than daily changes in the price of the SCI. By comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2021, the actual total return of CPER as measured by changes in its per share NAV was 25.41 . This is based on an initial per share NAV of 21.72 as of December 31, 2020 and an ending per share NAV as of December 31, 2021 of 27.24. During this time period, CPER made no distributions to its shareholders. However, if CPER s daily changes in its per share NAV had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily total return of the SCI, CPER would have had an estimated per share NAV of 27.48 as of December 31, 2021, for a total return over the relevant time period of 26.52 . The difference between the actual per share NAV total return of CPER of 25.41 and the expected total return based on the SCI of 26.52 was an error over the time period of (1.11) , which is to say that CPER s actual total return underperformed its benchmark by that percentage. CPER incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses. The impact of these expenses, offset by interest and dividend income, and net of positive or negative execution, tends to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of CPER to track slightly lower or higher than daily changes in the price of the SCI. Factors That Can Impact Ability to Track the Applicable Index There are currently five factors that have impacted or are most likely to impact a Trust Series ability to accurately track its Applicable Index. First, a Trust Series may buy or sell its holdings in the then current Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts at a price other than the closing settlement price of that contract on the day during which such Trust Series executes the trade. In that case, a Trust Series may pay a price that is higher, or lower, than that of the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts, which could cause the changes in the daily per share NAV of a Trust Series to either be too high or too low relative to the daily changes in the price of the Applicable Index. USCF attempts to minimize the effect of these transactions by seeking to execute its purchase or sale of the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts at, or as close as possible to, the end of the day settlement price. However, it may not always be possible for a Trust Series to obtain the closing settlement price and there is no assurance that failure to obtain the closing settlement price in the future will not adversely impact a Trust Series attempt to track the Applicable Index. Second, each Trust Series incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses. The impact of these expenses tends to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of such Trust Series to track slightly lower than daily changes in the price of the Applicable Index. At the same time, each Trust Series earns dividend and interest income on its cash, cash equivalents and Treasuries. A Trust Series is not required to distribute any portion of its income to its shareholders and did not make any distributions to shareholders during the year ended December 31, 2022. Interest payments, and any other income, were retained within the portfolio and added to each Trust Series NAV. When this income exceeds the level of a Trust Series expenses for its management fee, brokerage commissions and other expenses (including ongoing registration fees, licensing fees and the fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF), such Trust Series realizes a net yield that will tend to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of such Trust Series to track slightly higher than daily changes in the price of the Applicable Index. If short-term interest rates rise above these levels, the level of deviation created by the yield would increase. Conversely, if short-term interest rates were to decline, the amount of error created by the yield would decrease. When short-term yields drop to a level lower than the combined expenses of the management fee and the brokerage commissions, then the tracking error becomes a negative number and would tend to cause the daily returns of the per share NAV to underperform the daily returns of the Applicable Index. USCF anticipates that interest rates may continue to increase over the near future from historical lows. It is anticipated that fees and expenses paid by each Trust Series may continue to be higher than interest earned by each Trust Series. As such, USCF anticipates that each Trust Series could possibly outperform its benchmark so long as interest earned is higher than the fees and expenses paid by each Trust Series. Third, a Trust Series may hold Futures Contracts in a particular commodity other than the one specified as the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contract, or may hold Other Related Investments in its portfolio that may fail to closely track the Applicable Index s total return movements. Taking USCI as an example, assume for a given month one of the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts is the NYMEX WTI physically settled Futures Contract, trading under the symbol CL, for the contract month of November 2020. It is possible that USCI could hold a NYMEX WTI financially settled Futures Contract, trading under the symbol WS, for the contract month of November 2020. Alternatively, and using the same example, USCI could hold the ICE WTI financially settled Futures Contract, also for the contract month of November 2020. As a third example, USCI could hold the NYMEX WTI physically settled 
 78 

Table of Contents 
 Futures Contract, trading under the symbol CL, but for a contract month other than November 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2022, no Trust Series held any Other Related Investments. Fourth, a Trust Series could hold Other-Related Investments. In that case, the error in tracking the Applicable Index could result in daily changes in the per share NAV of a Trust Series that are either too high, or too low, relative to the daily changes in the price of the Applicable Index. During the year ended December 31, 2022, none of the Trust Series held any Other-Related Investments, but did, at times, hold Futures Contracts that were in months other than the months specified as the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contract. If any Trust Series increases in size, and due to its obligations to comply with regulatory limits, or due to other market pricing or liquidity factors, such Trust Series may invest in Futures Contract months other than the designated month specified as the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contract, or in Other-Related Investments, which may have the effect of increasing transaction related expenses and may result in increased tracking error. Finally, a Trust Series could hold the same Futures contracts as its benchmark but at a different weight. This is due to the fact that the benchmark can theoretically own a fractional percentage of a Futures contract but a Trust Series must own a full contract. For a Trust Series with smaller asset base, this percentage difference can have a material impact. Hypothetical Performance of the SDCI The table and chart below show the hypothetical performance of the SDCI from January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2022. The composition of the SDCI was revised effective December 24, 2020. Beginning with the commodity selection process that commenced on December 24, 2020, SHIM revised the composition of the SDCI to consolidate the six commodity sectors that comprised the index into five sectors. Specifically, prior to December 24, 2020, the SDCI reflected commodities in six commodity sectors: energy (e.g., crude oil, natural gas, heating oil, etc.), precious metals (e.g., gold, silver platinum), industrial metals (e.g., zinc, nickel, aluminum, copper, etc.), grains (e.g., wheat, corn, soybeans, etc.), softs (e.g., sugar, cotton, coffee, cocoa), and livestock (e.g., live cattle, lean hogs, feeder cattle). In light of these changes to the SDCI, the table and chart below reflecting the performance of the SDCI from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021 also reflects the hypothetical performance of the SDCI from January 1, 2020 through December 24, 2020 had the changes to the composition of the SDCI been effective during that period. HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS HAVE MANY INHERENT LIMITATIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. NO REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT USCI WILL OR IS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE PROFITS OR LOSSES SIMILAR TO THOSE SHOWN. IN FACT, THERE ARE FREQUENTLY SHARP DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND THE ACTUAL RESULTS ACHIEVED BY ANY PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM. ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS IS THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PREPARED WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT. IN ADDITION, HYPOTHETICAL TRADING DOES NOT INVOLVE FINANCIAL RISK, AND NO HYPOTHETICAL TRADING RECORD CAN COMPLETELY ACCOUNT FOR THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL RISK IN ACTUAL TRADING. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ABILITY TO WITHSTAND LOSSES OR TO ADHERE TO A PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM IN SPITE OF TRADING LOSSES ARE MATERIAL POINTS WHICH CAN ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER FACTORS RELATED TO THE MARKETS IN GENERAL OR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY SPECIFIC TRADING PROGRAM WHICH CANNOT BE FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PREPARATION OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND ALL OF WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS. The performance data does not reflect any reinvestment or distribution of profits, commission charges, management fees or other expenses that would have been incurred in connection with operating and managing a commodity pool designed to track the SDCI. Such fees and expenses would reduce the performance returns shown in the table below.

The S P GSCI Commodity Index Total Return is a composite index of commodity sector returns representing an unleveraged, long-only investment in commodity futures that is broadly diversified across the spectrum of commodities. The Bloomberg Commodity Index Total Return SM is currently composed of futures contracts on a diversified basket of commodities traded on U.S. exchanges. The Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity Index-Optimum Yield Total ReturnTM is designed to reflect the performance of certain wheat, corn, light sweet crude oil, heating oil, gold and aluminum futures contracts plus the returns from investing in 3-month U.S. Treasury Bills. The data for the SDCI Total Return Index is derived by using the SDCI s calculation methodology with historical prices for the futures contracts comprising the SDCI. The information about each of the indices comes from publicly-available material about such indices but is not designed to provide a thorough overview of the methodology of each index. None of the indices has an investment objective identical to the SDCI. As a result, there are inherent limitations in comparing the performance of such indices against the SDCI. For more information about these indices and their methodologies, please refer to the material published by the sponsors of each such index which may be found on their websites. USCI is not responsible for any information found on such websites, and such information is not part of this annual report on Form 10-K. In the table above, Total Return refers to the return of the relevant index from December 31, 1997 to December 31, 2022; Annualized Volatility is a measure of the amount of variation or fluctuation in the returns of the relevant index. Annualized Volatility is calculated by taking the monthly standard deviation of the relevant index s return and multiplying it by the square root of 12; and Annualized Sharpe Ratio is a measure of the total return of each relevant index adjusted by the risk-free interest rate (the 90-Day U.S. Treasury Bill yield) and the volatility of each index. Many investors consider volatility to be a measure of risk, and lower volatility of investment returns is considered a positive investment attribute as opposed to higher volatility. Annualized Sharpe Ratio is a standard measure for investors to compare two different investments or indexes that have different levels of volatility. If two indexes have the same total return, but one has lower Annualized Volatility, then its Annualized Sharpe Ratio will be higher. The higher the Annualized Sharpe Ratio, the better the risk-adjusted performance. Annualized Sharpe Ratio is calculated by taking the average monthly total return of the relevant index and subtracting the then current yield on the 90-Day U.S. Treasury Bill. The annualized return of this series is then divided by the Annualized Volatility of this series, and this result is the Annualized Sharpe Ratio for the relevant index. A higher Sharpe Ratio is not a guarantee that one investment or index will in the future produce better risk adjustment total returns, but USCF believes it is a useful tool for investors to consider when making investment decisions.

SCI The SCI is a single-commodity index designed to be an investment benchmark for copper as an asset class. The SCI is composed of copper futures contracts on the COMEX exchange. The SCI attempts to maximize backwardation and minimize contango while utilizing contracts in liquid portions of the futures curve. The SCI is rules-based and is rebalanced monthly based on observable price signals described below in the section Contract Selection and Weighting. In this context, the term rules-based is meant to indicate that the composition of the SCI in any given month will be determined by quantitative formulas relating to the prices of the futures contracts that are included in the SCI. Such formulas are not subject to adjustment based on other factors. The overall return on the SCI is generated by two components: (i) uncollateralized returns from the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts comprising the SCI, and (ii) a daily fixed income return reflecting the interest earned on hypothetical 3-month Treasuries, calculated using the weekly auction rate for 3-Month Treasuries published by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. SHIM is the owner of the SCI.

Commodity Allowed Max. Commodity Name Symbol Contracts Tenor Copper HG All 12 calendar months 12 Prior to the end of each month, SHIM determines the composition of the SCI and provides such information to the NYSE Arca. Values of the SCI are computed by the NYSE Arca and disseminated approximately every fifteen (15) seconds from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, which also publishes a daily SCI value at approximately 5:30 p.m., New York City time, under the index ticker symbol SCI. Only settlement and last-sale prices are used in the SCI s calculation, bids and offers are not recognized including limit-bid and limit-offer price quotes. Where no last-sale price exists, typically in the more deferred contract months, the previous days settlement price is used. This means that the underlying SCI may lag its theoretical value. This tendency to lag is evident at the end of the day when the SCI value is based on the settlement prices of the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts, and explains why the underlying SCI often closes at or near the high or low for the day. Composition of the SCI The composition of the SCI on any given day, as determined and published by SHIM, is determinative of the benchmark for CPER. Neither the index methodology for the SCI nor any set of procedures, however, are capable of anticipating all possible circumstances and events that may occur with respect to the SCI and the methodology for its composition, weighting and calculation. Accordingly, a number of subjective judgments must be made in connection with the operation of the SCI that cannot be adequately reflected in this description of the SCI. All questions of interpretation with respect to the application of the provisions of the index methodology for the SCI, including any determinations that need to be made in the event of a market emergency or other extraordinary circumstances, will be resolved by SHIM. Beginning with the commodity selection process that was scheduled to occur on December 31, 2020, the rebalancing period for the SCI changed from the first four business days of each month to the 11th-14th business days of each month, based on signals used for contract selection on the 10th business day of each month, rather than the last business day of each month. In addition, commencing with the first commodity selection date occurring after the change, the SCI was revised as follows: the number of Eligible Copper Futures Contracts was reduced, and the SCI itself is now comprised of one or three Eligible Copper Futures Contracts. Previously, the SCI could have been comprised of two or three Eligible Copper Futures Contracts. These revisions to the composition of the SCI are intended to ensure that the SCI components at any given time represent copper futures contracts for which there is an active and liquid trading market. Contract Expirations Because the SCI is comprised of actively traded contracts with scheduled expirations, it can be calculated only by reference to the prices of contracts for specified expiration, delivery or settlement periods, referred to as contract expirations. The contract expirations included in the SCI for each commodity during a given year are designated by SHIM, provided that each contract must be an active contract. An active contract for this purpose is a liquid, actively-traded contract expiration, as defined or identified by the relevant trading facility or, if no such definition or identification is provided by the relevant trading facility, as defined by standard custom and practice in the industry. If a futures exchange, such as the COMEX, ceases trading in all contract expirations relating to an Eligible Copper Futures Contract, SHIM may designate a replacement contract. The replacement contract must satisfy the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the SCI. To the extent practicable, the replacement will be effected during the next monthly review of the composition of the SCI. If that timing is not practicable, SHIM will determine the date of the replacement based on a number of factors, including the differences between the existing Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contract and the replacement contract with respect to contractual specifications and contract expirations.

 The designation of a replacement contract could affect the value of the SCI, either positively or negatively, depending on the price of the contract that is eliminated and the prices of the replacement contract. It is impossible, however, to predict the effect of these changes, if they occur, on the value of the SCI. Contract Selection and Weighting Weights for each of the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts are determined for the next month. The methodology used to calculate the SCI weighting is based solely on quantitative data using observable futures prices and is not subject to human bias. The monthly weighting selection is a process based upon examination of the relevant futures prices for copper: 1) On CPER s Selection Date CPER s Selection Date ): a) the copper futures curve is assessed to be in either backwardation or contango (as discussed below); and b) the Three Eligible Copper Futures Contracts are identified. For each month, the Three Eligible Copper Futures Contracts are as follows 

Month January February March April May June July August September October November December Closest to Expiration Futures Contract Mar Mar May May Jul Jul Sep Sep Dec Dec Dec Mar Eligible Futures Contracts Mar May May Jul Jul Sep Sep Dec Dec Dec Mar Mar May July July Sep Sep Dec Dec Mar Mar Mar May May July Sep Sep Dec Dec Mar Mar May May May Jul Jul A futures curve in backwardation occurs when the price of the closest-to-expiration Eligible Copper Futures Contract is greater than or equal to the price of the next closest-to-expiration Eligible Copper Futures Contract. These contracts will have expirations that are approximately two or three months apart. A curve not in backwardation is defined as being in contango, which occurs when the price of the closest-to-expiration contract is less than the price of the next closest-to-expiration contract. 2a) Backwardation: If the copper futures curve is in backwardation on the Selection Date, the SCI takes positions in the first Eligible Copper Futures Contract, weighted at 100 . A hypothetical example is included below, with the selected Eligible Copper Futures Contract shaded below: 

Expiration Contract Copper Futures Contract Date Price Nearest-to-maturity December-10 374.70 Next nearest-to-maturity March-11 365.20 

Eligible Copper Futures Contracts Price December-10 374.70 2b) Contango: If the copper futures curve is in contango, then the SCI takes positions in first three Eligible Copper Futures Contracts, each position is weighted at 33.33 . A hypothetical example is included below, with the three selected Eligible Copper Futures Contracts indicated below:

Eligible Copper Futures Contracts Price December-10 374.00 March-11 375.70 May-11 376.30 Due to the dynamic monthly weighting calculation, the individual weights will vary-over time, depending on the price observations each month. CPER s Selection Date for the SCI is the 10th business day of the calendar month. The following graph shows the weights of the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts selected for inclusion in the SCI as of December 31, 2022. Insert SCI Chart Contracts Weights Portfolio Construction The portfolio rebalancing takes place during the Rebalancing Period. At the end of each of the days in the Rebalancing Period one fourth of the prior month portfolio positions are replaced by the new weights for the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts determined on CPER s Selection Date. SCI Total Return Calculation The value of the SCI on any business day is equal to the product of (i) the value of the SCI on the immediately preceding business day multiplied by (ii) one plus the sum of the day s returns for another version of the SCI known as the SummerHaven Dynamic Copper Index Excess Return SCI ER (explained below) and one business day s interest from the hypothetical Treasury Bill portfolio. The value of the SCI will be calculated and published by the NYSE Arca. SCI Base Level The SCI was set to 100 on January 2, 1991. SCI ER Calculation The total return of the SCI ER reflects the percentage change of the market values of the underlying commodity futures. During the Rebalancing Period, the SCI changes its contract holdings and weightings during a four day period. The value of the SCI ER at the end of a business day t is equal to the SCI ER value on day t -1 multiplied by the sum of the daily percentage price changes of each commodity future factoring in each respective commodity future s notional holding on day t -1 . Rebalancing Period The SCI is rebalanced during the 11th-14th business days of each month, based on signals used for contract selection on the 10th business day of each month, when existing positions are placed by new positions and weightings based on the signals used for contract selection on the prior calendar month as outlined above. Hypothetical Performance of the SCI The table and chart below show the hypothetical performance of the SCI from January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2022. HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS HAVE MANY INHERENT LIMITATIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. NO REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT CPER WILL OR IS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE PROFITS OR LOSSES SIMILAR TO THOSE SHOWN. IN FACT, THERE ARE FREQUENTLY SHARP DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND THE ACTUAL RESULTS ACHIEVED BY ANY PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM. 
 86 

Table of Contents 
 ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS IS THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PREPARED WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT. IN ADDITION, HYPOTHETICAL TRADING DOES NOT INVOLVE FINANCIAL RISK, AND NO HYPOTHETICAL TRADING RECORD CAN COMPLETELY ACCOUNT FOR THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL RISK IN ACTUAL TRADING. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ABILITY TO WITHSTAND LOSSES OR TO ADHERE TO A PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM IN SPITE OF TRADING LOSSES ARE MATERIAL POINTS WHICH CAN ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER FACTORS RELATED TO THE MARKETS IN GENERAL OR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY SPECIFIC TRADING PROGRAM WHICH CANNOT BE FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PREPARATION OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND ALL OF WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS. The performance data does not reflect any reinvestment or distribution profits, commission charges, management fees or other expenses that would have been incurred in connection with operating and managing a commodity pool designed to track the SCI. Such fees and expenses would reduce the performance returns shown in the table below.

 The table above shows the performance of the SCI from December 31, 1997 through December 31, 2022 in comparison with a traditional commodity index and spot copper prices: the Bloomberg Copper Subindex Total Return SM and spot copper prices less warehouse storage rents. The Bloomberg Copper Subindex Total Return SM includes the contract in the Bloomberg Commodity Index Total Return that relates to a single commodity, copper (currently the Copper High Grade futures contract traded on the COMEX). The data for the SCI Total Return Index is derived by using the SCI s calculation methodology with historical prices for the futures contracts comprising the SCI. The information about the index above comes from publicly-available material about such index but is not designed to provide a thorough overview of the methodology of such index. The index noted above does not have investment objectives identical to the SCI. As a result, there are inherent limitations in comparing such performance against the SCI. For more information about the index and its methodologies, please refer to the material published by the sponsor of the Bloomberg Copper Subindex Total Return which may be found on its website. In addition to the actual performance of the SCI, this chart includes as SCI Hypothetical TR the hypothetical performance of the SCI had the changes to the composition of the SCI, which became effective on January 1, 2021, been effective during the period from December 31, 1997 through December 31, 2020. USCF is not responsible for any information found on such website, and such information is not part of this annual report on Form 10-K. In the table above, Total Return refers to the return of the relevant index from December 31, 1997 to December 31, 2022; Annualized Volatility is a measure of the amount of variation or fluctuation in the returns of the relevant index. Annualized Volatility is calculated by taking the monthly standard deviation of the relevant index s return and multiplying it by the square root of 12; and Annualized Sharpe Ratio is a measure of the total return of each relevant index adjusted by the risk-free interest rate (the 90-Day U.S. Treasury Bill yield) and the volatility of each index. Many investors consider volatility to be a measure of risk, and lower volatility of investment returns is considered a positive investment attribute as opposed to higher volatility. Annualized Sharpe Ratio is a standard measure for investors to compare two different investments or indexes that have different levels of volatility. If two indexes have the same total return, but one has lower Annualized Volatility, then its Annualized Sharpe Ratio will be higher. The higher the Annualized Sharpe Ratio, the better the risk-adjusted performance. Annualized Sharpe Ratio is calculated by taking the average monthly total return of the relevant index and subtracting the then current yield on the 90-Day U.S. Treasury Bill. The annualized return of this series is then divided by the Annualized Volatility of this series, and this result is the Annualized Sharpe Ratio for the relevant index. A higher Sharpe Ratio is not a guarantee that one investment or index will in the future produce better risk adjustment total returns, but USCF believes it is a useful tool for investors to consider when making investment decisions.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which is incorporated by reference herein. Critical Accounting Policies Preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the application of appropriate accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The Trust s application of these policies involves judgments and actual results may differ from the estimates used. 
 91 

Table of Contents 
 USCF has evaluated the nature and types of estimates that it makes in preparing the Trust s financial statements and related disclosures and has determined that the valuation of Applicable Interests, which are not traded on a United States or internationally recognized futures exchange (such as forward contracts and OTC swaps) involves a critical accounting policy. The values which are used by each Trust Series for its Futures Contracts are provided by its commodity broker who uses market prices when available, while OTC swaps are valued based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that would be received from or paid to a third party in settlement of these derivative contracts prior to their delivery date and valued on a daily basis. In addition, each Trust Series estimates interest income on a daily basis using prevailing rates earned on its cash and cash equivalents. These estimates are adjusted to the actual amount received on a monthly basis and the difference, if any, is not considered material. Liquidity and Capital Resources None of the Trust Series has made, and does not anticipate making, use of borrowings or other lines of credit to meet its obligations. Each Trust Series has met, and it is anticipated that each Trust Series will continue to meet, its liquidity needs in the normal course of business from the proceeds of the sale of its investments, or from the Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents that it intends to hold at all times. Each Trust Series liquidity needs include: redeeming shares, providing margin deposits for its existing Futures Contracts or the purchase of additional Futures Contracts and posting collateral for its OTC swaps, if applicable, and payment of its expenses, summarized below under Contractual Obligations. Each Trust Series currently generates cash primarily from: (i) the sale of Creation Baskets and (ii) income earned on Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents. Each Trust Series has allocated substantially all of its net assets to trading in Applicable Interests. Each Trust Series invests in Applicable Interests to the fullest extent possible without being leveraged or unable to satisfy its current or potential margin or collateral obligations with respect to its investments in Applicable Interests. A significant portion of each Trust Series NAV is held in Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents that are used as margin and as collateral for its trading in Applicable Interests. The balance of the assets is held in each Trust Series account at the Custodian and in Treasuries at one or more FCMs. Income received from any investments in money market funds and Treasuries by a Trust Series will be paid to such Trust Series. During the year ended December 31, 2022, each Trust Series income earned and the cash earned from the sale of Creation Baskets and the redemption of Redemption Baskets exceeded the expenses. Each Trust Series investments in Applicable Interests may be subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions, regulatory considerations and other reasons. For example, most commodity exchanges limit the fluctuations in futures contracts prices during a single day by regulations referred to as daily limits. During a single day, no trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. Once the price of a futures contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, positions in the contracts can neither be taken nor liquidated unless the traders are willing to effect trades at or within the specified daily limit. Such market conditions could prevent a Trust Series from promptly liquidating its positions in Futures Contracts. During the year ended December 31, 2022, none of the Trust Series purchased or liquidated any of its positions while daily limits were in effect; however, no Trust Series can predict whether such an event may occur in the future. Prior to the initial offering of each Trust Series, all payments with respect to each Trust Series expenses are paid by USCF. None of the Trust Series has an obligation or intention to refund such payments made by USCF. USCF is under no obligation to pay any Trust Series future expenses. Since the initial offering of shares, each Trust Series has been responsible for expenses relating to: (i) management fees, (ii) brokerage fees and commissions, (iii) ongoing registration expenses in connection with offers and sales of its shares subsequent to the initial offering, (iv) other expenses, including tax reporting costs, (v) the fees of the Trustee in connection with its services as Delaware trustee of the Trust, (vi) fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF and (vii) other extraordinary expenses not in the ordinary course of business, while USCF has been responsible for expenses relating to the fees of the Trust Series Marketing Agent, Administrator and Custodian, the trading advisory and licensing fees of SummerHaven and offering expenses relating to the initial offering of shares of each Trust Series. If USCF and each Trust Series are unsuccessful in raising sufficient funds to cover these respective expenses or in locating any other source of funding, one or more of the Trust Series could terminate and investors may lose all or part of their investment.

 Market Risk Trading in Applicable Interests, such as Futures Contracts, involves each Trust Series entering into contractual commitments to purchase or sell specified amounts of commodities at a specified date in the future. The aggregate market value of the contracts will significantly exceed each Trust Series future cash requirements since each Trust Series intends to close out its open positions prior to settlement. As a result, each Trust Series is generally only subject to the risk of loss arising from the change in value of the contracts. Each Trust Series considers the fair value of its derivative instruments to be the unrealized gain or loss on the contracts. The market risk associated with each Trust Series commitments to purchase a specific commodity will be limited to the aggregate market value of the contracts held. Each Trust Series exposure to market risk depends on a number of factors, including the markets for commodities, the volatility of interest rates and foreign exchange rates, the liquidity of the Applicable Interest markets and the relationships among the contracts held by each such Trust Series. The limited experience that each Trust Series has had in utilizing its model to trade in Applicable Interests in a manner intended to track the changes in the Applicable Index, as well as drastic market occurrences, could ultimately lead to the loss of all or substantially all of an investor s capital. Credit Risk When a Trust Series enters into Futures Contracts and Other Related Investments, it is exposed to the credit risk that the counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations. The counterparty for the Futures Contracts traded on the Futures Exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with the particular exchange. In general, in addition to margin required to be posted by the clearinghouse in connection with cleared trades, clearinghouses are backed by their members who may be required to share in the financial burden resulting from the nonperformance of one of their members and, therefore, this additional member support should significantly reduce credit risk. The Trust Series are not currently a member of any clearinghouse. Some foreign exchanges are not backed by their clearinghouse members but may be backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions. There can be no assurance that any counterparty, clearinghouse, or their members or their financial backers will satisfy their obligations to a Trust Series in such circumstances. USCF attempts to manage the credit risk of each Trust Series by following various trading limitations and policies. In particular, each Trust Series generally posts margin and/or holds liquid assets that are approximately equal to the market value of its obligations to counterparties under the Futures Contracts and Other Related Investments it holds. USCF has implemented procedures that include, but are not limited to, executing and clearing trades and entering into OTC transactions only with creditworthy parties and/or requiring the posting of collateral or margin by such parties for the benefit of each Trust Series to limit its credit exposure. Each Trust Series commodity broker, or any other broker that may be retained by a Trust Series in the future, when acting as the Trust Series FCM in accepting orders to purchase or sell Futures Contracts on United States exchanges, is required by CFTC regulations to separately account for and segregate as belonging to a Trust Series, all assets of a Trust Series relating to domestic Futures Contracts trading. FCMs are not allowed to commingle a Trust Series assets with their other assets. In addition, the CFTC requires FCMs to hold in a secure account a Trust Series assets related to foreign Futures Contracts trading. During the year ended December 31, 2022, CPER did not make investments on any foreign exchanges. In the future, a Trust Series may purchase OTC swaps, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of OTC swaps. As of December 31, 2022, each of USCI and CPER held cash deposits and investments in Treasuries and money market funds in the amount of 246,057,371 and 165,213,916, respectively, with the custodian and FCMs. Some or all of these amounts held by a custodian or an FCM, as applicable, may be subject to loss should the Trust Series custodian or FCMs, as applicable, cease operations. Off Balance Sheet Financing As of December 31, 2022, neither the Trust nor any Trust Series had any loan guarantee, credit support or other off-balance sheet arrangements of any kind other than agreements entered into in the normal course of business, which may include indemnification provisions relating to certain risks that service providers undertake in performing services which are in the best interests of any Trust Series. While each Trust Series exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, they are not expected to have a material impact on any Trust Series financial position.

 Redemption Basket Obligation In order to meet its investment objective and pay its contractual obligations described below, each Trust Series requires liquidity to redeem shares, which redemptions must be in blocks of 50,000 shares called Redemption Baskets. Each Trust Series has to date satisfied this obligation by paying from the cash or cash equivalents it holds or through the sale of its Treasuries in an amount proportionate to the number of shares being redeemed. Contractual Obligations The Trust s (and each series thereunder) primary contractual obligations are with USCF and certain other service providers. In return for its services, USCF is entitled to a management fee calculated as a fixed percentage of a Trust Series NAV. Effective January 1, 2016, USCF permanently lowered the management fee to 0.80 (80 basis points) per annum of average daily total net assets for USCI and 0.65 (65 basis points) per annum of average daily total net assets for CPER. Ongoing fees, costs and expenses of its operation for which a Trust Series is responsible include: brokerage and other fees and commissions incurred in connection with the trading activities of each Trust Series; expenses incurred in connection with registering additional shares of each Trust Series or offering shares of each Trust Series after the time any shares of each Trust Series have begun trading on the NYSE Arca; the routine expenses associated with distribution, including printing and mailing, of any monthly, annual and other reports to shareholders required by applicable U.S. federal and state regulatory authorities; payment for routine services of the Trustee, legal counsel and independent accountants; payment for fees associated with tax accounting and reporting, routine accounting, bookkeeping, whether performed by an outside service provider or by affiliates of USCF; postage and insurance, including directors and officers liability insurance; costs and expenses associated with investor relations and services; the payment of any distributions related to redemption of shares; payment of all federal, state, local or foreign taxes payable on the income, assets or operations of each Trust Series and the preparation of all tax returns related thereto; and extraordinary expenses (including, but not limited to, indemnification of any person against liabilities and obligations to the extent permitted by law and required under the Trust Agreement and the bringing and defending of actions at law or in equity and otherwise engaging in the conduct of litigation and the incurring of legal expense and the settlement of claims and litigation). 
 While USCF has agreed to pay registration fees to the SEC, FINRA, NYSE Arca or any other regulatory agency or exchange in connection with the initial offer and sale of the shares and the legal, printing, accounting and other expenses associated with such registration, each Trust Series is responsible for any registration fees and related expenses incurred in connection with any subsequent offer and sale of its shares after the initial offering of shares. In addition, any Trust Series, in its Registration Statement, may provide for different allocation of expenses among the Sponsor and such Trust Series, in each case solely with respect to such Trust Series.

 Each Trust Series pays its own brokerage and other transaction costs. Each Trust Series pays fees to FCMs in connection with its transactions in Futures Contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2022, FCM fees were approximately 0.07 of average daily total net assets for USCI, and approximately 0.03 of average daily total net assets for CPER. In general, transaction costs on OTC Applicable Interests and on Treasuries and other short-term securities are embedded in the purchase or sale price of the instrument being purchased or sold, and may not readily be estimated. USCF had voluntarily agreed to pay certain expenses normally borne by USCI to the extent that such expenses exceeded 0.15 (15 basis points) of USCI s NAV, on an annualized basis, through June 30, 2011 when such expense waiver was terminated. USCF voluntarily agreed to pay certain expenses typically borne by CPER to the extent that such expenses exceed 0.15 (15 basis points) of CPER s NAV, on an annualized basis. USCF terminated such expense waiver as of April 30, 2021. As a result, the Annual Fund Operating Expenses increased, which would negatively impact your total return from an investment in CPER. This voluntary expense waiver was in addition to those amounts USCF is contractually obligated to pay as described in Note 5 to the financial statements of the Trust and terminated on April 30, 2021. The parties cannot anticipate the amount of payments that will be required under these arrangements for future periods, as each Trust Series NAVs and trading levels to meet its investment objective will not be known until a future date. These agreements are effective for a specific term agreed upon by the parties with an option to renew, or, in some cases, are in effect for the duration of a Trust Series existence. Either party may terminate these agreements earlier for certain reasons described in the agreements. As of December 31, 2022, USCI s portfolio consisted of 6,037 Futures Contracts traded on the Futures Exchanges and CPER s portfolio consisted of 1,779 Contracts traded on the COMEX. For a list of each of USCI s and CPER s current holdings, please see www.uscfinvestments.com. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Commodity Price Risk. USCI and CPER are exposed to commodity price risk. In particular, each Trust Series is exposed to commodity risk of the commodities that comprise the Applicable Index for such Trust Series through its holdings of Futures Contracts together with any other derivatives in which it may invest, which are discussed below. As a result, fluctuations in the value of the Futures Contracts that each Trust Series holds in its portfolio, as described in Contractual Obligations under Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations above, are expected to directly affect the value of the Trust Series. OTC Contract Risk USCI and CPER may purchase OTC Commodity-Related Interests and Copper-Related Interests, such as forward contracts or swap or spot contracts. Unlike most exchange-traded futures contracts or exchange-traded options on such futures, each party to an OTC swap bears the credit risk that the other party may not be able to perform its obligations under its contract. The Trust, on behalf of each Trust Series, may enter into certain transactions where an OTC component is exchanged for a corresponding futures contract Exchange for Related Position or EFRP transactions). In the most common type of EFRP transaction entered into by the Trust, the OTC component is the purchase or sale of one or more baskets of a Trust Series shares. These EFRP transactions may expose a Trust Series to counterparty risk during the interim period between the execution of the OTC component and the exchange for a corresponding futures contract. Generally, the counterparty risk from the EFRP transaction will exist only on the day of execution. Swap transactions, like other financial transactions, involve a variety of significant risks. The specific risks presented by a particular swap transaction necessarily depend upon the terms and circumstances of the transaction. In general, however, all swap transactions involve some combination of market risk, credit risk, counterparty credit risk, funding risk, liquidity risk and operational risk. Highly customized swap transactions in particular may increase liquidity risk, which may result in a suspension of redemptions. Highly leveraged transactions may experience substantial gains or losses in value as a result of relatively small changes in the value or level of an underlying or related market factor. In evaluating the risks and contractual obligations associated with a particular swap transaction, it is important to consider that a swap transaction may be modified or terminated only by mutual consent of the original parties and subject to agreement on individually negotiated terms. Therefore, it may not be possible for USCF to modify, terminate or offset a Trust Series obligations or its exposure to the risks associated with a transaction prior to its scheduled termination date. 
 95 

Table of Contents 
 To reduce the credit risk that arises in connection with such contracts, a Trust Series will generally enter into an agreement with each counterparty based on the Master Agreement published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association that provides for the netting of its overall exposure to its counterparty, if the counterparty is unable to meet its obligations to the Trust Series due to the occurrence of a specified event, such as the insolvency of the counterparty. A Trust Series assesses or reviews, as appropriate, the creditworthiness of each potential or existing counterparty to an OTC contract pursuant to guidelines approved by USCF s board of directors (the Board ). Furthermore, USCF on behalf of a Trust Series only enters into OTC swaps with counterparties who are, or are affiliates of, (a) banks regulated by a United States federal bank regulator, (b) broker-dealers regulated by the SEC, (c) insurance companies domiciled in the United States, or (d) producers, users or traders of energy, whether or not regulated by the CFTC. Any entity acting as a counterparty shall be regulated in either the United States or the United Kingdom unless otherwise approved by the Board after consultation with its legal counsel. Existing counterparties are also reviewed periodically by USCF. A Trust Series will also require that the counterparty be highly rated and/or provide collateral or other credit support. Even if collateral is used to reduce counterparty credit risk, sudden changes in the value of OTC transactions may leave a party open to financial risk due to a counterparty default since the collateral held may not cover a party s exposure on the transaction in such situations. In general, valuing OTC derivatives is less certain than valuing actively traded financial instruments such as exchange-traded futures contracts and securities or cleared swaps because the price and terms on which such OTC derivatives are entered into or can be terminated are individually negotiated, and those prices and terms may not reflect the best price or terms available from other sources. In addition, while market makers and dealers generally quote indicative prices or terms for entering into or terminating OTC swaps, they typically are not contractually obligated to do so, particularly if they are not a party to the transaction. As a result, it may be difficult to obtain an independent value for an outstanding OTC derivatives transaction. During the twelve month reporting period ended December 31, 2022, the Trust Series did not invest in any OTC contracts. Each Trust Series anticipates that the use of Other Related Investments together with its investments in Futures Contracts will produce price and total return results that closely track the investment goals of such Trust Series. However, there can be no assurance of this. OTC swaps may result in higher transaction-related expenses than the brokerage commissions paid in connection with the purchase of Futures Contracts, which may impact a Trust Series ability to successfully track its Applicable Index.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Sponsor and Shareholders of United States Commodity Index Funds Trust Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying statements of financial condition of United States Commodity Index Funds Trust (the Trust and its Series including United States Commodity Index Fund, and United States Copper Index Fund, in total and for each Series as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, including the schedule of investments as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related statements of operations, changes in capital and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). We also have audited the Trust s and its Series internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Trust and its Series as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Trust and its Series maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. Basis for Opinion The Trust s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Trust s and its Series financial statements and an opinion on the Trust s and its Series internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Trust and its Series in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A Trust s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Trust s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Trust are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Trust; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Trust s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters. /s/ We have served as the Trust s auditor since 2009. February 27, 2023

Audit Committee The Board of USCF has an audit committee which is made up of the three independent directors (Gordon L. Ellis, Malcolm R. Fobes III, and Peter M. Robinson). The audit committee is governed by an audit committee charter that is posted on USCI s website at www.uscfinvestments.com. Any shareholder of USCI may also obtain a printed copy of the audit committee charter, free of charge, by calling 1-800-920-0259. The Board has determined that each member of the audit committee meets the financial literacy requirements of the NYSE Arca and the audit committee charter. The Board has further determined that each of Messrs. Ellis and Fobes have accounting or related financial management expertise, as required by the NYSE Arca, such that each of them is considered an Audit Committee Financial Expert as such term is defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K. Other Committees Since the individuals who perform work on behalf of USCI are not compensated by USCI, but instead by USCF, USCI does not have a compensation committee. Similarly, since the directors noted above serve on the Board of USCF, there is no nominating committee of the Board that acts on behalf of USCI. USCF believes that it is necessary for each member of the Board to possess many qualities and skills. USCF further believes that all directors should possess a considerable amount of business management and educational experience. When vacancies in USCF s Board occur, the members of the Board consider a candidate s management experience as well as his/her background, stature, conflicts of interest, integrity and ethics. In connection with this, the Board also considers issues of diversity, such as diversity of gender, race and national origin, education, professional experience and differences in viewpoints and

Table of Contents 
 skills. The Board does not have a formal policy with respect to diversity; however, the Board believes that it is essential that the Board members represent diverse viewpoints. Corporate Governance Policy The Board of USCF has adopted a Corporate Governance Policy that applies to USCI and the Related Public Funds. USCI has posted the text of the Corporate Governance Policy on its website at www.uscfinvestments.com. Any shareholder of USCI may also obtain a printed copy of the Corporate Governance Policy, free of charge, by calling 1-800-920-0259. Code of Ethics USCF has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the Code of Ethics that applies to its principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions, and also to USCI. USCI has posted the text of the Code of Ethics on its website at www.uscfinvestments.com. Any shareholder of USCI may also obtain a printed copy of the Code of Ethics, free of charge, by calling 1-800-920-0259. USCI intends to disclose any amendments or waivers to the Code of Ethics applicable to USCF s principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions, on its website. Executive Sessions of the Non-Management Directors In accordance with the Corporate Governance Policy of USCF, the non-management directors of the Board (who are the same as the independent directors of the Board) meet separately from the other directors in regularly scheduled executive sessions, without the presence of Management Directors or executive officers of USCF. The non-management directors have designated Gordon L. Ellis to preside over each such executive session. Interested parties who wish to make their concerns known to the non-management directors may communicate directly with Mr. Fobes by writing to 475 Milan Drive, No. 103, San Jose, CA 95134-2453 or by e-mail at uscf.director@gmail.com. Board Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight The Board of USCF is led by a Chairman, Mr. John P. Love, who also serves as USCF s President and Chief Executive Officer. The Board s responsibilities include: (i) the selection, evaluation, retention and succession of the Chief Executive Officer and the oversight of the selection and performance of other executive officers, (ii) understanding, reviewing and monitoring the implementation of strategic plans, annual operating plans and budgets, (iii) the selection and oversight of USCI s independent auditors and the oversight of USCI s financial statements, (iv) advising management on significant issues, (v) the review and approval of significant company actions and certain other matters, (vi) nominating directors and committee members and overseeing effective corporate governance and (vii) the consideration of other constituencies, such as USCF s and USCI s customers, employees, suppliers and the communities impacted by USCI. The non- management directors have designated Gordon L. Ellis as the presiding independent director. Mr. Ellis role as the presiding independent director includes presiding over each executive session of the non-management directors, facilitating communications by shareholders and employees with the non-management directors and may also include representing the non-management directors with respect to certain matters as to which the views of the non-management directors are sought pursuant to USCI s Corporate Governance Policy. The Board believes that Mr. Love is best situated to serve as Chairman of USCF because he is the director most familiar with the business of USCF as the President and CEO of USCF. Because of his background, he is most capable of effectively leading discussions and execution of new strategic objectives while facilitating information flow between USCF and the full Board, including the independent directors, which is essential to effective governance. The independent directors of USCF are actively involved in the oversight of USCF and, because of their varied backgrounds, provide different perspectives in connection with the oversight of USCF, USCI and the Related Public Funds. USCF s independent directors bring expertise from outside USCF and the commodities industry, while Mr. Love brings company-specific and industry-specific experience and expertise. Risk Management The full Board is actively involved in overseeing the management and operation of USCF, including oversight of the risks that face USCI and the Related Public Funds. For example, the Board has adopted an Investment Policy and a Policy for Use of Derivatives. The policies are intended to ensure that USCF takes prudent and careful action while entering into and managing investments taken by USCI, including Oil Futures Contracts and Other Oil-Related Investments such as OTC swap contracts. Additionally, the policies are intended to provide assurance that there is sufficient flexibility in controlling risks and returns associated with the use of investments by USCI. 
 138 

Table of Contents 
 The policies, among other things, limit USCI s ability to have too high of a concentration of its assets in non-exchange traded futures contracts or cleared swap contracts or concentrating its investments in too few counterparties, absent prior approval from the Board. Existing counterparties are reviewed periodically by the Board to ensure that they continue to meet the criteria outlined in the policies. The Board tasks USCF with assessing risks, including market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, cash flow risk, basis risk, legal and tax risk, settlement risk, and operational risk. There are certain risks that may arise as a result of a growth in assets under management. For example, if position limits are imposed on USCI and the assets under management continue to increase, then USCI may not be able to invest solely in the Benchmark Futures Contracts and may have to invest in OTC swap contracts or Other Oil-Related Investments as it seeks to track its benchmark. Other Futures Contracts in which USCI may invest may not track changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract. Other Oil-Related Investments, including OTC swap contracts, may also expose USCI to increased counterparty credit risk and may be less liquid and more difficult to value than Futures Contracts. USCI and the Related Public Funds ameliorate the potential credit, liquidity and valuation risks by fully collateralizing any OTC swap contracts or other investments. Other Information In addition to the certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of USCF filed or furnished with this annual report on Form 10-K regarding the quality of USCI s public disclosure, USCI will submit, within 30 days after filing this annual report on Form 10-K, to the NYSE Arca a certification of the Chief Executive Officer of USCF certifying that he is not aware of any violation by USCI of NYSE Arca corporate governance listing standards. Part III Item 11. Executive Compensation. Compensation to USCF and Other Compensation None of the Trust Series directly compensates any of the executive officers noted above. The executive officers noted above are compensated by USCF for the work they perform on behalf of each Trust Series and other entities controlled by USCF.

Each of USCI and CPER is contractually obligated to pay USCF a fee, which is paid monthly, equal to 0.95 per annum of average daily total net assets.

However, there have been no direct financial transactions between any Trust Series and the directors or officers of USCF that have not been disclosed herein. See Item 11. Executive Compensation and Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters.

Director Independence In February 2022, the Board undertook a review of the independence of the directors of USCF and considered whether any director has a material relationship or other arrangement with USCF, the Trust Series or the Related Public Funds that could compromise his ability to exercise independent judgment in carrying out his responsibilities. As a result of this review, the Board determined that each of Messrs. Fobes, Ellis and Robinson is an independent director, as defined under the rules of NYSE Arca.
