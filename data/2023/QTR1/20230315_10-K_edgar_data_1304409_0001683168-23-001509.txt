PART I 

ITEM 1 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS. 

Overview 

We were incorporated on December 23, 2003, in Delaware and our principal
business is the acquisition and exploration of mineral resources. 

In January 2021, the company s Board of Directors approved a
name change from Athena Silver Corporation, to Athena Gold Corporation. Athena Gold Corporation we, our, 
 us, or Athena is engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral resources. We began our mining operations
in 2010. 

We entered into a Mining Lease and Option Agreement which granted us
mining rights to the Langtry silver prospect located in San Bernardino County California. Due to the depressed commodities prices over
the ensuing decade, we were never able to engage in meaningful exploration efforts. On April 28,
2020, Athena Silver Corporation entered into Agreement to Terminate Lease with Option to Buy dated March 10, 2016 with Bruce and Elizabeth
Strachan, Trustees of the Bruce and Elizabeth Strachan Revocable Living Trust dated July 25, 2007, including any and all amendments thereto
dated April 28, 2020 with respect to the Langtry Mine in California. As a result of this termination agreement, all scheduled lease option
payments due in 2020 and beyond were considered terminated and void upon signing of the Agreement. 

In December 2009, we formed and organized a new wholly-owned subsidiary,
Athena Minerals, Inc. Athena Minerals which owned and operated our mining interests and properties in California. On December
31, 2020 we sold the subsidiary to John Gibbs and/or his affiliate, a related party, in a non-cash exchange to satisfy our more than 2.0
million debt to Mr. Gibbs which is discussed further below and in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this
report. 

Effective December 27, 2021 Effective Date ), the Company
simultaneously executed and consummated a definitive Share Purchase Agreement (the SPA with Nubian Resources, Ltd. Nubian
Resources ). The SPA was the result of a previously disclosed Option Agreement with Nubian Resources dated as of December 11, 2020,
as amended by First Amendment to Option Agreement dated November 10, 2021 (the Option ). While the Option granted the Company
the right to acquire up to a 100 interest in the mining claims comprising the Excelsior Springs Prospect (the Property located in Esmerelda County, Nevada, the Company and Nubian Resources agreed to restructure the transaction so that the Company purchased
100 of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Nubian Resources (USA) Ltd Nubian USA ), a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Nubian Resources which held the Property. By purchasing 100 of Nubian US, the Company effectively acquired the remaining 90 interest
in the Property, the Company having previously acquired a 10 interest in the Property in December 2020 under the terms of the Option. 

The following is a summary of the terms of the
SPA, which summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the SPA: 

The consideration paid to Nubian for 100 of the issued and outstanding shares of Nubian US consisted of: 

An aggregate of 50 million shares of Athena Gold Corp.
 common stock, which number includes the 5 million shares of common stock previously issued to Nubian Resources under the Option;
 and 

A 1 Net Smelter Royalty on all production from the Excelsior Springs Property. 

The 50 million shares issued to Nubian Resources were
 issued as restricted securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended Securities Act ). The
 Company filed a registration statement on Form S-1 registering the distribution by Nubian of all 50 million shares to its
 shareholders, pro rata. Nubian Resources had undertaken to complete the distribution of all the shares once the S-1 registration
 statement has been declared effective. Notwithstanding the fact that the S-1 registration statement was declared
 effective by the SEC, Nubian Resources elected not to distribute the shares as originally agreed. 

For a period of 12 months following the Effective Date
 of the SPA, or until Nubian owns less than 4.9 of the Athena issued and outstanding shares, Nubian Resources has agreed to exercise
 its voting rights with respect to such shares in a manner to support the recommendations of the Athena Board of Directors except for
 (i) voting on any proposed change in control transaction or (ii) voting on any proposed sale of all or substantially all of the
 Excelsior Property, including a property included known as Palmetto. 

Nubian is be entitled to nominate one representative to serve on the Athena Board of Directors. 

3 

Athena s agreement with Nubian Resources includes 100 of
the 140 unpatented claims at Excelsior Springs with two additional patented claims held under a lease option that are subject to a
2 net smelter returns royalty on gold production. Athena subsequently expanded the Excelsior Springs project by staking 51
additional claims with the BLM and purchasing the two patented claims previously under a lease option agreement. 

Excelsior Springs is our flagship project and completed a N.I.
43-101 Technical Report to support our secondary listing on the Canadian Stock Exchange that details past work and drill programs and
highlight future exploration plans to advance the Property. 

We have not presently determined whether our mineral properties contain
mineral reserves that are economically recoverable. 

Our primary focus going forward will be to continue evaluating our
properties, as well as possible acquisitions of additional mineral rights and exploration, all of which will require additional capital. 

Conflicts of Interests 

Magellan Gold Corporation Magellan is a publicly-held
company under common control. Mr. Power is our President, CEO and a director and is a former officer and director of Magellan. John Gibbs
is a significant shareholder of both Athena and Magellan. 

Silver Saddle Resources, LLC Silver Saddle is a private
company under common control. Mr. Power and Mr. Gibbs are significant investors and managing members of Silver Saddle. 

Athena, Magellan and Silver Saddle are exploration stage companies,
and each is involved in the business of acquisition and exploration of mineral resources. 

The existence of common ownership and common management could result
in significantly different operating results or financial position from those that could have resulted had Athena, Magellan and Silver
Saddle been autonomous. In addition, the common ownership could result in significant conflicts of interest both in terms of the allocation
of working capital as well as under the doctrine of corporate opportunity, since all three entities are engaged in mineral exploration
in the United States. Messrs. Power and Gibbs have not adopted any policy or guidelines to mitigate the potential adverse effects of their
conflicting interests between and among, Athena, Magellan and Silver Saddle. 

Investors in Athena should be cognizant that the interests of Athena
may, in the future, be in conflict with the other activities of Athena s control persons. 

EXCELSIOR SPRINGS PROJECT 

Excelsior Springs is Athena Gold s flagship property, which is
located in the southern portion of the Walker Lane. The Excelsior Springs project has been explored by a number of companies over the
past 30 years. The target is a large tonnage, moderate grade gold deposit amenable to open pit mining. The Company was granted a drilling
and exploration permit (the Drill Permit by the BLM at the Excelsior Springs project in Esmeralda County, Nevada
(the Excelsior Springs Project ). A drilling contractor was engaged and a Phase One RC drill program consisting of
5,575 feet (11 holes) Reverse Circulation RC drilling program was completed in early April 2022. A Phase Two RC drill
program consisting of 2,700 feet (9 holes) was completed in October 2022. A Phase 3 drill program is planned for 2023 subject to sufficient
capital being raised in 2023 to complete the next drill program.

Location and Access: 

The Excelsior Springs Property is located in the southeast part of
unsurveyed Township 5 south, Range 39 and 40 east, MDBM, Esmeralda County, Nevada, approximately 45 miles southwest of Goldfield, Nevada.
The Property is accessed by traveling 14.5 miles (23.2 km) south of Goldfield on US highway 95 and then turning west onto Nevada State
Route 266 at Lida Junction and proceeding west for approximately 28.7 miles (45.9 km). Just past mile marker 12, a county-maintained gravel
road turns north and leads five miles (8 km) to the Property. There is a locked gate at the southern edge of the patented claims. The
Property lies on the moderately hilly south flank of the Palmetto Mountains at an elevation of 6,000 to 8,000 feet (1,829 2,439
m) with moderate to heavy juniper/pinion pine cover. 

The Excelsior Springs Property comprises 191 unpatented mining claims
and two patented mining claims. All of the claims are held by Nubian Resources USA Nubian and located on Federal
Government land administered by the Department of Interior's Bureau of Land Management BLM ). Athena staked 51 new BLM claims
in Q4-2022 and the remaining 140 BLM claims were acquired as part of the original purchase of the project in December 2021. The two patented
claims were leased to Nubian by the owner, Christian Bramwell, of Pahrump, Nevada until purchased in June 2022 as further described below.
The patented claims, the Prout and Fortunatus (MS 4106), were located in 1873 and 1892, respectively, and were patented in 1912. The patented
claims have both surface and mineral rights. Ownership of the unpatented claims gives the right to explore for and develop mineral resources
but no surface rights. 

The Property consisted of 42 EX and 88 ES contiguous,
unpatented lode mining claims covering approximately 2,884 acres (1,167 hct) and two patented claims covering 40 acres (16.1 hct). A separate
block of ten ES claims covering 202 acres (84 hct) is located approximately one mile (1.6 km) northwest of the main block
of claims. 

In September and October 2022, the Company expanded the Excelsior
Springs claim block by staking 51 new BLM claims ES 2R ES 38R and BL 1 BL 32 were staked by Nubian Resources USA Ltd.
(our wholly-owned subsidiary) and filed with the BLM in December 2022 and were assigned serial numbers NV 105804872 NV 105804922. 

The Excelsior Springs project now consists of 191 BLM unpatented claims
and 2 patented claims or approximately 3,900 acres. 

Legal Ownership 

On June 9, 2022, the Company entered into an Acquisition
Agreement (the Agreement to purchase an undivided 100 interest in the Fortunatus and Prout patented lode mining claims
in Esmeralda County, Nevada 185,000. The Agreement was completed in July 2022 with the following terms: 

25,000 will be settled in cash (Paid July 2022) 

35,000 of the purchase price settled by the issuance of 500,000 shares of the Company s common stock (Issued); and 

125,000 will be settled by a loan, repayable by the Company in quarterly installments
of 25,000, beginning November 13, 2022 (paid), and continuing until October 13, 2023, at which time the entire remaining unpaid principal
balance will be payable. The balance on the loan as of the date of this filing is 75,000. 

Nubian Resources Ltd (The seller retained a 1 Net
Smelter Returns Royalty (the NSR Royalty on the claims it sold to Athena. One-half (0.5 of the NSR Royalty may be
purchased by Athena for CAD 500,000 payable to Nubian Resources. An additional one-half (0.5 of the NSR Royalty may be purchased by Athena
at fair market value.

History: 

The Buster Mine claim block was discovered in 1872 and has been through
several periods of small-scale mining and exploration efforts. During the late 1800s and perhaps the early 1900s there was unconfirmed
production from the Buster Mine of an estimated 18,000 tons at 1.2 oz Au/ton (37.3 g/T). Little else is known about work on the mine until
Fernand Lemieux re-timbered the Buster shaft in 1964 at a reported cost of 50,000 (Grant, 1986). A visual inspection of the shaft indicated
the ladders were still in good condition. Since 1964, the Property has been explored by a number of companies as described below: 

1960s 1970s Efforts to re-timber the shafts and attempts at small scale mining 

1986 Great Pacific Resources (11 RC holes) 

1988 Lucky Hardrock JV (12 RC holes) 

2005-2007 Walker Lane Gold (22 RC holes) 

2008 Evolving Gold (8 RC holes) 

2011-2014 Global Geoscience and partner Osisko Mining (31 RC holes Geophysics) 

Geology and Mineralization: 

The project comprises 140 unpatented and two patented lode claims covering
2,884 acres (1,167 hct). The project has had some historic, high-grade gold production from silicified zones on the patented claims. These
zones are contained in several, large, intensely altered, E-W-trending shear zones in Paleozoic siltstones and limestones. These shear
zones host structurally and lithologically controlled gold mineralization within a 3 X 1 km area of intense clay alteration. The shear
zones have been collectively named the Excelsior Springs Shear Zone, ESSZ, and form the core of the exploration targets on the property. 

Geology and Mineralization. The Property lies within the Walker
Lane, a regional-scale zone of northwest-trending, strike-slip faulting. The Walker Lane hosts a significant number of precious metal
deposits including the Comstock Lode at Virginia City, Borealis, Aurora, Mineral Ridge, Paradise Peak, Rawhide, Tonopah, Goldfield and
the Bullfrog District. These deposits are Tertiary in age, and all have a very strong structural control for the mineralization. However,
the author has not verified information with respect to the abovementioned deposits, and information in this Report with respect to these
deposits is not necessarily indicative of the mineralization on the Excelsior Springs Property. The Excelsior Springs Property area contains
a thick section of basal Precambrian-Cambrian sedimentary rocks that are complexly interlayered by thrust faults with the Ordovician Palmetto
Formation. On the Property, there are a large number of prospect pits, small trenches and drill roads concentrated along the Excelsior
Springs Property structural zone ESSZ ), a 1,000 foot-wide and 10,000 foot-long (304 m x 3,048 m), east-west-trending zone
of shearing and alteration. Underground workings on the two patented claims have been the source of the Property's unverified, historic
production, reported to be 19,200 oz Au (18,000 tons containing 1.2 oz Au/ton (37.3 g Au/T)). Assay results for the 84 RC holes that have
been drilled on the Property show that 51 of the holes (61 contain a 20-foot interval averaging 0.25 g Au/T, typical cut-off grade
for Nevada open-pit gold mines. Forty of the holes (48 contain a 20-foot interval averaging 0.5 g Au/T, and 24 of the holes (29 contain a 20-foot interval averaging 1.0 g Au/T. 

Property Geology. The Excelsior Springs Property area contains
basal Precambrian-Cambrian sedimentary rocks complexly interlayered by thrust faults with the Ordovician Palmetto Formation, as seen in
Figure 17 (McKee, 1985). Lithologic units shown on the map are listed below. 

Qa - Alluvium, (Quaternary) - sand and gravel. 

Tq - Quartz porphyry and alaskite dikes, (Miocene) - Light-colored,
quartz-rich fine- grained intrusive rocks. 

Opa - Palmetto Formation, (Ordovician) - Heterogeneous mixture
of dark, thin-bedded chert, shale, limestone and quartzites, usually in thrust fault contact with older rocks. 

Ce - Emigrant Formation, (Cambrian) - Gray- green limey siltstone
with sandstone interbeds. Grades upward into platy, gray, aphanitic limestone with chert nodules, chert beds and intraformational limestone
conglomerates. 

Ch - Harkless Formation, (Cambrian) - Interbedded fine-grained
sandstone, siliceous siltstone and thin limestone. 

6 

Miocene rhyolite and hornblende diorite dikes (Tq) occur throughout
the Property and are particularly abundant in the area east of the Excelsior Springs Property. Most of the dikes are aligned parallel
to the east-west to east-northeast trends of the mineralization in the ESSZ. The quartz-rich rhyolite dikes appear to be more closely
associated with alteration and gold mineralization than do the hornblende diorite dikes. 

The 3,500 foot-thick (1,067 m), Cambrian-age (Ch) Harkless Formation
seems to be the predominant host for the alteration and mineralization and is divided into a lower, greenish-gray quartz-rich siltstone
member and an upper olive-gray siltstone member. Limestone layers, up to 100 feet-thick (30 m), occur in the lower member. The Cambrian-age
(Ce) Emigrant Formation overlying the Harkless consists of a lower, multi-colored limestone-siltstone member, a middle, greenish-gray
shale member and an upper, gray, cherty limestone member. The Emigrant Formation is about 1,300 feet-thick (396 m). 

Mineralized Zones. The east-west trending ESSZ shows strong
hydrothermal alteration over an area 1,000-1,800 feet-wide (305 549 m) and 10,000 feet-long (3,050 m) and appears to extend under
Quaternary gravels to the west of the Buster and pit areas. In addition to the area around the Buster shaft, there are many other scattered
zones of anomalous gold and base metal mineralization within the ESSZ. There are large, well developed, east-west-trending drainages to
the north and south of the ESSZ. These drainages also contain outcrops of strongly altered rocks that have not been closely examined.
Mineralization on the claims is hosted mostly in the Harkless Formation and the Emigrant Formation. Mineralization occurs almost entirely
in shear zones which are characterized by brecciation, silicification and local mylonitization. The ESSZ contains well developed fractures
striking east-west and well mineralized sets of north-, northeast- and northwest-striking fractures. There are several gold-bearing quartz
veins containing galena and tetrahedrite in the shear zones that represent a post-deformation period of mineralization. Most of the mineralized
zones do not contain visible sulfides. 

7 

Gold mineralization is localized by the structures and occurs as veinlets
and veins. Gold also appears to occur in a disseminated form in favorable stratigraphic units. Brecciated quartz veins are common in the
mineralized zones but frequently exhibit no direct correlation with higher gold values. Quartz-copper veins and pods of white quartz are
also brecciated and locally re-cemented with fine-grained crystalline to chalcedonic silica. A strong correlation between visible copper
and/ or zinc oxides and carbonates and higher-grade gold values has been noted. Cadmium and antimony values are anomalous but somewhat
randomly distributed, and arsenic is strongly correlated with gold values greater than 8 ppm. 

EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES: 

Summary 

Athena has begun an initial work program for the Excelsior Springs
Property comprising the following: 

Data compilation and review; 

Geologic mapping and sampling of selected areas of the project; 

Acquisition and evaluation of hyperspectral satellite imagery for alteration studies; 

Refining the project's structural model for mineralization; 

Developing a 3-D, computer generated model of the Buster area mineralization; 

Creating a new set of 1:1200 scale cross sections to include all drill holes. 

(a) Data Compilation. There is a large amount of historic data
generated by previous exploration programs on the Property. Much of the earlier data is incomplete and weakly documented but still useful.
A new compilation of all the drilling results including collar location, hole azimuth, dip, total depth and gold values has been completed
and used to construct the three-dimensional model and new cross sections. 

(b) Geologic Mapping and Sampling. Approximately 20 man-days
have been spent mapping in selected areas of the project. Mapping was done on detailed color photos at a scale of 1:2,400 with a particular
focus on alteration zones and structural features. This new work is being integrated into the existing geologic map and will be fully
digital. The new geologic map has not been completed, but it will serve as a base layer for showing alteration, mineralization, structures,
geophysical data and drill hole projections. In conjunction with the mapping of selected areas, the Company has collected and processed
100 surface rock chip samples. Custody of these samples was maintained by the geologists and then delivered to American Assay Labs in
Sparks, Nevada. All samples were fire assayed for gold, and an ICP process was used for other elements. The assay process is described
in Section 11.1 of this Report and duplicate, standard and blank samples were used. 

(c) Hyperspectral Data. 
SpecTir Imagery of Reno, Nevada provided a suite of hyperspectral images covering the area around the project. The study shows the alteration
mineralogy image generated by the SpecTIR data. The Buster zone clearly shows strong kaolinite and sodium-rich illite (paragonite) alteration.
The strong clay alteration zone continues eastward to the Ridge zone (447300 E) and further east into the Excelsior Springs Property area
(448000 E). Further east and west from the Buster zone the clay mineralogy becomes potassium-rich phengite along with muscovite. 

(d) Refining the Structural
Model. Ore deposits found within the Walker Lane and particularly mineralized zones in the ESSZ are both structurally and lithologically
controlled. 

(e) Three-Dimensional
Model. Geo Vector Consultants and Mountain Goat Consulting has utilized the updated drill hole data base for the Property and has
generated the 3-D model for the mineralized zones. There are multiple intercepts of potentially well mineralized material in many of
the holes, but further infill drilling is needed to better confirm continuity of the zones between the holes. 

8 

(f) Cross Sections. 
Mine Development Associates MDA ), a division of RESPEC Inc., consultants in Reno, generated a complete set of 1:600 scale
cross sections along with a topographic map showing all of the drill holes and mineralized intervals. 

The Company was granted a drilling and exploration permit (the Drill
Permit by the BLM in December 2021 for its Excelsior Springs Project in Esmeralda County, Nevada. The permit was amended in
2022. Athena has posted the required reclamation bond with the BLM to secure the Drill Permit. 

Athena entered into a contract with New Frontier
Drilling and in April 2022 completed its maiden drill program with 11 RC holes on both the patented and unpatented claims totaling approximately
5,500 feet. 

The Company updated its permit with the BLM with
additional locations and completed a Phase 2 drill program with 9 RC holes on both the patanted and unpatented claims totalling approximately
2,800 feet. 

Athena submitted the samples from the drill program
to an independent assay lab in Reno, Nevada for analysis.

Future exploration phases would be needed to precisely
define depth, width, length, tonnage and value per ton of any deposit that has been identified and would involve: 

RC and CORE drilling. A permit is in place with
 the BLM and a bond has been posted to allow for additional RC drilling. 
 
 Conduct a new gradient array IP survey that will
 provide data to a depth of approximately 900 feet (274 m) and better define the southwestern chargeability zone. 

conducting metallurgical testing; and 

obtaining other pertinent technical information required to define an ore reserve and complete a feasibility study. 

Depending upon the nature of the particular deposit,
future exploration phases on the property could take one to five years or more and cost well in excess of 1 million.

OTHER NON-MATERIAL PROJECTS 

(a) 
 PALMETTO PROSPECT 

Nubian Resources USA, Ltd. also holds nine (9)
unpatented mining claims covering a prospect known as Palmetto located in the Railroad Springs Mining District in Esmeralda County, Nevada.
The Company has no current plans to explore the prospect and the claims are held for investment. 

(b) 
 CROW SPRINGS PROSPECT 

Athena leased from an independent geologist seven unpatented mining
claims and then staked four additional unpatented mining claims for a total of eleven (11) claims in the Crow Springs Mining District
located in Esmeralda County, Nevada. 

The Company has no current plans to explore the
prospect and the claims are held for investment. 

No Proven or Probable Mineral Reserves/Exploration Stage Company 

We are considered an exploration stage company under SEC criteria since
we have not demonstrated the existence of proven or probable mineral reserves at any of our properties. 

The SEC s Final Rule 13-10570,
Modernization of Property Disclosures for Mining Registrants, became effective March 30, 2019, and rescinds SEC Industry Guide 7
following a two-year transition period. 

Under the former Industry Guide 7, the SEC defined a reserve 
as that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination.
Proven or probable mineral reserves were those reserves for which (a) quantity is computed and (b) the sites for inspection,
sampling, and measurement are spaced so closely that the geologic character is defined and size, shape and depth of mineral content can
be established (proven) or the sites are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced but high enough to assume continuity between
observation points (probable). Mineral Reserves could not be considered proven or probable unless and until they are supported by a feasibility
study, indicating that the mineral reserves have had the requisite geologic, technical and economic work performed and are economically
and legally extractable. 

The final rule s amendments require disclosure of both mineral
reserves and mineral resources. Under the final rule, a mineral reserve is defined as an estimate of tonnage and grade or quality
of indicated and measured mineral resources that, in the opinion of the qualified person, can be the basis of an economically viable
project. A mineral resource is defined as a concentration or occurrence of material of economic interest in or on the Earth s
crust in such form, grade or quality, and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for economic extraction. Under the SEC s
former disclosure requirements under Industry Guide 7, , an assessment of the economic viability of mineral reserves must be supported
by a final feasibility study. By contrast, the final rule s amendments provide that a prefeasibility study, which is more limited
in scope than a final feasibility study, will also be sufficient to support such an assessment. As for mineral resources, their disclosure
is prohibited under former SEC guidance unless it is required under the regulations of another jurisdiction, such as Canada. Under the
final rule s amendments, however, mineral resources must be disclosed and categorized as measured (if the geological
sampling is conclusive ), indicated (if the geological sampling is adequate ), or inferred 
(if the geological sampling is limited ). Effectively, the categorization is based on the company s confidence in
its ability to develop the mineral resources, which depends on the sampling and testing that have been performed. The final rule s
amendments also require companies to disclose exploration results when such information would be material to investors. Further, the
disclosures required under the final rule must be supported by the work of a qualified person, such as a mine engineer. When a company
first reports mineral reserves or resources, or makes a material change to such disclosures, it must file a technical report summary
supporting the disclosure. Developing this detailed disclosure information (e.g., by using an expert) and maintaining appropriate disclosure
controls and procedures over it requires significant time, resources, and effort.

MARKETING 

All of our mining operations, if successful, will produce gold in dor 
form or a concentrate that contains gold. 

We plan to market our refined metal and dor to credit worthy
bullion trading houses, market makers and members of the London Bullion Market Association, industrial companies and sound financial institutions.
The refined metals will be sold to end users for use in electronic circuitry, jewelry, silverware, and the pharmaceutical and technology
industries. Generally, the loss of a single bullion trading counterparty would not adversely affect us due to the liquidity of the markets
and the availability of alternative trading counterparties. 

We plan to refine and market its precious metals dor and concentrates
using a geographically diverse group of third party smelters and refiners. The loss of any one smelting and refining client may have a
material adverse effect if alternate smelters and refiners are not available. We believe there is sufficient global capacity available
to address the loss of any one smelter. 

GOVERNMENT REGULATION 

General 

Our activities are and will be subject to extensive federal, state
and local laws governing the protection of the environment, prospecting, mine development, production, taxes, labor standards, occupational
health, mine safety, toxic substances and other matters. The costs associated with compliance with such regulatory requirements are substantial
and possible future legislation and regulations could cause additional expense, capital expenditures, restrictions and delays in the development
and continued operation of our properties, the extent of which cannot be predicted. In the context of environmental permitting, including
the approval of reclamation plans, we must comply with known standards and regulations which may entail significant costs and delays.
Although we are committed to environmental responsibility and believe we are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations,
amendments to current laws and regulations, more stringent implementation of these laws and regulations through judicial review or administrative
action or the adoption of new laws could have a materially adverse effect upon our results of operations. 

Federal Environmental Laws 

Certain mining wastes from extraction and beneficiation of ores are
currently exempt from the extensive set of Environmental Protection Agency EPA regulations governing hazardous waste,
although such wastes may be subject to regulation under state law as a solid or hazardous waste. The EPA has worked on a program to regulate
these mining wastes pursuant to its solid waste management authority under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act RCRA ).
Certain ore processing and other wastes are currently regulated as hazardous wastes by the EPA under RCRA. If our future mine wastes,
if any, were treated as hazardous waste or such wastes resulted in operations being designated as a Superfund site under
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act CERCLA or Superfund for cleanup,
material expenditures would be required for the construction of additional waste disposal facilities or for other remediation expenditures.
Under CERCLA, any present owner or operator of a Superfund site or an owner or operator at the time of its contamination generally may
be held liable and may be forced to undertake remedial cleanup action or to pay for the government s cleanup efforts. Such owner
or operator may also be liable to governmental entities for the cost of damages to natural resources, which may be substantial. Additional
regulations or requirements may also be imposed upon our future tailings and waste disposal, if any, in Nevada under the Federal Clean
Water Act CWA and state law counterparts. We have reviewed and considered current federal legislation relating to climate
change and we do not believe it to have a material effect on our operations. Additional regulation or requirements under any of these
laws and regulations could have a materially adverse effect upon our results of operations.

Unpatented Mining Claims: The Mining Law of 1872 

Except for the Langtry Property, our mineral rights consist of leases
covering unpatented mining claims created and maintained in accordance with the U.S. General Mining Law of 1872, or the General
Mining Law. Unpatented mining claims are unique U.S. property interests, and are generally considered to be subject to greater
title risk than other real property interests because the validity of unpatented mining claims is often uncertain. The validity of an
unpatented mining claim, in terms of both its location and its maintenance, is dependent on strict compliance with a complex body of federal
and state statutory and decisional law that supplement the General Mining Law. Also, unpatented mining claims and related rights, including
rights to use the surface, are subject to possible challenges by third parties or contests by the federal government. In addition, there
are few public records that definitively control the issues of validity and ownership of unpatented mining claims. We have not filed a
patent application for any of our unpatented mining claims that are located on federal public lands in the United States and, under possible
future legislation to change the General Mining Law, patents may be difficult to obtain. 

17 

Location of mining claims under the General Mining Law, is a self-initiation
system under which a person physically stakes an unpatented mining claim on public land that is open to location, posts a location notice
and monuments the boundaries of the claim in compliance with federal laws and regulations and with state location laws, and files notice
of that location in the county records and with the BLM. Mining claims can be located on land as to which the surface was patented into
private ownership under the Stockraising Homestead Act of 1916, 43 U.S.C. 299, but the mining claimant cannot injure, damage or
destroy the surface owner's permanent improvements and must pay for damage to crops caused by prospecting. Discovery of a valuable mineral
deposit, as defined under federal law, is essential to the validity of an unpatented mining claim and is required on each mining claim
individually. The location is made as a lode claim for mineral deposits found as veins or rock in place, or as a placer claim for other
deposits. While the maximum size and shape of lode claims and placer claims are established by statute, there are no limits on the number
of claims one person may locate or own. The General Mining Law also contains provision for acquiring five-acre claims of non-mineral land
for millsite purposes. A mining operation typically is comprised of many mining claims. 

The holder of a valid unpatented mining claim has possessory title
to the land covered thereby, which gives the claimant exclusive possession of the surface for mining purposes and the right to mine and
remove minerals from the claim. Legal title to land encompassed by an unpatented mining claim remains in the United States, and the government
can contest the validity of a mining claim. The General Mining Law requires the performance of annual assessment work for each claim,
and subsequent to enactment of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, 43 U.S.C. 1201 et seq. , mining claims
are invalidated if evidence of assessment work is not timely filed with BLM. However, in 1993 Congress enacted a provision requiring payment
of 140 per year claim maintenance fee in lieu of performing assessment work, subject to an exception for small miners having less than
10 claims. No royalty is paid to the United States with respect to minerals mined and sold from a mining claim. The current annual maintenance fee is 165 per unpatented claim payable to the Bureau of Land Management. 

The General Mining Law provides a procedure for a qualified claimant
to obtain a mineral patent i.e., fee simple title to the mining claim) under certain conditions. It has become much more difficult
in recent years to obtain a patent. Beginning in 1994, Congress imposed a funding moratorium on the processing of mineral patent applications
which had not reached a designated stage in the patent process at the time the moratorium went into effect. Additionally, Congress has
considered several bills in recent years to repeal the General Mining Law or to amend it to provide for the payment of royalties to the
United States and to eliminate or substantially limit the patent provisions of the law. 

Mining claims are conveyed by deed, or leased by the claimant to the
party seeking to develop the property. Such a deed or lease (or memorandum of it) needs to be recorded in the real property records of
the county where the property is located, and evidence of such transfer needs to be filed with BLM. It is not unusual for the grantor
or lessor to reserve a royalty, which as to precious metals often is expressed as a percentage of net smelter returns. 

Patented Mining Claims 

Patented mining claims, such as the two patented claims included in
the Excelsior Springs project, are mining claims on federal lands that are held in fee simple by the owner. No maintenance fees
or royalties are payable to the BLM; however, lease payments and royalties are payable under the operative leases.

EMPLOYEES AND CONSULTANTS 

We have only one part-time employee, Mr. Power, who devotes approximately
25 of his time and attention to our business. We have agreed to pay Mr. Power 2,500 per month for his services. 

We rely heavily on the services of consulting engineers and geologists. 

ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS. 

An investment in our securities is speculative and involves a high
degree of risk. Please carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the possibility of the loss of your entire investment,
before deciding to invest in our securities. 

Risks Related to our Business 

Due to our history of operating losses our auditors have expressed
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue
as a going concern. Due to our continuing operating losses and negative cash flows from our operations, the report of our auditors issued
in connection with our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021 contain explanatory paragraphs indicating
that the foregoing matters raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We cannot provide any assurance
that we will be able to continue as a going concern. 

Uncontrollable events like the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively
impact our operations. 

The occurrence of an uncontrollable event
such as the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively affect our operations. A pandemic typically results in social distancing, travel bans and
quarantine, and this may limit access to our facilities, customers, management, support staff and professional advisors. These factors,
in turn, may not only impact our operations, financial condition and demand for our goods and services but our overall ability to react
timely to mitigate the impact of this event. Also, it may hamper our efforts to comply with our filing obligations with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. 

19 

We have no history of or experience in mineral production. 

We have no history of or experience in producing gold or other metals.
The development of our Excelsior Springs Project would require the construction and operation of mines, processing plants, and related
infrastructure. As a result, we would be subject to all of the risks associated with establishing a new mining operation and business
enterprise. We may never successfully establish mining operations, and any such operations may not achieve profitability. 

Our principal shareholders and control
persons are also principal shareholders and control persons of Athena, Magellan Gold and Silver Saddle, which could result in conflicts
with the interests of minority stockholders. 

Magellan Gold Corporation Magellan is a publicly-held
company under common control. Mr. Power is our President, CEO and a director and is a former officer and director of Magellan. John Gibbs
is a significant shareholder of both Athena and Magellan. 

Messrs. Gibbs and Power are control persons
and principal shareholders of Athena and Silver Saddle. Athena, Magellan and Silver Saddle are engaged in mineral exploration activities,
although in different geographical regions. While the geographical focus of the companies is different, numerous conflicts could arise
in the future. For example, Messrs. Gibbs and Power have provided the majority of working capital for all three companies to date, and
in the likely event that these companies require additional capital in the future, their resources may be inadequate to finance the activities
of all. In addition, if new prospects become available, a conflict may exist with respect to which company to offer those opportunities.
Messrs. Gibbs and Power have not developed a conflict of interest policy to mitigate the potential adverse effects of these conflicts
and as a result these conflicts represent a significant risk to the shareholders of the Company. Conflicts for access to limited resources
and opportunities cannot be eliminated completely, and investors should be aware of their potential. 

Our principal executive officer intends
to devote only a limited amount of his time and attention to our business. 

Mr. Power is the only executive officer of
Athena. He anticipates that he will only devote approximately 25 of his time and attention to our business. This limited focus could
result in significant delays in our exploration and development activities and ability to generate revenues and profits, if any, in the
future. 

We have no proven or probable reserves
and our properties are in the exploration stage 

We have not established that our properties contain
any mineral reserve according to recognized reserve guidelines, nor can there be any assurance that we will be able to do so. A mineral
reserve is defined by the SEC in Regulation SK 1300 as that part of a mineral deposit, which could be economically and legally extracted
or produced at the time of the reserve determination. The probability of an individual prospect ever having a reserve that
meets the requirements of Regulation SK 1300 is extremely remote; in all probability our mineral properties do not contain any reserves 
and any funds that we spend on exploration could be lost. Even if we do eventually discover a mineral reserve on our properties, there
can be no assurance that they can be developed into producing mines and extract those minerals. Both mineral exploration and development
involve a high degree of risk and few mineral properties which are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. 

The commercial viability of an established mineral
deposit will depend on a number of factors including, by way of example, the size, grade and other attributes of the mineral deposit,
the proximity of the mineral deposit to infrastructure such as a smelter, roads and a point for shipping, government regulation and market
prices. Most of these factors will be beyond our control, and any of them could increase costs and make extraction of any identified mineral
deposit unprofitable. 

In order to demonstrate the existence of proven or probable reserves
under SEC guidelines, it would be necessary for us to advance the exploration of our Excelsior Springs Project by significant additional
delineation drilling to demonstrate the existence of sufficient mineralized material with satisfactory continuity which would provide
the basis for a feasibility study which would demonstrate with reasonable certainty that the mineralized material can be economically
extracted and produced. We do not have sufficient data to support a feasibility study with regard to the Excelsior Springs Project, and
in order to perform the drill work to support such feasibility study, we must obtain the necessary permits and funds to continue our exploration
efforts. It is possible that, even after we have obtained sufficient geologic data to support a feasibility study on the Excelsior Springs
Project, such study will conclude that none of the identified mineral deposits can be economically and legally extracted or produced.
If we cannot adequately confirm or discover any mineral reserves of precious metals on the Excelsior Springs Property, we may not be able
to generate any revenues. Even if we discover mineral reserves on the Excelsior Springs Property in the future that can be economically
developed, the initial capital costs associated with development and production of any reserves found is such that we might not be profitable
for a significant time after the initiation of any development or production. The commercial viability of a mineral deposit once discovered
is dependent on a number of factors beyond our control, including particular attributes of the deposit such as size, grade and proximity
to infrastructure, as well as metal prices. In addition, development of a project as significant as Excelsior Springs will likely require
significant debt financing, the terms of which could contribute to a delay of profitability. 

20 

The exploration of mineral properties is highly speculative in nature,
involves substantial expenditures and is frequently non-productive. 

Mineral exploration is highly speculative in nature and is frequently
non-productive. Substantial expenditures are required to: 

establish ore reserves through drilling and metallurgical and other testing techniques; 

determine metal content and metallurgical recovery processes to extract metal from the ore; and, 

design mining and processing facilities. 

If we discover ore at the Excelsior Springs Project, we expect that
it would be several additional years from the initial phases of exploration until production is possible. During this time, the economic
feasibility of production could change. As a result of these uncertainties, there can be no assurance that our exploration programs will
result in proven and probable reserves in sufficient quantities to justify commercial operations at the Excelsior Springs Project. 

Even if our exploration efforts at Excelsior Springs are successful,
we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to develop the Excelsior Springs Project. 

If our exploration efforts at Excelsior Springs are successful, our
current estimates indicate that we would be required to raise at least 50 million in external financing to develop and construct the
Excelsior Springs Project. Sources of external financing could include bank borrowings and debt and equity offerings, but financing has
become significantly more difficult to obtain in the current market environment. The failure to obtain financing would have a material
adverse effect on our growth strategy and our results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that we will commence
production at Langtry or generate sufficient revenues to meet our obligations as they become due or obtain necessary financing on acceptable
terms, if at all, and we may not be able to secure the financing necessary to begin or sustain production at the Excelsior Springs Project.
In addition, should we incur significant losses in future periods, we may be unable to continue as a going concern, and we may not be
able to realize our assets and settle our liabilities in the normal course of business at amounts reflected in our financial statements
included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. 

We may not be able to obtain all of the permits required for development
of the Excelsior Springs Project. 

In the ordinary course of business, mining companies are required to
seek governmental permits for expansion of existing operations or for the commencement of new operations. We will be required to obtain
numerous permits for our Excelsior Springs Project. Obtaining the necessary governmental permits is a complex and time-consuming process
involving numerous jurisdictions and often involving public hearings and costly undertakings. Our efforts to develop the Property
may also be opposed by environmental groups. In addition, mining projects require the evaluation of environmental impacts for
air, water, vegetation, wildlife, cultural, historical, geological, geotechnical, geochemical, soil and socioeconomic conditions. An Environmental
Impact Statement would be required before we could commence mine development or mining activities. Baseline environmental conditions are
the basis on which direct and indirect impacts of the Excelsior Springs Project are evaluated and based on which potential mitigation
measures would be proposed. If the Excelsior Springs Project were found to significantly adversely impact the baseline conditions, we
could incur significant additional costs to avoid or mitigate the adverse impact, and delays in the Excelsior Springs Project could result. 

Permits would also be required for, among other things, storm-water
discharge; air quality; wetland disturbance; dam safety (for water storage and/or tailing storage); septic and sewage; and water rights
appropriation. In addition, compliance must be demonstrated with the Endangered Species Act and the National Historical Preservation Act. 

21 

The mining industry is intensely competitive. 

The mining industry is intensely competitive. We may be at a competitive
disadvantage because we must compete with other individuals and companies, many of which have greater financial resources, operational
experience and technical capabilities than we do. Increased competition could adversely affect our ability to attract necessary capital
funding or acquire suitable producing properties or prospects for mineral exploration in the future. We may also encounter increasing
competition from other mining companies in our efforts to locate acquisition targets, hire experienced mining professionals and acquire
exploration resources. 

Our future success is subject to risks inherent in the mining industry. 

Our future mining operations, if any, would be subject to all of the
hazards and risks normally incident to developing and operating mining properties. These risks include: 

insufficient ore reserves; 

fluctuations in metal prices and increase in production costs that may make mining of reserves uneconomic; 

significant environmental and other regulatory restrictions; 

labor disputes; geological problems; 

failure of underground stopes and/or surface dams; 

force majeure events; and 

the risk of injury to persons, property or the environment. 

Our future profitability will be affected by changes in the prices
of metals. 

If we establish reserves, complete a favorable feasibility study for
the Excelsior Springs Project, and complete development of a mine, our profitability and long-term viability will depend, in large part,
on the market price of gold. The market prices for metals are volatile and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including: 

global or regional consumption patterns; 

supply of, and demand for, silver and other metals; 

speculative activities; 

expectations for inflation; and 

political and economic conditions. 

The aggregate effect of these factors on metals prices is impossible
for us to predict. Decreases in metals prices could adversely affect our ability to finance the exploration and development of our properties,
which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and cash flows. There can be no assurance
that metals prices will not decline. 

22 

The market price of gold is volatile. Low gold prices could result
in decreased revenues, decreased net income or increased losses and decreased cash flows, and may negatively affect our business. 

Gold is a commodity. Its price fluctuates, and is affected by many
factors beyond our control, including interest rates, expectations regarding inflation, speculation, currency values, governmental decisions
regarding the disposal of precious metals stockpiles, global and regional demand and production, political and economic conditions and
other factors. 

The price of gold may decline in the future. Factors that are generally
understood to contribute to a decline in the price of gold include sales by private and government holders, and a general global economic
slowdown. If the price of silver is depressed for a sustained period and our net losses continue, we may be forced to suspend operations
until the prices increase, and to record asset impairment write-downs. Any continued or increased net losses or asset impairment write-downs
would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

We might be unable to raise additional financing necessary to complete
capital needs, conduct our business and make payments when due. 

We will need to raise additional funds in order to meet capital needs
and implement our business plan. Any required additional financing might not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.
If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, holders of our common stock could experience significant dilution of their
ownership interest, and these securities could have rights senior to those of the holders of our common stock. 

Mineral exploration and development inherently involves significant
and irreducible financial risks. We may suffer from the failure to find and develop profitable mines. 

The exploration for and development of mineral deposits involves significant
financial risks, which even a combination of careful evaluation, experience and knowledge may not eliminate. Unprofitable efforts may
result from the failure to discover mineral deposits. Even if mineral deposits are found, such deposits may be insufficient in quantity
and quality to return a profit from production, or it may take a number of years until production is possible, during which time the economic
viability of the Project may change. Few properties which are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. Mining companies
rely on consultants and others for exploration, development, construction and operating expertise. 

Substantial expenditures are required to establish ore reserves, extract
metals from ores and, in the case of new properties, to construct mining and processing facilities. The economic feasibility of any development
project is based upon, among other things, estimates of the size and grade of ore reserves, proximity to infrastructures and other resources
(such as water and power), metallurgical recoveries, production rates and capital and operating costs of such development projects, and
metals prices. Development projects are also subject to the completion of favorable feasibility studies, issuance and maintenance of necessary
permits and receipt of adequate financing. 

Once a mineral deposit is developed, whether it will be commercially
viable depends on a number of factors, including: the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure;
government regulations including taxes, royalties and land tenure; land use, importing and exporting of minerals and environmental protection;
and mineral prices. Factors that affect adequacy of infrastructure include: reliability of roads, bridges, power sources and water supply;
unusual or infrequent weather phenomena; sabotage; and government or other interference in the maintenance or provision of such infrastructure.
All of these factors are highly cyclical. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination may result
in not receiving an adequate return on invested capital. 

23 

Significant investment risks and operational costs are associated
with our exploration, development and mining activities. These risks and costs may result in lower economic returns and may adversely
affect our business. 

Mineral exploration, particularly for gold, involves many risks and
is frequently unproductive. If mineralization is discovered, it may take a number of years until production is possible, during which
time the economic viability of the Project may change. 

Development projects may have no operating history upon which to base
estimates of future operating costs and capital requirements. Development project items such as estimates of reserves, metal recoveries
and cash operating costs are to a large extent based upon the interpretation of geologic data, obtained from a limited number of drill
holes and other sampling techniques, and feasibility studies. Estimates of cash operating costs are then derived based upon anticipated
tonnage and grades of ore to be mined and processed, the configuration of the ore body, expected recovery rates of metals from the ore,
comparable facility and equipment costs, anticipated climate conditions and other factors. As a result, actual cash operating costs and
economic returns of any and all development projects may materially differ from the costs and returns estimated, and accordingly, our
financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected. 

The estimation of ore reserves is imprecise and depends upon subjective
factors. Estimated ore reserves may not be realized in actual production. Our operating results may be negatively affected by inaccurate
estimates. 

If, in the future, we present estimates of ore reserve figures in our
public filings, those figures may be estimated by our technical personnel. Reserve estimates are a function of geological and engineering
analyses that require us to make assumptions about production costs and gold market prices. Reserve estimation is an imprecise and subjective
process. The accuracy of such estimates is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation,
judgment and experience. Assumptions about gold market prices are subject to great uncertainty as those prices have fluctuated widely
in the past. Declines in the market prices of gold may render future potential reserves containing relatively lower grades of ore uneconomic
to exploit, and we may be required to reduce reserve estimates, discontinue development or mining at one or more of our properties, or
write down assets as impaired. Should we encounter mineralization or geologic formations at any of our projects different from those we
predicted, we may adjust our reserve estimates and alter our mining plans. Either of these alternatives may adversely affect our actual
future production and operating results. 

The estimation of the ultimate recovery of metals contained within
a heap leach pad inventory is inherently inaccurate and subjective and requires the use of estimation techniques. Actual recoveries can
be expected to vary from estimations. 

We expect to use the heap leach process to extract gold from ore. The
heap leach process is a process of extracting gold by placing ore on an impermeable pad and applying a diluted cyanide solution that dissolves
a portion of the contained silver, which is then recovered in metallurgical processes. 

We will use several integrated steps in the process of extracting gold
to estimate the metal content of ore placed on the leach pads. Although we will refine our estimates as appropriate at each step in the
process, the final amounts are not determined until a third-party smelter converts the dor and determines final ounces of gold
available for sale. We will then review this end result and reconcile it to the estimates we developed and used throughout the production
process. Based on this review, we may adjust our estimation procedures when appropriate. As a result, actual recoveries can vary from
estimates, and the amount of the variation could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and
results of operations. 

Gold mining involves significant production and operational risks.
We may suffer from the failure to efficiently operate our mining projects. 

Gold mining involves significant degrees of risk, including those related
to mineral exploration success, unexpected geological or mining conditions, the development of new deposits, climatic conditions, equipment
and/or service failures, compliance with current or new governmental requirements, current availability of or delays in installing and
commissioning plant and equipment, import or customs delays and other general operating risks. Problems may also arise due to the quality
or failure of locally obtained equipment or interruptions to services (such as power, water, fuel or transport or processing capacity)
or technical support, which results in the failure to achieve expected target dates for exploration or production activities and/or result
in a requirement for greater expenditure. The right to develop gold reserves may depend on obtaining certain licenses and quotas, the
granting of which may be at the discretion of the relevant regulatory authorities. There may be delays in obtaining such licenses and
quotas, leading to our results of operations being adversely affected, and it is possible that from time-to-time mining licenses may be
refused. 

24 

There will be significant hazards associated with our mining activities,
some of which may not be fully covered by insurance. To the extent we must pay the costs associated with such risks, our business may
be negatively affected. 

The mining business is subject to risks and hazards, including environmental
hazards, industrial accidents, the encountering of unusual or unexpected geological formations, cave-ins, flooding, earthquakes and periodic
interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions. These occurrences could result in damage to, or destruction of, mineral
properties or production facilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage, reduced production and delays in mining, asset write-downs,
monetary losses and possible legal liability. Insurance fully covering many environmental risks (including potential liability for pollution
or other hazards as a result of disposal of waste products occurring from exploration and production) is not generally available to us
or to other companies in the industry. Although we maintain insurance in an amount that we consider to be adequate, liabilities might
exceed policy limits, in which event we could incur significant costs that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of
operation and liquidity. 

We are subject to significant governmental regulations. 

Our operations and exploration and development activities are subject
to extensive federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing various matters, including: 

environmental protection; 

management and use of toxic substances and explosives; 

management of natural resources; 

exploration and development of mines, production and post-closure reclamation; 

taxation; 

labor standards and occupational health and safety, including mine safety; and 

historic and cultural preservation. 

Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in
civil or criminal fines or penalties or enforcement actions, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities enjoining or
curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures, installation of additional equipment or remedial actions, any of which could result
in us incurring significant expenditures. We may also be required to compensate private parties suffering loss or damage by reason of
a breach of such laws, regulations or permitting requirements. It is also possible that future laws and regulations, or a more stringent
enforcement of current laws and regulations by governmental authorities, could cause additional expense, capital expenditures, restrictions
on or suspensions of any future operations and delays in the exploration of our properties. 

Changes in mining or environmental laws could increase costs and
impair our ability to develop our properties. 

From time to time the U.S. Congress may consider revisions in its mining
and environmental laws. It remains unclear to what extent new legislation may affect existing mining claims. The effect of any such revisions
on our operations cannot be determined conclusively until such revision is enacted; however, such legislation could materially increase
costs on properties located on federal lands, such as ours, and such revision could also impair our ability to develop the Langtry Project
and to explore and develop other mineral projects. 

25 

Compliance with environmental regulations and litigation based on
environmental regulations could require significant expenditures. 

Mining exploration and mining are subject to the potential risks and
liabilities associated with pollution of the environment and the disposal of waste products occurring as a result of mineral exploration
and production. Insurance against environmental risk (including potential liability for pollution or other hazards as a result of the
disposal of waste products occurring from exploration and production) is not generally available to us (or to other companies in the minerals
industry) at a reasonable price. 

Environmental regulations mandate, among other things, the maintenance
of air and water quality standards and land reclamation. They also set forth limitations on the generation, transportation, storage and
disposal of solid and hazardous waste. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner which will require stricter standards and enforcement,
increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects, and a heightened degree
of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors and employees. 

To the extent we are subject to environmental liabilities, the settlement
of such liabilities or the costs that we may incur to remedy environmental pollution would reduce funds otherwise available to us and
could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to fully remedy an environmental
problem, it might be required to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy.
The environmental standards that may ultimately be imposed at a mine site impact the cost of remediation and may exceed the financial
accruals that have been made for such remediation. The potential exposure may be significant and could have a material adverse effect
on our financial condition and results of operations. 

Moreover, governmental authorities and private parties may bring lawsuits
based upon damage to property and injury to persons resulting from the environmental, health and safety impacts of our operations, which
could lead to the imposition of substantial fines, remediation costs, penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions. Substantial costs
and liabilities, including for restoring the environment after the closure of mines, are inherent in our proposed operations. 

Some mining wastes are currently exempt to a limited extent from the
extensive set of federal Environmental Protection Agency EPA regulations governing hazardous waste under the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act RCRA ). If the EPA designates these wastes as hazardous under RCRA, we may be required to
expend additional amounts on the handling of such wastes and to make significant expenditures to construct hazardous waste disposal facilities.
In addition, if any of these wastes causes contamination in or damage to the environment at a mining facility, such facility may be designated
as a Superfund site under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act CERCLA ).
Under CERCLA, any owner or operator of a Superfund site since the time of its contamination may be held liable and may be forced to undertake
extensive remedial cleanup action or to pay for the government s cleanup efforts. Such owner or operator may also be liable to governmental
entities for the cost of damages to natural resources, which may be substantial. Additional regulations or requirements are also imposed
under the federal Clean Water Act CWA ). The Company considers the current proposed federal legislation relating to climate
change and its potential enactment may have future impacts to the Company s operations in the United States. 

In addition, there are numerous legislative and regulatory proposals
related to climate change, including legislation pending in the U.S. Congress to require reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.
The Company has reviewed and considered current federal legislation relating to climate change and does not believe it to have a material
effect on its operations, however, additional regulation or requirements under any of these laws and regulations could have a materially
adverse effect upon the Company and its results of operations. 

26 

Compliance with CERCLA, the CWA and state environmental laws could
entail significant costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. 

In the context of environmental permits, including the approval of
reclamation plans, we must comply with standards and regulations which entail significant costs and can entail significant delays. Such
costs and delays could have a dramatic impact on our operations. There is no assurance that future changes in environmental regulation,
if any, will not adversely affect our operations. We intend to fully comply with all applicable environmental regulations. 

We are required to obtain government permits to begin new operations.
The acquisition of such permits can be materially impacted by third party litigation seeking to prevent the issuance of such permits.
The costs and delays associated with such approvals could affect our operations, reduce our revenues, and negatively affect our business
as a whole. 

Mining companies are required to seek governmental permits for the
commencement of new operations. Obtaining the necessary governmental permits is a complex and time-consuming process involving numerous
jurisdictions and often involving public hearings and costly undertakings. The duration and success of permitting efforts are contingent
on many factors that are out of our control. The governmental approval process may increase costs and cause delays depending on the nature
of the activity to be permitted, and could cause us to not proceed with the development of a mine. Accordingly, this approval process
could harm our results of operations. 

Any of our future acquisitions may result in significant risks,
which may adversely affect our business. 

An important element of our business strategy is the opportunistic
acquisition of precious metal mines, properties and businesses or interests therein. While it is our practice to engage independent mining
consultants to assist in evaluating and making acquisitions, any mining properties or interests therein we may acquire may not be developed
profitably or, if profitable when acquired, that profitability might not be sustained. In connection with any future acquisitions, we
may incur indebtedness or issue equity securities, resulting in increased interest expense, or dilution of the percentage ownership of
existing shareholders. We cannot predict the impact of future acquisitions on the price of our business or our common stock. Unprofitable
acquisitions, or additional indebtedness or issuances of securities in connection with such acquisitions, may impact the price of our
common stock and negatively affect our results of operations. 

We are continuously considering possible acquisitions of additional
mining properties or interests therein that are located in other countries, and could be exposed to significant risks associated with
any such acquisitions. 

In the ordinary course of our business, we are continuously considering
the possible acquisition of additional significant mining properties or interests therein that may be located in countries other than
those in which we now have interests. Consequently, in addition to the risks inherent in the valuation and acquisition of such mining
properties, as well as the subsequent development, operation or ownership thereof, we could be subject to additional risks in such countries
as a result of governmental policies, economic instability, currency value fluctuations and other risks associated with the development,
operation or ownership of mining properties or interests therein. Such risks could adversely affect our results of operations. 

Our ability to find and acquire new mineral properties is uncertain.
Accordingly, our prospects are uncertain for the future growth of our business. 

Because mines have limited lives based on proven and probable ore reserves,
we expect we will be continually seeking to replace and expand any future ore reserves. Identifying promising mining properties is difficult
and speculative. Furthermore, we encounter strong competition from other mining companies in connection with the acquisition of properties
producing or capable of producing gold. Many of these companies have greater financial resources than we do. Consequently, we may be unable
to replace and expand future ore reserves through the acquisition of new mining properties or interests therein on terms we consider acceptable.
As a result, our future revenues from the sale of gold may decline, resulting in lower income and reduced growth. 

27 

Current economic conditions and in the global economy generally,
including ongoing disruptions in the debt and equity capital markets, may adversely affect our business and results of operations, and
our ability to obtain financing. 

The global economy has undergoing a slowdown, which some observers
view as a deepening recession, and the future economic environment may continue to be less favorable than that of recent years. The mining
industry has experienced and may continue to experience significant downturns in connection with, or in anticipation of, declines in general
economic conditions. We are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruptions in debt and equity capital markets
and adverse economic conditions in the United States and other countries, which may continue to have an adverse effect on our business
and results of operations. 

The global stock and credit markets have recently experienced
significant price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which have caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate
substantially and the spreads on prospective and outstanding debt financings to widen considerably. These circumstances have
materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets, making terms for certain financings materially less attractive, and in
certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of financing. This volatility and illiquidity have negatively
affected a broad range of mortgage and asset-backed and other fixed income securities. As a result, the market for fixed income
securities has experienced decreased liquidity, increased price volatility, credit downgrade events, and increased defaults. Global
equity markets have also been experiencing heightened volatility and turmoil, with issuers exposed to the credit markets
particularly affected. These factors and the continuing market disruption have an adverse effect on us, in part because we, like
many companies, from time to time may need to raise capital in debt and equity capital markets including in the asset-backed
securities markets. 

In addition, continued uncertainty in the stock and credit markets
may negatively affect our ability to access additional short-term and long-term financing, including future securitization transactions,
on reasonable terms or at all, which would negatively impact our liquidity and financial condition. In addition, if one or more of the
financial institutions that support our future credit facilities fails, we may not be able to find a replacement, which would negatively
impact our ability to borrow under the credit facilities. These disruptions in the financial markets also may adversely affect our credit
rating and the market value of our common stock. If the current pressures on credit continue or worsen, we may not be able to refinance,
if necessary, our outstanding debt when due, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. While we believe we will have
adequate sources of liquidity to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital, debt servicing and capital expenditures for the
foreseeable future if our operating results worsen significantly and our cash flow or capital resources prove inadequate, or if interest
rates increase significantly, we could face liquidity problems that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and
financial condition. 

As we do not maintain an effective system of internal controls,
we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential shareholders could
lose confidence in our financial reporting. This would harm our business and the trading price of our stock. 

Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable
financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide financial reports or prevent fraud, our business reputation and
operating results could be harmed. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial
information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock. 

Risks Related to Our Stock 

Future issuances of our common stock could dilute current shareholders
and adversely affect the market if it develops. 

We have the authority to issue up to 250 million shares of common stock
and 5 million shares of preferred stock and to issue options and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock, without shareholder
approval. Future share issuances are likely due to our need to raise additional working capital in the future. Those future issuances
will likely result in dilution to our shareholders. In addition, we could issue large blocks of our common stock to fend off unwanted
tender offers or hostile takeovers without further shareholder approval, which would not only result in further dilution to investors
in this offering but could also depress the market value of our common stock, if a public trading market develops. 

28 

We may issue preferred stock that would have rights that are preferential
to the rights of our common stock that could discourage potentially beneficial transactions to our common shareholders. 

An issuance of shares of preferred stock could result in a class of
outstanding securities that would have preferences with respect to voting rights and dividends and in liquidation over our common stock
and could, upon conversion or otherwise, have all of the rights of our common stock. Our Board of Directors' authority to issue preferred
stock could discourage potential takeover attempts or could delay or prevent a change in control through merger, tender offer, proxy contest
or otherwise by making these attempts more difficult or costly to achieve. The issuance of preferred stock could impair the voting, dividend
and liquidation rights of common stockholders without their approval. 

Outstanding shares that are eligible for future sale could adversely
impact a public trading market for our common stock 

In the future, we may offer and sell shares without registration under
the Securities Act. All of such shares will be restricted securities as defined by Rule 144 Rule 144 under the
Securities Act and cannot be resold without registration except in reliance on Rule 144 or another applicable exemption from registration.
Under Rule 144, our non-affiliates can sell restricted shares held for at least six months, subject only to the restriction that we made
available public information as required by Rule 144. Our affiliates can sell restricted securities after six months, subject to compliance
with the volume limitation, manner of sale, Form 144 filing and current public information requirements. 

No prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, that future sales
of restricted shares of common stock, or the availability of such common stock for sale, will have on the market price of the common stock
prevailing from time to time. Sales of substantial amounts of such common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales
may occur, could adversely affect the then prevailing market price of the common stock. 

Owners of our common stock will be subject to the penny stock 
rules. 

Since our shares are not listed on a national stock exchange or quoted
on the Nasdaq Capital Market within the United States, trading in our shares on the OTC market will be subject, to the extent the market
price for our shares is less than 5.00 per share, to a number of regulations known as the penny stock rules . The
penny stock rules require a broker-dealer to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC, to provide the customer
with additional information including current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and
its salesperson in the transaction, monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account,
and to make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the investor and receive the investor s
written agreement to the transaction. To the extent these requirements may be applicable they will reduce the level of trading activity
in the secondary market for our shares and may severely and adversely affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our shares. 

We do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
Any return on investment may be limited to the value of our stock. 

We have never paid any cash dividends on any shares of our capital
stock, and we do not anticipate that we will pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Our current business plan is to retain any future
earnings to finance the expansion of our business. Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our Board
of Directors, and will be dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors as our
board of directors may deem relevant at that time. If we do not pay cash dividends, our stock may be less valuable because a return on
your investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates. 

Delaware law and our by-laws protect our directors
from certain types of lawsuits. 

Delaware law provides that our directors will not be liable to us or
our stockholders for monetary damages for all but certain types of conduct as directors. Our by-laws require us to indemnify our directors
and officers against all damages incurred in connection with our business to the fullest extent provided or allowed by law. The exculpation
provisions may have the effect of preventing stockholders from recovering damages against our directors caused by their negligence, poor
judgment or other circumstances. The indemnification provisions may require us to use our assets to defend our directors and officers
against claims, including claims arising out of their negligence, poor judgment, or other circumstances.

ITEM 5 MARKET FOR REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED
STOCKHOLDER MATTERS. 

Market Information 

The Company s common stock is quoted for trading on the OTCQB
under the symbol AHNR and is traded on the Canadian Securities Exchange (or CSE) under the symbol ATHA . Over-the-counter
market quotations on the OTCQB reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark-down or commission and may not necessarily represent
actual transactions. 

On December 31, 2022, there were 136,091,400 Common Shares issued and
outstanding, and the Company had approximately 92 shareholders of record. On December 30, 2022, the closing price of the shares of common
stock as reported by the CSE was C 0.10 and on OTCQB was 0.06. 

Dividends 

Our Board of Directors may declare and pay dividends on outstanding
shares of common stock out of funds legally available therefore in its sole discretion; however, to date, no dividends have been paid
on common stock and we do not anticipate the payment of dividends in the foreseeable future. 

Trading in our common stock is subject to rules adopted by the SEC
regulating broker dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Those disclosure rules applicable to penny
stocks require a broker dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized
risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC. That disclosure document advises an investor that investment in penny stocks can be very
risky and that the investor's salesperson or broker is not an impartial advisor but rather paid to sell the shares. The disclosure contains
further warnings for the investor to exercise caution in connection with an investment in penny stocks, to independently investigate the
security, as well as the salesperson with whom the investor is working and to understand the risky nature of an investment in this security.
The broker dealer must also provide the customer with certain other information and must make a special written determination that the
penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. Further, the
rules require that, following the proposed transaction, the broker provide the customer with monthly account statements containing market
information about the prices of the securities. 

Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities 

None, except as reported on Forms 8-K. 

Equity Compensation Plan Information

The decrease in legal and professional fees increase is associated with the acquisition and maintenance of the Excelsior Springs project and our listing on the Canadian Stock Exchange CSE in 2021. 

The increase in share-based compensation is due to the following: 
 
 On March 22, 2021, the Company issued a total of 2,000,000 non-statutory
 stock options to four individuals, three of which are Directors of the Company, the other an independent technical consultant. Upon vesting,
 each option is exercisable to purchase one share of common stock at a price of 0.09 per share. The options vest 50 upon issuance, and
 25 on each of the first and second anniversaries of the grant date. The Company recognized share-based compensation expense
 related to the stock options of 128,000 for 2021. In addition, the Company agreed to issue a total of 300,000 restricted stock units
 at a price of 0.10 per share to the independent technical consultant helping design our 2021 exploration programs at Excelsior Springs.
 As such, we have recorded stock-based compensation in the amount of 30,000, with a share-based compensation of 47,548 in 2022 and 

On October 12, 2022, the Company granted 2,250,000 options pursuant to the terms of the Company s Stock Option Plan. The Black Scholes option pricing model was used to estimate the aggregate fair value of the October 2022 options of 106,109 as stock-based compensation. In addition, 675,000 shares were issued to officers and directors with a fair value of 33,750. On August 24, 2022, the Company granted 730,000 options pursuant to the terms of the Company s Stock Option Plan. The Black Scholes option pricing model was used to estimate the aggregate fair value of the August 2022 options of 43,456 as stock-based compensation. 

The increase in stock exchange fees was a result of listing on the CSE and other compliance reporting. 

For the year ended December 31, 2022, there was a variance of approximately
 479,000 for the same period in 2021 in exploration and evaluation expenses. The Company engaged in activities on our exploration programs,
including drilling, mapping, permitting, consulting and assay testing which has resulted in additional exploration cost compared to 2021.

Liquidity and Capital Resources: 

The Company has no revenue generating operations from which it can
internally generate funds. To date, the Company s ongoing operations have been financed by the sale of its equity securities by
way of public offerings, private placements and the exercise of incentive stock options and share purchase warrants. The Company believes
that it will be able to secure additional private placements and public financings in the future, although it cannot predict the size
or pricing of any such financings. This situation is unlikely to change until such time as the Company can develop a bankable feasibility
study on one of its projects. 

During August, September and October 2022,
the Company completed the private placement of four tranches (August 12, 2022; August 31, 2022; September 14, 2022; October 28, 2022)
in which we sold 8,807,700 units. We realized total proceeds of 529,908 net of offering costs. 

In April 2022 the Company completed a private
placement in which we sold 6,250,000 units. We realized total proceeds of 394,082 net of offering costs. 

On May 25, 2021 we completed a private placement
in which we sold 6,250,000 units. We realized total proceeds of 401,823 net of offering costs. Additionally, on September 30, 2021 we
completed a private placement in which we sold 3,108,700 units. We realized total proceeds of 190,552 net of offering costs. 

Going Concern 

Our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis,
which assumes that we will be able to meet our obligations and continue our operations during the next fiscal year. Asset realization
values may be significantly different from carrying values as shown in our consolidated financial statements and do not give effect to
adjustments that would be necessary to the carrying values of assets and liabilities should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 

34 

Liquidity 

As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately
 15,000 of cash and a negative working capital of approximately 215,000. This compares to cash on hand of approximately 73,000 and working
capital of approximately 74,000 at December 31, 2021. 

The Company expects that it will operate at a loss for the foreseeable
future and believes the current cash and cash equivalents and working capital will be sufficient for it to maintain its currently held
properties, fund its planned exploration, and fund its currently anticipated general and administrative costs for at least the next 12
months from the date of this report. 

However, the Company does expect that it will be required to raise additional funds through public
or private equity financings in the future in order to continue in business in the future past the immediate 12-month period. Should such
financing not be available in that timeframe, the Company will be required to reduce its activities and will not be able to carry out
all of its presently planned exploration and, if warranted, development activities on its currently anticipated scheduling. 

Capital Management 

The Company s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern in order to pursue the development and exploration of its mineral properties
and to maintain a flexible capital structure, which optimizes the costs of capital to an acceptable risk. 

As of December 31, 2022, the capital structure of the Company consists
of 136,091,400 shares of common stock, par value 0.0001. The Company manages the capital structure and adjusts it in response to changes
in economic conditions, its expected funding requirements, and risk characteristics of the underlying assets. The Company s funding
requirements are based on cash forecasts. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may issue new debt, new shares
and/or consider strategic alliances. Management reviews its capital management approach on a regular basis. The Company is not subject
to any externally imposed capital requirements. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not engage in any activities involving variable interest entities
or off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP
requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements. The accounting
positions described below are significantly affected by accounting estimates. 

We believe that the significant estimates, assumptions and judgments
used when accounting for items and matters such as capitalized mineral rights, asset valuations, recoverability of assets, asset impairments,
taxes, and other provisions were reasonable, based upon information available at the time they were made. Actual results could differ
from these estimates, making it possible that a change in these estimates could occur in the near term.

ITEM 8 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA. 

The financial statements required by this item
are located in Item 15 beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are incorporated herein by reference. 

ITEM 9 CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON
ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE. 

None, except as previously disclosed. 

ITEM 9A CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within
the time period specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including
the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Our management necessarily applied its judgment
in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance regarding
management's control objectives. 

Our management, with the participation of our CEO, evaluated the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based upon this
evaluation, our CEO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of the identification of a material
weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which is described below. 

Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies
and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations,
including the possibility of human error and the circumvention of overriding controls. Accordingly, even effective internal control over
financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

36 

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this evaluation,
management concluded that that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2022. Our CEO concluded
we have a material weakness due to lack of segregation of duties, a limited corporate governance structure, and a lack of a formal management
review process over preparation of financial information. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies,
in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or
interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

Our size has prevented us from being able to employ sufficient resources
to enable us to have an adequate level of supervision and segregation of duties within our system of internal control. Therefore, while
there are some compensating controls in place, it is difficult to ensure effective segregation of accounting and financial reporting duties.
Management reported the following material weaknesses: 

Lack of segregation of duties in certain accounting and financial reporting processes including the initiation, processing, recording and approval of disbursements; 

Our corporate governance responsibilities are performed by the Board of Directors, none of whom are independent under applicable standards; we do not have an independent audit committee or compensation committee. Our Board of Directors acts primarily by written consent without meetings which results in several of our corporate governance functions not being performed concurrent (or timely) with the underlying transactions, including evaluation of the application of accounting principles and disclosures relating to those transactions; and 

Certain reports that we prepare and accounting and reporting conclusions reached in connection with the financial statement preparation process are not subjected to a formal review process that includes multiple levels of review, and are not submitted timely to the Board of Directors for review or approval. 

While we strive to segregate duties as much as practicable, there is
an insufficient volume of transactions at this point in time to justify additional full-time staff. We believe that this is typical in
many exploration stage companies. We may not be able to fully remediate the material weakness until we commence mining operations at which
time, we would expect to hire more staff. We will continue to monitor and assess the costs and benefits of additional staffing. 

This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our registered
public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by our
registered public accounting firm pursuant to the SEC rules that permit us to provide only management's report in this Annual Report. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.

Expense Reimbursement 

We will reimburse our officers and directors for
reasonable expenses incurred during the course of their performance. 

Retirement Plans and Benefits 

None. 

Indemnification of Directors and Officers 

Our bylaws contain provisions that limit the liability of our directors
for monetary damages to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Consequently, our directors will not be personally liable to us
or our stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duties as directors, except liability for: 

any breach of the director s duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders, 

any act or omission not in good faith or that involves intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, 

unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases, or redemptions as provided in Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or 

any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. 

43 

Our bylaws provide that we are required to indemnify our directors
and executive officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Any repeal of or modification to our restated certificate of incorporation
or bylaws may not adversely affect any right or protection of a director or executive officer for or with respect to any acts or omissions
of such director or executive officer occurring prior to such amendment or repeal. Our bylaws also provide that we may advance expenses
incurred by a director or executive officer in advance of the final disposition of any action or proceeding and permit us to secure insurance
on behalf of any officer, director, employee or other agent for any liability arising out of his or her actions in that capacity regardless
of whether we would otherwise be permitted to indemnify him or her under the provisions of Delaware law. We believe that these bylaw provisions
are necessary to attract and retain qualified persons as directors and officers. 

The limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in our bylaws
may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. They may also reduce the
likelihood of derivative litigation against our directors and executive officers, even though an action, if successful, might benefit
us and other stockholders. Further, a stockholder s investment may be adversely affected to the extent that we pay the costs of
settlement and damage awards against directors and executive officers as required by these indemnification provisions. At present, there
is no pending litigation or proceeding involving any of our directors, officers or employees for which indemnification is sought, and
we are not aware of any threatened litigation that may result in claims for indemnification.

ITEM 13 CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS AND
DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE. 

Except as disclosed herein and in the Notes to Financial Statements,
there have been no transactions or proposed transactions in which the amount involved exceeds the lesser of 120,000 or 1 of the average
of our total assets at year-end for the last two completed fiscal years in which any of our directors, executive officers or beneficial
holders of more than 5 of the outstanding shares of our common stock, or any of their respective relatives, spouses, associates or affiliates,
has had or will have any direct or material indirect interest. 

The information required by this Item is located in the Notes to our
consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are
incorporated herein by reference. 

Director Independence 

Our common stock is listed on the OTC Market Inc. s OTQB and
OTC Pinks inter-dealer quotation systems, which does not have director independence requirements. Nevertheless, for purposes of determining
director independence, we have applied the definition set forth in NASDAQ Rule 4200(a)(15). John C. Power and Brian Power would not
be considered independent under the NASDAQ rule due to the fact that John C. Power is an officer and Brian Power is John
C. Power s brother. 

ITEM 14 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING FEES AND SERVICES. 

We understand the need for our principal accountants to maintain objectivity
and independence in their audit of our financial statements. To minimize relationships that could appear to impair the objectivity of
our principal accountants, our Board of Directors has restricted the non-audit services that our principal accountants may provide to
us primarily to tax services and audit-related services. We are only to obtain non-audit services from our principal accountants when
the services offered by our principal accountants are more effective or economical than services available from other service providers,
and, to the extent possible, only after competitive bidding. These determinations are among the key practices adopted by the Board of
Directors. Our Board has adopted policies and procedures for pre-approving work performed by our principal accountants. 

The aggregate fees billed for the years ended December 31, 2022, and
2021 for professional services rendered by our principal accountants for the audit of our annual financial statements and review of the
financial statements included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and services that are normally provided by our accountants in connection
with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for these fiscal periods were as follows: 

2022 
 2021 
 
 Audit fees - audit of annual financial statements and review of financial statements included in our quarterly reports, services normally provided by the accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings 
 51,900 
 40,500 

Audit-related fees - related to the performance of audit or review of financial statements not reported under "audit fees" 

Tax fees - tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning 
 3,000 
 5,000 

All other fees - services provided by our principal accountants other than those identified above 
 14,000 
 5,500 

Total fees 
 68,900 
 51,000 

After careful consideration, the Board of Directors has determined
that payment of the audit fees is in conformance with the independent status of our principal independent accountants.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of 

 Athena Gold Corporation 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Athena Gold Corporation and its subsidiary (collectively, the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related
notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going Concern Matter 

The accompanying financial statements
have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the
Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency that raises substantial doubt about its ability
to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do
not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were
we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures
to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that
respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

for the 
shares issued. The transaction does not constitute a business combination in accordance with ASC 805, which defines a business as an integrated
set of activities and assets capable of being conducted and managed for the purposes of providing a return to investors or other participants
and that a business consists of inputs and processes applied to those inputs that have the ability to contribute to the creation of outputs.
Management has determined that the acquired assets do not contain processes sufficient to constitute a business in accordance with ASC
805. The transaction represents the acquisition of assets in exchange for the assumption of liabilities and the issuance of share-based
payments. 

On June 9, 2022, the Company entered into an Acquisition
Agreement (the Agreement to purchase an undivided 100 interest in the Fortunatus and Prout patented lode mining claims
in Esmeralda County, Nevada . The Agreement was completed in July 2022 with the following terms: 

will be settled in cash (Paid July 2022) 

of the purchase price settled by the issuance of shares of the Company s common stock (Issued); and 

will be settled by a loan, repayable by the Company in quarterly installments of 25,000,
 beginning November 13, 2022 (paid), and continuing until October 13, 2023, at which time the entire remaining unpaid principal
 balance will be payable. The balance due as of December 31, 2022 is . 

in favor of Clifford Neuman, the Company s
legal counsel, representing accrued and unpaid fees for past legal services. The Note was unsecured and accrues interest at the rate of
 per annum, compounded quarterly, and is due on demand. The principal and accrued interest due under the Note may be converted, at the
option of the holder, into shares of the Company s common stock. 

On April 24, 2020, the Company agreed to reduce
the conversion price from 0.0735 per share to 0.0210 per share. All other terms of the Note remain unchanged, and therefore did not
change the cash flows of the Note. The Company determined the transaction was considered an extinguishment because of the change in conversion
price in which no gain or loss was recorded according to ASC 470-50. However, because the conversion price was reduced below the 0.03
market value on the date of the change, a beneficial conversion feature resulted from the price reduction in the amount of , which
was accounted for as a discount to the debt and a corresponding increase in additional paid in capital. The debt discount is being amortized
on a straight-line basis over one year to interest expense. A total of was amortized to interest expense during the twelve months
ended December 31, 2021 

On November 30, 2021, the Company received a notice
of conversion of the Note with a principal balance of and a conversion price of . On December 3, 2021, a total of

in escrow. In September 2022, the Company issued shares of common stock as a part of the private placement offering to settle
 of notes payable and of accrued interest to Mr. Gibbs. 

The warrants have an exercise price in Canadian

the warrants have a derivative liability value.
