Business GENERAL As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company or PGI refers, unless the context otherwise requires, to PGI Incorporated and its subsidiaries. This is a final SEC filing for PGI. Effective December 21, 2022, the Officers and Directors of PGI executed a Resolution to cease operations and allow the dissolution and wind up of the affairs of the Company. The Company, a Florida corporation, was founded in 1958, and up until the mid 1990 s was in the business of building and selling homes, developing and selling home sites and selling undeveloped or partially developed tracts of land. Over approximately the last 30 years, the Company s business focus has concentrated on its sales of its remaining real estate. This change was prompted by its continuing financial difficulties due to the principal and interest owed on its debt. For many years, the Company s independent accountants and management stated in its SEC filings that there was substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. PGI has been filing as an Inactive Registrant since 2019 when the Board of Directors of PGI concluded that PGI met all of the conditions of an Inactive Entity as that term is defined in Rule 3-11 of Regulation S-X and is further contemplated in the Securities and Exchange Commission s Division of Corporation Finance s Financial Reporting Manual section 1320.2. Accordingly, the financial statements have been unaudited. The Company has been administratively dissolved by the Florida Secretary of State for the 2022 calendar year. During 2022, two single family lots were sold and Sugarmill Woods Inc. Sugarmill Woods realized approximately 39,000. The costs of continued operations, including insurance, administrative expenses, SEC filings, tax return preparation and filing, and other expenses of the Company exceed any income to which the Company is or reasonably could be entitled. The net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 51,000 and 23,000 was used during the year ended December 31, 2021. With the December 21, 2022 Resolution, the Board approved the sale of the Company s last remaining parcel of value for a purchase price of 200,000, consistent with the offer in a sale transaction which failed earlier in the year. The parcel was sold to Love Investment Company LIC ), the primary preferred shareholder of PGI. Further, the Resolution approved the payment of the proceeds of the sale in full settlement of the remaining aggregate balance of accrued interest of the Convertible Secured Debentures of 52,709,836, held by LIC and Love-1989 Florida Partners L.P.,( Love-1989 an affiliate of LIC in proportion to their respective outstanding balances. 3 Table of Contents Item 1. Business (continued) The Company s remaining land inventory consisting of minor parcels of real estate available for tax sale. It consists of easements in Citrus County, Florida, and 12 parcels of real estate in Charlotte County, Florida, which total approximately 58 acres.

The real estate taxes for the remaining parcels are delinquent. AVAILABLE INFORMATION The Company has filed annual and quarterly reports (including any exhibits or amendments to those reports) and other information with the SEC. These materials may also be accessed through the SEC s website (www.sec.gov).

In addition, the Company owns 12 parcels of real estate in Charlotte County, Florida, which total approximately 58 acres held through Punta Gorda Isles Sales, Inc. PGIS ), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. These parcels have limited value because of associated developmental constraints such as wetlands, easements, and/or other obstacles to development and sale. The real estate taxes for the remaining parcels are delinquent. Item 3. Legal Proceedings There are no legal proceedings. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not Applicable 4 Table of Contents PART II Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. There is no public trading market for the Company s common equity securities. There have been no reported transactions in the Company s common stock, par value .10 (the Common Stock ), since January 29, 1991, with the exception of the odd lot tender offer by PGIP LLC PGIP ), an affiliate of the Company, in 2003 which was described previously in the Company s annual report on Form 10-KSB for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 and the 2,260,706 shares of Common Stock assigned by Love-PGI Partners, L.P. L-PGI to LIC, an affiliate of L-PGI, effective December 31, 2016. There were also a small number of over-the-counter quotations, obtained from www.otcmarkets.com, in 2017 and 2016 which were described previously in the Company s annual reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.

No dividends have ever been paid on the Common Stock, and payment of dividends on the Common Stock is restricted under the terms of the two indentures (one of which matured on June 1, 1991 and the other on May 1, 1992) pursuant to which the Company s outstanding subordinated convertible debentures were issued and by the terms of the Company s preferred stock. As of December 31, 2022, to the Company s knowledge, there were 539 holders of record of the Company s Common Stock and 317 debenture holders. Item 6. Selected Financial Data Not Applicable 5 Table of Contents Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Effective December 21, 2022, the Officers and Directors of PGI executed a Resolution to cease operations and allow the dissolution and wind up of the affairs of the Company. The Resolution approved the sale of the Company s last remaining parcel of value to LIC, a Missouri Corporation, as well as the Company s primary preferred shareholder. The parcel is approximately seven acres located in Citrus County, Florida and was judged to be a contaminated site in May 1995 by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection FDEP ). After years of clean-up activities by the Company, the FDEP advised in its May 8, 2020 Conditional Site Rehabilitation Completion Order that the Company had satisfied the rehabilitation requirements. During 2022 and 2021, the Company had marketed the parcel. During 2022, several unsuccessful third-party transactions indicated the parcel had a value of no more than 200,000. There were no pending third party offers or apparent opportunities for sale. The Board accepted the LIC offer to purchase the respective seven-acre parcel for a purchase price of 200,000, consistent with the offer in the most recent failed sale transaction. The Resolution further approves the proceeds of the sale of the Citrus County Parcel to be paid in full settlement of the remaining aggregate balance of accrued interest of the Convertible Secured Debentures of 52,709,836 held by LIC and Love-1989, a Missouri limited partnership, an affiliate of LIC, in proportion to their respective outstanding balances. For many years, the Company s independent accountants and management stated in its SEC filings that there was substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. In early 2019, the Board of Directors of PGI concluded that PGI met and continued to meet all conditions under which a registrant may be deemed an Inactive Entity as that term is defined or contemplated in Rule 3-11 of Regulation S-X. The Company has been administratively dissolved by the Florida Secretary of State for the 2022 calendar year. The costs of continued operations, including insurance, administrative expenses, SEC filings, tax return preparation and filing, and other expenses of the Company exceed any income to which the Company is or reasonably could be entitled. The Company s remaining land inventory is available for tax sale. The remaining landholdings consist of minor easements in Citrus County, Florida, which are owned through its wholly owned subsidiary, Sugarmill Woods. In addition, the Company, owns 12 parcels of real estate in Charlotte County, Florida, held through PGIS, a wholly owned subsidiary, which totals approximately 58 acres. These parcels have limited value because of associated developmental constraints such as wetlands, easements, and/or other obstacles to development and sale. The real estate taxes for the remaining parcels are delinquent. 6 Table of Contents Item 7.

There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the Company s fourth fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management of PGI Incorporated (the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 32 Table of Contents Item 9A. Controls and Procedures (continued) Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention of overriding controls. Accordingly, even an effective system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on that assessment, management concludes that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective. Item 9B.
