Recent Acquisitions 
 Our strategy is to profitably grow our business through internal growth and selective acquisitions. We continue to look for profitable expansion opportunities primarily in existing and new markets in the Rocky Mountain and Western states. We have completed the following acquisitions during the last five fiscal years:

 See Note 23 in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding the 2021 acquisition. 
 
 Market Area and Competition 
 We have 221 locations, which consists of 187 branches and 34 loan or administration offices, in 76 counties within 8 states including Montana, Idaho, Utah, Washington, Wyoming, Colorado, Arizona and Nevada. The market area s economic base primarily focuses on tourism, construction, mining, energy, manufacturing, agriculture, service industry, and health care. The tourism industry is highly influenced by national parks, ski resorts, significant lakes and rural scenic areas. 
 
 Commercial banking is a highly competitive business and operates in a rapidly changing environment. There are a large number of depository institutions including commercial banks, savings and loans, and credit unions in the markets in which we have locations. Competition is also increasing for deposit and lending services from internet-based competitors. Non-depository financial service institutions, primarily in the securities, insurance and retail industries, have also become competitors for retail savings, investment funds and lending activities. In addition to offering competitive interest rates, the principal methods used by the Bank to attract deposits include the offering of a variety of services including online banking, mobile banking and convenient office locations and business hours. The primary factors in competing for loans are interest rates and rate adjustment provisions, loan maturities, loan fees, relationships with customers and the quality of service. 
 
 The following table summarizes our number of locations, the number of counties we serve and the percentage of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC insured deposits we have in those counties for each of the eight states we operate in. Percent of deposits are based on the FDIC summary of deposits survey as of June 30, 2022 and does not include any bank division acquired after such date. 
 Number of Locations Number of Counties Served Percent of Deposits Montana 70 18 26.3 Idaho 30 11 8.5 Utah 38 8 0.5 Washington 15 6 5.8 Wyoming 19 10 15.0 Colorado 26 13 1.8 Arizona 16 7 0.8 Nevada 7 3 6.1 Total 221 76

Human Capital 
 As of December 31, 2022, we employed 3,552 persons, 3,235 of whom were employed full time. No employees were represented by a collective bargaining group. We believe our employees are united by our commitment to serve our customers and communities and that our customers are best served by a staff of competent, caring employees who are customer oriented. Our employees are one of our most valuable assets. We consider our employee relations to be excellent. 
 
 We strive to provide a safe and gratifying workplace for our employees. We promote and support a work environment free from any form of harassment, discrimination, bullying, or retaliation, and we are committed to principles of equal employment opportunity and to taking affirmative steps to hire and advance qualified minorities, women, individuals with disabilities, and protected veterans. We also encourage employee growth and development in a variety of ways, including through formal and informal training, relationships with colleagues and internal mentors, and by making a variety of resources available. 
 
 The Company has established a Training Committee charged with creating company-wide training expectations for employees to encourage adherence to internal policies and procedures and compliance with the variety of laws and regulations applicable to our operations. We also strive to offer multidisciplinary educational opportunities for employees to improve their knowledge and skills for their current positions, as well as to create opportunities to advance within the organization. Other targeted development opportunities are available for group leaders and promising employees, such as tuition support for employees seeking additional degrees or certifications through our Tuition Reimbursement program. 
 
 Our employee s overall health and well-being is a top priority. It is our goal for all employees to work hard and experience a high quality work life, but we also encourage employees to be active participants in our communities, and to enjoy quality time with their families and cultivate their independent interests. We have developed several programs to encourage a safe and healthy workplace, including: 
 
 GBCI Injury and Illness Prevention Program 
 Work-life Balance Employee Assistance Program EAP 
 WellSteps program offering assessments, goal setting tools, activities, incentives, and rewards 
 The appointment of Safety Wellness Ambassadors 
 Quarterly Wellness Campaign 
 Workstation Ergonomics Assessments 
 
 Through our Injury and Illness Prevention Program, we have established protocols for minimizing work place injuries and incidents. Instilling safety as a standard of practice is facilitated by a Safety Committee at each of our banking divisions and by Safety Wellness Ambassadors at each location. 
 
 We also believe employee retention is critical to our success, and we are proud of our track record when it comes to retaining employees, including many employees at institutions we acquire. Retention strategies are woven into all our compensation and retirement programs, and even our efforts at expansion. We provide our qualifying employees with a comprehensive benefit program, including health, dental and vision insurance, life and accident insurance, short- and long-term disability coverage, vacation and sick leave. In addition we offer a Profit Sharing and 401(k) Plan, stock-based compensation plan, deferred compensation plans, and a supplemental executive retirement plan for certain employees SERP ). For select management-level employees, we also offer our Short and Long-Term Incentive Plans, which are cash and equity-based compensation plans, respectively, that are designed to encourage achievement of short and long-term financial goals as our determined by the Company s Board of Directors (the Board from time to time, and to further retention through long-term vesting of certain awards earned. See Note 14 in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for detailed information regarding employee benefit plans and eligibility requirements. 
 
 We have continued to adjust our operations as needed as the coronavirus disease of 2019 COVID-19 has evolved and the federal, state and local response to the pandemic has changed. While most of our employees have returned to physical locations, we have continued to make work from home options available to those who are able to do their jobs remotely. In addition, we have continued to offer a special time off benefit to employees affected by the virus or exposure to the virus, and to make other adjustments to our benefit programs to address pandemic-related issues. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have remained focused on the health and safety of our associates, especially our associates that have been required to work in person, including by continuing to implement various safety protocols in our facilities consistent with local regulatory requirements and providing support to employees who have been affected by COVID-19.

Copies can also be obtained by accessing the SEC s website (www.sec.gov). 
 
 Supervision and Regulation 
 We are subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws. This section provides a general overview of the federal and state regulatory framework applicable to us. In general, this regulatory framework is designed to protect depositors, the federal Deposit Insurance Fund DIF ), and the federal and state banking system as a whole, rather than specifically for the protection of shareholders. Note that this section is not intended to summarize all laws and regulations applicable to us. Descriptions of statutory or regulatory provisions do not purport to be complete and are qualified by reference to those provisions. 
 
 These statutes and regulations, as well as related policies, continue to be subject to change by Congress, state legislatures, and federal and state regulators. Changes in statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies applicable to us (including their interpretation or implementation) cannot be predicted and could have a material effect on our business and operations. Numerous changes to the statutes, regulations, and regulatory policies applicable to us have been made or proposed in recent years. Continued efforts to monitor and comply with new regulatory requirements add to the complexity and cost of our business and operations. 
 
 The Company is subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve and the Montana Department of Administration s Division of Banking and Financial Institutions MT Division of Banking and regulation generally by the State of Montana. The Company is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are both administered by the SEC. The Bank is subject to regulation and supervision by the FDIC, the MT Division of Banking, and, with respect to Bank branches outside of the State of Montana, the respective regulators in those states. In addition, we are subject to the direct supervision of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB which is empowered to exercise broad rulemaking, supervision, and enforcement authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws. 
 
 Federal and State Bank Holding Company Regulation 
 General. The Company is a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended BHCA ), due to its ownership of and control over the Bank. As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve. Further, because the Bank is a regional banking organization under Montana law, the Company (as a bank holding company of the Bank) is also subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the MT Division of Banking. In general, the BHCA limits the business of a bank holding company to owning or controlling banks and engaging in, or retaining or acquiring shares in a company engaged in, other activities closely related to the business of banking. In addition, the Company must also file reports with and provide additional information to the Federal Reserve. 
 
 Holding Company Bank Ownership. The BHCA requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before: 1) acquiring, directly or indirectly, ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, it would own or control more than 5 percent of such shares; 2) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company; or 3) merging or consolidating with another bank holding company. 
 
 Holding Company Control of Non-banks . With some exceptions, the BHCA prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring or retaining direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5 percent of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company, or from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or providing services for its subsidiaries. The principal exceptions to these prohibitions involve certain non-bank activities that, by federal statute, agency regulation, or order, have been identified as activities closely related to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks. 
 
 Transactions with Affiliates . Bank subsidiaries of a bank holding company are subject to restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on extensions of credit to the holding company or its subsidiaries, on investments in securities, and on the use of securities as collateral for loans to any borrower. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 Dodd-Frank Act further extends the definition of an affiliate and treats credit exposure arising from derivative transactions, securities lending, and borrowing transactions as covered transactions under the regulations. It also 1) expands the scope of covered transactions required to be collateralized; 2) requires collateral to be maintained at all times for covered transactions required to be collateralized; and 3) places limits on acceptable collateral. These regulations and restrictions may limit the Company s ability to obtain funds from the Bank for its cash needs, including funds for payments of dividends, interest, and operational expenses. 
 7 

Tying Arrangements . We are also prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit, sale or lease of property, or furnishing of services. For example, with certain exceptions, we may not condition an extension of credit to a customer on either 1) a requirement that the customer obtain additional services provided by us; or 2) an agreement by the customer to refrain from obtaining other services from a competitor. 
 
 Support of Bank Subsidiaries . Under Federal Reserve policy and the Dodd-Frank Act, the Company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to the Bank. This means that the Company is required to commit, as necessary, capital and resources to support the Bank, including at times when the Company may not be in a financial position to provide such resources or when it may not be in the Company's or its stockholders' best interests to do so. Any capital loans a bank holding company makes to its bank subsidiaries are subordinate to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the bank subsidiaries. 
 
 State Law Restrictions under Corporate Law. As a Montana corporation, the Company is subject to certain limitations and restrictions under applicable Montana corporate law. For example, Montana corporate law includes limitations and restrictions relating to indemnification of directors, distributions to shareholders, transactions involving directors, officers, or interested shareholders, maintenance of books, records, and minutes, and observance of certain corporate formalities. 
 
 Federal and State Regulation of the Bank 
 General . Deposits in the Bank are insured by the FDIC. The Bank is subject to primary supervision, periodic examination, and regulation of the FDIC and the MT Division of Banking. These agencies have the authority to prohibit the Bank from engaging in what they believe constitute unsafe or unsound banking practices. The federal laws that apply to the Bank regulate, among other things, the scope of its business, its investments, its reserves against deposits, the timing of the availability of deposited funds, and the nature and amount of and collateral for loans. Federal laws also regulate community reinvestment and insider credit transactions and impose safety and soundness standards. In addition to federal law and the laws of the State of Montana, with respect to the Bank's branches in Idaho, Utah, Washington, Wyoming, Colorado, Arizona and Nevada, the Bank is also subject to the various laws and regulations governing its activities in those states. 
 
 Consumer Protection . The Bank is subject to a variety of federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations that govern its relationships and interactions with consumers, including laws and regulations that impose certain disclosure requirements and that govern the manner in which the Bank takes deposits, makes and collects loans, and provides other services. In recent years, examination and enforcement by federal and state banking agencies for compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations have increased and become more intense. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may subject the Bank to various penalties, including but not limited to enforcement actions, injunctions, fines, civil monetary penalties, criminal penalties, punitive damages, and the loss of certain contractual rights. The Bank has established a comprehensive compliance system to ensure consumer protection. 
 
 Community Reinvestment . The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 CRA requires that, in connection with examinations of financial institutions within their jurisdictions, federal bank regulators evaluate the record of financial institutions in meeting the credit needs of their local communities, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of those institutions. A bank s community reinvestment record is also considered by the applicable banking agencies in evaluating mergers, acquisitions, and applications to open a branch or facility. In some cases, a bank's failure to comply with the CRA, or CRA protests filed by interested parties during applicable comment periods, can result in the denial or delay of such transactions. The Bank received a satisfactory rating in its most recent CRA examination. In May 2022, federal bank regulators released a notice of proposed rule-making to strengthen and modernize CRA regulations and the related regulatory framework. Future changes in the 
 evaluation process or requirements under CRA could impact the Bank s costs of compliance and rating. 
 
 Insider Credit Transactions . Banks are subject to certain restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, principal shareholders, and their related interests. These extensions of credit 1) must be made on substantially the same terms (including interest rates and collateral) and follow credit underwriting procedures that are at least as stringent as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not related to the lending bank; and 2) must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Banks are also subject to certain lending limits and restrictions on overdrafts to insiders. A violation of these restrictions may result in the assessment of substantial civil monetary penalties, regulatory enforcement actions, and other regulatory sanctions. The Dodd-Frank Act and federal regulations place additional restrictions on loans to insiders and generally prohibit loans to senior officers other than for certain specified purposes. 
 
 Regulation of Management . Federal law 1) sets forth circumstances under which officers or directors of a bank may be removed by the bank's federal supervisory agency; 2) as discussed above, places restraints on lending by a bank to its executive officers, directors, principal shareholders, and their related interests; and 3) generally prohibits management personnel of a bank from serving as directors or in other management positions of another financial institution whose assets exceed a specified amount or which has an office within a specified geographic area. 
 
 8 

Safety and Soundness Standards . Certain non-capital safety and soundness standards are also imposed upon banks. These standards cover, among other things, internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, such other operational and managerial standards as the agency determines to be appropriate, and standards for asset quality, earnings, and stock valuation. In addition, each insured depository institution must implement a comprehensive written information security program that includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate to the institution s size and complexity and the nature and scope of its activities. The information security program must be designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, protect against any unanticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information, protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer, and ensure the proper disposal of customer and consumer information. An institution that fails to meet these standards may be required to submit a compliance plan, or be subject to regulatory sanctions, including restrictions on growth. The Bank has established comprehensive policies and risk management procedures to ensure the safety and soundness of the Bank. 
 
 Interstate Banking and Branching 
 The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated interstate branching restrictions that were implemented as part of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 ("Interstate Act"), and removed many restrictions on de novo interstate branching by state and federally chartered banks. Federal regulators have authority to approve applications by such banks to establish de novo branches in states other than the bank's home state if the host state's banks could establish a branch at the same location. The Interstate Act requires regulators to consult with community organizations before permitting an interstate institution to close a branch in a low-income area. Federal bank regulations prohibit banks from using their interstate branches primarily for deposit production and federal bank regulatory agencies have implemented a loan-to-deposit ratio screen to ensure compliance with this prohibition. 
 
 Dividends 
 A principal source of the Company s cash is from dividends received from the Bank, which are subject to regulation and limitation. As a general rule, regulatory authorities may prohibit banks and bank holding companies from paying dividends in a manner that would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. For example, regulators have stated that paying dividends that deplete an institution's capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and that an institution should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. In addition, a bank may not pay cash dividends if that payment could reduce the amount of its capital below that necessary to meet minimum applicable regulatory capital requirements. Current guidance from the Federal Reserve provides, among other things, that dividends per share on the Company s common stock generally should not exceed earnings per share, measured over the previous four fiscal quarters. In certain circumstances, Montana law also places limits or restrictions on a bank s ability to declare and pay dividends. 
 
 Rules adopted in accordance with the third installment of the Basel Accords Basel III also impose limitations on the Bank's ability to pay dividends. In general, these rules limit the Bank's ability to pay dividends unless the Bank's common equity conservation buffer exceeds the minimum required capital ratio by at least 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets. 
 
 The Federal Reserve has also issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies. In general, the policy statement expresses the view that although no specific regulations restrict dividend payments by bank holding companies other than state corporate laws, a bank holding company should not pay cash dividends unless the bank holding company s earnings for the past year are sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a prospective rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the bank holding company s capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. A bank holding company's ability to pay dividends may also be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. The various laws and regulatory policies applicable to the Company and the Bank may limit our ability to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions. 
 
 The Dodd-Frank Act 
 General . The Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and has affected the lending, deposit, investment, trading, and operating activities of banks and bank holding companies. Some of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that may impact our business and operations are summarized below. 
 
 Corporate Governance. The Dodd-Frank Act requires publicly traded companies to provide their shareholders with 1) a non-binding shareholder vote on executive compensation; 2) a non-binding shareholder vote on the frequency of such vote; 3) disclosure of golden parachute arrangements in connection with specified change in control transactions; and 4) a non-binding shareholder vote on golden parachute arrangements in connection with these change in control transactions. The SEC adopted a rule mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act that requires a public company to disclose the ratio of the compensation of its Chief Executive Officer CEO to the median compensation of its employees. This rule is intended to provide shareholders with information that they can use to evaluate a CEO s compensation. 
 
 Prohibition Against Charter Conversions of Financial Institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act generally prohibits a depository institution from converting from a state to federal charter, or vice versa, while it is the subject to an enforcement action unless the depository 
 9 

institution seeks prior approval from its primary regulator and complies with specified procedures to ensure compliance with the enforcement action. 
 
 Repeal of Demand Deposit Interest Prohibition. The Dodd-Frank Act repealed the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts. 
 
 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB and empowered it to exercise broad rulemaking, supervision, and enforcement authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws. The CFPB has issued and continues to issue numerous regulations under which we will continue to incur additional expense in connection with our ongoing compliance obligations. Significant recent CFPB developments that may affect operations and compliance costs include: 
 Positions taken by the CFPB on fair lending, including applying the disparate impact theory which could make it more difficult for lenders to charge different rates or to apply different terms to loans to different customers; 
 The CFPB's Final Rule amending Regulation C, which implements the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring most lenders to report expanded information in order for the CFPB to more effectively monitor fair lending concerns and other information shortcomings identified by the CFPB; 
 Positions taken by the CFPB regarding the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Federal Reserve Regulation E, which require companies to obtain consumer authorizations before automatically debiting a consumer s account for pre-authorized electronic funds transfers; 
 Focused efforts on enforcing certain compliance obligations the CFPB deems a priority, such as automobile and student loan servicing (including certain forbearance requirements related to the COVID-19 pandemic), debt collection, collateral repossession, mortgage origination and servicing, remittances, and fair lending, among others; and 
 Positions taken by the CFPB and focused efforts on enforcing compliance obligations related to deposit account fees including overdraft, non-sufficient funds, and returned deposit fees. 
 
 Interchange Fees. Under the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve adopted rules establishing standards for assessing whether the interchange fees that may be charged with respect to certain electronic transactions are "reasonable and proportional" to the costs incurred by issuers for processing such transactions. Notably, the Federal Reserve's rules set a maximum permissible interchange fee, among other requirements. We have been subject to the interchange fee cap since July 1, 2019. 
 
 Stress Testing 
 In May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act EGRRC Act was signed into law, rolling back certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act to provide regulatory relief to financial institutions. In relevant part, the EGRRC Act raised the applicability threshold for company-run stress testing required under the Dodd-Frank Act by exempting bank holding companies under 100 billion in total assets and raising the asset threshold for covered banks from 10 billion to 250 billion. In November of 2019, the FDIC adopted a Final Rule to implement these changes. As a result, we are not currently subject to the Dodd-Frank Act stress testing requirements. 
 
 Capital Adequacy 
 Banks and bank holding companies are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by state and federal regulatory agencies, which involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items calculated under regulatory guidelines. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weighting, and other factors. The capital requirements are intended to ensure that institutions have adequate capital given the risk levels of assets and off-balance sheet financial instruments and are applied separately to the Company and the Bank. 
 
 Federal regulations require insured depository institutions and bank holding companies to meet several minimum capital standards, including: 1) a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5 percent; 2) a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6 percent; 3) a total capital to risk-based assets ratio of 8 percent; and 4) a 4 percent Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. These minimum capital requirements became effective in January 2015 and were the result of Final Rules implementing regulatory changes based on the recommendation of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act ("Final Rules"). 
 
 The Final Rules also require a capital conservation buffer designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Failure to comply with this buffer requirement may result in constraints on capital distributions e.g. , dividends, equity repurchases, and certain bonus compensation for executive officers). The Final Rules change the risk-weights of certain assets for purposes of the risk-based capital ratios and phase out certain instruments as qualifying capital. For additional information regarding trust preferred securities and their impact to regulatory capital, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
 
 10 

The Final Rules also contain revisions to the prompt corrective action framework, which is designed to place restrictions on an insured depository institution if its capital levels begin to show signs of weakness. Under the prompt corrective action requirements, which are designed to complement the capital conservation buffer, insured depository institutions are required to meet the following increased capital level requirements to qualify as well capitalized : 1) a Tier 1 common equity capital ratio of at least 6.5 percent; 2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8 percent; 3) a total capital ratio of at least 10 percent; 4) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 percent; and 5) not be subject to any order or written directive requiring a specific capital level. The FDIC s rules (as amended by the Final Rules) contain other capital classification categories, such as adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized, each of which are based on differing capital ratios. Undercapitalized institutions are subject to certain mandatory restrictions, including on capital distributions and growth. Significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to additional restrictions. An institution may be downgraded to a category lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition, or if the institution receives an unsatisfactory examination rating. 
 
 The application of the Final Rules may result in lower returns on invested capital, require the raising of additional capital or require regulatory action if the Bank were unable to comply with such requirements. In addition, management may be required to modify its business strategy due to the changes to the asset risk-weights for risk-based capital calculations and the requirement to meet the capital conservation buffer. The imposition of liquidity requirements in connection with these rules could also cause the Bank to increase its holdings of liquid assets, change its business strategy, and make other changes to the terms of its funding. 
 
 Regulatory Oversight and Examination 
 Inspections. The Federal Reserve conducts periodic inspections of bank holding companies. In general, the objectives of the Federal Reserve's inspection program are to ascertain whether the financial strength of a bank holding company is maintained on an ongoing basis and to determine the effects or consequences of transactions between a bank holding company or its non-banking subsidiaries and its bank subsidiaries. The inspection type and frequency typically varies depending on asset size, complexity of the organization, and the bank holding company s rating at its last inspection. 
 
 Examinations. Banks are subject to periodic examinations by their primary regulators. In assessing a bank's condition, bank examinations have evolved from reliance on transaction testing to a risk-focused approach. These examinations are extensive and cover the entire breadth of the operations of a bank. Generally, safety and soundness examinations occur on an 18-month cycle for banks under 3 billion in total assets that are well capitalized and without regulatory issues, and 12-months otherwise. Examinations alternate between the federal and state bank regulatory agencies, and in some cases they may occur on a combined schedule. The frequency of consumer compliance and CRA examinations is linked to the size of the institution and its compliance and CRA ratings at its most recent examinations. However, the examination authority of the Federal Reserve and the FDIC allows them to examine supervised institutions as frequently as deemed necessary based on the condition of the institution or as a result of certain triggering events. Because our total consolidated assets exceed 10 billion, we are also subject to the direct supervision of the CFPB. 
 
 Commercial Real Estate Ratios. The federal banking regulators have also issued guidance reminding financial institutions to reexamine the existing regulations regarding concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The purpose of the guidance is to guide banks in developing risk management practices and capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of real estate concentrations. The banking regulators are directed to examine each bank s exposure to commercial real estate loans that are dependent on cash flow from the real estate held as collateral and to focus their supervisory resources on institutions that may have significant commercial real estate loan concentration risk. The guidance provides that the strength of an institution s lending and risk management practices with respect to such concentrations will be taken into account in evaluating capital adequacy and does not specifically limit a bank s commercial real estate lending to a specified concentration level. 
 
 Corporate Governance and Accounting 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 SOX Act addresses, among other things, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information, and penalties for non-compliance. Among other matters, the SOX Act 1) requires chief executive officers and chief financial officers to certify to the accuracy and completeness of periodic reports filed with the SEC and to certain matters relating to disclosure and accounting controls at public companies; 2) imposes specific and enhanced corporate disclosure requirements; 3) accelerates the time frame for reporting insider transactions and periodic disclosures by public companies; and 4) requires companies to adopt and disclose information about corporate governance practices. As a publicly reporting company with the SEC, the Company is subject to the requirements of the SOX Act and related rules and regulations issued by the SEC and the NYSE. 
 
 Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism 
 The Bank Secrecy Act BSA requires all financial institutions to establish a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The BSA also sets forth various recordkeeping and reporting requirements (such as reporting suspicious activities that might signal criminal activity) and certain due diligence and "know your customer" documentation requirements. 
 11 

The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 Patriot Act ), intended to combat terrorism, was renewed with certain amendments in 2006. In relevant part, the Patriot Act 1) prohibits banks from providing correspondent accounts directly to foreign shell banks; 2) imposes due diligence requirements on banks opening or holding accounts for foreign financial institutions or wealthy foreign individuals; 3) requires financial institutions to establish an anti-money laundering compliance program; and 4) eliminates civil liability for persons who file suspicious activity reports. The Patriot Act also includes provisions providing the government with power to investigate terrorism, including expanded government access to bank account records. Regulators are directed to consider a bank holding company s and a bank s effectiveness in combating money laundering when reviewing and ruling on applications under the BHCA and the Bank Merger Act. We have established comprehensive compliance programs designed to comply with the requirements of the BSA and Patriot Act. 
 
 The Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 AMLA ), which amends the BSA, was enacted in January 2021. The AMLA is intended to be a comprehensive reform and modernization to U.S. bank secrecy and anti-money laundering laws. Among other things, it codifies a risk-based approach to anti-money laundering compliance for financial institutions; requires the U.S. Department of the Treasury to promulgate priorities for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism policy; requires the development of standards for testing technology and internal processes for BSA compliance; expands enforcement- and investigation-related authority, including increasing available sanctions for certain BSA violations; and expands BSA whistleblower incentives and protections. Many of the statutory provisions in the AMLA will require additional rulemakings, reports and other measures, and the impact of the AMLA will depend on, among other things, rulemaking and implementation guidance. In June 2021, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, issued the priorities for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism policy required under the AMLA. The priorities include: corruption, cybercrime, terrorist financing, fraud, transnational crime, drug trafficking, human trafficking and proliferation financing. 
 
 Financial Services Modernization 
 The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 GLBA brought about significant changes to the laws affecting banks and bank holding companies. Generally, the GLBA 1) repeals historical restrictions on preventing banks from affiliating with securities firms; 2) provides a uniform framework for the activities of banks, savings institutions, and their holding companies; 3) broadens the activities that may be conducted by national banks and banking subsidiaries of bank holding companies; 4) provides an enhanced framework for protecting the privacy of consumer information and requires notification to consumers of bank privacy policies; and 5) addresses a variety of other legal and regulatory issues affecting both day-to-day operations and long-term activities of financial institutions. The Bank is subject to FDIC regulations implementing the privacy provisions of the GLBA. These regulations require a bank to disclose its privacy policy, including informing consumers of the bank's information sharing practices and their right to opt out of certain practices. 
 
 Deposit Insurance 
 FDIC Insured Deposits. The Bank's deposits are insured under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, up to the maximum applicable limits and are subject to deposit insurance assessments by the FDIC, which are designed to tie what banks pay for deposit insurance to the risks they pose. The FDIC determines the amount of insurance premiums based on the financial institutions deposit base and the applicable assessment rate. The Dodd-Frank Act redefined the assessment base as the average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity capital of a financial institution. The FDIC determines the assessment rate for insured depository institutions with more than 10 billion in assets under a scorecard methodology that seeks to capture both the probability that such an institution will fail and the magnitude of the impact on the DIF if such a failure occurs. Assessment rates are applied to the depository intuition s base to determine payments to the DIF. The FDIC has authority to increase assessment rates, and in October 2022 adopted a Final Rule increasing initial base deposit rate schedules uniformly by two basis points starting with the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. The FDIC also communicated that the new rate schedules will remain in effect unless and until the reserve ratio meets or exceeds two percent; progressively lower assessment rates can be expected when the reserve ratio goal is met. No institution may pay a dividend if it is in default on its federal deposit insurance assessment. The FDIC may also prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity determined by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the DIF. 
 
 Safety and Soundness. The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution if the FDIC determines after a hearing that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order, or any condition imposed by an agreement with the FDIC. Management is not aware of any existing circumstances that would result in termination of the Bank's deposit insurance. 
 
 Insurance of Deposit Accounts . The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased FDIC deposit insurance from 100,000 to 250,000 per depositor. The FDIC insurance coverage limit applies per depositor, per insured depository institution for each account ownership category. 
 
 Recent and Proposed Legislation 
 The economic and political environment of the past several years has led to a number of proposed legislative, governmental, and regulatory initiatives that may significantly impact the banking industry. Other regulatory initiatives by federal and state government agencies may also significantly impact our business, including, as an example, the Biden administration s July 2021 executive order 
 12 

encouraging more robust scrutiny of mergers and acquisitions and the related efforts of banking regulators to increase scrutiny of transactions. Subsequently, in March 2022, the FDIC published a Request for Information RFI seeking information and comments 
 regarding the application of the laws, practices, rules, regulations, guidance, and statements of policy that apply to merger transactions 
 of one or more depository institutions. The FDIC highlighted that significant changes over the past several decades in the banking 
 industry and financial system necessitate a review of the regulatory framework. The FDIC expressed interest in receiving comments 
 regarding the effectiveness of the existing frameworks and requirements under the Bank Merger Act. The RFI is intended to inform 
 future FDIC policy on the matter. 
 
 We cannot predict the ultimate impact of any such initiatives on our operations, competitive situation, financial conditions, or results of operations, or whether any other proposals will emerge. Recent history has demonstrated that new legislation or changes to existing laws or regulations typically result in a greater compliance burden (and therefore increase the general costs of doing business), and the new administration under President Biden has demonstrated a general intent to regulate the financial services industry more strictly than the administration of his predecessor, including with respect to its review of proposed change in control transactions. 
 
 Effects of Federal Government Monetary Policy 
 The Company s earnings and growth are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government, particularly the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve implements national monetary policy to promote maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. Through its open market operations in U.S. government securities, control of the discount rate applicable to borrowings, establishment of reserve requirements against certain deposits, and control of the interest rate applicable to excess reserve balances and reverse repurchase agreements, the Federal Reserve influences the availability and cost of money and credit and, ultimately, a range of economic variables including employment, output, and the prices of goods and services. Recently, the Federal Reserve shifted its focus from economic growth to addressing continued concerns with inflation. During 2022, the Federal Reserve increased the federal funds target rate seven times, an increase of 425 basis points for the year, and communicated that it anticipates ongoing increases. Changes in monetary policy, including increases in the federal funds rate, can affect net interest income and margin, overall profitability, and stockholders equity. The nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies and their impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty. 
 
 Heightened Requirements for Large Bank Holding Companies and Banks 
 As mentioned above, the Dodd-Frank Act imposed heightened requirements on large bank holding companies and banks, and the EGRRC Act has rolled back certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. In particular, the EGRRC Act increased the asset threshold for certain rules that previously applied to bank holding companies and banks with at least 10 billion in total consolidated assets. As a result of the EGRRC Act and follow-up rules, we are not currently subject to several of those heightened requirements (e.g., stress testing and a dedicated risk committee), but we will remain subject to other requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act left unaffected by the EGRRC Act, such as the requirement that we be examined, primarily by the CFPB, for compliance with federal consumer protection laws. We have established a comprehensive compliance system to ensure compliance with these rules. 
 
 Cybersecurity 
 In February 2018, the SEC published interpretive guidance to assist public companies in preparing disclosures about cybersecurity risks and incidents. These SEC guidelines, and any other regulatory guidance, are in addition to notification and disclosure requirements under state and federal banking law and regulations. 
 
 The federal banking regulators regularly issue new guidance and standards, and update existing guidance and standards, intended to enhance cyber risk management among financial institutions. Financial institutions are expected to comply with such guidance and standards and to accordingly develop appropriate security controls and risk management processes. If we fail to observe such regulatory guidance or standards, we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties. 
 
 In November 2021, the federal banking agencies adopted a Final Rule, with compliance required by May 1, 2022, establishing new notification requirements for banking organizations. The new rule requires banks to notify their primary banking regulator within 36 hours of determining that a computer-security incident rising to the level of a notification incident, has occurred. A notification incident is one that materially affects, or is likely to affect, the viability of the banking organization s operations and services resulting in material loss, or potential impact the stability of the United States. 
 
 State regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations. Several states have regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and many states, including Montana, have also implemented or recently modified their data breach notification, information security and data privacy requirements. We expect this trend of state-level activity in those areas to continue, and are continually monitoring developments in the states in which our customers are located. 
 
 Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks, including litigation and enforcement risks, are expected to be elevated for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by us and our customers. 
 13 

Environmental, Social and Governance 
 Bank regulatory agencies and the SEC have shown increased interest in environmental, social and governance matters ESG and expressed an intent to increase related regulatory oversight of companies efforts to address how ESG issues may affect their business. In 2022, multiple federal regulatory agencies formalized their intent by issuing proposed policy statements and rules, and by establishing a pilot climate scenario analysis exercise for large banks. We believe that continued focus on environmental and social issues is consistent with our community banking model. We are continually seeking ways to improve our stewardship of the environment through recycling programs, resource conservation, empowered employees, construction evaluation, and more. Our Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee oversees the Company s efforts in setting and maintaining high standards for corporate social responsibility and reviewing our performance in ESG matters. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee s environmental and social duties include monitoring and assessing developments, trends and issues related to ESG, monitoring risks and overseeing Company solutions related to ESG, overseeing our reporting and disclosures related to ESG, overseeing and reviewing at least annually policies and programs related to ESG, overseeing our human capital management strategy, and evaluating our overall ESG performance and identifying areas for improvement. The Company s Community and Social Responsibility Report describes our ESG performance and is located on the Company s website (www.glacierbancorp.com) under the Governance Documents section. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 The following is a discussion of what we believe are the most significant risks and uncertainties that may affect our business, financial condition and future results of operations. These risks are not the only ones that we face. Other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or currently believed to be material may harm our future business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 
 Economy and Our Markets 
 
 Economic conditions in the market areas the Bank serves may adversely impact its earnings and could increase the credit risk associated with its loan portfolio and the value of its investment portfolio. 
 Substantially all of the Bank s loans are to businesses and individuals in Montana, Idaho, Utah, Washington, Wyoming, Colorado, Arizona and Nevada, and adverse economic conditions in these market areas could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Deterioration in the national economy as a result of continued inflation, the rising rate environment, and recurring supply chain issues may also have an adverse effect in these markets.Any future deterioration in economic conditions in the markets the Company serves could result in the following consequences, any of which could have an adverse impact, which could be material, on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects: 
 
 loan delinquencies may increase; 
 problem assets and foreclosures may increase; 
 collateral for loans made may decline in value, in turn reducing customers borrowing power and the Bank s security; 
 certain securities within the investment portfolio could become other-than-temporarily impaired, requiring a write-down through earnings to fair value, thereby reducing equity; 
 low cost or non-interest bearing deposits may decrease; and 
 demand for loan and other products and services may decrease. 
 
 Competition in the Bank s market areas may limit future success. 
 Commercial banking is a highly competitive business and a consolidating industry. The Bank competes with other commercial banks, credit unions, finance, insurance and other non-depository companies operating in its market areas. The Bank is subject to substantial competition for loans and deposits from other financial institutions. Some of its competitors are not subject to the same degree of regulation and restriction as the Bank while others have greater financial resources than the Bank. If the Bank is unable to effectively compete in its market areas, the Bank s business, our results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected. 
 
 We may not be able to continue to grow organically or through acquisitions. 
 Historically, we have expanded through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. If market and regulatory conditions change, we may be unable to grow organically or successfully compete for, complete, and integrate potential future acquisitions at the same pace as we have achieved in recent years, or at all. We have historically used our strong stock currency and capital resources to complete acquisitions. Downturns in the stock market and the market price of our stock, changes in our capital position, and changes in our regulatory standing could each have a negative impact on our ability to complete future acquisitions. 
 
 Growth through future acquisitions could, in some circumstances, adversely affect profitability or other performance measures. 
 In the past, we have been active in acquiring banks and bank holding companies, and we may in the future engage in selected acquisitions of additional financial institutions. There are risks associated with any such acquisitions that could adversely affect profitability and other performance measures. These risks include, among other things, incorrectly assessing the asset quality of a financial institution being acquired, discovering compliance or regulatory issues after the acquisition, encountering greater than anticipated cost and use of management time associated with integrating acquired businesses into our operations, and being unable to 
 14 

profitably deploy funds acquired in an acquisition. We may not be able to continue to grow through acquisitions, and if we do, there is a risk of negative impacts of such acquisitions on our operating results and financial condition, which could be material. 
 
 Acquisitions may also cause business disruptions that cause the Bank to lose customers or cause customers to remove their accounts from the Bank and move to competing financial institutions. Further, acquisitions may also disrupt the Bank's ongoing businesses or create inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, and policies that adversely affect relationships with employees, clients, customers, and depositors. The loss of key employees during acquisitions may also adversely affect our business. 
 
 We anticipate that we might issue capital stock in connection with future acquisitions. Acquisitions and related issuances of stock may have a dilutive effect on earnings per share, book value per share, and the percentage ownership of current stockholders. In acquisitions involving the use of cash as consideration, there will be an impact on our capital position. 
 
 If goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions becomes impaired, it could have an adverse impact on earnings and capital. 
 Accounting standards require us to account for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting. Under acquisition accounting, if the purchase price of an acquired company exceeds the fair value of its net assets, the excess is carried on the acquirer s balance sheet as goodwill. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ), goodwill is not amortized but rather is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment exists. Our goodwill was not considered impaired as of December 31, 2022 and 2021; however, there can be no assurance that future evaluations of goodwill will not result in findings of impairment and write-downs, which could be material. Since we have 985 million in goodwill, representing 35 percent of our stockholders' equity, impairment of goodwill could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, even though it is a non-cash item, significant impairment of goodwill could subject us to regulatory limitations, including the ability to pay dividends on our common stock. 
 
 There can be no assurance we will be able to continue paying dividends on our common stock at recent levels. 
 We may not be able to continue paying quarterly dividends commensurate with recent levels given that our ability to pay dividends on our common stock depends on a variety of factors. The payment of dividends is subject to government regulation in that regulatory authorities may prohibit banks and bank holding companies from paying dividends that would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. This is heavily based on our earnings and capital levels which currently are strong. Current guidance from the Federal Reserve provides, among other things, that dividends per share should not exceed earnings per share measured over the previous four fiscal quarters. In certain circumstances, Montana law also places limits or restrictions on a bank s ability to declare and pay dividends. As a result, our future dividends will generally depend on the level of earnings at the Bank. 
 
 Credit and Asset Quality 
 
 The allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses, which could adversely affect earnings. 
 The Bank maintains an allowance for credit losses ACL or allowance in an amount that it believes is adequate to provide for losses in the loan portfolio. While the Bank strives to carefully manage and monitor credit quality and to identify loans that may become non-performing, at any time there are loans included in the portfolio that will result in losses, but that have not been identified as non-performing or potential problem loans. With respect to real estate loans and property taken in satisfaction of such loans other real estate owned or OREO ), the Bank can be required to recognize significant declines in the value of the underlying real estate collateral quite suddenly as values are updated through appraisals and evaluations (new or updated) performed in the normal course of monitoring the credit quality of the loans. There are many factors that can cause the value of real estate to decline, including declines in the general real estate market, changes in methodology applied by appraisers, and/or using a different appraiser than was used for the prior appraisal or evaluation. The Bank s ability to recover on real estate loans by selling or disposing of the underlying real estate collateral is adversely impacted by declining values, which increases the likelihood the Bank will suffer losses on defaulted loans beyond the amounts provided for in the ACL. This, in turn, could require material increases in the Bank s provision for credit losses and ACL. By closely monitoring credit quality, the Bank attempts to identify deteriorating loans before they become non-performing assets and adjust the ACL accordingly. However, because future events are uncertain, and if difficult economic conditions occur, there may be loans that deteriorate to a non-performing status in an accelerated time frame. As a result, future additions to the ACL may be necessary beyond the levels commensurate with any loan growth. Because the loan portfolio contains a number of loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans may cause a significant increase in non-performing loans, requiring an increase to the ACL. Additionally, future significant additions to the ACL may be required based on changes in the mix of loans comprising the portfolio, changes in the financial condition of borrowers, which may result from changes in economic conditions, or changes in the assumptions used in determining the ACL. Additionally, federal and state banking regulators, as an integral part of their supervisory function, periodically review the Bank s loan portfolio and the adequacy of the ACL. These regulatory authorities may require the Bank to recognize further provision for credit losses or charge-offs based upon their judgments, which may be different from the Bank s judgments. Any increase in the ACL could have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 15 

The Bank s loan portfolio mix increases the exposure to credit risks tied to deteriorating conditions. 
 The loan portfolio contains a high percentage of commercial, commercial real estate, real estate acquisition and development loans in relation to the total loans and total assets. These types of loans have historically been viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans or certain other types of loans or investments. In fact, the FDIC has issued pronouncements alerting banks of its concern about banks with a heavy concentration of commercial real estate loans. Moreover, federal bank regulators recently highlighted the increased risk associated with commercial real estate loans as a result of the stress COVID-19 created for some industries, and the higher vulnerability of these credits to pressure from the current rising interest rate environment and overall inflationary pressure in the economy. These types of loans also typically are larger than residential real estate loans and other commercial loans. Because the Bank s loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial and commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of one or more of these loans may cause a significant increase in non-performing loans. An increase in non-performing loans could result in a loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for credit losses, or an increase in charge-offs, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 The Bank has a high concentration of loans secured by real estate, so any future deterioration in the real estate markets could require material increases in the ACL and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 The Bank has a high degree of concentration in loans secured by real estate. Any future deterioration in the real estate markets could adversely impact borrowers ability to repay loans secured by real estate and the value of real estate collateral, thereby increasing the credit risk associated with the loan portfolio. The Bank s ability to recover on these loans by selling or disposing of the underlying real estate collateral would be adversely impacted by any decline in real estate values, which increases the likelihood that the Bank will suffer losses on defaulted loans secured by real estate beyond the amounts provided for in the ACL. This, in turn, could require material increases in the ACL which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Non-performing assets could increase, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 The Bank may experience increases in non-performing assets in the future. Non-performing assets (which includes OREO) adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in various ways. The Bank does not record interest income on non-accrual loans or OREO, thereby adversely affecting its earnings. When the Bank takes collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings, it is required to mark the related asset to the then fair value of the collateral, less estimated cost to sell, which may result in a charge-off of the value of the asset and lead the Bank to increase the provision for credit losses. An increase in the level of non-performing assets also increases the Bank s risk profile and may impact the capital levels its regulators believe are appropriate in light of such risks. Further decreases in the value of these assets, or the underlying collateral, or in these borrowers performance or financial condition, whether or not due to economic and market conditions beyond the Bank s control, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, perhaps materially. In addition to the carrying costs to maintain OREO, the resolution of non-performing assets increases the Bank s loan administration costs generally, and requires significant commitments of time from management and our directors, which reduces the time they have to focus on profitably growing our business. 
 
 A decline in the fair value of the Bank s investment portfolio could adversely affect earnings and capital. 
 The fair value of the Bank s debt securities could decline as a result of factors including changes in market interest rates, tax reform, credit quality and credit ratings, lack of market liquidity and other economic conditions. For debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company may be required to record an allowance for credit losses or write down the security depending on the type of security and the circumstances. Any such impairment charge would have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our results of operations and financial condition, including capital and stockholders equity. 
 
 While we believe that the terms of our debt securities have been kept relatively short, we are subject to elevated interest rate risk exposure in the current rising rate environment. Further, debt securities present a different type of asset quality risk than the loan portfolio. While we believe a relatively conservative management approach has been applied to the investment portfolio, there is always potential loss exposure under changing economic conditions. 
 
 The Bank is subject to environmental liability risk associated with our lending activities. 
 A significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate, and we could become subject to environmental liabilities with respect to one or more of these properties. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing defaulted loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous conditions or toxic substances are found on these properties, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage, civil fines and criminal penalties regardless of when the hazardous conditions or toxic substances first affected any particular property. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses to address unknown liabilities and may materially reduce the affected property s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Although we have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure on nonresidential real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 
 16 

We face competition from technologies used to support and enable banking and financial services. 
 Emerging technologies and advances and the growth of e-commerce have lowered geographic and monetary barriers of other financial institutions, made it easier for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products and allowed non-traditional financial service providers and technology companies to compete with traditional financial service companies in providing electronic and internet-based financial solutions and services, including electronic securities trading, marketplace lending, financial data aggregation and payment processing, including real-time payment platforms. Further, clients may choose to conduct business with other market participants who engage in business or offer products in areas we deem speculative or risky, such as cryptocurrencies. Increased competition may negatively affect our earnings by creating pressure to lower prices or credit standards on our products and services requiring additional investment to improve the quality and delivery of our technology and/or reducing our market share, or affecting the willingness of our clients to do business with us. 
 
 Interest Rates, Operations and Risk Management 
 
 Fluctuating interest rates can adversely affect profitability and stockholders equity. 
 The Bank s profitability is dependent to a large extent upon net interest income, which is the difference (or spread between the interest earned on loans, investment securities and other interest earning assets and interest paid on deposits, borrowings, and other interest-bearing liabilities. Because of the differences in maturities and repricing characteristics of interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, changes in interest rates do not produce equivalent changes in interest income earned on interest earning assets and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities. Accordingly, fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect the Bank s interest rate spread, and, in turn, profitability. The Bank seeks to manage its interest rate risk within well-established policies and guidelines. Generally, the Bank seeks an asset and liability structure that insulates net interest income from large deviations attributable to changes in market rates. However, the Bank s structures and practices to manage interest rate risk may not be effective in a highly volatile rate environment. While the federal funds target rate remained at or near historical lows as part of the fiscal response to the pandemic, the Federal Reserve increasee the federal funds target rate seven times in 2022 for a total annual increase of 425 basis points. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve has communicated that it anticipates ongoing increases until inflationary pressures subside. Continued increases in interest rates could negatively impact deposit growth, the value of our investments, stockholders equity, and the Bank s profitability. 
 
 We may be impacted by the retirement of London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR as a reference rate. 
 In July 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced that LIBOR may no longer be published after 2021. LIBOR is used extensively in the U.S and globally as a benchmark or reference rate for various commercial and financial contracts. 
 
 In March 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the LIBOR Act was enacted providing that LIBOR-based contracts that lack fallback language specifying practicable replacement benchmarks will automatically transition to the applicable reference rates recommended by the Federal Reserve. Subsequently in December 2022, the Federal Reserve issued a Final Rule establishing benchmark replacements based on SOFR. However, the ICE Benchmark Administration IBA ), the authorized and regulated administrator of LIBOR, expects to continue publishing some LIBOR tenors until June 2023 and may be compelled to continue publishing other tenors under a different methodology after the Financial Conduct Authority FCA completes a consultation and makes a final determination on the matter (expected in 2023). 
 
 Despite the progress made through the LIBOR Act and the Federal Reserve s Final Rule, it is impossible to predict the effect of any alternatives rates on the value of LIBOR-based securities and variable rate loans, subordinated debentures or other securities or financial arrangements. The replacement of LIBOR with one or more alternative rates may impact the availability and cost of hedging instruments and borrowings, including the rates we pay on our subordinated debentures and derivative financial instruments. When LIBOR rates are no longer available, and we are required to implement substitute indices for the calculation of interest rates under contracts or financial instruments to which we are a party, we may incur significant expenses in effecting the transition. 
 
 The transition to a new reference rate requires changes to contracts, risk and pricing models, valuation tools, systems, product design and hedging strategies. 
 
 Our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, floods, fires, and other natural catastrophes. 
 With Bank branches located in Montana, Idaho, Utah, Washington, Wyoming, Colorado, Arizona and Nevada, our business could be affected by a major natural catastrophe, such as a drought, fire, flood, earthquake, or other natural disaster. The occurrence of any of these events may result in a prolonged interruption of our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations. 
 
 Our future performance will depend on our ability to respond timely to technological change. 
 The financial services industry is experiencing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success will depend upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as create additional efficiencies in our 
 17 

operations. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products or services, or be successful in marketing these products and services. Additionally, the implementation of technological changes and upgrades to maintain current systems and integrate new ones may cause services interruptions, transaction processing errors and system conversion delays and may cause us to fail to comply with applicable laws. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage the risks associated with increased dependency on technology. 
 
 A failure in or breach of the Bank s operational or security systems, or those of the Bank s third party service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase costs and cause losses. 
 In the normal course of its business, the Bank collects, processes and retains sensitive and confidential customer and consumer information. Despite the security measures we have in place, our facilities may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks, security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming or human errors, and other similar events. 
 
 Information security risks for financial institutions such as the Bank have increased recently in part because of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies, including mobile devices, to conduct financial and other business transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists and others. In addition to cyber attacks or other security breaches involving the theft of sensitive and confidential information, hackers have engaged in attacks against financial institutions designed to disrupt key business services such as customer-facing web sites. National and international economic and geopolitical conditions may also have a negative impact in the number of cyber security threats the Bank may face. Most recently, increasing inflation, unemployment, and military action in Ukraine have affected the volume of cyber threats. We are not able to anticipate or implement effective preventative measures against all security breaches of these types. Although the Bank employs detection and response mechanisms designed to contain and mitigate security incidents, early detection may be thwarted by sophisticated attacks and malware designed to avoid detection, which continue to evolve. 
 
 Additionally, the Bank faces the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the third parties that facilitate its business activities, including exchanges, clearing agents, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries. Such parties could also be the source of an attack on, or breach of, the Bank s operational systems. 
 
 Any failures, interruptions or security breaches in the Company s information systems could damage its reputation, result in a loss of customer business, result in a violation of privacy or other laws, or expose us to civil litigation, regulatory fines or losses not covered by insurance. 
 
 We have various anti-takeover measures that could impede a takeover. 
 Our articles of incorporation include certain provisions that could make it more difficult to acquire us by means of a tender offer, a proxy contest, merger or otherwise. These provisions include a requirement that any Business Combination (as defined in the articles of incorporation) be approved by at least 80 percent of the voting power of the then outstanding shares, unless it is either approved by our Board or certain price and procedural requirements are satisfied. In addition, the authorization of preferred stock, which is intended primarily as a financing tool and not as a defensive measure against takeovers, may potentially be used by management to make more difficult uninvited attempts to acquire control of us. These provisions may have the effect of lengthening the time required to acquire control of us through a tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise, and may deter any potentially unfriendly offers or other efforts to obtain control of us. This could deprive our stockholders of opportunities to realize a premium for their common stock in the Company, even in circumstances where such action is favored by a majority of our stockholders. 
 
 Regulatory Matters 
 
 We operate in a highly regulated environment and changes or increases in, or supervisory enforcement of, banking or other laws and regulations or governmental fiscal or monetary policies could adversely affect us. 
 We are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by federal and state banking regulators. In addition, as a publicly-traded company, we are subject to regulation by the SEC. Any change in applicable regulations or federal, state or local legislation or in policies or interpretations or regulatory approaches to compliance and enforcement, income tax laws and accounting principles could have a substantial impact on us and our operations. Changes in laws and regulations may also increase expenses by imposing additional fees or taxes or restrictions on operations. Additional legislation and regulations that could significantly affect powers, authority and operations may be enacted or adopted in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Failure to appropriately comply with any such laws, regulations or principles could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies or damage to our reputation, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Regulators have significant discretion and authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws or regulations by financial institutions and bank holding companies in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties. Existing and proposed federal and state laws and regulations restrict, limit and govern all aspects of our activities and may affect our ability to expand our business over time, may result in an increase in our compliance costs, and may affect our ability to attract and 
 18 

retain qualified executive officers and employees. The exercise of regulatory authority may have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations, including limiting the types of financial services and products we may offer or increasing the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products. Additionally, our business is affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies, including the Federal Reserve. 
 
 We cannot accurately predict the full effects of recent legislation or the various other governmental, regulatory, monetary and fiscal initiatives which have been and may be enacted on the financial markets and on us. The terms and costs of these activities, or the failure of these actions to help stabilize the financial markets, asset prices, market liquidity and a continuation or worsening of current financial market and economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock. 
 
 General Risk Factors 
 
 National and international economic and geopolitical conditions could adversely affect our future results of operations or market price of our stock. 
 Our business is impacted by factors such as economic, political and market conditions, broad trends in industry and finance, changes in government monetary and fiscal policies, inflation, and financial market volatility, all of which are beyond our control. National and global economies are constantly in flux, as evidenced by recent market volatility resulting from, among other things, disruptions in the global supply chain, the effects of inflation, and the ever-changing landscape of the energy and medical industries. Future economic conditions cannot be predicted, and any renewed deterioration in the economies of the nation as a whole or in our markets could have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, and could cause the market price of our stock to decline. 
 
 Our business is heavily dependent on the services of members of the senior management team. 
 We believe our success to date has been substantially dependent on our executive management team. In addition, our unique model relies upon the Presidents of our separate Bank divisions, particularly in light of our decentralized management structure in which such Bank divisions have significant local decision-making authority. The unexpected loss of any of these persons could have an adverse effect on our business and future growth prospects. 
 
 We could suffer operational, reputational and financial harm if we fail to properly anticipate and manage risk. 
 We use models and strategies to forecast losses, project revenue, measure and assess capital requirements for credit, market, operational and strategic risks, and assess and control our operations and financial condition. These models require oversight, ongoing monitoring, and periodic reassessment. Models are subject to inherent limitations due to the use of historical trends and simplifying assumptions, uncertainty regarding economic and financial outcomes, and emerging risks from the use of applications that may rely on artificial intelligence. Our models and strategies may not be adequate due to limited historical data and shocks caused by extreme or unanticipated market changes, especially during severe market downturns or stress events. Regardless of the steps we take to ensure effective controls, governance, monitoring and testing, and implement new risk management tools, we could suffer operational, reputational and financial harm if our models and strategies and other risk management tools fail to properly anticipate and manage current and evolving risks. 
 
 Changes in accounting standards could materially impact our financial statements. 
 Periodically, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. For information regarding the impact of recently issued accounting standards, see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 
 The continued economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact our results of operations and/or the market price of our stock. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic and related government actions caused significant economic turmoil in the U.S. and around the world, resulting in a slow-down in economic activity, increased unemployment levels, and disruptions in global supply chains and financial markets. Both the direct effects of the pandemic and the resulting U.S. and state level governmental responses were and are of an unprecedented scope. The long-term impact of the government actions in mitigating the health and economic effects of the pandemic cannot be accurately predicted, whether on our business or on the economy as a whole. Despite improvement in the U.S. and global economies after the initial impact of the pandemic, some adverse consequences, including labor shortages, disruptions of the global supply chains, and increased inflation, continue to negatively impact the international, national, and local economic environment. In addition, the Federal government's financial support of the economy and the governments effort's to control the virus and its effects has for the most part ended, and the effects on the national and local economy of ending that support are yet to be determined. The Company believes it continues to be well positioned to mitigate the potential financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic with a strong liquidity and capital position, and the various measures we have implemented to manage through the pandemic, including efforts to proactively react to, and work with customers to assess customer needs and provide funding, flexible repayment options or modifications as necessary, and increased monitoring of credit quality and portfolio risk for industries determined to have elevated risk 
 19 

characteristics. Nonetheless, any future deterioration in economic conditions in the markets the Bank serves as a consequence of the pandemic, or a failure of the economy to recover from pandemic-related disruptions as quickly as anticipated, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 
 Climate change may materially adversely affect the Company's business and results of operations. 
 Concerns over the long-term effects of climate change have led governmental efforts around the world to mitigate those impacts. Consumers and businesses also may voluntarily change their behavior as a result of these concerns. The Company and its customers will need to respond to new laws and regulations as well as consumer and business preferences resulting from climate change concerns. The Company and its customers may face cost increases, asset value reductions and operating process changes. The impact on our customers will likely vary depending on their specific attributes, including reliance on or role in carbon-intensive activities. Among the impacts to the Company could be a drop in demand for our products and services, particularly in certain sectors. In addition, we could face reductions in creditworthiness on the part of some customers or in the value of assets securing loans. The Company s efforts to take these risks into account in making lending and other decisions, including by increasing our business with climate-friendly companies, may not be effective in protecting the Company from the negative impact of new laws and regulations or changes in consumer or business behavior.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
 OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 COMPARED TO DECEMBER 31, 2021 
 
 Highlights and Overview 
 
 The Company ended the year at 26.635 billion in assets, which was a 695 million, or 3 percent, increase over the prior year and was driven by the increase in the loan portfolio that more than offset the decreases in the debt securities. Loan growth, excluding PPP loans, was 1.974 billion, or 15 percent, during 2022 with increases in all loan categories. The Company experienced core deposit growth during the first three quarters of 2022 with a decrease during the fourth quarter of 2022 as a result of an outflow of excess higher balance deposits previously received during COVID-19. Total core deposits of 20.575 billion, decreased 737 million, or 3 percent, over the prior year end. Non-interest bearing deposits were 37 percent of total core deposits at year end 2022 and 2021. 
 
 Stockholders equity decreased 334 million, or 3.04 per share, which was a direct result of the increase in unrealized loss on AFS debt securities which was driven by the increased interest rates during 2022. Outside of the unrealized loss component, earnings retention contributed 161.8 million to increased tangible stockholders equity. The Company increased its total regular quarterly dividends declared from 1.27 per share during 2021 to 1.32 per share in 2022. 
 
 The Company had record net income for the year of 303 million, which was an increase of 18.4 million, or 6 percent, over the prior year net income of 285 million. Diluted earnings per share for the year was 2.74, a decrease of 4 percent, from the 2021 diluted earnings per share of 2.86 which was impacted by the shares issued from the acquisition of Alta. The improvement in net income for 2022 was due to the Alta acquisition in late 2021, organic loan growth, and controlled operating expenses. This record net income was achieved even with the 43.0 million decrease in gain on sale of loans, the continuing pressure from the inflationary environment, increasing business costs, and historic rate increases during 2022. The Company's net interest margin for 2022 was 3.27 percent, a 15 basis points decrease from the net interest margin of 3.42 percent from 2021, which was primarily driven by the volatile interest rate environment and the increase in higher rate borrowings to fund earning assets. 
 
 Looking forward, the Company s future performance will depend on many factors including economic conditions in the markets the Company serves, interest rate changes, increasing competition for deposits and loans, loan quality and growth, the impact and successful integration of acquisitions, and managing regulatory requirements.

 Net Interest Income 
 Net-interest income of 788 million for 2022 increased 126 million, or 19 percent, over 2021. Interest income of 830 million for the current year increased 149 million, or 22 percent, from the prior year and was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Alta and organic loan growth. 
 
 Interest expense of 41.3 million for 2022 increased 22.7 million, or 122 percent over the prior year and was the result of increased borrowings and higher interest rates. Core deposit cost (including non-interest bearing deposits) was 7 basis points for both 2022 and 2021. The total funding cost (including non-interest bearing deposits) for 2022 was 18 basis points, which increased 8 basis points compared to 10 basis points in 2021 driven by the increased borrowing rates and loan balances. 
 
 The net interest margin as a percentage of earning assets, on a tax-equivalent basis, during 2022 was 3.27 percent, a 15 basis points decrease from the net interest margin of 3.42 percent for the same period in the prior year. The core net interest margin, excluding discount accretion, the impact from non-accrual interest and the impact from the PPP loans, was 3.20 percent which was a 4 basis point decrease from the core margin of 3.24 percent in the prior year. 
 
 Non-interest Income 
 Non-interest income of 120.7 million for 2022 decreased 24.1 million, or 17 percent, over the same period last year and was principally due to the 43.0 million, or 68 percent, decrease in gain on sale of residential loans. Service charges and other fees of 72.1 million for 2022 increased 12.8 million, or 22 percent, from the prior year as a result of additional fees from increased customer accounts, transaction activity and the acquisition of Alta. Miscellaneous loan fees and charges increased 3.3 million, or 28 percent, primarily driven by increases in credit card interchange fees due to increased activity and the acquisition of Alta.

Non-interest Expense 
 The following table summarizes non-interest expense for the periods indicated:

 Total non-interest expense of 519 million for 2022 increased 84.0 million, or 19 percent, over the prior year and was primarily driven by the increased costs from the acquisition of Alta. Total estimated non-interest expense for the Altabank division in 2022 was 75.5 million, an increase of 56.7 million over prior year non-interest expense of 18.9 million as a result of the acquisition occurring in the fourth quarter of 2021. Excluding the increase from the Altabank division, compensation and employee benefits increased 22.0 million, or 8 percent, over the prior year which was driven by annual salary increases and a reduction in deferred compensation from loan originations which more than offset the decrease in commission expense resulting from the slowing of mortgage loan sales. Data processing expense of 30.8 million for 2022, increased 7.4 million, or 31 percent, and was driven by increases from the Altabank division and expenses associated with technology infrastructure improvements. Other expenses of 87.5 million for 2022 increased 16.9 million, or 24 percent, from the prior year which was driven by increased costs from the Altabank division, general operating cost increases, and increased fees to outside services associated with technology infrastructure improvements. Acquisition-related expenses were 10.0 million in the current year compared to 9.8 million in the prior year. 
 
 Provision for Credit Losses 
 The following table summarizes the provision for credit losses on the loan portfolio, net charge-offs and select ratios relating to the provision for credit losses on loans for the previous eight quarters: (Dollars in thousands) Provision for Credit Losses on Loans Net Charge-Offs (Recoveries) ACL as a Percent of Loans Accruing Loans 30-89 Days Past Due as a Percent of Loans Non-Performing Assets to Total Sub-sidiary Assets Fourth quarter 2022 6,060 1,968 1.20 0.14 0.12 Third quarter 2022 8,382 3,154 1.20 0.07 0.13 Second quarter 2022 (1,353) 1,843 1.20 0.12 0.16 First quarter 2022 4,344 850 1.28 0.12 0.24 Fourth quarter 2021 19,301 616 1.29 0.38 0.26 Third quarter 2021 2,313 152 1.36 0.23 0.24 Second quarter 2021 (5,723) (725) 1.35 0.11 0.26 First quarter 2021 489 2,286 1.39 0.40 0.19 
 
 The provision for credit loss expense was 19.9 million for 2022, including provision for credit loss expense of 17.4 million on the loan portfolio and credit loss expense of 2.5 million on unfunded loan commitments. The prior year credit loss expense of 16.4 million on the loan portfolio included 18.1 million of provision for credit loss from the acquisition of Alta to fully fund an allowance for credit losses post-acquisition. 
 
 Excluding the impact from the acquisition of Alta, the provision for credit loss expense of 17.4 million on the loan portfolio in the current year increased 19.1 million over the prior year which was primarily attributable to organic loan growth during the current year. Net charge-offs during the current year were 7.8 million compared to 2.3 million during the prior year.

Efficiency Ratio 
 The efficiency ratio was 54.64 percent for 2022 compared to 51.35 percent for last year. Excluding the impact from the PPP loans and acquisition related expenses, the efficiency ratio was 53.88 percent in 2022 compared to 53.07 percent in 2021. 

ADDITIONAL MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

Investment Activity 
 The Company s investment securities primarily consist of debt securities classified as either available-for-sale or held-to-maturity. Non-marketable equity securities consist of capital stock issued by the FHLB of Des Moines. 
 
 Debt Securities 
 Debt securities classified as available-for-sale are carried at estimated fair value and debt securities classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost. During the first quarter of the current year, the Company transferred 2.2 billion of available-for-sale securities with an unrealized net loss of 55.7 million into the held-to-maturity portfolio after determining it had the intent and ability to hold such securities until maturity. During the first quarter of 2021, the Company transferred 404 million of available-for-sale securities with an unrealized net gain of 3.8 million into the held-to-maturity portfolio after determining it had the intent and ability to hold such securities until maturity. The Company transferred an additional 440 million of available-for-sale securities with an unrealized net gain of 40.6 million into held-to-maturity portfolio during the second quarter of 2021. Unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, on available-for-sale debt securities are reflected as an adjustment to other comprehensive income. The Company s debt securities are summarized below:

 The Company s debt securities are primarily comprised of state and local government securities and mortgage-backed securities. In 2022, the Company s debt securities were primarily comprised of U.S. government and federal agency and mortgage-backed securities. State and local government securities are largely exempt from federal income tax and the Company s federal statutory income tax rate of 21 percent is used in calculating the tax-equivalent yields on the tax-exempt securities. Mortgage-backed securities largely consists of short, weighted-average life U.S. agency guaranteed residential and commercial mortgage pass-through securities and to a lesser extent, short, weighted-average life U.S. agency guaranteed residential collateralized mortgage obligations. Combined, the mortgage-backed securities provide the Company with ongoing liquidity as scheduled and pre-paid principal is received on the securities. 
 
 State and local government securities carry different risks that are not as prevalent in other security types. The Company evaluates the investment grade quality of its securities in accordance with regulatory guidance. Investment grade securities are those where the issuer has an adequate capacity to meet the financial commitments under the security for the projected life of the investment. An issuer has an adequate capacity to meet financial commitments if the risk of default by the obligor is low and the full and timely payment of principal and interest are expected. In assessing credit risk, the Company may use credit ratings from Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations NRSRO entities such as S P and Moody s as support for the evaluation; however, 
 31 

they are not solely relied upon. There have been no significant differences in the Company s internal evaluation of the creditworthiness of any issuer when compared with the ratings assigned by the NRSROs. 
 
 The following table stratifies the state and local government securities by the associated NRSRO ratings. The highest issued rating was used to categorize the securities in the table for those securities where the NRSRO ratings were not at the same level.

 ______________________________ 
 1 Mortgage-backed securities, which have prepayment provisions, are not assigned to maturity categories due to fluctuations in their prepayment speeds. 
 
 Based on an analysis of its available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses as of December 31, 2022, the Company determined their decline in value was unrelated to credit loss and was primarily the result of interest rate changes and market spreads subsequent to acquisition. The fair value of the debt securities is expected to recover as payments are received and the debt securities approach maturity. In addition, the Company determined an insignificant amount of credit losses is expected on the held-to-maturity debt securities portfolio; therefore, no ACL has been recognized at December 31, 2022.

Lending Activity 
 The Company focuses its lending activities primarily on the following types of loans: 1) first-mortgage, conventional loans secured by residential properties, particularly single-family; 2) commercial lending, including agriculture and public entities; and 3) installment lending for consumer purposes (e.g., home equity, automobile, etc.). Supplemental information regarding the Company s loan portfolio and credit quality based on regulatory classification is provided in the section captioned Loans by Regulatory Classification included in Part I. Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The regulatory classification of loans is based primarily on the type of collateral for the loans. Loan information included in Part I. Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on the Company s loan segments, which are based on the purpose of the loan, unless otherwise noted as a regulatory classification. The following table summarizes the Company s loan portfolio as of the dates indicated:

 Residential Real Estate Lending 
 The Company s lending activities consist of the origination of both construction and permanent loans on residential real estate. The Company actively solicits residential real estate loan applications from real estate brokers, contractors, existing customers, customer referrals, and online applications. The Company s lending policies generally limit the maximum loan-to-value ratio on residential mortgage loans to 80 percent of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price. Policies allow for higher loan-to-values with appropriate risk mitigation such as documented compensating factors, credit enhancement, etc. For loans held for sale, the Company complies with each investor s loan-to-value guidelines. The Company also provides interim construction financing for single-family dwellings. These loans are supported by a term take-out commitment that may be subject to certain contingencies. 
 
 34 

Consumer Land or Lot Loans 
 The Company originates land and lot acquisition loans to borrowers who intend to construct their primary residence on the respective land or lot. These loans are generally for a term of three to five years and are secured by the developed land or lot with the loan-to-value limited to the lesser of 75 percent of the appraised value or 75 percent of the cost. 
 
 Unimproved Land and Land Development Loans 
 Although the Company has originated very few unimproved land and land development loans since the economic downturn in 2008, the Company may originate such loans on properties intended for residential and commercial use where real estate market conditions have improved. These loans are typically made for a term of 18 months to two years and are secured by the developed property with a loan-to-value not to exceed the lesser of 75 percent of cost or 65 percent of the appraised discounted bulk sale value upon completion of the improvements. The projects under development are inspected on a regular basis and advances are made on a percentage-of-completion basis. The loans are made to borrowers with real estate development experience and appropriate financial strength. Generally, the Company requires that a certain percentage of the development be pre-sold or that construction and term take-out commitments are in place prior to funding the loan. Loans made on unimproved land are generally made for a term of five to ten years with a loan-to-value not to exceed the lesser of 50 percent of appraised value or 50 percent of cost. 
 
 Residential Builder Guidance Lines 
 The Company provides Builder Guidance Lines that are comprised of pre-sold and spec-home construction and lot acquisition loans. The spec-home construction and lot acquisition loans are limited to a specific number and maximum amount. Generally, the individual loans will not exceed a one year maturity. The homes under construction are inspected on a regular basis and advances made on a percentage-of-completion basis. 
 
 Construction Loans 
 During the construction loan term, all construction loan collateral properties are inspected at least monthly, or more frequently as needed, until completion. Draws on construction loans are predicated upon the results of the inspection and advanced based upon a percentage-of-completion basis versus original budget percentages. When construction loans become non-performing and the associated project is not complete, the Company on a case-by-case basis makes the decision to advance additional funds or to initiate collection/foreclosure proceedings. Such decision includes obtaining as-is and at completion appraisals for consideration of potential increases or decreases in the collateral s value. The Company also considers the increased costs of monitoring progress to completion, and the related collection/holding period costs should collateral ownership be transferred to the Company. 
 
 Commercial Real Estate Loans 
 Loans are made to purchase, construct and finance commercial real estate properties. These loans are generally made to borrowers who will own and occupy the property, but may include loans to finance investment or income properties. Commercial real estate loans generally have a loan-to-value up to the lesser of 75 percent of the appraised value or 75 percent of the cost and require a minimum 1.2 times debt service coverage margin. 
 
 Agricultural Lending 
 Agricultural lending is conducted on a conservative basis and consists of operating credits, term real estate loans for the acquisition or refinance of agricultural real estate or equipment, and term livestock loans for the acquisition or refinance of livestock. Loan-to-value on equipment, livestock and agricultural real estate is generally limited to 75 percent. 
 
 PPP Loans 
 A PPP loan is a small business loan designed to assist qualifying businesses in keeping workers on the payroll during the Covid-19 pandemic. The program commenced on April 3, 2020 with June 30, 2020 (subsequently changed to August 8, 2020) as the last day to apply for and receive a PPP loan for the first round. As originally enacted, each PPP loan is 100 guaranteed by the SBA, has a 1 interest rate, 2-year maturity and 6-month payment deferral period starting from the loan disbursement date. The PPP program was further amended as of June 5, 2020 under the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act with the primary changes to extend the period of qualifying expenditures from 8 weeks to 24 weeks, reduce the required use of funds for payroll expenses from 75 to 60 , change the deferral date from 6 months to the date of forgiveness, and extend the maturity from 2 years to 5 years for loans originated after the June 5, 2020 enactment date. A second round of the program opened up January 11, 2021, and ran through May 31, 2021. 
 
 Home Equity Loans 
 Home equity lines of credit are generally originated with maturity terms of 15 years. At origination, borrowers can choose a variable interest rate that changes quarterly, or after the first 3 or 5 years from the origination date. The draw period for home equity lines of credit usually exists from origination to maturity. During the draw period, the Company has home equity lines of credit where the borrowers pay interest only and home equity lines of credit where borrowers pay principal and interest. 

35 

Consumer Lending 
 The majority of consumer loans are secured by real estate, automobiles, or other assets. The Company intends to continue making such loans because of their short-term nature, generally between three months and five years. Moreover, interest rates on consumer loans are generally higher than on residential mortgage loans. 
 
 States and Political Subdivisions Lending 
 The Company lends directly to state and local political subdivisions. The loans are typically secured by the full faith and credit of the municipality or a specific revenue stream such as water or sewer fees. In general, state and local political subdivision loans carry a low risk of default and offer other complementary business opportunities such as deposits and cash management. The loans are generally long-term in nature and interest on many of these loans is tax-exempt for federal income tax purposes. 
 
 Credit Risk Management 
 The Company is committed to a conservative management of the credit risk within the loan portfolio, including the early recognition of problem loans. The Company s credit risk management includes stringent credit policies, individual loan approval limits, limits on concentrations of credit, and committee approval of larger loan requests. Management practices also include regular internal and external credit examinations, identification and review of individual loans and leases experiencing deterioration of credit quality, procedures for the collection of non-performing assets, quarterly monitoring of the loan portfolio, semi-annual review of loans by industry, and periodic stress testing of the loans secured by real estate. Federal and state regulatory safety and soundness examinations are conducted annually. 
 
 The Company s loan policy and credit administration practices establish standards and limits for all extensions of credit that are secured by interests in or liens on real estate, or made for the purpose of financing the construction of real property or other improvements. Ongoing monitoring and review of the loan portfolio is based on current information, including: the borrowers and guarantors creditworthiness, value of the real estate and other collateral, the project s performance against projections, and monthly inspections by Company employees or external parties until the real estate project is complete. 
 
 Monitoring of the junior lien and home equity lines of credit portfolios includes evaluating payment delinquency, collateral values, bankruptcy notices and foreclosure filings. Additionally, the Company places junior lien mortgages and junior lien home equity lines of credit on non-accrual status when there is evidence that the associated senior lien is 90 days past due or is in the process of foreclosure, regardless of the junior lien delinquency status. 
 
 Loan Approval Limits 
 Individual loan approval limits have been established for each lender based on the loan types and experience of the individual. There are four additional loan approval levels: 1) the Bank divisions Officer Loan Committees, consisting of senior lenders and members of senior management; 2) the Bank divisions advisory boards; 3) the Bank s Executive Loan Committee, consisting of the Bank divisions senior loan officers and the Company s Chief Credit Administrator; and 4) the Bank s Board of Directors. Under banking laws, loans-to-one-borrower and related entities are limited to a prescribed percentage of the unimpaired capital and surplus of the Bank. 
 
 Interest Reserves 
 Interest reserves are used to periodically advance loan funds to pay interest charges on the outstanding balance of the related loan. As with any extension of credit, the decision to establish a loan-funded interest reserve upon origination of construction loans, including residential construction and land, lot and other construction loans, is based on prudent underwriting, including the feasibility of the project, expected cash flow, creditworthiness of the borrower and guarantors, and the protection provided by the real estate and other underlying collateral. Interest reserves provide an effective means for addressing the cash flow characteristics of construction loans. In response to the downturn in the housing market and potential impact upon construction lending, the Company discourages the creation or continued use of interest reserves. 
 
 Interest reserves are advanced provided the related construction loan is performing as expected. Loans with interest reserves may be extended, renewed or restructured only when the related loan continues to perform as expected and meets the prudent underwriting standards identified above. Such renewals, extension or restructuring are not permitted in order to keep the related loan current. 
 
 In monitoring the performance and credit quality of a construction loan, the Company assesses the adequacy of any remaining interest reserve, and whether the use of an interest reserve remains appropriate in the presence of emerging weakness and associated risks in the construction loan. 
 
 The ongoing accrual and recognition of uncollected interest as income continues only when facts and circumstances continue to reasonably support the contractual payment of principal or interest. Loans are typically designated as non-accrual when the collection 
 36 

of the contractual principal or interest is unlikely and has remained unpaid for ninety days or more. For such loans, the accrual of interest and its capitalization into the loan balance will be discontinued. 
 
 The Company had 554 million and 374 million of loans with remaining interest reserves of 27.7 million and 17.6 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. During 2022 and 2021, the Company extended, renewed or restructured 5 loans and 3 loans, respectively, with interest reserves. Such loans had an aggregate outstanding principal balance of 16.2 million and 3.7 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had no construction loans with interest reserves that are currently non-performing or which are potential problem loans. 
 
 Loan Purchases, Sales, and Servicing 
 Fixed rate, long-term mortgage loans are generally sold in the secondary market. The Company is active in the secondary market, primarily through the origination of conventional, Rural Development, Federal Housing Administration and Department of Veterans Affairs residential mortgages. The sale of loans in the secondary mortgage market reduces the Company s risk of holding long-term, fixed rate loans during periods of rising interest rates. In connection with conventional loan sales, the Company typically sells the majority of mortgage loans originated with servicing released. In certain circumstances, the Company strategically retains servicing and in the current year has been more active in retaining the servicing. For the loans that are sold with servicing retained, the Company records a servicing right asset that is subsequently amortized over the life of the loan. The servicing assets are also evaluated for impairment based on the fair value of the servicing asset compared to the carrying value. 
 
 The Company has also been very active in generating commercial SBA loans, and other commercial loans, with a portion of those loans sold to investors. The Company has not originated any type of subprime mortgages, either for the loan portfolio or for sale to investors. In addition, the Company has not purchased debt securities collateralized with subprime mortgages. The Company does not actively purchase loans from other financial institutions, and substantially all of the Company s loans receivable are with customers in the Company s geographic market areas. 
 
 Loan Origination and Other Fees 
 In addition to interest earned on loans, the Company receives fees for originating loans. Loan fees generally are a percentage of the principal amount of the loan and are charged to the borrower, and are normally deducted from the proceeds of the loan. Loan origination fees are generally 1.0 to 1.5 percent on residential mortgages and 0.5 to 1.5 percent on commercial loans, excluding PPP loans. Consumer loans generally require a fixed fee amount. The Company also receives other fees and charges relating to existing loans, which include charges and fees collected in connection with loan modifications. 
 
 As enticement to financial institutions to administer the program, the SBA reimburses PPP lenders for processing a PPP loan via loan fees. The fee structure changed as the PPP developed with the following reflecting the fee structure for each program: 
 
 Original Program Commencing on April 3, 2020 (round one): 
 5 for loans of not more than 350,000. 
 3 for loans of more than 350,000 and less than 2 million. 
 1 for loans of 2 million up to a maximum loan of 10 million that were available under the original PPP. 
 
 New program commencing on January 11, 2021 for new borrowers (round two): 
 50 with maximum of 2,500 for loans up to 50,000. 
 5 for loans of more than 50,000 and less than 350,000. 
 3 for loans of more than 350,000 and less than 2 million. 
 1 for loans of 2 million up to a maximum loan of 10 million. 
 
 New program commencing on January 11, 2021 for existing borrowers (round two): 
 50 with maximum of 2,500 for loans up to 50,000. 
 5 for loans of more than 50,000 and less than 350,000. 
 3 for loans of 350,000 up to a maximum loan of 2 million . 
 
 Appraisal and Evaluation Process 
 The Company s loan policy and credit administration practices have adopted and implemented the applicable legal and regulatory requirements, which establishes criteria for obtaining appraisals or evaluations (new or updated), including transactions that are otherwise exempt from the appraisal requirements. 
 
 Each of the Bank divisions monitor conditions, including supply and demand factors, in the real estate markets served so they can react quickly to changing market conditions to mitigate potential losses from specific credit exposures within the loan portfolio. Evidence of the following real estate market conditions and trends is obtained from lending personnel and third party sources: 
 37 

demographic indicators, including employment and population trends; 
 foreclosures, vacancy, construction and absorption rates; 
 property sales prices, rental rates, and lease terms; 
 current tax assessments; 
 economic indicators, including trends within the lending areas; and 
 valuation trends, including discount and capitalization rates. 
 
 Third party information sources include federal, state, and local governments and agencies thereof, private sector economic data vendors, real estate brokers, licensed agents, sales, rental and foreclosure data tracking services. 
 
 The time between ordering an appraisal or evaluation and receipt from third party vendors is typically two to six weeks for residential property depending on geographic market and four to six weeks for non-residential property. For real estate properties that are of highly specialized or limited use, significantly complex or large, additional time beyond the typical times may be required for new appraisals or evaluations (new or updated). 
 
 As part of the Company s credit administration and portfolio monitoring practices, the Company s regular internal and external credit examinations review a significant number of individual loan files. Appraisals and evaluations (new or updated) are reviewed to determine whether the timeliness, methods, assumptions, and findings are reasonable and in compliance with the Company s loan policy and credit administration practices. Such reviews include the adequacy of the steps taken by the Company to ensure that the individuals who perform appraisals and evaluations (new or updated) are appropriately qualified and are not subject to conflicts of interest. If there are any deficiencies noted in the reviews, they are reported to Bank management and prompt corrective action is taken. 

Non-performing Assets 
 The following table summarizes information regarding non-performing assets at the dates indicated:

 ______________________________ 
 1 Amounts represent estimated interest income that would have been recognized on loans accounted for on a non-accrual basis as of the end of each period had such loans performed pursuant to contractual terms. 
 
 Non-performing assets of 32.7 million at December 31, 2022 decreased 34.9 million, or 52 percent, over prior year end. Non-performing assets as a percentage of subsidiary assets at December 31, 2022 was 0.12 percent compared to 0.26 percent in the prior year end. 
 
 Most of the Company s non-performing assets are secured by real estate, and based on the most current information available to management, including updated appraisals or evaluations (new or updated), the Company believes the value of the underlying real estate collateral is adequate to minimize significant charge-offs or losses to the Company. Through pro-active credit administration, 
 38 

the Company works closely with its borrowers to seek favorable resolution to the extent possible, thereby attempting to minimize net charge-offs or losses to the Company. With very limited exceptions, the Company does not disburse additional funds on non-performing loans. Instead, the Company proceeds to collection and foreclosure actions in order to reduce the Company s exposure to loss on such loans. 
 
 For additional information on accounting policies relating to non-performing assets, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
 
 Restructured Loans 
 A restructured loan is considered a troubled debt restructuring TDR if the creditor, for economic or legal reasons related to the debtor s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider. Each restructured debt is separately negotiated with the borrower and includes terms and conditions that reflect the borrower s prospective ability to service their obligations as modified. The Company discourages the use of the multiple loan strategy when restructuring loans regardless of whether or not the loans are designated as TDRs. The Company had TDR loans of 37.6 million and 37.2 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 Other Real Estate Owned and Foreclosed Assets 
 The book value of loans prior to the acquisition of collateral and transfer of the loans into other real estate owned OREO and other foreclosed assets during 2022 was 1.3 million. The fair value of the loan collateral acquired in foreclosure during 2022 was 0.9 million. The following table sets forth the changes in OREO for the periods indicated:

 The ACL as a percentage of total loans outstanding at December 31 2022 was 1.20 percent which was a 9 basis points decrease from the prior year end. The Company s ACL of 182 million is considered by management to be adequate to absorb the estimated credit losses from any segment of its loan portfolio based upon managements best estimate of current expected credit losses within the existing portfolio of loans. Should any of the factors considered by management in making this estimate change, the Company s estimate of current expected credit losses could also change, which could affect the level of future provision of credit losses related to loans. For the periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company believes the ACL is commensurate with the risk in the Company s loan portfolio and is directionally consistent with the change in the quality of the Company s loan portfolio. During 2022, provision for credit losses exceeded the charge-offs, net of recoveries, by 9.6 million. During the same period in 2021, the charge-offs, net of recoveries, exceeded provision for credit losses by 14.1 million. 
 
 At the end of each quarter, the Company analyzes its loan portfolio and maintains an ACL at a level that is appropriate and determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). Determining the adequacy of the ACL involves a high degree of judgment and is inevitably imprecise as the risk of loss is difficult to quantify. The ACL methodology is designed to reasonably estimate the probable credit losses within the Company s loan portfolio. Accordingly, the ACL is maintained within a range of estimated losses. The determination of the ACL on loans, including credit loss expense and net charge-offs, is a critical accounting estimate that involves management s judgments about the loan portfolio that impact credit losses, including the credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio, economic forecasts nationally and in the local markets in which the Company operates, trends and changes in collateral values, delinquencies, non-performing assets, net charge-offs, credit-related policies and personnel, and other environmental factors. 
 
 In determining the allowance, the loan portfolio is separated into pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics which are the Company s loan segments. The Company then derives estimated loss assumptions from its model by loan segment which is further segregated by the credit quality indicators. The loss assumptions are then applied to each segment of loan to estimate the ACL on the pooled loans. For any loans that do not share similar risk characteristics, the estimated credit losses are determined on an individual loan basis and such loans primarily consist of non-accrual loans. An estimated credit loss is recorded on individually reviewed loans when the fair value of a collateral-dependent loan or the present value of the loan s expected future cash flows (discounted at the loans original effective interest rate) is less than the amortized cost of the loan.

The Company provides commercial banking services to individuals, small to medium-sized businesses, community organizations and public entities from 221 locations, including 187 branches, across Montana, Idaho, Utah, Washington, Wyoming, Colorado, Arizona and Nevada. The states in which the Company operates have diverse economies and markets that are tied to commodities (crops, livestock, minerals, oil and natural gas), tourism, real estate and land development and an assortment of industries, both manufacturing and service-related. Thus, the changes in the global, national, and local economies are not uniform across the Company s geographic locations. The geographic dispersion of these market areas helps to mitigate the risk of credit loss. The Company s model of seventeen bank divisions with separate management teams is also a significant benefit in mitigating and managing the Company s credit risk. This model provides substantial local oversight to the lending and credit management function and requires multiple reviews of larger loans before credit is extended. 
 
 The primary responsibility for credit risk assessment and identification of problem loans rests with the loan officer of the account. This continuous process of identifying non-performing loans is necessary to support management s evaluation of the ACL adequacy. An independent loan review function verifying credit risk ratings evaluates the loan officer and management s evaluation of the loan portfolio credit quality. The ACL evaluation is well documented and approved by the Company s Board. In addition, the policy and procedures for determining the balance of the ACL are reviewed annually by the Company s Board, the internal audit department, independent credit reviewers and state and federal bank regulatory agencies. 
 
 Although the Company continues to actively monitor economic trends and regulatory developments, no assurance can be given that the Company will not, in any particular period, sustain losses that are significant relative to the ACL amount, or that subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio applying management s judgment about then current factors will not require significant changes in the ACL. Under such circumstances, additional credit loss expense could result. 
 
 For additional information regarding the ACL, its relation to credit loss expense and risk related to asset quality, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Sources of Funds 
 The Company s deposits have traditionally been the principal source of funds for use in lending and other business purposes. The Company also obtains funds from repayment of loans and debt securities, securities sold under agreements to repurchase repurchase agreements ), wholesale deposits, advances from FHLB and other borrowings. Loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while interest bearing deposit inflows and outflows are significantly influenced by general interest rate levels and market conditions. Borrowings and advances may be used on a short-term basis to compensate for reductions in normal sources of funds such as deposit inflows at less than projected levels. Borrowings also may be used on a long-term basis to support expanded activities, match maturities of longer-term assets or manage interest rate risk. 
 
 Deposits 
 The Company has several deposit programs designed to attract both short-term and long-term deposits from the general public by providing a wide selection of accounts and rates. These programs include non-interest bearing deposit accounts and interest bearing deposit accounts such as NOW, DDA, savings, money market deposits, fixed rate certificates of deposit with maturities ranging from three months to five years, negotiated-rate jumbo certificates, and individual retirement accounts. These deposits are obtained primarily from individual and business residents in the Bank s geographic market areas. Wholesale deposits are obtained through various programs and include brokered deposits classified as NOW, DDA, money market deposits and certificate accounts. The Company s deposits are summarized below: 
 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (Dollars in thousands) Amount Percent Amount Percent Non-interest bearing deposits

Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase, Federal Home Loan Bank Advances and Other Borrowings 
 The Company borrows money through repurchase agreements. This process involves the selling of one or more of the securities in the Company s investment portfolio and simultaneously entering into an agreement to repurchase the same securities at an agreed upon later date, typically overnight. A rate of interest is paid for the agreed period of time. The Bank enters into repurchase agreements with local municipalities, and certain customers, and has adopted procedures designed to ensure proper transfer of title and safekeeping of the underlying securities. In addition to retail repurchase agreements, the Company periodically enters into wholesale repurchase agreements as additional funding sources. The Company has not entered into reverse repurchase agreements. 
 
 The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Des Moines, which is one of eleven banks that comprise the FHLB system. The Bank is required to maintain a certain level of activity-based stock in order to borrow or to engage in other transactions with the FHLB of Des Moines. Additionally, the Bank is subject to a membership capital stock requirement that is based upon an annual calibration tied to the total assets of the Bank. The borrowings are collateralized by eligible categories of loans and debt securities (principally, securities which are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the U.S. government and its agencies), provided certain standards related to credit-worthiness have been met. Advances are made pursuant to several different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rates and range of maturities. The Bank s maximum amount of FHLB advances is limited to the lesser of a fixed percentage of the Bank s total assets or the discounted value of eligible collateral. FHLB advances fluctuate to meet seasonal and other withdrawals of deposits and to expand lending or investment opportunities of the Company. 
 
 Additionally, the Company has other sources of secured and unsecured borrowing lines from various sources that may be used from time to time. 
 
 For additional information concerning the Company s borrowings, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
 
 Short-term borrowings 
 A critical component of the Company s liquidity and capital resources is access to short-term borrowings to fund its operations. Short-term borrowings are accompanied by increased risks managed by the Bank s Asset Liability Committee ALCO such as rate increases or unfavorable change in terms which would make it more costly to obtain future short-term borrowings. The Company s short-term borrowing sources include FHLB advances, federal funds purchased and retail and wholesale repurchase agreements. The Company also has access to the short-term discount window borrowing programs (i.e., primary credit) of the Federal Reserve Bank FRB as well as a line of credit with a large national banking institution. FHLB advances and certain other short-term borrowings may be renewed as long-term borrowings to decrease certain risks such as liquidity or interest rate risk; however, the reduction in risks are weighed against the increased cost of funds and other risks. 
 
 The following table provides information relating to significant short-term borrowings, which consists of borrowings that mature within one year of period end: At or for the Years ended (Dollars in thousands) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Repurchase agreements Amount outstanding at end of period 945,916 1,020,794 Weighted interest rate on outstanding amount 1.20 0.19 Maximum outstanding at any month end 985,774 1,040,939 Average balance 920,955 994,968 Weighted-average interest rate 0.35 0.23 FHLB advances Amount outstanding at end of period 1,800,000 Weighted interest rate on outstanding amount 4.54 Maximum outstanding at any month end 1,800,000 Average balance 584,562 Weighted-average interest rate 2.92

Subordinated Debentures 
 In addition to funds obtained in the ordinary course of business, the Company formed or acquired financing subsidiaries for the purpose of issuing or holding trust preferred securities that entitle the investor to receive cumulative cash distributions thereon. Subordinated debentures were issued in conjunction with the trust preferred securities and the terms of the subordinated debentures and trust preferred securities are the same. For regulatory capital purposes, the trust preferred securities are included in Tier 2 capital at December 31, 2022. The subordinated debentures outstanding as of December 31, 2022 were 133 million, including fair value adjustments from acquisitions. For additional information regarding the subordinated debentures, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 

Liquidity Risk 
 In the normal course of business, the Company has commitments that require material cash requirements for customer deposits outflows, repurchase agreements, borrowed funds, lease obligations, off-balance sheet obligations, operating expenses and other contractual obligations. The source of funding for such requirements includes loan repayments, customer deposit inflows, borrowings and capital resources. Liquidity risk is the possibility that the Company will not be able to fund present and future obligations as they come due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding at a reasonable cost. 
 
 The objective of liquidity management is to maintain cash flows adequate to meet current and future needs for credit demand, deposit withdrawals, maturing liabilities and corporate operating expenses. Effective liquidity management entails three elements: 
 1. assessing on an ongoing basis, the current and expected future needs for funds, and ensuring that sufficient funds or access to funds exist to meet those needs at the appropriate time; 
 2. providing for an adequate cushion of liquidity to meet unanticipated cash flow needs that may arise from potential adverse circumstances ranging from high probability/low severity events to low probability/high severity; and 
 3. balancing the benefits between providing for adequate liquidity to mitigate potential adverse events and the cost of that liquidity. 
 
 The Company has a wide range of versatility in managing the liquidity and asset/liability mix. The Bank s ALCO meets regularly to assess liquidity risk, among other matters. The Company monitors liquidity and contingency funding alternatives through management reports of liquid assets (e.g., debt securities), both unencumbered and pledged, as well as borrowing capacity, both secured and unsecured, including off-balance sheet funding sources. The Company evaluates its potential funding needs across alternative scenarios and maintains contingency funding plans consistent with the Company s access to diversified sources of contingent funding.

 Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 In the normal course of business, there may be various outstanding commitments to obtain funding and to extend credit, such as letters of credit and unfunded loan commitments, which are not reflected in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company assessed the off-balance sheet credit exposures as of December 31, 2022 and determined its ACL of 25.3 million was adequate to absorb the estimated credit losses. Such ACL is included in other liabilities. 
 
 Off-balance sheet arrangements also include any obligation related to a variable interest held in an unconsolidated entity. The Company does not anticipate any material losses as a result of these transactions. For additional information regarding the Company s interests in unconsolidated VIEs, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Capital Resources 
 Maintaining capital strength continues to be a long-term objective of the Company. Abundant capital is necessary to sustain growth, provide protection against unanticipated declines in asset values, and to safeguard the funds of depositors. Capital is also a source of funds for loan demand and enables the Company to effectively manage its assets and liabilities. The Company has the capacity to issue 234,000,000 shares of common stock of which 110,777,780 have been issued as of December 31, 2022. The Company also has the capacity to issue 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock of which none have been issued as of December 31, 2022. Conversely, the Company may decide to utilize a portion of its strong capital position, as it has done in the past, to repurchase shares of its outstanding common stock, depending on market price and other relevant considerations. 
 
 The Federal Reserve has adopted capital adequacy guidelines that are used to assess the adequacy of capital in supervising a bank holding company. The federal banking agencies issued final rules Final Rules that established a comprehensive regulatory capital framework based on the recommendation of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The Final Rules require the Company to hold a 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. As of December 31, 2022, management believes the Company and Bank meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject and there are no conditions or events subsequent to this date that management believes have changed the Company s or Bank s risk-based capital category. 
 
 The following table illustrates the Bank s regulatory capital ratios and the Federal Reserve s capital adequacy guidelines as of December 31, 2022:

 On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted the current expected credit losses CECL accounting standard that requires management s estimate of credit losses over the expected contractual lives of the Company's relevant financial assets. On March 27, 2020, federal banking regulators issued an interim final rule to delay for two years the initial adoption impact of CECL on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of the capital benefit provided during 2020 and 2021 (i.e., a five-year transition period). The Company has elected to utilize the five-year transition period. During the two-year delay, the Company added back to Common Tier 1 capital 100 percent of the initial adoption impact of CECL plus 25 percent of the cumulative quarterly changes in ACL (i.e., quarterly transitional amounts). Starting on January 1, 2022, the quarterly transitional amounts along with the initial adoption impact of CECL will be phased out of Common Tier 1 capital evenly over the three-year period.

Rate/Volume Analysis 
 Net interest income can be evaluated from the perspective of relative dollars of change in each period. Interest income and interest expense, which are the components of net interest income, are shown in the following table on the basis of the amount of any increases (or decreases) attributable to changes in the dollar levels of the Company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities volume and the yields earned and paid on such assets and liabilities rate ). The change in interest income and interest expense attributable to changes in both volume and rates has been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate.

 Net interest income (tax-equivalent) increased 128.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. The interest income for 2022 increased over the same period last year primarily from the acquisition of Alta, increased volume in commercial loans and investment securities. 
 
 Net interest income (tax-equivalent) increased 64.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. The interest income for 2021 increased over the same period last year primarily from the acquisition of Alta, increased volume 
 in commercial loans and investment securities. The growth in the investment securities was the result of security purchases utilizing 
 the 1.623 billion of cash received from the Alta acquisition, excess liquidity from the increase in core deposits, and SBA forgiveness 
 of PPP loans. Total interest expense decreased from the prior year primarily from the decreased rates on deposits. 

Cyber Risk 
 A failure in or breach of the Company s operational or security systems, or those of the Company s third party service providers, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could disrupt business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase costs and cause losses. The Company employs detection and response mechanisms designed to contain and mitigate these risks. The Company maintains a robust information security program that is regularly reviewed, tested, and updated. This includes vulnerability and patch management programs, incident response planning, security monitoring, employee training, and security awareness testing. The Board's Risk Oversight Committee is responsible for monitoring the Company s cyber risk management profile and related programs. The Board is responsible for approval of related policies.

Critical Accounting Policies 
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP often requires management to use significant judgments as well as subjective and/or complex measurements in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The Company considers its accounting policies for the ACL, goodwill and fair value measurements to be critical accounting policies. The application of these policies has a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements and financial results could differ significantly if different judgments or estimates were applied. The following describes why the estimates are subject to uncertainty, the estimated change in the reported periods, and the sensitivity of the reported amounts to the methods, assumptions, and estimates underlying the calculation. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 The allowance for credit losses for loans receivable represents management s estimate of credit losses over the expected contractual life of the loan portfolio. Determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires a high degree of judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the then-existing loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance in those future period which is why there is such a high degree of uncertainty. Such factors or assumptions include loan volumes, delinquency status, credit ratings, historical loss experiences, estimated prepayment speeds, weighted average lives and other conditions influencing loss expectations, such as reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions. As a result of the significant size of the loan portfolio, the numerous assumptions in the model, and the high degree of potential change in such assumptions, there is a high degree of sensitivity to the reported amounts. For information regarding the ACL for loans receivable, its relation to the provision for credit losses and risk related to asset quality, and the estimated change during the reported periods, see the section captioned Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans Receivable included in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Notes 1 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
 
 Goodwill 
 The Company is required to assess goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if determined necessary. Goodwill of a reporting unit is tested for impairment if an event is more-likely-than-not to reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Changes in the economic environment, operations of the aggregated reporting units, or other factors could result in the decline in the fair value of the aggregated reporting units which could result in a goodwill impairment in the future. The estimate is considered to have a low amount of uncertainty unless there is an event that significantly lowers the goodwill fair value estimate. Examples of events and circumstances include: significant change in legal factors or in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, loss of key personnel, a more likely-than-not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of, and the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit. There were no changes to the Company s assessment or reported amounts during 2022. For information on goodwill, see Notes 1 and 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
 
 Fair Value Measurements 
 Fair value measurement estimates are used for certain recorded and disclosed financial instruments on a recurring and non-recurring basis. Such estimates utilize a variety of assumptions which are subject to uncertainty. Certain fair value measurements have a higher degree of sensitivity of the reported amount to the methods, assumptions and estimates underlying the calculation. For information on fair value measurements and the estimated changes during the reporting periods, see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 

Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
 There was no Authoritative accounting guidance that had a material impact on the Company that became effective during 2022 or 2021. Authoritative accounting guidance that may possibly have a material impact on the Company that is pending adoption at December 31, 2022 includes amendments to: 
 
 FASB ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures 
 FASB ASC Topic 848, Reference Rate Reform 
 
 For additional information on the topics and the impact on the Company see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 The disclosures set forth in this item are qualified by the section captioned Forward-Looking Statements included in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates/prices such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and equity prices. The Company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. 
 54 

Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate risk is the potential for loss of future earnings resulting from adverse changes in the level of interest rates. Interest rate risk results from many factors and could have a significant impact on the Company s net interest income, which is the Company s primary source of net income. Net interest income is affected by a myriad of variables, including changes in interest rates, the relationship between rates on interest bearing assets and liabilities, the impact of the interest fluctuations on asset prepayments and the mix of interest bearing assets and liabilities. 
 Although interest rate risk is inherent in the banking industry, banks are expected to have sound risk management practices in place to measure, monitor and control interest rate exposures. The objective of interest rate risk management is to appropriately manage the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. The process includes identification and management of the sensitivity of net interest income to changing interest rates. 
 The ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of the Company s asset/liability management process which is governed by policies established by the Company s Board. The Board delegates responsibility for carrying out the asset/liability management policies to ALCO. In this capacity, ALCO develops guidelines and strategies impacting the Company s asset/liability management-related activities which are focused on managing earnings, particularly net interest income, relative to acceptable levels of interest rate, liquidity and credit/capital risks. Accordingly, an important goal of the Company s asset and liability management practices is to manage its existing and prospective levels of net interest income within an acceptable degree of interest rate risk based upon estimated market risk sensitivity, policy limits and overall market interest rate levels and trends. 
 
 Net interest income simulation 
 The Company uses a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income NII to sustained interest rate changes. While ALCO routinely monitors simulated NII sensitivity over rolling two-year and five-year horizons, it also utilizes additional tools to monitor potential longer-term interest rate risk. The simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all assets and liabilities reflected on the Company s statements of financial condition. This sensitivity analysis is compared to ALCO policy limits which specify a maximum tolerance level for NII exposure over a one year and two year horizon, assuming no balance sheet growth. The ALCO policy rate scenarios include upward and downward shifts in interest rates for 100 bps, 200 bps, 300 bps, and 400 bps scenarios with instantaneous and parallel changes in current market yield curves. The ALCO policy also includes 200 bps and 400 bps rate scenarios with gradual parallel shifts in interest rates over 12-month and 24-month periods, respectively. Given the historically low rate environment, the Company only models and reports for a downward shift in interest rates of 100 bps. Other non-parallel rate movement scenarios are also modeled to determine the potential impact on net interest income. The additional scenarios are adjusted as the economic environment changes and provide ALCO additional interest rate risk monitoring tools to evaluate current market conditions. 
 
 The following is indicative of the Company s overall NII sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2022. The Company s NII sensitivity remained within policy limits at December 31, 2022. Estimated Sensitivity Rate Scenarios One Year Two Years -100 bps Rate shock (0.31 (2.07 +100 bps Rate shock 0.08 1.65 +200 bps Rate shock (2.00 1.31 +200 bps Rate ramp (1.02 0.79 +300 bps Rate shock (7.19 (2.09 +400 bps Rate shock (12.39 (5.54 +400 bps Rate ramp (1.06 (0.61 
 
 The preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results. Growth in the Company s core deposit franchise, updated deposit pricing assumptions, and other balance sheet changes including the acquisition of Alta over the past year have increased the degree of measured asset sensitivity and thus well positioned the Company for a higher interest rate environment. It is important to note that these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions that are specific to our Company and thus may not be directly comparable to other institutions. These assumptions include: the nature and timing of interest rate levels including, but not limited to, yield curve shape, prepayments on loans and securities, deposit decay rates, pricing decisions on loans and deposits and reinvestment/replacement of asset and liability cash flows. While assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions, the Company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might 
 55 

change. Also, as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis, actual results will also differ due to prepayment/refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed, the varying impact of interest rate caps or floors on adjustable rate assets, the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans, depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes, and other internal and external variables. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that ALCO might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates.

 For loans receivable, the ACL is a contra-asset valuation account, calculated in accordance with Topic 326 that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected 
 For unfunded loan commitments, the ACL is a liability account calculated in accordance with Topic 326, reported as a component of other liabilities 
 
 The determination of the ACL includes a quantitative portion that calculates historical average loss rates and uses forecast assumptions and other inputs to project credit losses over the life of the loan portfolio. Additionally, the ACL requires management to exercise significant judgment and consider numerous subjective factors, including determining qualitative factors utilized to adjust the ACL for projected credit losses that the quantitative allocations portion does not factor into its consideration. As disclosed by management, different assumptions and conditions could result in a materially different amount for the ACL. 
 
 Auditing the allowance for credit loss involved a high degree of subjectivity in evaluating management s estimates, such as evaluating management s identification of credit quality indicators, assessment of economic conditions and other environmental factors, evaluating the adequacy of specific allowances associated with individually evaluated loans and assessing the appropriateness of loan grades and non-accrual, collateral dependent, and individually evaluated designations. 
 
 The primary procedures we performed as of December 31, 2022 to address this critical audit matter included: 
 
 Testing the effectiveness of controls, including those related to technology over the ACL including data completeness and accuracy, classifications of loan segments, historical data, the calculation of baseline loss rates, the establishment of qualitative adjustments, identification of individually evaluated loans and risk classification of individual loans and/or loan relationships, establishment of specific reserves on individually evaluated loans and management s review controls over the ACL balance as a whole 
 Testing of completeness and accuracy of the information utilized in the ACL through testing of year-end loan balances, non-accrual and individually evaluated loan designations, gross charge-offs, and recoveries 
 Testing of the Company s ACL narrative supporting the overall ACL process in place and adjusted loss factors applied to various loan segments 
 Testing of the economic inputs utilized to generate the economic forecast multipliers utilized within the quantitative portion of the ACL 
 Testing the Company s ACL model for computational accuracy

Definitions and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of reliable financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

bank divisions and a corporate division. The corporate division includes the Bank s investment portfolio, wholesale borrowings and other centralized functions. The Bank divisions operate under separate names, management teams and advisory directors. The Company considers the Bank to be its sole operating segment as the Bank 1) engages in similar bank business activity from which it earns revenues and incurs expenses; 2) the operating results of the Bank are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer CEO (i.e., the chief operating decision maker) who makes decisions about resources to be allocated to the Bank; and 3) financial information is available for the Bank. All significant inter-company transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
 
 The Bank has subsidiary interests in variable interest entities VIE for which the Bank has both the power to direct the VIE s significant activities and the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. These subsidiary interests are included in the Company s consolidated financial statements. The Bank also has subsidiary interests in VIEs for which the Bank does not have a controlling financial interest and is not the primary beneficiary. These subsidiary interests are not included in the Company s consolidated financial statements. For additional information on the Bank s interest in VIEs, see note 7. 
 
 The parent holding company owns non-bank subsidiaries that have issued trust preferred securities. The trust subsidiaries are not included in the Company s consolidated financial statements.

or more past due based on payments received and applied to the loan are considered delinquent. Loans are designated non-accrual and the accrual of interest is discontinued when the collection of the contractual principal or interest is unlikely. A loan is typically placed on non-accrual when principal or interest is due and has remained unpaid for or more. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current period interest income. Subsequent payments on non-accrual loans are applied to the outstanding principal balance if doubt remains as to the ultimate collectability of the loan. Interest accruals are not resumed on partially charged-off impaired loans. For other loans on non-accrual, interest accruals are resumed on such loans only when they are brought fully current with respect to interest and principal and when, in the judgment of management, the loans are estimated to be fully collectible as to both principal and interest. 
 
 The Company has acquired loans through acquisitions, some of which have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination. The Company considers all acquired non-accrual loans to be PCD loans. In addition, the Company considers loans accruing or more past due or substandard loans to be PCD loans. An ACL is determined using the same methodology as other loans held for investment. The ACL determined on a collective basis is allocated to individual loans. The sum of a loan s fair value and ACL becomes the initial amortized cost basis. The difference between the initial amortized cost basis and the par value of the loan is a noncredit discount or premium, which is amortized into interest income over the life of the loan. Subsequent changes to the ACL are recorded through provision for credit losses. 
 
 For additional information relating to loans, see Note 3. 
 
 days delinquent. Real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure is classified as other real estate owned OREO until such time as it is sold. 
 
 The expected credit loss estimate process involves procedures to consider the unique characteristics of each of the Company s loan portfolio segments, which consist of residential real estate, commercial real estate, other commercial, home equity, and other 
 70 

consecutive quarter forecasting period is a reasonable and supportable period. Expected credit loss for periods beyond reasonable and supportable forecast periods are determined based on a reversion method which reverts back to historical loss estimates over a consecutive quarter period on a straight-line basis. 
 
 Credit quality is assessed and monitored by evaluating various attributes and the results of those evaluations are utilized in underwriting new loans and the process for estimating the expected credit losses. The following paragraphs describe the risk characteristics relevant to each portfolio segment. 
 
 Residential Real Estate. Residential real estate loans are secured by owner-occupied 1-4 family residences. Repayment of these loans is primarily dependent on the personal income and credit rating of the borrowers. Credit risk in these loans is impacted by economic conditions within the Company s market areas that affect the value of the residential property securing the loans and affect the borrowers' personal incomes. Mitigating risk factors for this loan segment include a large number of borrowers, geographic dispersion of market areas and the loans are originated for relatively smaller amounts. 
 
 Commercial Real Estate . Commercial real estate loans typically involve larger principal amounts, and repayment of these loans is generally dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan and/or the business conducted on the property securing the loan. Credit risk in these loans is impacted by the creditworthiness of a borrower, valuation of the property securing the loan and conditions within the local economies in the Company s diverse, geographic market areas. 
 
 Commercial . Commercial loans consist of loans to commercial customers for use in financing working capital needs, equipment purchases and business expansions. The loans in this category are repaid primarily from the cash flow of a borrower s principal business operation. Credit risk in these loans is driven by creditworthiness of a borrower and the economic conditions that impact the cash flow stability from business operations across the Company s diverse, geographic market areas. 
 
 Home Equity . Home equity loans consist of junior lien mortgages and first and junior lien lines of credit (revolving open-end and amortizing closed-end) secured by owner-occupied 1-4 family residences. Repayment of these loans is primarily dependent on the personal income and credit rating of the borrowers. Credit risk in these loans is impacted by economic conditions within the Company s market areas that affect the value of the residential property securing the loans and affect the borrowers' personal incomes. Mitigating risk factors for this loan segment are a large number of borrowers, geographic dispersion of market areas and the loans are originated for terms that range from to years. 
 
 Other Consumer . The other consumer loan portfolio consists of various short-term loans such as automobile loans and loans for other personal purposes. Repayment of these loans is primarily dependent on the personal income of the borrowers. Credit risk is driven by consumer economic factors (such as unemployment and general economic conditions in the Company s diverse, geographic market areas) and the creditworthiness of a borrower. 
 
 The allowance is impacted by loan volumes, delinquency status, credit ratings, historical loss experiences, estimated prepayment speeds, weighted average lives and other conditions influencing loss expectations, such as reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions. The methodology for estimating the amount of expected credit losses reported in the allowance has basic components: 1) individual loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with other loans and the measurement of expected credit losses for such individual loans; and 2) the expected credit losses for pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics. 
 
 Loans that do not Share Similar Risk Characteristics with Other Loans. For a loan that does not share similar risk characteristics with other loans, expected credit loss is measured based on the net realizable value, that is, the difference between the discounted value of the expected future cash flows, based on the original effective interest rate, and the amortized cost basis of the loan. For these loans, the expected credit loss is equal to the amount by which the net realizable value of the loan is less than the amortized cost basis of the loan (which is net of previous charge-offs and deferred loan fees and costs), except when the loan is collateral-dependent, that is, when foreclosure is probable or the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. In these cases, expected credit loss is measured as the difference between the amortized cost basis of the loan and the fair value of the collateral. The fair value of the collateral is adjusted for the estimated cost to sell if repayment or satisfaction of a loan is dependent on the sale (rather than only on the operation) of the collateral. The Company has determined that non-accrual loans do not share similar risk characteristics with other loans and these loans are individually evaluated for estimated allowance for credit losses. The Company, through its credit monitoring process, may also identify other loans that do not share similar risk characteristics and individually evaluate such loans. The starting point for determining the fair value of collateral is to obtain external appraisals or evaluations (new or updated). The valuation techniques used in preparing appraisals or evaluations (new or updated) include the cost approach, income approach, sales comparison approach, or a combination of the preceding valuation techniques. The Company s credit department reviews appraisals, giving consideration to the highest and best use of the collateral. The appraisals or evaluations (new or updated) are reviewed at least quarterly and more frequently based on current 
 71 

to days past due loans; and 3) non-accrual and or more past due loans. The primary credit quality indicator for commercial real estate and commercial loans is the Company s internal risk rating system, which includes the following categories: 1) pass loans; 2) special mention loans; 3) substandard loans; and 4) doubtful or loss loans. Such credit quality indicators are regularly monitored and incorporated into the Company s allowance estimate. The following paragraphs further define the internal risk ratings for commercial real estate and commercial loans. 
 
 Pass Loans. These ratings represent loans that are of acceptable, good or excellent quality with very limited to no risk. Loans that do not have one of the following ratings are considered pass loans. 
 
 Special Mention Loans. These ratings represent loans that are designated as special mention per the regulatory definition. Special mention loans are currently protected but are potentially weak. The credit risk may be relatively minor yet constitute an undue and unwarranted risk in light of the circumstances surrounding a specific loan. The rating may be used to identify credit with potential weaknesses that if not corrected may weaken the loan to the point of inadequately protecting the Bank s credit position. Examples include a lack of supervision, inadequate loan agreement, condition, or control of collateral, incomplete, or improper documentation, deviations from lending policy, and adverse trends in operations or economic conditions. 
 
 Substandard Loans. This rating represents loans that are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged. A loan so classified must have a well-defined weakness that jeopardizes the liquidation of the debt. These loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Loss potential, while existing in the aggregated amount of substandard loans, does not have to exist in an individual loan classified substandard. 
 
 Doubtful/Loss Loans. A loan classified as doubtful has the characteristics that make collection in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly improbable. The possibility of loss is extremely high, but because of pending factors, which may work to the advantage and strengthening of the loan, its classification as loss is deferred until its more exact status may be

 months or less are excluded from accounting guidance; as a result, the lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and the leases are not reflected on the Company s statements of financial condition. Renewal and termination options are considered when determining short-term leases. Leases are accounted for on an individual lease level. 

For additional information relating to leases, see Note 4. 

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, no long-lived assets were considered materially impaired.

following consummation of a business combination. 
 
 Core deposit intangible represents the intangible value of depositor relationships resulting from deposit liabilities assumed in acquisitions and is amortized using an accelerated method based on an estimated runoff of the related deposits. The core deposit intangible is evaluated for impairment and recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable, with any changes in estimated useful life accounted for prospectively over the revised remaining life. For additional information relating to core deposit intangibles, see Note 5. 
 
 The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually during the third quarter. The Company has identified that each of the Bank divisions are reporting units (i.e., components of the Glacier Bank operating segment) given that each division has a separate management team that regularly reviews its respective division financial information; however, the reporting units are aggregated into a single reporting unit due to the reporting units having similar economic characteristics. 
 
 The goodwill of a reporting unit is tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Examples of events and circumstances that could trigger the need for interim impairment testing include: 
 a significant change in legal factors or in the business climate; 
 an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; 
 unanticipated competition; 
 a loss of key personnel; 
 a more-likely-than-not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of; and 
 the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit.

 , , and for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, and largely consisted of revenue from service charges and other fees from deposits (e.g., overdraft fees, ATM fees, debit card fees). Due to the short-term nature of the Company s contracts with customers, an insignificant amount of receivables related to such revenue was recorded at December 31, 2022 and 2021 and there were impairment losses recognized. Policies specific to revenue from contracts with customers include the following: 
 
 Service Charges. Revenue from service charges consists of service charges and fees on deposit accounts under depository agreements with customers to provide access to deposited funds and, when applicable, pay interest on deposits. Service charges on deposit accounts may be transactional or non-transactional in nature. Transactional service charges occur in the form of a service or penalty and are charged upon the occurrence of an event (e.g., overdraft fees, ATM fees, wire transfer fees). Transactional service charges are recognized as services are delivered to and consumed by the customer, or as penalty fees are charged. Non-transactional service charges are charges that are based on a broader service, such as account maintenance fees and dormancy fees, and are recognized on a monthly basis.

A substantial portion of such securities were issued by Federal National Mortgage Association Fannie Mae ), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Freddie Mac ), Government National Mortgage Association Ginnie Mae and other agencies of the U.S. government or have credit ratings issued by one or more of the NRSRO entities in the highest credit rating categories.

Accrued interest receivable on available-for-sale debt securities totaled and at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, and was excluded from the estimate of credit losses. 
 
 During the period ended December 31, 2021, the Company acquired available-for-sale debt securities from the secondary market and through the Altabank acquisition. Such securities were evaluated and it was determined there were no PCD securities, so allowance for credit losses was recorded. 
 
 Based on an analysis of its available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses as of December 31, 2022, the Company determined the decline in value was unrelated to credit losses and was primarily the result of changes in interest rates and market spreads subsequent to acquisition. The fair value of the debt securities is expected to recover as payments are received and the debt securities approach maturity. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, management determined it did not intend to sell available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, and there was no expected requirement to sell such securities before recovery of their amortized cost. As a result, ACL was recorded on available-for-sale debt securities at December 31, 2022. As part of this determination, the Company considered contractual obligations, regulatory constraints, liquidity, capital, asset/liability management and securities portfolio objectives and whether or not any of the Company s investment securities were managed by third-party investment funds.

All of the Company s municipal bonds that are classified as held-to-maturity debt securities at December 31, 2022 have been determined to be investment grade. Held-to-maturity debt securities included in the Company s U.S. government and federal agency and residential mortgage-backed security categories are issued and guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae and other agencies of the U.S. government and are considered to be zero-loss securities. This determination is in consideration of the explicit and implicit guarantees by the US Government, the US Government s ability to print its own currency, a history of no credit losses by the US Government and noted agencies and the current economic and financial condition of the United States and US Government providing no indication the zero-loss determination is unjustified . 
 
 As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company did t have any held-to-maturity debt securities past due.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, the ACL increased primarily as a result of organic loan growth. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the ACL increased primarily as a result of the provision for credit losses recorded as a result of the Alta acquisition.

 The Company evaluates goodwill for possible impairment utilizing a control premium analysis. The analysis first calculates the market capitalization and then adjusts such value for a control premium range which results in an implied fair value. The control premium range is determined based on historical control premiums for acquisitions that are comparable to the Company and is obtained from an independent third party. The calculated implied fair value is then compared to the book value to determine whether the Company needs to proceed to step two of the goodwill impairment assessment. The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of 2022 and determined the fair value of the aggregated reporting units exceeded the carrying value, such that the Company s goodwill was not considered impaired. In recognition, there were no events or circumstances that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2022 that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value, the Company did not perform interim testing at December 31, 2022. Changes in the economic environment, operations of the aggregated reporting units, or other factors could result in the decline in the fair value of the aggregated reporting units which could result in a goodwill impairment in the future. Accumulated impairment charges were as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

However, the Company has credit protection in the form of indemnification agreements, guarantees, and collateral arrangements. The Company has evaluated the variable interests held by the Company in each CDE (NMTC) investment and determined the Company does not individually meet the characteristics of a primary beneficiary; however, the related party group does meet the criteria as a group and substantially all of the activities of the CDEs either involve or are conducted on behalf of the Company. As a result, the Company is the primary beneficiary of the CDEs and their assets, liabilities, and results of operations are included in the Company s consolidated financial statements.

 Subordinated Debentures Owed to Trust Subsidiaries 
 Trust preferred securities were issued by the Company s trust subsidiaries, the common stock of which is wholly-owned by the Company, in conjunction with the Company issuing subordinated debentures to the trust subsidiaries. The terms of the subordinated debentures are the same as the terms of the trust preferred securities. The Company guaranteed the payment of distributions and payments for redemption or liquidation of the trust preferred securities to the extent of funds held by the trust subsidiaries. The obligations of the Company under the subordinated debentures together with the guarantee and other back-up obligations, in the aggregate, constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by the Company of the obligations of all trusts under the trust preferred securities. 
 
 The trust preferred securities are subject to mandatory redemption upon repayment of the subordinated debentures at their stated maturity date or the earlier redemption in an amount equal to their liquidation amount plus accumulated and unpaid distributions to the date of redemption. Interest distributions are payable quarterly. The Company may defer the payment of interest at any time for a period not exceeding consecutive quarters provided that the deferral period does not extend past the stated maturity. During any such deferral period, distributions on the trust preferred securities will also be deferred and the Company s ability to pay dividends on its common shares will be restricted. 
 
 Subject to prior approval by the FRB, the trust preferred securities may be redeemed at par prior to maturity at the Company s option on or after the redemption date. All of the Company s trust preferred securities have reached the redemption date and could be redeemed at the Company s option. The trust preferred securities may also be redeemed at any time in whole (but not in part) for the Trusts in the event of unfavorable changes in laws or regulations that result in 1) subsidiary trusts becoming subject to federal income tax on income received on the subordinated debentures; 2) interest payable by the Company on the subordinated debentures becoming

billion due to an acquisition, then trust preferred securities are to be excluded from Tier 1 capital beginning in the period in which the transaction occurred. During 2020, the Company s acquisition of SBAZ on February 29, 2020, resulted in total consolidated assets exceeding billion; accordingly the trust preferred securities were included in Tier 2 capital instead of Tier 1 beginning in 2020. 
 
 Subordinated Debentures 
 The Company acquired subordinated debentures with the FSB acquisition that qualified as Tier 2 capital under the applicable capital adequacy rules and regulations promulgated by the FRB. The Tier 2 subordinated debentures were not deposits and were not insured by the FDIC or any other government agency. Such obligations were subordinated to the claims of general creditors, were unsecured and were ineligible as collateral. The principal amount was due at maturity and interest distributions were payable quarterly. The Tier 2 subordinated debentures should not be prepaid prior to the fifth anniversary of the closing date, which was September 30, 2020, except in the event the obligation no longer qualifies as Tier 2 capital Tier 2 capital event or the interest payable is no longer deductible tax event ). Any prepayment made in connection with a Tier 2 capital event or a tax event will be subject to obtaining the prior approval of the FRB. The Company prepaid this obligation in 2021.

 Residential Real Estate Derivatives 
 The Company enters into residential real estate derivatives for commitments interest rate locks to fund certain residential real estate loans to be sold into the secondary market. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, loan commitments with interest rate lock commitments totaled and , respectively. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of the related derivatives on the interest rate lock commitments was and , respectively, and was included in other assets with corresponding changes recorded in gain on sale of loans. The Company enters into free-standing derivatives to mitigate interest rate risk for most residential real estate loans to be sold. These derivatives include forward commitments to sell to-be-announced TBA securities which are used to economically hedge the interest rate risk associated with such loans and unfunded commitments. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, TBA commitments were and , respectively. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of the related derivatives on the TBA securities was and , respectively, and was included in other liabilities with corresponding changes recorded in gain on sale of loans. The Company does not enter into a commitment to sell these loans to an investor until the loan is funded and is ready to be delivered to the investor. Due to the forward sales commitments being short-term in nature, the corresponding derivatives are not significant. For all other residential real estate loans to be sold, the Company enters into best efforts forward sales commitments for the future delivery of loans to third party investors when interest rate lock commitments are entered into in order to economically hedge the effect of changes in interest rates resulting from its

 percent capital conservation buffer designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. The Company has elected to opt-out of the requirement to include most components of accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2022, management believes the Company and Bank meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject. 
 
 Prompt corrective action regulations provide the following classifications: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. If undercapitalized, capital distributions (including payment of a dividend) are generally restricted, as is paying management fees to its bank holding company. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements set forth in the table below can initiate certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company s and Bank s financial condition. The Company s and Bank s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. 
 
 At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the most recent regulatory notifications categorized the Company and Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be well capitalized, the Bank must maintain minimum total capital, Tier 1 capital, Common Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 Leverage ratios as set forth in the table below. There are no conditions or events since December 31, 2022 that management believes have changed the Company s or Bank s risk-based capital category. 
 
 Current guidance from the Federal Reserve provides, among other things, that dividends per share on the Company s common stock generally should not exceed earnings per share, measured over the previous four fiscal quarters. In certain circumstances, Montana law also places limits or restrictions on a bank s ability to declare and pay dividends.

 transfers between fair value hierarchy levels during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. 
 
 Recurring Measurements 
 The following is a description of the inputs and valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, as well as the general classification of such assets and liabilities pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. There have been no significant changes in the valuation techniques during the period ended December 31, 2022. 
 
 Debt securities, available-for-sale. The fair value for available-for-sale debt securities is estimated by obtaining quoted market prices for identical assets, where available. If such prices are not available, fair value is based on independent asset pricing services and models, the inputs of which are market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including but not limited to, yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, market spreads, prepayments, defaults, recoveries, cumulative loss projections, and cash flows. Such securities are classified in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Where Level 1 or Level 2 inputs are not available, such securities are classified as Level 3 within the hierarchy. 
 
 Fair value determinations of available-for-sale debt securities are the responsibility of the Company s corporate accounting and treasury departments. The Company obtains fair value estimates from independent third party vendors on a monthly basis. The vendors pricing system methodologies, procedures and system controls are reviewed to ensure they are appropriately designed and operating effectively. The Company reviews the vendors inputs for fair value estimates and the recommended assignments of levels within the fair value hierarchy. The review includes the extent to which markets for debt securities are determined to have limited or no activity, or are judged to be active markets. The Company reviews the extent to which observable and unobservable inputs are used as well as the appropriateness of the underlying assumptions about risk that a market participant would use in active markets, with adjustments for limited or inactive markets. In considering the inputs to the fair value estimates, the Company places less reliance on quotes that are judged to not reflect orderly transactions, or are non-binding indications. In assessing credit risk, the Company reviews payment performance, collateral adequacy, third party research and analyses, credit rating histories and issuers financial statements. For those markets determined to be inactive or limited, the valuation techniques used are models for which management has verified that discount rates are appropriately adjusted to reflect illiquidity and credit risk. 
 
 Loans held for sale, at fair value. Loans held for sale measured at fair value, for which an active secondary market and readily available market prices exist, are initially valued at the transaction price and are subsequently valued by using quoted prices for similar assets, adjusted for specific attributes of that loan or other observable market data, such as outstanding commitments from third party investors. Loans held for sale measured at fair value are classified within Level 2. Included in gain on sale of loans were net gains of , net gains of and net losses of for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, from the changes in fair value of loans held for sale measured at fair value. Electing to measure loans held for sale at fair value reduces certain timing differences and better matches changes in fair value of these assets with changes in the value of the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without the burden of complying with the requirements for hedge accounting. 
 
 Loan interest rate lock commitments. F air value estimates for loan interest rate lock commitments were based upon the estimated sales price, origination fees, direct costs, interest rate changes, etc. and were obtained from an independent third party. The components of the valuation were observable or could be corroborated by observable market data and, therefore, were classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.

Non-recurring Measurements 
 The following is a description of the inputs and valuation methodologies used for assets recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis, as well as the general classification of such assets pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. There have been no significant changes in the valuation techniques during the period ended December 31, 2022. 
 
 Other real estate owned. OREO is initially recorded at fair value less estimated cost to sell, establishing a new cost basis. OREO is subsequently accounted for at lower of cost or fair value less estimated cost to sell. Estimated fair value of OREO is based on appraisals or evaluations (new or updated). OREO is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 
 Collateral-dependent loans, net of ACL. Fair value estimates of collateral-dependent loans that are individually reviewed are based on the fair value of the collateral, less estimated cost to sell. Collateral-dependent individually reviewed loans are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 
 The Company s credit department reviews appraisals for OREO and collateral-dependent loans, giving consideration to the highest and best use of the collateral. The appraisal or evaluation (new or updated) is considered the starting point for determining fair value. The valuation techniques used in preparing appraisals or evaluations (new or updated) include the cost approach, income approach, sales comparison approach, or a combination of the preceding valuation techniques. The key inputs used to determine the fair value of the collateral-dependent loans and OREO include selling costs, discounted cash flow rate or capitalization rate, and adjustment to comparables. Valuations and significant inputs obtained by independent sources are reviewed by the Company for accuracy and reasonableness. The Company also considers other factors and events in the environment that may affect the fair value. The appraisals or evaluations (new or updated) are reviewed at least quarterly and more frequently based on current market conditions, including deterioration in a borrower s financial condition and when property values may be subject to significant volatility. After review and acceptance of the collateral appraisal or evaluation (new or updated), adjustments to the impaired loan or OREO may occur. The Company generally obtains appraisals or evaluations (new or updated) annually.

 2021 Acquisition 
 On October 1, 2021, the Company acquired percent of the outstanding common stock of Altabancorp and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Altabank, a community bank based in American Fork, Utah. Altabank provides banking services to individuals and businesses in Utah with twenty-five banking offices from Preston, Idaho to St. George, Utah. The acquisition significantly increased the Company s presence in the State of Utah. Alta operates as a new division of the Bank under its existing name and management team. The Alta acquisition was valued at and resulted in the Company issuing shares of its common stock and paying in cash in exchange for all of Alta s outstanding common stock shares. The fair value of the Company shares issued was determined on the basis of the opening market price of the Company s common stock on the October 1, 2021 acquisition date. The excess of the preliminary fair value of consideration transferred over total identifiable net assets was recorded as goodwill. The goodwill arising from the acquisition consists largely of the synergies and economies of scale expected from combining the operations of the Company and Alta. None of the goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes as the acquisition was accounted for as a tax-free exchange. 
 
 The fair value of the Alta s assets acquired include gross loans with fair values of . The gross principal and contractual interest due under Alta contracts was . The Company evaluated the principal and contractual interest due at the acquisition date and determined that an insignificant amount were not expected to be collectible.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 An evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), of the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, the disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that are filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are recorded, processed, summarized and timely reported as provided in the SEC s rules and forms. As a result of this evaluation, there were no significant changes in the internal control over financial reporting during the year ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonable likely to materially affect, the internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as it relates to its financial statements presented in conformity with GAAP. The Company s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Internal control over financial reporting includes self-monitoring mechanisms and actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified. 
 
 There are inherent limitations in any internal control, no matter how well designed, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected, including the possibility of circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even an effective internal control system can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of an internal control system may vary over time. 
 
 Management assessed its internal control structure over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. This assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management asserts that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as it relates to its financial statements presented in conformity with GAAP.
