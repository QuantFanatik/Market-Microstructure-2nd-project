 Item 1117 of Regulation AB: Legal Proceedings. 

 Except as set forth below,
there are no legal proceedings pending (or proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities) against any of Barclays Bank
Delaware, Barclays Dryrock Funding LLC, U.S. Bank National Association, Wilmington Trust, National Association or Barclays Dryrock Issuance
Trust, or of which any property of the foregoing is subject, that are material to holders of the notes. BBD is a defendant in a number
of putative class action cases commenced in 2005 in various federal district courts by merchants alleging that Visa U.S.A., Inc. Visa ),
MasterCard International MasterCard and their member banks conspired to fix interchange fees and unlawfully bundle
several separate and distinct services, such as payment protection and transaction processing costs, in violation of the U.S. antitrust
laws. The merchants also alleged that the defendants imposed other restraints on merchants in connection with accepting payment cards
and that such alleged restraints violated the antitrust laws. Visa, MasterCard, and several other payment card issuing banks are also
defendants in the proceedings, which have been consolidated into a single proceeding in the Eastern District of New York, MDL No. 1720. 

 The merchants complaints
sought an unspecified amount of damages and injunctive relief. By an order dated January 9, 2008, the court dismissed class damage claims
prior to January 1, 2004; accordingly, the period over which any damages may be awarded is January 1, 2004 to the date of the award. On
July 13, 2012, the parties filed a proposed settlement agreement with the court under which the defendants agreed to pay the class plaintiffs
 6.05 billion, to make network rule changes and to give other relief (the 2012 class settlement ). The 2012 class
settlement included a provision pursuant to which Visa and MasterCard would reduce U.S. interchange rates 10 bps during an eight-month
period from July 29, 2013 through March 29, 2014. On the same day, defendants announced that they reached an agreement in principle to
settle with a group of individual plaintiffs that were not members of the class. The 2012 class settlement was approved by District Judge
John Gleeson on December 13, 2013, who then entered an agreed form of final judgment on January 14, 2014. 

 A number of merchants, including
several large retailers, elected against participation in the 2012 class settlement, opting out of that settlement and pursuing
separate actions on the same or similar claims as those alleged by the putative class plaintiffs. Some of these merchants commenced new
actions against Visa, MasterCard, and certain member banks, not including BBD, which remain pending. Although the class settlement fund
was reduced to account for opt-outs, resulting in a refund to BBD of a portion of its share of the class settlement fund, total settlement
payments by BBD to opt-out plaintiffs may be higher than the amount of that refund. If so, BBD will be liable for its share of the excess
over the refund under the terms of a judgment sharing agreement with Visa, MasterCard, and the other payment card issuing bank defendants.
As of the date hereof, Visa and MasterCard have settled a number of these opt-out actions and BBD has contributed to the settlement of
those actions in accordance with the judgment sharing agreements. The amount of those settlements has exceeded what each of those plaintiffs
would have been paid as a result of the 2012 class settlement. 

 The National Retail Federation
and a number of merchants appealed the judgment entering the 2012 class settlement to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit. On June 30, 2016, the Second Circuit reversed District Judge Gleeson s ruling approving the 2012 class settlement and remanded
the action back to the Eastern District of New York. Following remand of the case, the District Court reappointed counsel to represent
members of the putative class seeking primarily (but not exclusively) damages pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 

23(b)(3) and
appointed new counsel to represent class members seeking primarily equitable relief pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2). 

 Counsel for the Rule 23(b)(3)
putative class members moved for leave to file an amended complaint adding factual allegations and legal theories to conform to developments
in the law, as well as damage claims for additional years of alleged damages. On September 27, 2017, Magistrate Judge James Orenstein
granted the Rule 23(b)(3) plaintiffs motion to amend in part and denied it in part, allowing the plaintiffs to amend their complaints
to add their additional legal and factual theories, but holding that those theories would only apply to the preceding four years and would
not relate back to the date of filing of the initial complaints in 2005. On October 30, 2017, the Rule 23(b)(3) plaintiffs filed their
amended complaint. 

 The Rule 23(b)(3) plaintiffs
also appealed Magistrate Judge Orenstein s ruling to District Judge Margo Brodie. On August 30, 2018, District Judge Brodie set
aside Magistrate Judge Orenstein s ruling, holding that plaintiffs additional legal and factual theories related back to
the original filing dates for the Rule 23(b)(3) complaints and, for similar reasons, that comparable theories advanced by merchants that
elected not to participate in the 2012 class settlement and are suing the same defendants separately were entitled to have had their claims
considered to be tolled such that they would be treated as timely. 

 Counsel for the Rule 23(b)(2)
putative class members filed a separate complaint seeking broad equitable relief against allegedly anticompetitive conduct as well as
Visa and MasterCard network rules (the Rule 23(b)(2) Class Action ). On January 16, 2019, BBD and the other bank defendants
moved to dismiss the Rule 23(b)(2) class plaintiffs claims. On November 20, 2019, the Court denied the bank defendants motion
to dismiss. BBD and the other bank defendants filed answers to the complaint on May 18, 2020. On June 1, 2020, defendants and the Rule
23(b)(2) class plaintiffs each moved for summary judgment on various issues, which motions have been fully briefed as of December 21,
2020 and are pending before the District Court. On December 18, 2020, the Rule 23(b)(2) class plaintiffs moved to certify a class, and
District Judge Brodie granted the motion for class certification on September 27, 2021. 

 On September 17, 2018, all
defendants entered into a settlement agreement with the Rule 23(b)(3) class plaintiffs to resolve their claims (the Settlement
Agreement ). The Settlement Agreement amends and supersedes the 2012 class settlement. The Settlement Agreement resolves the
damages claims of the plaintiffs in the interchange fee litigation pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District
of New York, subject to any of those plaintiffs choosing to opt out of the Settlement Agreement and pursue their own actions, with the
class plaintiffs agreeing to receive 6.20 billion to settle this matter. BBD has contributed to the class settlement in accordance with
the judgment sharing agreements. On December 13, 2019, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York granted final
approval of the Settlement Agreement (the (b)(3) Class Settlement Final Approval ). Several objectors have filed appeals
in connection with the (b)(3) Class Settlement Final Approval. The appeals have been fully briefed, and the Second Circuit heard those
appeals on March 16, 2022. On July 8, 2022, the Second Circuit requested that the District Court confirm that its order approving the
2018 Settlement could be certified as a final judgment for assessment by the Second Circuit, notwithstanding the District Court s
stated intention to appoint a special master to resolve certain disputes related to who may claim settlement funds. On July 18, 2022,
the District Court issued an order confirming that all other aspects of the Damages Settlement constituted a final judgment. A final decision
on the appeal remains pending. 

 On July 20, 2019, forty-five
merchants filed an opt-out suit in the Northern District of California, asserting claims against Visa and MasterCard that are generally
similar to the claims raised by the Rule 23(b)(3) plaintiffs. This suit was transferred to the Eastern District of New York to be coordinated
with the MDL No. 1720 proceedings. Since July 2019, several additional opt-out claims have been initiated, and BBD anticipates that additional
opt-out claims may be initiated. While the Settlement Agreement provides that the class settlement fund will be reduced to account for
opt-outs, resulting in a refund to BBD of a portion of its share of the class settlement fund provided by the Settlement Agreement, total
settlement payments by BBD to opt-out plaintiffs that opt out of the Settlement Agreement may be higher than the amount of that refund.
If so, BBD will be liable for its share of the excess over the refund under the terms of a judgment sharing agreement with Visa, MasterCard,
and the other payment card issuing bank defendants. As of the date hereof, Visa and MasterCard have settled a number of these additional
opt-out actions, and BBD has contributed to the settlement of those actions in accordance with the judgment sharing agreements. 

Because of the inherent
uncertainties involved in the Rule 23(b)(2) Class Action, the opt-out plaintiffs actions arising from the 2012 class
settlement, and the prospect of additional opt-out plaintiffs actions arising from the Settlement Agreement, it is
too early to reliably estimate the ultimate liability BBD may incur or whether the results could be material to the operation or cash
flows of BBD. Any reduction in the interchange fees paid by merchants to banks could adversely impact the business operations of credit
card issuers, such as BBD, and could reduce the amount of interchange included in finance charge collections.

Party) complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB
(the Servicing Criteria) for the asset-backed securities transactions backed by credit card receivables, for which transactions the Asserting
Party acted as servicer, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 (the Reporting Period), that were registered with the Securities
and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, where the related asset-backed securities were outstanding
during the Reporting Period (the Platform), except for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(ii), 1122(d)(2)(iii),

1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the Platform. The Company
has determined that servicing criterion 1122(d)(2)(i) is applicable to the activities performed by the Company with respect to the Platform
only as it relates to sending payments on the pool assets to the trustee. The Company has determined that servicing criterion 1122(d)(2)(iv)
is applicable to the activities performed by the Company with respect to the Platform only as it relates to providing direction to the
Trustee relative to custodial bank account origination and maintenance. The Company has determined that servicing criterion 1122(d)(3)(i)
is applicable to the activities performed by the Company with respect to the Platform only as it relates to clauses (A) and (C), the
monitoring of the preparation and filing of investor reports and the signing of investor reports. The Company has determined that servicing
criterion 1122(d)(3)(ii) is applicable to the activities performed by the Company with respect to the Platform only as it relates to
the forwarding of allocation and remittance instructions to the trustee. Appendix B to management s Report on Assessment of Compliance
with Servicing Criteria identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the
Platform. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants to obtain reasonable assurance and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence
about the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. Our examination included testing selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing
selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and
performed those selected activities in compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected
transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed
to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts
calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions.
We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on
the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria.

 U.S. Bank National Association 

We have examined management s assertion,
included in the accompanying Report on Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, that U.S. Bank National Association
and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association (collectively, the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth
in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the U.S. Bank Corporate Trust Asset-Backed Securities
Platform (the Platform ), for which the Company provides trustee, securities administration, registrar and paying agent services,
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, except for servicing criteria Items 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(4)(i)-(ii), and 1122(d)(4)(iv)-(xiv),
which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the servicing platform covered by this
report. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted in accordance with
attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing
of less than all of the individual asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of less than all of the
servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed
those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions
and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine
whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated
or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. Although
the Company is responsible for assessing compliance with Items 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(v), and 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB, there
were no servicing activities performed by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2022 that required these servicing criteria to
be complied with. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

We are required to be independent of the Company
and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements related to our examination engagement. 

Our examination does not provide a legal determination
on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 

In our opinion, management s assertion
that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, for the U.S. Bank
