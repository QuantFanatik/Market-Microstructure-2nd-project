There
is a growing market in Asia of companies who are seeking to go public and become listed on a recognized exchange in a foreign jurisdiction.
We see tremendous opportunity to the extent that this trend continues worldwide. With respect to cross border listing advisory services,
we are assisting private companies in their desire to list and trade on public exchanges, including the U.S. NASDAQ and OTC Markets.
The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, signed in 2012, eases the initial public offering IPO process for
 emerging growth companies and reduces their regulatory burden, (2) improves the ability of these companies to access capital
through private offerings and small public offerings without SEC registration, and (3) allows private companies with a substantial shareholder
base to delay becoming a public reporting company. 

Through
our cross-border listing advisory services, we seek to form the bridge between these companies seeking to conduct their IPO (or in some
cases, self-directed public offerings), and their goal of becoming a listed company on a recognized U.S. national exchange, such as NASDAQ
and the NYSE. 

While
there are several alternatives for companies seeking to go public and trade on the U.S. OTC markets, we primarily focus on three methods: 

Registration
 Statement on Form S-1 

Regulation
 A+ offering 

The
 Form 10 shell company 

The
manner in which the OTC markets are structured provides companies the ability to uplist in the marketplace as they provide
better transparency. These OTC markets include: 

OTCQX
 Best Marketplace: offers transparent and efficient trading of established investor-focused U.S. and global companies. 

OTCQB
 Venture Marketplace: for early-stage and developing U.S. and international companies that are not yet able to qualify for OTCQX.

OTC
 Pink Open Marketplace: offers trading in a wide spectrum of securities through any broker. With no minimum financial standards, this
 market includes foreign companies that limit their disclosure, penny stocks and shells, as well as distressed, delinquent, and dark
 companies not willing or able to provide adequate information to investors. 

We
act as a case reference for our clients, as we originally had our shares quoted in the OTC markets and subsequently uplisted 
to The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC., a U.S. national securities exchange. 

18 

With
growing competition and increasing economic sophistication, we believe more companies need strategies for cross-border restructuring
and other corporate matters. Our plan is to bundle our Cross-Border Business Solution services with our cloud accounting solutions and
Accounting Outsourcing Services described below. 

Accounting
Outsourcing Services 

We
intend to develop relationships with professional firms from Hong Kong, Malaysia, China, and Thailand that can provide company secretarial,
business centers and virtual offices, book-keeping, tax compliance and planning, payroll management, business valuation, and wealth management
services to our clients. We intend to include local accounting firms within this network to provide general accounting, financial evaluation
and advisory services to our clients. Our expectation is that firms within our professional network will refer their international clients
to us that may need our book-keeping, payroll, company secretarial and tax compliance services. We believe that this accounting outsourcing
service arrangement will be beneficial to our clients by providing a convenient, one-stop firm for their local and international business
and financial compliance and governance needs. 

Our
Service Rates 

We
intend to have a two-tiered rate system based upon the type of services being offered. We may impose project-based fees, where we charge
10 - 25 of the revenues generated by the client on projects that are completed using our services, such as transaction projects, contract
compliance projects, and business planning projects. We may also charge a flat rate fee or fixed fee based on the estimated complexity
and timing of a project when our professionals provide specified expertise to our clients on a project. For example, for our Cross-Border
Business Solutions services, we plan to charge our client a monthly fixed fee. 

Our
Venture Capital Business Segment 

Venture
Capital Investment 

As
a result of our acquisition of Greenpro Venture Capital Limited GVCL in 2015, we entered a venture capital business in
Hong Kong with a focus on companies located in South-East Asia and East Asia, including Hong Kong, Malaysia, China, Thailand and Singapore.
Our venture capital business is focused on (1) establishing a business incubator for start-up and high growth companies to support such
companies during critical growth periods and (2) investment opportunities in select start-ups and high growth companies. 

We
believe that a company s life cycle can be divided into five stages, including the seed stage, start-up stage, expansion stage,
mature stage and decline stage. We anticipate that most of a company s funding needs will occur during these first three stages. 

Seed
 stage: Financing is needed for assets, and research and development of an initial business concept. The company usually has relatively
 low costs in developing the business idea. The ownership model is considered and implemented. 

Start-up
 stage: Financing is needed for product development and initial marketing. Firms in this phase may be in the process of setting up
 a business or they might have been in operating the business for a short period of time but may not have sold their products commercially.
 In this phase, costs are increasing due to product development, market research and the need to recruit personnel. Low levels of
 revenues are starting to generate. 

Expansion
 stage: Financing is needed for growth and expansion. Capital may be used to finance increased production capacity, product, or marketing
 development or to hire additional personnel. In the early expansion phase, sales, and production increases but there is not yet any
 profit. In the later expansion stage, the business typically needs extra capital in addition to organically generated profit, for
 further development, marketing, or product development. 

19 

We
intend for our business incubators to provide valuable support to young, emerging growth and potential high growth companies at critical
junctures of their development. For example, our incubators will offer office space at a below market rental rate. We will also provide
our expertise, business contacts, introductions, and other resources to assist their development and growth. Depending on each individual
circumstance, we may also take an active advisory role in our venture capital companies including board representation, strategic marketing,
corporate governance, and capital structuring. We believe that there will be potential investment opportunities for us in these start-up
companies. 

Our
business processes for our investment strategy in select start-up and high growth companies are as follows: 

Step
 1. Generating Deal Flow: We expect to actively search for entrepreneurial firms and to generate deal flow through our business incubator
 and the personal contacts of our executive team. We also anticipate that entrepreneurs will approach us for financing. 

Step
 2. Investment Decision: We will evaluate, examine and engage in due diligence of a prospective portfolio company, including but not
 limited to product/services viability, market potential and integrity as well as capability of the management. After that, both parties
 arrive at an agreed value for the deal. Following that is a process of negotiation which, if successful, ends with capital transformation
 and restructuring. 

Step
 3. Business Development and Value Adding: In addition to capital contribution, we expect to provide expertise, knowledge and relevant
 business contacts to the company. 

Step
 4. Exit: There are several ways to exit an investment in a company. Common exits are: 

IPO
 (Initial Public Offering): The company s shares are offered in a public sale on an established securities market. 

Trade
 sale (Acquisition): The entire company is sold to another company. 

Secondary
 sale: The company s firm sells only part of its shares. 

Buyback
 or MBO: Either the entrepreneur or the management of the company buys back the company s shares of the firm. 

Reconstruction,
 liquidation or bankruptcy: If the project fails, the company will restructure or close down its operations. 

Our
objective is to achieve a superior rate of return through the eventual and timely disposal of investments. We expect to look for businesses
that meet the following criteria: 

high
 growth prospects 

ambitious
 teams 

viability
 of product or service 

experienced
 management 

ability
 to convert plans into reality 

justification
 of venture capital investment and investment criteria 

20 

Our
Venture Capital Related Education and Support Services. 

In
addition to providing venture capital services through GVCL, we also provide educational and support services that we believe will be
synergistic with our venture capital business. We have arranged seminars called the CEO Business Owners Strategic Session CBOSS in Malaysia and Singapore for business owners who are interested in the following: 

Developing
 their business globally; 

Expanding
 business with increased capital funding; 

Creating
 a sustainable SME business model; 

Accelerating
 the growth of the business; or 

Significantly
 increasing company cash flows. 

The
objective of the CBOSS seminar is to educate the chief executive officers or business owners on how to acquire smart capital 
and the considerations involved. The seminar includes an introduction to the basic concepts of smart capital, wealth
and value creation, recommendation and planning and similar topics. We believe that this seminar will synergistically support
our venture capital business segment. 

Sales
and Marketing 

We
plan to deploy three strategies to market the Greenpro brand: leadership, market segmentation and sales management process development. 

Building
 Brand Image: Greenpro s marketing efforts will focus on building the image of our extensive expertise and knowledge of
 our professionals. We intend to conduct a marketing campaign through media visibility, seminars, webinars, and the creation of a
 wide variety of white papers, newsletters, books, and other information. 

Market
 segmentation: We plan to devote marketing resources to highly measurable and high return on investment tactics that specifically
 target those industries and areas where Greenpro has particularly deep experience and capabilities. These efforts typically involve
 local, regional, or national trade show and event sponsorships, targeted direct mail, email, and telemarketing campaigns, and practice
 and industry specific micro-sites and newsletters in the Asian region. 

Social
 Media: We plan to begin a social media campaign utilizing blogs, Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn after we secure sufficient financing.
 A targeted campaign will be made to the following groups of clients: law firms, auditing firms, consulting firms and small to medium-sized
 enterprises SMEs in different industries, including biotechnology, intellectual property, information technologies
 and real estate. 

21 

Worldwide
Wealth Wisdom Development 

Worldwide
Wealth Wisdom Development WWW is our marketing and promotional campaign, which is focused on building long-term awareness
of our brand. WWW targets the following markets (i) business owners and senior management; (ii) high and medium net worth individuals
in China and (iii) financial services providers, such as Certified Financial Planners in China. The campaign involves sharing content,
knowledge and information about wealth management, including wealth creation, wealth protection and wealth succession. 

The
objectives of WWW are: 

1. 
 To
 increase public awareness and recognition of Greenpro as a well-known advocate of the wealth principles described above; 

2. 
 For
 our philosophy to gain recognition so that our clients are confident and comfortable with our services and trust us; 

3. 
 To
 educate existing clients and potential prospects; and 

4. 
 To
 act as a channel of communication to gather market data and feedback. 

Set
forth below are the marketing strategies we expect to develop. 

Awareness
and Optimization 

1. 
 Email
 Blasts and E-Newsletter 

Email
blasts are one of the commonly used tactics to disseminate information. Our email database will be collected through leads generated
by online marketing (social media) and promotional events. Future event invitations and monthly/quarterly newsletters will be sent to
the email database to boost event participation and provide updates on Company development. 

2. 
 Media
 PR and News Releases 

Our
post event information will be sent to news and media platforms as part of our publicity effort to increase public awareness about our
events and developments, and to encourage more participants to join our upcoming events. We will also share our analysis on various industries
and industry trends to the media network providers for free. We believe that this strategy will strengthen the relationship between Greenpro
and the media network providers. 

3. 
 Social
 Media 

To
generate more leads and subscribers, two to four articles related to wealth management will be shared in our official WeChat account.
These articles are tools we use to share content online, through social media platforms such as WeChat, Jinri Toutiao and Facebook, which
increases our online presence. 

4. 
 Online
 Search Engine Optimization 

Online
Search Engine Optimization SEO will be used as a supporting strategy to enhance our online presence campaign. We will
seek a SEO expert team in China and Malaysia to assist in the promotion of the campaign by using an advertising and keyword tagging strategy
to drive traffic to our social media accounts and our company website. The major search engines are Baidu and Google as these are the
common search engine worldwide. 

22 

Interaction
and Conversion 

1. 
 Seminars
 and Conferences 

Seminars
and conferences will be held once a month to deliver and educate the attendees on wealth management. We target between 80 and 100 attendees
each time. We intend to invite professionals and strategic partners to share their ideas, resources and knowhow in the seminars and conferences.
The seminars and conferences will focus on our three core wealth management principles, namely Wealth Creation, Wealth Protection
and Wealth Succession . 

2. 
 Private
 Events by Invitation 

Private
and exclusive events are planned to be held quarterly with a target between 30 and 40 attendees. These events are exclusive and by-invitation
only, at which we will share insights into our services and explain to attendees how they can proceed with wealth management planning. 

3. 
 Small
 Group Meet Ups and Networking 

Small
Group Meet Ups will be held twice a month targeting the public with an estimated five to ten attendees per session. The objective of
these sessions is to encourage idea exchanges, to provide a platform for networking and potentially future collaboration opportunities,
and foster better understanding between the participants and us, as well as among themselves. 

Market
Opportunities 

We
believe the main drivers for the growth of our business are the products and services together with the resources such as an office network,
professional staff members and operational tools to make the advisory and consulting business more competitive. 

We
intend to assist our clients in the preparation of their financial statements cost-effectively and provide security to such financial
information since the data will be stored in a cloud system. We anticipate a market with growing needs in Asia. We believe that there
is currently an increasing need for enterprises in different industries to maximize their performance with cost-effective methods. We
believe our services will create numerous competitive advantages for our clients. We believe that with us handling the administrative
and logistic support, our clients can focus on developing their businesses and expanding their own client portfolio. 

Customers 

Our
revenues are generated from clients located globally, including those from Hong Kong, China, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand,
Australia, Japan, Taiwan, Russia and the United States. Our venture capital business will initially focus on Hong Kong and other Asian
start-ups and high growth companies. We hope to generate deal flow through personal contacts of our management team as well as through
our business incubator. 

We
generated revenues of 3,673,997 during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, and 2,949,780 during the fiscal year ended December
31, 2021. We are not a party to any long-term agreements with our customers. 

Competition 

We
operate in a mature, competitive industry. We consider our focus to be on a niche market of small and medium-sized businesses. Competition
in the general field of business advisory services is quite intense, particularly in Hong Kong. We face competition principally from
established law firms and consulting service providers in the corporate finance industry, such as Marbury, King Wood Mallesons,
QMIS Financial Group, First Asia Finance Group Limited and their respective affiliates, as well as from certain accounting firms, including
those that specialize in a tax planning and corporate restructuring. The competition in China and Malaysia is not as fierce as in Hong
Kong. Our major competitors in China are JP Investment Group and QMIS Financial Group while our major competitors in Malaysia are Global
Bridge Management Sdn. Bhd. and QMIS Financial Group. These competitors generate significant traffic and have established brand recognition
and financial resources. New or existing competition that uses a business model that is different from our business model may pressure
us to change so that we can remain competitive. 

We
believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include quality of analysis; applicability and efficacy of recommendations;
strength and depth of relationships with clients; ability to meet the changing needs of current and prospective clients; and service
scope. By utilizing our competitive strengths, we believe that we have a competitive edge over other competitors due to the breadth of
our service offerings, one stop convenience, pricing, marketing expertise, coverage network, service levels, track record, brand, and
reputation. We are confident we can retain and enlarge our market share. 

23 

Intellectual
Property 

We
intend to protect our investment in the research and development of our products and technologies. We intend to seek the widest possible
protection for significant product and process developments in our major markets through a combination of trade secrets, trademarks,
copyrights, and patents, if applicable. We anticipate that the form of protection will vary depending upon the level of protection afforded
by a particular jurisdiction. Currently, our revenue is derived principally from our operations in Hong Kong, China and Malaysia, where
intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce. In such instances, we may seek protection of our intellectual
property through measures taken to increase the confidentiality of intellectual property. 

We
have registered trademarks as a means of protecting the brand names of our companies and products. We intend to protect our trademarks
against infringement, and also seek to register design protection where appropriate. Currently, there are six trademarks registered under
the name of Greenpro Resources (HK) Limited.

We
rely on trade secrets and un-patentable know-how that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements. Our policy is to require
all employees to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment with us. These agreements provide that all confidential
information developed or made known to the individual through individual s relationship with us, to be kept confidential and do
not disclose to third parties except in specific circumstances. The agreements also provide that all inventions conceived by the individual
while rendering services to us shall be assigned to us as the exclusive property of our company. There can be no assurance, however,
that all persons who we desire to sign such agreements will sign, or if they do, that these agreements will not be breached, that we
would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets or un-patentable know-how will not otherwise become known or be
independently developed by competitors. 

Government
Regulation 

We
provide our Package Solution initially in Hong Kong, China and Malaysia, which we believe are locations that would need outsourcing support
services. Further, we believe these markets are the central and regional markets for many customers doing cross border business in Asia.
We target those customers from Asia doing international business and plan to provide our Package Solution to meet their needs. Our planned
Package Solution will be structured in Hong Kong, but services may be outsourced to lower cost jurisdictions such as Malaysia and China,
which encourage and welcome outsourcing services. 

24 

The
following regulations are the laws and regulations that may be applicable to us: 

Hong
Kong 

Our
businesses located in Hong Kong are subject to the general laws in Hong Kong governing businesses, including labor, occupational safety
and health, general corporations, intellectual property and other similar laws. Because our website is maintained through the server
in Hong Kong, we expect that we will be required to comply with the rules and regulations and Hong Kong governing the data usage and
regular terms of service applicable to our potential customers. As the information of our potential customers is preserved in Hong Kong,
we will need to comply with the Hong Kong Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Cap 486). 

The
Employment Ordinance is the main piece of legislation governing conditions of employment in Hong Kong. It covers a comprehensive range
of employment protection and benefits for employees, including Wage Protection, Rest Days, Holiday Pay, Paid Annual Leave, Sickness Allowance,
Maternity Protection, Statutory Paternity Leave, Severance Payment, Long Service Payment, Employment Protection, Termination of Employment
Contract and Protection against Anti-Union Discrimination. 

An
employer must also comply with all legal obligations under the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance, (Cap 485). These include enrolling
all qualifying employees in Mandatory Provident Fund MPF schemes and making MPF contributions for them. Except for exempt
persons, employers should enroll both full-time and part-time employees who are at least 18 but under 65 years of age in an MPF scheme
within the first 60 days of employment. The 60-day employment rule does not apply to casual employees in the construction and catering
industries. 

We
are required to make MPF contributions for our Hong Kong employees once every contribution period (generally the wage period). Employers
and employees are each required to make regular mandatory contributions of 5 of the employee s relevant income to an MPF scheme,
subject to the minimum and maximum relevant income levels. For a monthly-paid employee, the minimum and maximum relevant income levels
are 7,100 and 30,000 respectively. 

We
comply with the above applicable ordinances and regulations in Hong Kong and have not been involved any lawsuit or prosecuted by the
local authority resulting from any breach of the ordinances and regulations. 

Malaysia 

Our
businesses located in Malaysia are subject to the general laws in Malaysia governing businesses including labor, occupational safety
and health, general corporations, intellectual property and other similar laws including the Computer Crime Act 1997 and The Copyright
(Amendment) Act 1997. We believe that the focus of these laws is censorship in Malaysia, however we believe this does not impact our
businesses because the censorship focus is on media controls and does not relate to cloud base technology which we plan to use. 

Our
real estate investments are subject to extensive local, city, county and state rules and regulations regarding permitting, zoning, subdivision,
utilities and water quality as well as federal rules and regulations regarding air and water quality and protection of endangered species
and their habitats. Such regulation may result in higher than anticipated administrative and operational costs. 

We
comply with the above applicable ordinances and regulations in Malaysia and have not involved any lawsuit or prosecuted by the local
authority resulting from any breach of the ordinances and regulations.

safety and health, general corporations, intellectual property and other similar laws.

Employment
Contracts 

The
Employment Contract Law was promulgated by the National People s Congress Standing Committee on June 29, 2007, and took
effect on January 1, 2008. The Employment Contract Law governs labor relations and employment contracts (including the entry into, performance,
amendment, termination, and determination of employment contracts) between domestic enterprises (including foreign-invested companies),
individual economic organizations and private non-enterprise units (collectively referred to as the employers and their
employees 

a.
Execution of employment contracts 

Under
the Employment Contract Law, an employer is required to execute written employment contracts with its employees within one month from
the commencement of employment. In the event of contravention, an employee is entitled to receive double salary for the period during
which the employer fails to execute an employment contract. If an employer fails to execute an employment contract for more than 12 months
from the commencement of the employee s employment, an employment contract would be deemed to have been entered into between the
employer and employee for a non-fixed term. 

b.
Right to non-fixed term contracts 

Under
the Employment Contract Law, an employee may request a non-fixed term contract without an employer s consent to renew. In addition,
an employee is also entitled to a non-fixed term contract with an employer if he has completed two fixed term employment contracts with
such employer; however, such employee must not have committed any breach or have been subject to any disciplinary actions during his
employment. Unless the employee requests to enter into a fixed term contract, an employer who fails to enter into a non-fixed term contract
pursuant to the Employment Contract Law is liable to pay the employee double salary from the date the employment contract is renewed. 

c.
Compensation for termination or expiry of employment contracts 

Under
the Employment Contract Law, employees are entitled to compensation upon the termination or expiry of an employment contract. Employees
are entitled to compensation even in the event the employer (i) has been declared bankrupt; (ii) has its business license revoked; (iii)
has been ordered to cease or withdraw its business; or (iv) has been voluntarily liquidated. Where an employee has been employed for
more than one year, the employee will be entitled to such compensation equivalent to one month s salary for every completed year
of service. Where an employee has been employed for less than one year, such employee will be deemed to have completed one full year
of service. 

d.
Trade union and collective employment contracts 

Under
the Employment Contract Law, a trade union may seek arbitration and litigation to resolve any dispute arising from a collective employment
contract provided that such dispute failed to be settled through negotiations. The Employment Contract Law also permits a trade union
to enter into a collective employee contract with an employer on behalf of all the employees. 

Where
a trade union has not been formed, a representative appointed under the recommendation of a high-level trade union may execute the collective
employment contract. Within districts below county level, collective employment contracts for industries such as those engaged in construction,
mining, food and beverage and those from the service sector, etc., may be executed on behalf of employees by the representatives from
the trade union of each respective industry. Alternatively, a district-based collective employment contract may be made. 

As
a result of the Employment Contract Law, all our employees have executed standard written employment agreements with us. We have not
experienced any significant labor disputes or any difficulties in recruiting staff for our operations. 

26 

On
October 28, 2010, the National People s Congress of China promulgated the PRC Social Insurance Law, which became effective on July
1, 2011. In accordance with the PRC Social Insurance Law, the Interim Regulations on the Collection and Payment of Social Security Fund
and other relevant laws and regulations, China establishes a social insurance system including basic pension insurance, basic medical
insurance, work-related injury insurance, unemployment insurance and maternity insurance. An employer shall pay the social insurance
for its employees in accordance with the rates provided under relevant regulations and shall withhold the social insurance that should
be assumed by the employees. The authorities in charge of social insurance may request an employer s compliance and impose sanctions
if such employer fails to pay and withhold social insurance in a timely manner. Under the Regulations on the Administration of Housing
Fund effective in 1999, as amended in 2002, PRC companies must register with applicable housing fund management centers and establish
a special housing fund account in an entrusted bank. Both PRC companies and their employees are required to contribute to the housing
funds. 

The
Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security promulgated the Interim Provisions on Labor Dispatch on January 24, 2014. The Interim
Provisions on Labor Dispatch, which became effective on March 1, 2014, sets forth that labor dispatch should only be applicable to temporary,
auxiliary or substitute positions. Temporary positions shall mean positions subsisting for no more than six months, auxiliary positions
shall mean positions of non-major business that serve positions of major businesses, and substitute positions shall mean positions that
can be held by substitute employees for a certain period of time during which the employees who originally hold such positions are unable
to work as a result of full-time study, being on leave or other reasons. The Interim Provisions further provides that, the number of
the dispatched workers of an employer shall not exceed 10 of its total workforce, and the total workforce of an employer shall refer
to the sum of the number of the workers who have executed labor contracts with the employer and the number of workers who are dispatched
to the employer. 

Foreign
Exchange Control and Administration 

Foreign
exchange in China is primarily regulated by: 

The
 Foreign Currency Administration Rules (1996), as amended; and 

The
 Administration Rules of the Settlement, Sale and Payment of Foreign Exchange (1996), or the Administration Rules. 

Under
the Foreign Currency Administration Rules, if documents certifying the purposes of the conversion of RMB into foreign currency are submitted
to the relevant foreign exchange conversion bank, the RMB will be convertible for current account items, including the distribution of
dividends, interest and royalty payments, and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions. Conversion of RMB for capital
account items, such as direct investment, loans, securities investment and repatriation of investment, however, is subject to the approval
of SAFE or its local counterpart. 

Under
the Administration Rules for the Settlement, Sale and Payment of Foreign Exchange, foreign-invested enterprises may only buy, sell and/or
remit foreign currencies at banks authorized to conduct foreign exchange business after providing valid commercial documents and, in
the case of capital account item transactions, obtaining approval from SAFE or its local counterpart. 

As
an offshore holding company with PRC subsidiaries, we may (i) make additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries, (ii) establish
new PRC subsidiaries and make capital contributions to these new PRC subsidiaries, (iii) make loans to our PRC subsidiaries or consolidated
affiliated entities, or (iv) acquire offshore entities with business operations in China in offshore transactions. However, most of these
uses are subject to PRC regulations and approvals. For example: 

Capital
 contributions to our PRC subsidiaries, whether existing or newly established ones, must be approved by the Ministry of Commerce or
 its local counterparts; 

Loans
 by us to our PRC subsidiaries, each of which is a foreign-invested enterprise, to finance their activities cannot exceed statutory
 limits and must be registered with SAFE or its local branches; and 

Loans
 by us to our consolidated affiliated entities, which are domestic PRC entities, must be approved by the National Development and
 Reform Commission and must also be registered with SAFE or its local branches. 

27 

On
August 29, 2008, SAFE promulgated the Circular on the Relevant Operating Issues concerning the Improvement of the Administration of Payment
and Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign-invested Enterprises, or Circular 142 . 

On
March 30, 2015, SAFE issued the Circular of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange Concerning Reform of the Administrative Approaches
to Settlement of Foreign Exchange Capital of Foreign-invested Enterprises, or Circular 19 , which became effective on June
1, 2015, to regulate the conversion by foreign invested enterprises, or FIEs, of foreign currency into RMB by restricting how the converted
RMB may be used. Circular 19 requires that RMB converted from the foreign currency-dominated capital of a FIE shall be managed under
the Accounts for FX settlement and pending payment. The expenditure scope of such Accounts includes expenditure within the business scope,
payment of funds for domestic equity investment and RMB deposits, repayment of the RMB loans after completed utilization and so forth. 

A
FIE shall truthfully use its capital by itself within the business scope and shall not, directly or indirectly, use its capital or RMB
converted from the foreign currency-dominated capital for (i) expenditure beyond its business scope or expenditure prohibited by laws
or regulations, (ii) disbursing RMB entrusted loans (unless permitted under its business scope), repaying inter-corporate borrowings
(including third-party advance) and repaying RMB bank loans already refinanced to any third party. Where a FIE, other than a foreign-invested
investment company, foreign-invested venture capital enterprise or foreign-invested equity investment enterprise, makes domestic equity
investment by transferring its capital in the original currency, it shall obey the current provisions on domestic re-investment. Where
such a FIE makes domestic equity investment by its RMB conversion, the invested enterprise shall first go through domestic re-investment
registration and open a corresponding Accounts for FX settlement and pending payment, and the FIE shall thereafter transfer the conversion
to the aforesaid Account according to the actual amount of investment. 

In
addition, according to the Regulations of the People s Republic of China on Foreign Exchange Administration, which became effective
on August 5, 2008, the use of foreign exchange or RMB conversion may not be changed without authorization. 

Violations
of the applicable circulars and rules may result in severe penalties, including substantial fines as set forth in the Foreign Exchange
Administration Regulations. 

In
light of the various requirements imposed by PRC regulations on loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies,
we cannot assure you that we will always be able to complete the necessary government registrations or obtain the necessary government
approvals on a timely basis, if at all, with respect to future loans to our PRC subsidiaries or future capital contributions by us to
our PRC subsidiaries. If we fail to complete such registrations or obtain such approvals, our ability to capitalize or otherwise fund
our PRC operations may be negatively affected, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and
expand our business. 

Currently,
we are following the above applicable ordinances and regulations in China and have not involved any lawsuit or prosecuted by the local
authority resulting from any breach of the ordinances and regulations. 

Insurance 

We
do not current maintain property, business interruption and casualty insurance. As our business matures, we expect to obtain such insurance
in accordance with customary industry practices in Malaysia, Hong Kong and China, as applicable. 

Seasonality 

Our
businesses are not subject to seasonality.

length of service with the Company. For the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, the contributions were 36,593 and 35,977, respectively. 

We
are required to contribute to the Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) for all eligible employees in Hong Kong between the ages of 18 and 65.
We are required to contribute a specified percentage of the participant s income based on their ages and wage level. For the years
ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, the MPF contributions by the Company were 22,025 and 25,663, respectively. We have not experienced
any significant labor disputes or any difficulties in recruiting staff for our operations. 

We
are required to contribute to the Social Insurance Schemes and Housing Fund Schemes for all eligible employees in PRC. For the years
ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, the contributions were 47,901 and 44,603, respectively.

Future
Development Plan 

We
are in the process of carrying out the following development plans. 

1. 
 Expansion
 of Corporate Finance Services: 

We
plan to further expand our corporate finance services business. Our corporate finance services include financial advisory services relating
to listings in the US capital markets (e.g., NASDAQ and OTC Markets) and listings in Hong Kong, mergers and acquisitions, investment
valuation, project management and other financial advisory services. We intend to enhance our corporate finance business in China, Hong
Kong, Malaysia and Thailand, by engaging in more marketing activities and expanding our business network to these regions. 

2. 
 ADAQ
 Development: 

ADAQ
is a next generation online financial information platform which facilitates connecting private high growth emerging companies with access
to potential investors and synergetic companies. ADAQ is dedicated to equip emerging growth companies in the Asia Pacific region with
the guidance and information to identify, build and stream their sustainable core values. In addition, it offers an acceleration program
to incubate and assist companies to accelerate the process by which they seek to list on international exchanges such as New York Stock
Exchange NYSE ), NASDAQ and Hong Kong Stock Exchange HKEX ). 

ADAQ
 has three major functions: 

1.
Corporate Value Building Program 

 2.
Online platform and acceleration process to International Capital Market Listing 

 3.
Online Financial Information Market 

We
intend to strengthen the development of ADAQ as an acceleration platform to assist high growth emerging companies in the ASEAN regions
covering Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam, and China to obtain funding and prepare for an IPO. An
increasing number of companies across South-East Asia and the Greater Bay Area are interested in listing on the ADAQ market platform.
We believe the successful development of the platform will heighten the prospects of Greenpro s venture capital projects, aiming
to achieve success and to widen market coverage to source for new potential projects. 

Wealth
 Management Portfolio Development. The increase in the number of high-net-worth individuals in the Asia Pacific Region has created
 opportunities and needs for cross-border wealth management services. Leveraging our competitive advantages with integrated financial
 services and strategic offices, we look forward to enhancing our strategic development in wealth management, fund management and
 asset management businesses. We continue to look for partnerships to explore the potential of wealth management, fund management
 and asset management services, and provide with the assistance from our affiliates customized wealth creation, wealth protection
 and wealth succession solutions for medium, high and ultra-high net worth individuals/families in the Asian region. We also expect
 to place more efforts into the development of our Wealth Network Database focusing on wealth related information sharing. 

For
our long-term plan and development, we look forward to initiating the Greenpro Capital Tower plan in ASEAN as an effort
to further develop our brand, strengthen our operational and client base with stronger customers and market confidence. In addition,
we plan to continue to grow through mergers and acquisitions of related services to enhance our services horizontally and vertically.
We are continuously sourcing synergetic and licensed financial institutions to strengthen our capabilities and scope of our services
with the aim to widen our market coverage.

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

You
should carefully consider the risks described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, which could materially and adversely affect
our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our business faces significant risks and the risks described below may not
be the only risks we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may materially affect
our business, results of operations, or financial condition. If any of these risks occur, the trading price of our Common Stock could
be decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. 

COVID-19
Pandemic 

Our
business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by global health epidemics, including the
recent COVID-19 outbreak. 

Outbreaks
of epidemic, pandemic, or contagious diseases such as COVID-19, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and
results of operations. The spread of COVID-19 from China to other countries has resulted in the World Health Organization declaring the
outbreak of COVID-19 as a global pandemic. The international stock markets reflect the uncertainty associated with the slow-down in the
global economy and the reduced levels of international travel experienced since the beginning of January 2020, large declines in oil
prices and the significant decline in the Dow Industrial Average at the end of February and beginning of March 2020 was largely attributed
to the effects of COVID-19. 

More
specifically our business was affected to a large extent by a shut-down of operations both for ourselves and our clients for much of
2020 and the first half of 2021. Total revenue for fiscal year 2022 was 3,673,997 compared to 2,949,780 for fiscal year 2021. The
increase year over year is largely attributable to the growth in the provision of business services, which mainly comprise business consulting
and advisory services as well as company secretarial, accounting and financial analysis services. When nation-wide shutdowns were mandated
the first half of 2020, there was a corresponding decline in demand for our business services. When business gradually resumed beginning
the latter half 2020, we saw a corresponding increase in orders of our business services. 

The
full extent of the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be reasonably estimated at this time and the pandemic is still ongoing.
The extent to which the COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted,
including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and its variants and the actions taken globally
to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, the efficacy of vaccines on COVID-19 and its variants, among others. Existing insurance
coverage may not provide protection for all costs that may arise from all such possible events. 

Additionally,
the COVID-19 pandemic may also affect our overall ability to react timely to mitigate the impact of this event and may hamper our efforts
to contact our service providers and advisors and to provide our investors with timely information and comply with our filing obligations
with the SEC, especially in the event of office closures, stay-in-place orders and a ban on travel or quarantines. We are still assessing
our business operations and the impact COVID-19 may have on our results and financial condition, but there can be no assurance that this
analysis will enable us to avoid part or all of any impact from the spread of COVID-19 or its consequences, including downturns in business
sentiment generally or in our sector in particular. 

Risks
Related to our Business 

We
have a limited operating history that you can use to evaluate us, and the likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the
problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered by a small developing company. 

We
were incorporated in Nevada in July 2013. For the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, we generated revenues of 3,673,997 and 2,949,780
and incurred net losses of 6,262,188 and 14,363,232, respectively. The likelihood of our success must be considered in the light of
the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications, and delays frequently encountered by a small company starting a new business enterprise
and the highly competitive environment in which we are operating. We have a limited operating history upon which an evaluation of our
future success or failure can be made. Our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon: 

our
 ability to market our product and services; 

our
 ability to generate revenues; and 

our
 ability to raise the capital necessary to continue marketing and developing our product. 

We
are not currently profitable and may not become profitable. 

As
of December 31, 2022, we recorded a negative cash flow of 2,402,769 in operating activities. We incurred an operating loss of 1,518,503
and a net loss of 6,262,188 for the year ended December 31, 2022. We expect to incur losses and negative operating cash flows for the
foreseeable future, and we may not achieve profitability. We also expect to experience negative cash flow for the foreseeable future
due to operating losses and capital expenditures. As a result, we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and maintain
profitability. We may not be able to generate these revenues or achieve profitability in the future. Our failure to achieve or maintain
profitability could negatively impact the value of our business. 

31 

We
may not be able to continue to operate as a going concern. 

For
the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred a net loss of 6,262,188 and used cash in operating activities of 2,402,769.
In addition, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, in their report on the Company s December 31, 2022,
audited financial statements, raised substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These factors
raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that the financial
statements are issued. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue
as a going concern. 

The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon improving its profitability and the continuing financial support
from its major shareholders. Management believes the existing shareholders or external financing will provide the additional cash to
meet the Company s obligations as they become due. No assurance can be given that any future financing, if needed, will be available
or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company can obtain additional financing,
if necessary, it may contain undue restrictions on its operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for its
stockholders, in the case of equity financing. 

Our
operating results may prove unpredictable which could negatively affect our profit. 

Our
operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which we have no control.
Factors that may cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly include: our inability to generate enough working capital from
future equity sales; the level of commercial acceptance by clients of our services; fluctuations in the demand for our service the amount
and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure and general
economic conditions. If realized, any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating
results. 

If
we are unable to gain any significant market acceptance for our service or establish a significant market presence, we may be unable
to generate sufficient revenue to continue our business. 

Our
growth strategy is substantially dependent upon our ability to successfully market our service to prospective clients. However, our planned
services may not achieve significant acceptance. Such acceptance, if achieved, may not be sustained for any significant period of time.
Failure of our services to achieve or sustain market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions
and the results of our operations. 

Management s
ability to implement the business strategy may be slower than expected and we may be unable to generate a profit. 

Our
business plans, including offering a cloud accounting system and consulting services, may not occur. Our growth strategy is subject to
significant risks which you should carefully consider before purchasing our shares. 

Our
services may be slow to achieve profitability, or may not become profitable at all, which will result in losses. There can be no assurance
that we will succeed. 

We
may be unable to enter into our intended markets successfully. The factors that could affect our growth strategy include our success
in (a) developing our business plan, (b) obtaining our clients, (c) obtaining adequate financing on acceptable terms, and (d) adapting
our internal controls and operating procedures to accommodate our future growth. 

Our
systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support the expansion of our business operations. Significant growth will place
managerial demands on all aspects of our operations. Our future operating results will depend substantially upon our ability to manage
changing business conditions and to implement and improve our technical, administrative and financial controls and reporting systems. 

32 

Competitors
may enter this sector with superior service which would affect our business adversely. 

We
believe that barriers to entry are low to medium because of economies of scale, cost advantage and brand identity. Potential competitors
may enter this sector with superior services. This would have an adverse effect upon our business and our results of operations. In addition,
a high level of support is critical for the successful marketing and recurring sales of our services. Despite having accumulated customers
from the past four years, we may still need to continue to improve our platform and software to assist potential customers in using our
platform, and we also need to provide effective support to future clients. If we are unable to increase customer support and improve
our platform in the face of increasing competition, with the increase in competition, our ability to sell our services to potential customers
could adversely affect our brand, which would harm our reputation. 

Our
use of open source and third-party software could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our services. 

We
intend to incorporate open-source software into our platform. Although we monitor our use of open source closely, the terms of many open-source
licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts or jurisdictions elsewhere, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed
in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our services. We could also be
subject to similar conditions or restrictions should there be any changes in the licensing terms of the open-source software incorporated
into our products. In either event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue our services in the event re-engineering
cannot be accomplished on a timely or successful basis, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial
condition. 

We
also intend to incorporate certain third-party technologies, including software programs, into our website and may need to utilize additional
third-party technologies in the future. However, licenses to relevant third-party technology may not continue to be available to us on
commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Therefore, we could face delays in releases of our platform until equivalent technology can
be identified, licensed or developed, and integrated into our current products. These delays, if they occur, could materially adversely
affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Any disruption in our access to software programs or third-party technologies
could result in significant delays in releases of our platform and could require substantial effort to locate or develop a replacement
program. If we decide in the future to incorporate into our products any other software program licensed from a third party, and the
use of such software program is necessary for the proper operation of our appliances, then our loss of any such license would similarly
adversely affect our ability to release our products in a timely fashion. 

The
security of our computer systems may be compromised and harm our business. 

A
significant portion of our business operations is conducted through use of our computer network. Although we intend to implement security
systems and procedures to protect the confidential information stored on these computer systems, experienced computer programmers and
hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties. As well,
they may be able to create system disruptions, shutdowns or effect denial of service attacks. Computer programmers and hackers also may
be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our networks or client computers, or
otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities, or that misappropriate and distribute confidential information stored on these computer
systems. Any of the foregoing could result in damage to our reputation and customer confidence in the security of our products and services
and could require us to incur significant costs to eliminate or alleviate the problem. Additionally, our ability to transact business
may be affected. Such damage, expenditures and business interruption could seriously impact our business, financial condition and results
of operations. 

Adverse
developments in our existing areas of operation could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 

Our
operations focus on utilizing the sales efforts which are principally located in South-East Asia and East Asia. As a result, the results
of our operations, cash flows and financial condition depend upon the demand for our services in these regions. Lack of broad diversification
in the industry type and geographic location, adverse developments in our current segment of the midstream industry, or in our existing
areas of operation, could have a greater impact on the results of operations, cash flows and financial condition than if our operations
were more diversified. 

33 

Risks
Related to Doing Business in South-East Asia and East Asia 

Our
business is subject to the risks of international operations. 

Our
business operations are conducted in South-East Asia and East Asia. Accordingly, the results of our operations, financial condition and
prospects are subject to a significant degree to the economic, political and legal conditions of the South-East Asia and East Asia countries
where we intend to develop business. Following the closing of our initial public offering in 2018, we derive a significant portion of
our revenues and earnings from Hong Kong, our principal business place, PRC, Malaysia, and other South-East Asia countries, respectively.
Operation in multiple foreign countries involves substantial risk. For example, our operations and business activities are subject to
a variety of laws and regulations, such as anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions,
data privacy and security requirements, labor laws, intellectual property laws, privacy laws, and anti-competition regulations. As we
expand into additional countries, the complexity inherent in complying with these laws and regulations increases, making compliance more
difficult and costly and driving up the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Any failure to comply with foreign laws and
regulations could subject us to fines and penalties, make it more difficult or impossible to do business in that country and harm our
reputation. 

We
face the risk that changes in the world economy and political developments in Malaysia may adversely affect our business. 

In
recent years, there have been political instabilities in the Malaysian government which may reduce investors confidence, result
in reduction in foreign direct investment and weigh on consumer and business sentiment, depressing growth. In addition, the Malaysian
economy is reliant on external demand. Any possible worsening global demand is likely to hinder the export development and any economic
weakness may possibly lead to market intervention and the government may impose capital controls. Under these circumstances, our business
operation may be adversely affected. 

You
may have difficulty enforcing judgments against us. 

We
are a Nevada corporation but most of our assets are and will be located outside of the United States. Almost all our operations are conducted
in Hong Kong, Malaysia and the PRC. In addition, most of our officers and directors are the nationals and residents of a country other
than the United States. Most of their assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for you to effect
service of process within the United States upon them. It may also be difficult for you to enforce in U.S. courts judgments on the civil
liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against us and our officers and directors, since he or she is not a resident
in the United States. In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of Hong Kong or other Asian countries would recognize
or enforce judgments of U.S. courts. 

Payment
of dividends is subject to restrictions under Nevada, Hong Kong, Malaysia and the PRC laws. 

Under
Nevada law, we may only pay dividends subject to our ability to service our debts as they become due and provided that our assets will
exceed our liabilities after the payment of such dividends. Our ability to pay dividends will therefore depend on our ability to generate
adequate profits. Under the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance, we are permitted to make payments of dividends from distributable profits
(that is, accumulated realized profits less its accumulated realized losses). Under the Laws of Malaysia, we may only make a distribution
to the shareholders out of our profits available if we are solvent. The Company is regarded as solvent if the Company can pay its debts
as and when the debts become due within twelve months immediately after the distribution is made. In addition, because of a variety of
rules applicable to our operations in China and the regulations on foreign investments as well as the applicable tax law, we may be subject
to further limitations on our ability to declare and pay dividends to our shareholders. 

We
can give no assurance that we will declare dividends of any amounts, at any rate or at all in the future. The declaration of future dividends,
if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our future operations and earnings, capital requirements,
general financial conditions, legal and contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant.

Risks
Related to Doing Business in Hong Kong and China 

Introduction
of new laws or changes to existing laws by the PRC government may adversely affect our business. 

The
PRC legal system is a codified legal system made up of written laws, regulations, circulars, administrative directives and internal guidelines.
Unlike common law jurisdictions like the U.S., decided cases (which may be taken as reference) do not form part of the legal structure
of the PRC and thus have no binding effect on subsequent cases with similar issues and fact patterns. Furthermore, in line with its transformation
from a centrally planned economy to a relatively free market economy, the PRC government is still in the process of developing a comprehensive
set of laws and regulations. As the legal system in the PRC is still evolving, laws and regulations or the interpretation of the same
may be subject to further changes. For example, the PRC government may impose restrictions on the amount of service fees that may be
payable by municipal governments to wastewater and sludge treatment service providers. Also, the PRC central and municipal governments
may impose more stringent environmental regulations which would affect our ability to comply with, or our costs to comply with, such
regulations. Such changes, if implemented, may adversely affect our business operations and may reduce our profitability 

We
face the risk that changes in the policies of the PRC government could have a significant impact upon the business we may be able to
conduct in the PRC and the profitability of such business. 

The
PRC s economy is in a transition from a planned economy to a market-oriented economy subject to five-year and annual plans adopted
by the central government that set national economic development goals. Policies of the PRC government can have significant effects on
the economic conditions of the PRC. The PRC government has confirmed that economic development will follow the model of a market economy.
Under this direction, we believe that the PRC will continue to strengthen its economic and trading relationships with foreign countries
and business development in the PRC will follow market forces. While we believe that this trend will continue, we cannot assure you that
this will be the case. A change in policies by the PRC government could adversely affect our interests by, among other factors: changes
in laws, regulations or the interpretation thereof, confiscatory taxation, restrictions on currency conversion, imports or sources of
supplies, or the expropriation or nationalization of private enterprises. Although the PRC government has been pursuing economic reform
policies for more than two decades, we cannot assure you that the government will continue to pursue such policies or that such policies
may not be significantly altered, especially in the event of a change in leadership, social or political disruption, or other circumstances
affecting the PRC s political, economic and social environment. 

The
recent state government interference into business activities on U.S. listed Chinese companies may negatively impact our existing and
future operations in Hong Kong and China. 

Recently,
the Chinese government announced that it would step up supervision of Chinese firms listed offshore. Under the new measures, China will
improve regulation of cross-border data flows and security, crack down on illegal activity in the securities market and punish fraudulent
securities issuance, market manipulation and insider trading, China will also check sources of funding for securities investment and
control leverage ratios. The Cyberspace Administration of China CAC has also opened a cyber-security probe into several
U.S.-listed tech giants focusing on anti-monopoly, financial technology regulation and more recently, with the passage of the Data Security
Law, how companies collect, store, process and transfer data. If our Hong Kong and PRC subsidiaries are subject to such a probe or if
they are required to comply with stepped-up supervisory requirements, valuable time from management and money may be expended in complying
and/or responding to the probe and requirements, thus diverting valuable resources and attention away from our operations. This may,
in turn, negatively impact their operations. 

The
Company is headquartered in Malaysia with operations in Hong Kong and China. The Company is NOT a Chinese operating company but a Malaysian
holding company with operations conducted by its subsidiaries based in China and that this structure involves unique risks to investors.
It does not use variable interest entities in its corporate structure. It provides cross-border business solutions such as tax planning,
trust and wealth management, cross border listing advisory services, transaction services, record management services, and accounting
outsourcing services. One of its venture capital business segments focuses on rental activities of commercial properties and the sale
of investment properties. None of the aforesaid business activities appears to be within the current targeted areas of concern by the
Chinese government. The Company plans to continue to explore future potential business opportunities in the Asia region, in particular
South East Asia. Nonetheless, it intends to keep Hong Kong and China as part of its operating structure going forward and this would
potentially subject it to political and economic influence from China to the extent of such operations. 

Because
of the Company s subsidiaries in Hong Kong and mainland China and its operations there and given the Chinese government s
significant oversight and discretion over the conduct of our Hong Kong and PRC subsidiaries business operations there, there is
always a risk that the Chinese government may, in the future, seek to affect operations of any company with any level of operations in
China including its ability to offer securities to investors, list its securities on a U.S. or other foreign exchange, conduct its business
or accept foreign investment. In light of China s recent extension of authority not only in China but into Hong Kong, there are
risks and uncertainties which it cannot foresee for the time being, and rules and regulations in China can change quickly with little
or no advance notice. The Chinese government may intervene or influence the Company s current and future operations in Hong Kong
and China at any time, or may exert more control over offerings conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in issuers likes ourselves. 

If
any or all of the foregoing were to occur, this could lead to a material change in our Hong Kong and China subsidiaries operations
and/or the value of the Company s Common Stock and/or significantly limit or completely hinder its ability to offer or continue
to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless.

Our
shares may be delisted under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act HFCAA if the PCAOB is unable to inspect our
auditors for three consecutive years beginning in 2021. If the bill passed by the U.S. Senate on June 22, 2021 is passed by the U.S.
House of Representatives and signed into law, this would reduce the number of consecutive non-inspection years required for triggering
the prohibitions under the HFCAA from three years to two. The delisting of our shares, or the threat of their being delisted, may materially
and adversely affect the value of your investment. 

The Holding
Foreign Companies Accountable Act HFCAA was enacted on December 18, 2020. The HFCAA states if the SEC determines that
a company has filed audit reports issued by a registered public accounting firm that has not been subject to inspection by the PCAOB for
three consecutive years beginning in 2021, the SEC shall prohibit the company s shares from being traded on a national securities
exchange or in the over the counter trading market in the U.S. 

On March
24, 2021, the SEC adopted interim final rules relating to the implementation of certain disclosure and documentation requirements of the
HFCAA. A company will be required to comply with these rules if the SEC identifies it as having a non-inspection year under
a process to be subsequently established by the SEC. The SEC is assessing how to implement other requirements of the HFCAA, including
the listing and trading prohibition requirements described above. 

On June
22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed a bill which, if passed by the U.S. House of Representatives and signed into law, would reduce the number
of consecutive non-inspection years required for triggering the prohibitions under the HFCAA from three years to two years. 

On December
2, 2021, the SEC adopted amendments to finalize rules implementing the submission and disclosure requirements in the HFCAA. The rules
apply to registrants the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report with an audit report issued by a registered public accounting
firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate Commission-Identified Issuers ).
The final amendments require Commission-Identified Issuers to submit documentation to the SEC establishing that, if true, it is not owned
or controlled by a governmental entity in the public accounting firm s foreign jurisdiction. The amendments also require that a
Commission-Identified Issuer that is a foreign issuer, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 3b-4, provide certain additional
disclosures in its annual report for itself and any of its consolidated foreign operating entities. Further, the release provides notice
regarding the procedures the SEC has established to identify issuers and to impose trading prohibitions on the securities of certain Commission-Identified
Issuers, as required by the HFCAA. 

The SEC
will identify Commission-Identified Issuers for fiscal years beginning after December 18, 2020. A Commission-Identified Issuer will be
required to comply with the submission and disclosure requirements in the annual report for each year in which it was identified. If a
registrant is identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer based on its annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, the
registrant will be required to comply with the submission or disclosure requirements in its annual report filing covering the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2022. 

On December
16, 2021, PCAOB announced the PCAOB HFCAA determinations (the PCAOB determinations relating to the PCAOB s inability
to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China of the PRC or Hong Kong, a Special
Administrative Region and dependency of the PRC, because of a position taken by one or more authorities in the PRC or Hong Kong. 

Our auditor,
JP Centurion Partners PLT Centurion is headquartered in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. and is the independent registered
public accounting firm that issued the audit reports included in this annual report, and as auditors of companies that are traded publicly
in the United States and firms registered with the PCAOB, are subject to laws in the United States pursuant to which the PCAOB conducts
regular inspections to assess their compliance with the applicable professional standards. We are not aware of any reasons to believe
or conclude that Centurion, would not permit an inspection by PCAOB or may not be subject to such inspection. Centurion is outside the
jurisdiction of Hong Kong and China and have assured us that if requested, they shall cooperate and deliver work papers of our Chinese
subsidiaries to the PCAOB for inspection. We cannot assure you that the jurisdiction in which our current auditor is located would not
implement rules forbidding our auditor to be subject to PCAOB inspection. If such rules were to be implemented, we may have to incur substantial
costs and time to appoint a new auditor to re-audit our financials. This could cause the market price of our shares to be materially and
adversely affected, and our securities could be delisted or prohibited from being traded on the national securities exchange if we fail
to do so timely or on commercially reasonable times. 

36 

On August
26, 2022, the PCAOB announced that it had signed a Statement of Protocol (the SOP with the China Securities Regulatory
Commission and the Ministry of Finance of China. The SOP, together with two protocol agreements governing inspections and investigations
(together, the SOP Agreement ), establishes a specific, accountable framework to make possible complete inspections and investigations
by the PCAOB of audit firms based in mainland China and Hong Kong, as required under U.S. law. The SOP Agreement remains unpublished and
is subject to further explanation and implementation. Pursuant to the fact sheet with respect to the SOP Agreement disclosed by the SEC,
the PCAOB shall have sole discretion to select any audit firms for inspection or investigation and the PCAOB inspectors and investigators
shall have a right to see all audit documentation without redaction. According to the PCAOB, its December 2021 determinations under the
HFCAA remain in effect. The PCAOB is required to reassess these determinations by the end of 2022. Under the PCAOB s rules, a reassessment
of a determination under the HFCAA may result in the PCAOB reaffirming, modifying or vacating the PCACOB determinations. However, if the
PCAOB continues to be prohibited from conducting complete inspections and investigations of PCAOB-registered public accounting firms in
mainland China and Hong Kong, the PCAOB is likely to determine by the end of 2022 that positions taken by authorities in the PRC obstructed
its ability to inspect and investigate registered public accounting firms in mainland China and Hong Kong completely, then the companies
audited by those registered public accounting firms would be subject to a trading prohibition on U.S. markets pursuant to the HFCAA. 

The SEC
may propose additional rules or guidance that could impact us if our auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspection. For example, on August
6, 2020, the President s Working Group on Financial Markets, or the PWG, issued the Report on Protecting United States Investors
from Significant Risks from Chinese Companies to the then President of the United States. This report recommended the SEC implement five
recommendations to address companies from jurisdictions that do not provide the PCAOB with sufficient access to fulfil its statutory mandate.
Some of the concepts of these recommendations were implemented with the enactment of the HFCAA. However, some of the recommendations were
more stringent than the HFCAA. For example, if a company s auditor was not subject to PCAOB inspection, the report recommended that
the transition period before a company would be delisted would end on January 1, 2022. 

The SEC had announced that
the SEC staff was preparing a consolidated proposal for the rules regarding the implementation of the HFCAA and to address the recommendations
in the PWG report. The implications of possible additional regulation in addition to the requirements of the HFCAA and what was recently
adopted on December 2, 2021 are uncertain. Such uncertainty could cause the market price of our shares of common stock to be materially
and adversely affected, and our securities could be delisted or prohibited from being traded on the national securities exchange earlier
than would be required by the HFCAA. If our shares are unable to be listed on another securities exchange by then, such a delisting would
substantially impair your ability to sell or purchase our shares when you wish to do so, and the risk and uncertainty associated with
a potential delisting would have a negative impact on the price of our shares. 

Changes
in China s economic, political or social conditions or government policies could have a material adverse effect on our future business
and operations. 

Our
business direction going forward is focused in the Asia region which, accordingly, could place our future business, financial condition,
results of operations and prospects be influenced to a certain degree by political, economic and social conditions in China generally.
The Chinese economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the level of government involvement,
level of development, growth rate, control of foreign exchange, and allocation of resources. Although the Chinese government has implemented
measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets, and
the establishment of improved corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portion of productive assets in China is still
owned by the government. In addition, the Chinese government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development
by imposing industrial policies. 

The
Chinese government also exercises significant control over China s economic growth through allocating resources, controlling payment
of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy, and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or
companies. 

While
the Chinese economy has experienced significant growth over the past decades, growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various
sectors of the economy. Any adverse changes in economic conditions in China, in the policies of the Chinese government or in the laws
and regulations in China could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of China. Such developments could adversely
affect our future business and operating results, lead to reduction in demand for our services and adversely affect our competitive position.
The Chinese government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these
measures may benefit the overall Chinese economy, but may have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition and results
of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations. In addition, in
the past the Chinese government has implemented certain measures, including interest rate adjustment, to control the pace of economic
growth. These measures may cause decreased economic activity in China, which may adversely affect our future business and operating results. 

37 

Interpretation
of PRC laws and the implementation of National Security Law in Hong Kong involve uncertainty. 

The
PRC s legal system is based on written statutes, and prior court decisions can only be used as a reference. Since 1979, the PRC s
government has promulgated laws and regulations in relation to economic matters such as foreign investment, corporate organization and
governance, commerce, taxation and trade, with a view to developing a comprehensive system of commercial law, including laws relating
to property ownership and development. However, due to the fact that these laws and regulations have not been fully developed, and because
of the limited volume of published cases and the non-binding nature of prior court decisions, interpretation of PRC s laws and
regulations involves a degree of uncertainty. Some of these laws may be changed with little advance notice, without immediate publication
or may be amended with retroactive effect. 

On
June 30, 2020, China s top legislature unanimously passed a new National Security Law for Hong Kong that was enacted on the same
day. Similar to PRC s laws and regulations, the interpretation of National Security Law involves a degree of uncertainty. 

Depending
on the government agency or how an application or case is presented to such agency, we may receive less favorable interpretations of
laws and regulations than our competitors, particularly if a competitor has long been established in the locality of, and has developed
a relationship with such agency. In addition, any litigation may be protracted and result in substantial costs and a diversion of resources
and management attention. All of these uncertainties may cause difficulties in the enforcement of our land use rights, entitlements under
our permits and other statutory and contractual rights and interests. 

We
may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Chinese anti-corruption law. 

In
connection with any future offering, we may be subjected to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA ), and other laws
that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. persons
and issuers as defined by the statute for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We may also be subjected to Chinese anti-corruption
laws, which strictly prohibit the payment of bribes to government officials. Going forward Hong Kong and China subsidiaries may have
operations, agreements with third parties, and make sales in China, which may experience corruption. Our Hong Kong and China subsidiaries 
future activities in China may create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of their employees, because sometimes
these employees are out of our control. Violations of the FCPA or Chinese anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal or civil
sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect their business, operating results and financial
condition. In addition, the government may seek to hold our Company liable for successor liability FCPA violations committed by companies
in which we invest or that we acquire. 

The
PRC government may issue further restrictive measures in the future. 

We
cannot assure you that the PRC s government will not issue further restrictive measures in the future. The PRC government s
restrictive regulations and measures could increase our existing and future operating costs in adapting to these regulations and measures,
limit our access to capital resources or even restrict our existing and future business operations, which could further adversely affect
our business and prospects. 

38 

Our
Hong Kong and China subsidiaries may be subject to a variety of laws and other obligations regarding cyber security and data protection,
and any failure to comply with applicable laws and obligations could have a material and adverse effect on their business, financial
condition and results of operations. 

Our
Hong Kong and China subsidiaries may be subject relating various risks and costs associated with to the collection, use, sharing, retention,
security, and transfer of confidential and private information, such as personal information and other data. This data is wide ranging
and relates to our investors, employees, contractors and other counterparties and third parties. The relevant PRC laws apply not only
to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between us, our subsidiaries and other parties with which we/they have
commercial relations. 

The
PRC regulatory and enforcement regime with regard to privacy and data security is evolving. The PRC Cyber Security Law which was promulgated
on November 7, 2016 and became effective on June 1, 2017 provides that personal information and important data collected and generated
by operators of critical information infrastructure in the course of their operations in the PRC should be stored in the PRC, and the
law imposes heightened regulation and additional security obligations on operators of critical information infrastructure. According
to the Cyber Security Review Measures promulgated by the Cyberspace Administration of China and certain other PRC regulatory authorities
in April 2020, which became effective in June 2020, operators of critical information infrastructure must pass a cyber-security review
when purchasing network products and services which do or may affect national security. If they provide or are deemed to provide such
network products and services to critical information infrastructure operators, or they are deemed to be a critical information infrastructure
operator, they would be required to follow cyber security review procedures. There can be no assurance that they would be able to complete
the applicable cyber security review procedures in a timely manner, or at all, if they are required to follow such procedures. Any failure
or delay in the completion of the cyber security review procedures may prevent them from using or providing certain network products
and services, and may result in fines of up to ten times the purchase price of such network products and services being imposed upon
us, if they are to be deemed a critical information infrastructure operator using network products or services without having completed
the required cyber security review procedures. The PRC government is increasingly focused on data security, recently launching cyber
security review against a number of mobile apps operated by several US-listed Chinese companies and prohibiting these apps from registering
new users during the review period. 

On
June 10, 2021, the Standing Committee of the National People s Congress of China promulgated the Data Security Law which shall
take effect in September 1, 2021. The Data Security Law provides for data security and privacy obligations of entities and individuals
carrying out data activities, prohibits entities and individuals in China from providing any foreign judicial or law enforcement authority
with any data stored in China without approval from the competent PRC authority, and sets forth the legal liabilities of entities and
individuals found to be in violation of their data protection obligations, including rectification order, warning, fines of up to RMB10
million, suspension of relevant business, and revocation of business permits or licenses. 

On
August 20, 2021, the Standing Committee of the National People s Congress adopted the Personal Information Security Law, which
shall come into force as of November 1, 2021. The Personal Information Protection Law includes the basic rules for personal information
processing, the rules for cross-border provision of personal information, the rights of individuals in personal information processing
activities, the obligations of personal information processors, and the legal responsibilities for illegal collection, processing, and
use of personal information. 

In
addition, on July 10, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued the Measures for Cyber Security Review (Revision Draft for
Comments) for public comments, which proposes to authorize the relevant government authorities to conduct cyber security review on a
range of activities that affect or may affect national security, including listings in foreign countries by companies that possess personal
data of more than one million users. The PRC National Security Law covers various types of national security, including technology security
and information security. 

Our
Hong Kong and China subsidiaries do not collect, process or use personal information of entities or individuals other than what is necessary
for our business and do not disseminate such information. They do not operate mobile apps and they do not possess information on more
than a million entities/individuals. Although we believe they currently are not required to obtain clearance from the Cyberspace Administration
of China under the Measures for Cyber Security Review (Revision Draft for Comments) or the Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down on Illegal
Securities Activities, they face uncertainties as to the interpretation or implementation of such regulations or rules, and if required,
whether such clearance can be timely obtained, or at all. 

Compliance
with the PRC Cyber Security Law, the PRC National Security Law, the Data Security Law, the Personal Information Protection Law, the Cyber
Security Review Measures, as well as additional laws and regulations that PRC regulatory bodies may enact in the future, including data
security and personal information protection laws, may result in additional expenses to us and subject us to negative publicity, which
could harm our reputation among users and negatively affect the trading price of our shares in the future. There are also uncertainties
with respect to how the PRC Cyber Security Law, the PRC National Security Law and the Data Security Law will be implemented and interpreted
in practice. PRC regulators, including the Ministry of Public Security, the MIIT, the SAMR and the Cyberspace Administration of China,
have been increasingly focused on regulation in the areas of data security and data protection, including for mobile apps, and are enhancing
the protection of privacy and data security by rule-making and enforcement actions at central and local levels. We expect that these
areas will receive greater and continued attention and scrutiny from regulators and the public going forward, which could increase our
Hong Kong and China subsidiaries compliance costs and subject them to heightened risks and challenges associated with data security
and protection. If our Hong Kong and China subsidiaries are unable to manage these risks, they could become subject to penalties, including
fines, suspension of business, prohibition against new user registration (even for a short period of time) and revocation of required
licenses, and their reputation and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 

39 

It
may be difficult for overseas shareholders and/or regulators to conduct investigation or collect evidence within China. 

Shareholder
claims or regulatory investigation that are common in the United States generally are difficult to pursue as a matter of law or practicality
in China. For example, in China, there are significant legal and other obstacles to providing information needed for regulatory investigations
or litigation initiated outside China. Although the authorities in China may establish a regulatory cooperation mechanism with the securities
regulatory authorities of another country or region to implement cross-border supervision and administration, such cooperation with the
securities regulatory authorities in the Unities States may not be efficient in the absence of mutual and practical cooperation mechanism.
Furthermore, according to Article 177 of the PRC Securities Law, or Article 177, which became effective in March 2020, no overseas securities
regulator is allowed to directly conduct investigation or evidence collection activities within the territory of the PRC. While detailed
interpretation of or implementation rules under Article 177 have yet to be promulgated, the inability for an overseas securities regulator,
such as the Department of Justice, the SEC, the PCAOB and other authorities, to directly conduct investigation or evidence collection
activities within China may further increase difficulties faced by you in protecting your interests. 

Some
of our business operations are conducted in Hong Kong and the PRC through our Hong Kong and China subsidiaries. In the event that the
U.S. regulators carry out investigation on us and there is a need to conduct investigation or collect evidence within the territory of
the PRC, the U.S. regulators may not be able to carry out such investigation or evidence collection directly in the PRC under the PRC
laws. The U.S. regulators may consider cross-border cooperation with securities regulatory authority of the PRC by way of judicial assistance,
diplomatic channels or regulatory cooperation mechanism established with the securities regulatory authority of the PRC. 

Failure
to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business in China could subject us to fines and penalties and could also cause
us to lose customers or otherwise harm our business. 

Our
Hong Kong and China subsidiaries business is subject to regulation by various governmental agencies in China, including agencies
responsible for monitoring and enforcing compliance with various legal obligations, such as value-added telecommunication laws and regulations,
privacy and data protection-related laws and regulations, intellectual property laws, employment and labor laws, workplace safety, environmental
laws, consumer protection laws, governmental trade laws, import and export controls, anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, and tax laws
and regulations. In certain jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than in China. These laws and regulations
impose added costs on their business. Noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject them to: 

investigations,
 enforcement actions, and sanctions; 

mandatory
 changes to our network and products; 

disgorgement
 of profits, fines, and damages; 

civil
 and criminal penalties or injunctions; 

claims
 for damages by our customers or channel partners; 

termination
 of contracts; 

loss
 of intellectual property rights; 

failure
 to obtain, maintain or renew certain licenses, approvals, permits, registrations or filings 

necessary
 to conduct our operations; and 

temporary
 or permanent debarment from sales to public service organizations. 

If
any governmental sanctions are imposed, or if they do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, their business, results
of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant
diversion of our management s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees. Enforcement actions and sanctions could
materially harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 

Additionally,
companies in the technology industry have recently experienced increased regulatory scrutiny. Any similar reviews by regulatory agencies
or legislatures may result in substantial regulatory fines, changes to their business practices, and other penalties, which could negatively
affect their business and results of operations. 

Changes
in social, political, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide range of topics may cause them to change their
business practices. Further, their expansion into a variety of new fields also could raise a number of new regulatory issues. These factors
could negatively affect their business and results of operations in material ways. 

Moreover,
they are exposed to the risk of misconduct, errors and failure to functions by their management, employees and parties that they collaborate
with, who may from time to time be subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings or otherwise face potential liability
and penalties in relation to noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations, which could harm their reputation and business.

recent joint statement by the SEC, proposed rule changes submitted by NASDAQ, and an act passed by the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House
of Representatives, all call for additional and more stringent criteria to be applied to U.S.-listed companies with significant operations
in China. These developments could add uncertainties to our future offerings, business operations share price and reputation. 

U.S.
public companies that have substantially all of their operations in China have been the subject of intense scrutiny, criticism and negative
publicity by investors, financial commentators and regulatory agencies, such as the SEC. Much of the scrutiny, criticism and negative
publicity has centered on financial and accounting irregularities and mistakes, a lack of effective internal controls over financial
accounting, inadequate corporate governance policies or a lack of adherence thereto and, in many cases, allegations of fraud. 

On
December 7, 2018, the SEC and the PCAOB issued a joint statement highlighting continued challenges faced by the U.S. regulators in their
oversight of financial statement audits of U.S.-listed companies with significant operations in China. On April 21, 2020, SEC Chairman
Jay Clayton and PCAOB Chairman William D. Duhnke III, along with other senior SEC staff, released a joint statement highlighting the
risks associated with investing in companies based in or have substantial operations in emerging markets including China, reiterating
past SEC and PCAOB statements on matters including the difficulty associated with inspecting accounting firms and audit work papers in
China and higher risks of fraud in emerging markets and the difficulty of bringing and enforcing SEC, Department of Justice and other
U.S. regulatory actions, including in instances of fraud, in emerging markets generally. 

On
May 20, 2020, the U.S. Senate passed the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act HFCAA requiring a foreign company
to certify it is not owned or controlled by a foreign government if the PCAOB is unable to audit specified reports because the company
uses a foreign auditor not subject to PCAOB inspection. If the PCAOB is unable to inspect the company s auditors for three consecutive
years, the issuer s securities are prohibited to trade on a national exchange. On December 2, 2020, the U.S. House of Representatives
approved the HFCAA. On December 18, 2020, the HFCAA Act was signed into law. On June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed a bill which, if
passed by the U.S. House of Representatives and signed into law, would reduce the number of consecutive non-inspection years required
for triggering the prohibitions under the HFCAA from three years to two. 

On
March 24, 2021, the SEC announced that it had adopted interim final amendments to implement congressionally mandated submission and disclosure
requirements of the Act. The interim final amendments will apply to registrants that the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report
on Forms 10-K, 20-F, 40-F or N-CSR with an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction
and that the PCAOB has determined it is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in that
jurisdiction. The SEC will implement a process for identifying such a registrant and any such identified registrant will be required
to submit documentation to the SEC establishing that it is not owned or controlled by a governmental entity in that foreign jurisdiction
and will also require disclosure in the registrant s annual report regarding the audit arrangements of, and governmental influence
on, such a registrant. 

On June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate
passed Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, and on December 29, 2022, legislation entitled Consolidated Appropriations
Act, 2023 (the Consolidated Appropriations Act was signed into law by President Biden, which contained, among other
things, an identical provision to the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act and amended the HFCAA by requiring the SEC
to prohibit an issuer s securities from trading on any U.S. stock exchanges if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections for
two consecutive years instead of three, thus reducing the time period for triggering the prohibition on trading. 

On
May 21, 2021, NASDAQ filed three proposals with the SEC to (i) apply minimum offering size requirement for companies primarily operating
in a Restrictive Market , (ii) prohibit Restrictive Market companies from directly listing on NASDAQ Capital Market, and
only permit them to list on NASDAQ Global Select or NASDAQ Global Market in connection with a direct listing and (iii) apply additional
and more stringent criteria to an applicant or listed company based on the qualifications of the company s auditors. 

On
December 2, 2021, the SEC adopted amendments to finalize rules implementing the submission and disclosure requirements in the HFCAA.
The rules apply to registrants the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report with an audit report issued by a registered public
accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate Commission-Identified Issuers ). The final amendments require Commission-Identified
Issuers to submit documentation to the SEC establishing that, if true, it is not owned or controlled by a governmental entity in the
public accounting firm s foreign jurisdiction. The amendments also require that a Commission-Identified Issuer that is a foreign
issuer, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 3b-4, provide certain additional disclosures in its annual report for itself and any of
its consolidated foreign operating entities. Further, the release provides notice regarding the procedures the SEC has established to
identify issuers and to impose trading prohibitions on the securities of certain Commission-Identified Issuers, as required by the HFCAA. 

41 

The
SEC will identify Commission-Identified Issuers for fiscal years beginning after December 18, 2020. A Commission-Identified Issuer will
be required to comply with the submission and disclosure requirements in the annual report for each year in which it was identified.
If a registrant is identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer based on its annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022,
the registrant will be required to comply with the submission or disclosure requirements in its annual report filing covering the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2023. 

On December
16, 2021, PCAOB announced the PCAOB HFCAA determinations (the PCAOB determinations relating to the PCAOB s inability
to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China of the PRC or Hong Kong, a Special
Administrative Region and dependency of the PRC, because of a position taken by one or more authorities in the PRC or Hong Kong. 

On August
26, 2022, the PCAOB announced that it had signed a Statement of Protocol (the SOP with the China Securities Regulatory
Commission and the Ministry of Finance of China. The SOP, together with two protocol agreements governing inspections and investigations
(together, the SOP Agreement ), establishes a specific, accountable framework to make possible complete inspections and investigations
by the PCAOB of audit firms based in mainland China and Hong Kong, as required under U.S. law. The SOP Agreement remains unpublished and
is subject to further explanation and implementation. Pursuant to the fact sheet with respect to the SOP Agreement disclosed by the SEC,
the PCAOB shall have sole discretion to select any audit firms for inspection or investigation and the PCAOB inspectors and investigators
shall have a right to see all audit documentation without redaction. According to the PCAOB, its December 2021 determinations under the
HFCAA remain in effect. The PCAOB is required to reassess these determinations by the end of 2022. Under the PCAOB s rules, a reassessment
of a determination under the HFCAA may result in the PCAOB reaffirming, modifying or vacating the PCACOB determinations. However, if the
PCAOB continues to be prohibited from conducting complete inspections and investigations of PCAOB-registered public accounting firms in
mainland China and Hong Kong, the PCAOB is likely to determine by the end of 2022 that positions taken by authorities in the PRC obstructed
its ability to inspect and investigate registered public accounting firms in mainland China and Hong Kong completely, then the companies
audited by those registered public accounting firms would be subject to a trading prohibition on U.S. markets pursuant to the HFCAA. 

On December
15, 2022, the PCAOB Board determined that the PCAOB was able to secure complete access to inspect and investigate registered public accounting
firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong and voted to vacate its previous determinations to the contrary. However, should PRC
authorities obstruct or otherwise fail to facilitate the PCAOB s access in the future, the PCAOB Board will consider the need to
issue a new determination. 

The lack
of access to the PCAOB inspection in China prevents the PCAOB from fully evaluating audits and quality control procedures of the auditors
based in China. As a result, the investors may be deprived of the benefits of such PCAOB inspections. The inability of the PCAOB to conduct
inspections of auditors in China makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of these accounting firms audit procedures
or quality control procedures as compared to auditors outside of China that are subject to the PCAOB inspections, which could cause existing
and potential investors in our stock to lose confidence in our audit procedures and reported financial information and the quality of
our financial statements. 

Our auditor,
JP Centurion Partners PLT Centurion is headquartered in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. and is the independent registered
public accounting firm that issued the audit reports included in this annual report, and as auditors of companies that are traded publicly
in the United States and firms registered with the PCAOB, are subject to laws in the United States pursuant to which the PCAOB conducts
regular inspections to assess their compliance with the applicable professional standards. We are not aware of any reasons to believe
or conclude that Centurion, would not permit an inspection by PCAOB or may not be subject to such inspection. Centurion is outside the
jurisdiction of Hong Kong and China and have assured us that if requested, they shall cooperate and deliver work papers of our Chinese
subsidiaries to the PCAOB for inspection. We cannot assure you that the jurisdiction in which our current auditor is located would not
implement rules forbidding our auditor to be subject to PCAOB inspection. If such rules were to be implemented, we may have to incur substantial
costs and time to appoint a new auditor to re-audit our financials. This could cause the market price of our shares to be materially and
adversely affected, and our securities could be delisted or prohibited from being traded on the national securities exchange if we fail
to do so timely or on commercially reasonable times. 

These
recent developments could add uncertainties to our offering and we cannot assure you whether NASDAQ or regulatory authorities would apply
additional and more stringent criteria to us after considering the effectiveness of our auditor s audit procedures and quality
control procedures, adequacy of personnel and training, or sufficiency of resources, geographic reach or experience as it relates to
the audit of our financial statements. 

It
remains unclear what further actions the SEC, the PCAOB or NASDAQ will take to address these issues and what impact those actions
will have on U.S. companies that have significant operations in the PRC and have securities listed on a U.S. stock exchange
(including a national securities exchange or over-the-counter stock market). In addition, the March 2021 interim final amendments
and any additional actions, proceedings, or new rules resulting from these efforts to increase U.S. regulatory access to audit
information could create some uncertainty for investors, the market price of our shares of common stock could be adversely affected,
and we could be delisted if we and our auditor are unable to meet the PCAOB inspection requirement or being required to engage a new
audit firm, which would require significant expense and management time. 

42 

As
a result of these scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity, the publicly traded stock of many U.S. listed Chinese companies sharply
decreased in value and, in some cases, has become virtually worthless. Many of these companies are now subject to shareholder lawsuits
and SEC enforcement actions and are conducting internal and external investigations into the allegations. It is not clear what effect
this sector-wide scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity will have on us, our future offerings, business and our share price. If we
become the subject of any unfavorable allegations, whether such allegations are proven to be true or untrue, we will have to expend significant
resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend our Company. This situation will be costly and time consuming and distract our
management from developing our growth. If such allegations are not proven to be groundless, we and our business operations will be severely
affected and you could sustain a significant decline in the value of our shares. 

NASDAQ
may apply additional and more stringent criteria for our continued listing. 

NASDAQ
Listing Rule 5101 provides NASDAQ with broad discretionary authority over the continued listing of securities in NASDAQ and NASDAQ may
use such discretion to deny apply additional or more stringent criteria for the continued listing of particular securities, or suspend
or delist particular securities based on any event, condition, or circumstance that exists or occurs that makes continued listing of
the securities on NASDAQ inadvisable or unwarranted in the opinion of NASDAQ, even though the securities meet all enumerated criteria
for continued listing on NASDAQ. In addition, NASDAQ has used its discretion to deny continued listing or to apply additional and more
stringent criteria in the instances, including but not limited to where the company engaged an auditor that has not been subject to an
inspection by PCAOB, an auditor that PCAOB cannot inspect, or an auditor that has not demonstrated sufficient resources, geographic reach,
or experience to adequately perform the company s audit. For the aforementioned concerns, we may be subject to the additional and
more stringent criteria of NASDAQ for our continued listing. 

The
current tension in international trade, particularly with regard to U.S. and China trade policies, may adversely impact our business,
financial condition, and results of operations. 

Although
cross-border business may not be an area of our focus, if we plan to expand our business internationally in the future, any unfavorable
government policies on international trade, such as capital controls or tariffs, may affect the demand for our services, impact our competitive
position, or prevent us from being able to conduct business in certain countries. If any new tariffs, legislation, or regulations are
implemented, or if existing trade agreements are renegotiated, such changes could adversely affect our business, financial condition,
and results of operations. Recently, there have been heightened tensions in international economic relations, such as the one between
the United States and China. The U.S. government has recently imposed, and has recently proposed to impose additional, new, or higher
tariffs on certain products imported from China to penalize China for what it characterizes as unfair trade practices. China has responded
by imposing, and proposing to impose additional, new, or higher tariffs on certain products imported from the United States. Following
mutual retaliatory actions for months, on January 15, 2020, the United States and China entered into the Economic and Trade Agreement
between the United States of America and the People s Republic of China as a phase one trade deal, effective on February 14, 2020. 

Although
the direct impact of the current international trade tension, and any escalation of such tension, on the industries in which we operate
is uncertain, the negative impact on general, economic, political and social conditions may adversely impact our business, financial
condition and results of operations. 

The
Hong Kong legal system embodies uncertainties which could limit the legal protections available to the Company. 

Hong
Kong is a Special Administrative Region of the PRC and enjoys a high degree of autonomy under the one country, two systems 
principle. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region s constitutional document, the Basic Law, ensures that the current political
situation will remain in effect for 50 years. Hong Kong has enjoyed the freedom to function in a high degree of autonomy for its affairs,
including currencies, immigration and custom, independent judiciary system and parliamentary system. However, we are not in any position
to guarantee the implementation of the one country, two systems principle and the level of autonomy as currently in place
at the moment. Any changes in the state of political environment in Hong Kong may materially and adversely affect our business and operation.
Additionally, intellectual property rights and confidentiality protections in Hong Kong may not be as effective as in the United States
or other countries. These uncertainties could limit the legal protections available to us, including our ability to enforce our agreements
with our clients. 

The Standing Committee
of the National People s Congress SCNPC or PRC regulatory authorities may in the future promulgate laws, regulations
or implementing rules that require us or our subsidiaries to obtain regulatory approval from Chinese authorities before or after listing
in the U.S. 

We are subject
to certain legal and operational risks associated with being based in China. PRC laws and regulations governing our current business operations
are sometimes vague and uncertain, and as a result these risks may result in material changes in the operations of our China subsidiaries,
significant depreciation of the value of our shares, or a complete hindrance of our ability to offer or continue to offer our securities
to investors. Recently, the PRC government adopted a series of regulatory actions and issued statements to regulate business operations
in China, including those related to variable interest entities, data security, and anti-monopoly concerns. As of the date of this report,
we and our subsidiaries have not been involved in any investigations on cybersecurity review initiated by any PRC regulatory authority,
nor has any of them received any inquiry, notice or sanction.

On August
8, 2006, six Governmental Agencies, namely, the Ministry of Commerce, the State Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the
State Administration for Taxation, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the CSRC and the SAFE, jointly adopted the Regulations
on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, or the M A Rules, which became effective on September 8,
2006 and were amended on June 22, 2009. The M A Rules require that among other things, that the Ministry of Commerce, or MOFCOM, be
notified in advance of any change of control transaction in which a foreign investor acquires control of a PRC domestic enterprise and
involves following circumstances: (i) any important industry is concerned; (ii) such transaction involves factors that impact or may impact
national economic security; or (iii) such transaction will lead to a change of control of a domestic enterprise which holds a famous trademark
or PRC time-honored brand. The M A Rules also requires offshore special purpose vehicles that are controlled by PRC companies or individuals
and that have been formed for overseas listing purposes through acquisitions of PRC domestic interest held by such PRC companies or individuals,
to obtain the approval of CSRC prior to publicly listing their securities on an overseas stock exchange. 

On December
30, 2019, the Ministry of Commerce and the State Administration of Market Supervision and Administration issued the Foreign Investment
Information Reporting Measures (hereinafter referred to as the Reporting Measures ), which took effect on January 1,
2020. The Reporting Measures clearly states that foreign investors who directly or indirectly conduct investment activities
in China should submit investment information to the commercial authorities by foreign investors or foreign-invested enterprises in accordance
with these Measures. If there is any change in the information of investors and their actual controllers, investment transaction information,
and other information, they should report to the relevant authorities. 

On February
17, 2023, the China Securities Regulatory Commission issued the Notice on Filing Management Arrangements for Overseas Issuance and Listing
of Domestic Enterprises (hereinafter referred to as the Arrangements for Overseas Listing of Domestic Enterprises ).
It clearly states that foreign investors who acquire control of domestic enterprises in China and are listed overseas as issuers are recognized
as domestic enterprises listed overseas must comply with laws, administrative regulations, and relevant national regulations
on foreign investment, state-owned asset management, industry supervision, and overseas investment, and accept the management and supervision
of the China Securities Regulatory Commission. 

Under
the current PRC laws and regulations, we do not expect that we will trigger MOFCOM pre-notification under the above-mentioned circumstances
or any review by other PRC government authorities. However, the application of the M A Rules remains unclear. If CSRC approval is
required, it is uncertain whether it would be possible for us to obtain the approval, and any failure to obtain or delay in obtaining
CSRC approval would subject us to sanctions imposed by the CSRC and other PRC regulatory agencies. According to our PRC counsel, Chiu
Sui Wun Grace from Guangdong Qianhai Sun Law Firm, based on her understanding of the current PRC laws, rules and regulations that the
CSRC s approval under the M A Rules may not be required for our continued listing on Nasdaq, given that: (i)
we did not establish our mainland China subsidiaries through merger with or acquisition of PRC domestic companies as defined in the M A
Rules, and (ii) our mainland China subsidiaries through merger with or acquisition of PRC domestic companies do not involve following
circumstances of any important industry is concerned, or such transaction involves factors that impact or may impact national economic
security; or such transaction will lead to a change of control of a domestic enterprise which holds a famous trademark or PRC time-honored
brand . 

However, according to the
 Arrangement for Overseas Listing of Domestic Enterprises issued by the China Securities Regulatory Commission on February
17, 2023, it is clearly stipulated that if a foreign investor acquires control of a domestic enterprise and is listed overseas as an
issuer, and the issuer simultaneously meets the following conditions, it will be recognized as an indirect overseas listing of a domestic
enterprise and subject to the supervision and management of the China Securities Regulatory Commission: (1) The operating income, total
profit, total assets, or net assets of the domestic enterprise in the most recent accounting year, the ratio of any indicator of total
profit, total assets, or net assets , whichever to the issuer s audited consolidated financial statements for the same period exceeds
50 ; (2) The main business activities are carried out in China or the main premises are located in China, or the majority of senior management
personnel responsible for business management are Chinese citizens or have their habitual residence in China. Since the implementation
date of the Management Trial Measures , a domestic enterprise that falls within the scope of filing and has been issued
and listed overseas or meets the following conditions is a stock enterprise: Before the implementation date of the Management Trial Measures , the application for indirect overseas issuance and listing has been approved by an overseas regulatory authority
or an overseas stock exchange (such as the Hong Kong market has passed the hearing, the United States market has agreed to register and
take effect, etc.), and there is no need to re fulfill the regulatory procedures for the issuance and listing of overseas regulatory
agencies or overseas stock exchanges (such as a re-hearing in the Hong Kong market, etc.), and complete the overseas issuance and listing
before September 30, 2023. Stock enterprises do not require immediate filing, and subsequent filing matters such as refinancing should
be filed as required. Therefore, if we are identified by the China Securities Regulatory Commission as to the situation of indirect
overseas listing , we should go through relevant filing procedures with the China Securities Regulatory Commission as required
when subsequent filing matters such as refinancing are involved, 

44 

In addition,
according to the Reporting Measures issued by the Ministry of Commerce and the State Administration of Market Supervision
and Administration on December 30, 2019, our previous listing on NASDAQ may be identified as a change in circumstances such as investors
and should be reported to the relevant competent authorities in accordance with the Reporting Measures . 

However,
our PRC counsel has further advised us that there remains some uncertainty as to how the M A Rules will be interpreted or implemented
in the context of an overseas listing and its opinions summarized above are subject to any new laws, rules and regulations or detailed
implementations and interpretations in any form relating to the M A Rules. We cannot assure you that relevant PRC government agencies,
including the CSRC, would reach the same conclusion as we do. 

Recently,
the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council jointly issued
the Opinions on Severely Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities According to Law, or the Opinions, which were made
available to the public on July 6, 2021. The Opinions emphasized the need to strengthen the administration over illegal securities activities,
and the need to strengthen the supervision over overseas listings by Chinese companies. Effective measures, such as promoting the construction
of relevant regulatory systems will be taken to deal with the risks and incidents of China-concept overseas listed companies, and cybersecurity
and data privacy protection requirements and similar matters. On July 10, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued a revised
draft of the Measures for Cybersecurity Review for public comments, which require, among others, in addition to any operator of
critical information infrastructure, any data processor controlling personal information of no less than one million
users which seeks to list in a foreign stock exchange should also be subject to cybersecurity review. Later on December 28, 2021, the
Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2021 version) were promulgated and became effective on February 15, 2022, which provide that any online
platform operators controlling personal information of more than one million users which seeks to list in a foreign stock exchange
should also be subject to cybersecurity review. The Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2021 version) further elaborated the factors to
be considered when assessing the national security risks of the relevant activities. On November 14, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration
of China published the Network Internet Data Protection Draft Regulations (draft for comments), which reiterates that data handlers that
process the personal information of more than one million users listing in a foreign country should apply for a cybersecurity review.
We do not believe we are among the operator of critical information infrastructure , data processor , online
platform operators or data handler as mentioned above, however, the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2021 version)
were newly adopted and the Network Internet Data Protection Draft Regulations (draft for comments) is in the process of being formulated
and it is unclear on how they will be interpreted, amended and implemented by the relevant PRC governmental authorities. 

On February
17, 2023, the CSRC released the Trial Measures and five supporting guidelines, which will come into effect on March 31, 2023 and if enacted,
may subject us to additional compliance requirement in the future. See Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure
- The Opinions recently issued by the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of
the State Council, and the New Overseas Listing Rules promulgated by the CSRC may subject us to additional compliance requirements in
the future. 

The Measures
for Cybersecurity Review (2021 version) was newly adopted, the Network Internet Data Protection Draft Regulations (draft for comments)
is in the process of being formulated and the Opinions remain unclear on how they will be interpreted, amended and implemented by the
relevant PRC governmental authorities. Thus, substantial uncertainties exist with respect to its interpretation and implementation regarding
such laws and regulations. Furthermore, if we are required by the Trial Measures to complete the filing procedures with the CSRC in connection
with our listing, we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete such filings in a timely manner, or at all, in the future. Any
failure by us to comply with such filing procedures could impact our operations materially and adversely, and significantly limit or completely
hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of our securities to significantly decline
or be worthless. 

Furthermore,
we and our subsidiaries, and our investors may face uncertainty about future actions by the government of China that could significantly
affect our financial performance and operations. We cannot assure you that the PRC government will not initiate possible governmental
actions or scrutiny to us, which could substantially affect our operation and the value of our shares may depreciate quickly. As of the
date of this report, neither our Company nor any of our subsidiaries have received nor was denied permission from Chinese authorities
to list on U.S. exchanges under the PRC laws and regulations currently in effect. However, there is no guarantee that our Company or our
subsidiaries will receive, or not be denied, permission from Chinese authorities to list on U.S. exchanges in the future. China s
economic, political and social conditions, as well as interventions and influences of any government policies, laws and regulations are
uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

45 

The Opinions recently
issued by the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council and
the New Overseas Listing Rules promulgated by the CSRC may subject us to additional compliance requirements in the future. 

On February
17, 2023, with the approval of the State Council, the CSRC released the Trial Measures and five supporting guidelines, which will come
into effect on March 31, 2023. According to the Trial Measures, (1) domestic companies that seek to offer or list securities overseas,
both directly and indirectly, should fulfill the filing procedures and report relevant information to the CSRC; if a domestic company
fails to complete the filing procedures or conceals any material fact or falsifies any major content in its filing documents, such domestic
company may be subject to administrative penalties, such as order to rectify, warnings, fines, and its controlling shareholders, actual
controllers, the person directly in charge and other directly liable persons may also be subject to administrative penalties, such as
warnings and fines; (2) if the issuer meets both of the following conditions, the overseas offering and listing shall be determined as
an indirect overseas offering and listing by a domestic company: (i) any of the total assets, net assets, revenues or profits of the domestic
operating entities of the issuer in the most recent accounting year accounts for more than 50 of the corresponding figure in the issuer s
audited consolidated financial statements for the same period; (ii) its major operational activities are carried out in China or its main
places of business are located in China, or the senior managers in charge of operation and management of the issuer are mostly Chinese
citizens or are domiciled in China; and (3) where a domestic company seeks to indirectly offer and list securities in an overseas market,
the issuer shall designate a major domestic operating entity responsible for all filing procedures with the CSRC, and where an issuer
makes an application for an initial public offering in an overseas market, the issuer shall submit filings with the CSRC within three
business days after such application is submitted. On the same day, the CSRC also held a press conference for the release of the Trial
Measures and issued the Notice on Administration for the Filing of Overseas Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies, which, among others,
clarifies that (1) on or prior to the effective date of the Trial Measures, domestic companies that have already submitted valid applications
for overseas offering and listing but have not obtained approval from overseas regulatory authorities or stock exchanges may reasonably
arrange the timing for submitting their filing applications with the CSRC, and must complete the filing before the completion of their
overseas offering and listing; (2) a six-month transition period will be granted to domestic companies which, prior to the effective date
of the Trial Measures, have already obtained the approval from overseas regulatory authorities or stock exchanges, but have not completed
the indirect overseas listing; if domestic companies fail to complete the overseas listing within such six-month transition period, they
shall file with the CSRC according to the requirements; and (3) the CSRC will solicit opinions from relevant regulatory authorities and
complete the filing of the overseas listing of companies with contractual arrangements which duly meet the compliance requirements, and
support the development and growth of these companies. 

On April
2, 2022, the CSRC published the Draft Archives Rules. In the overseas listing activities of domestic companies, domestic companies, as
well as securities companies and securities service institutions providing relevant securities services thereof, should establish a sound
system of confidentiality and archival work, shall not disclose state secrets, or harm the state and public interests. Where a domestic
company provides or publicly discloses to the relevant securities companies, securities service institutions, overseas regulatory authorities
and other entities and individuals, or provides or publicly discloses through its overseas listing entity, any document or material involving
any state secret or any work secret of any governmental agency, it shall report to the competent authority for approval in accordance
with the law, and submit to the secrecy administration department for filing. Domestic companies shall not provide accounting records
to an overseas accounting firm that has not performed the corresponding procedures. Securities companies and securities service organizations
shall comply with the confidentiality and archive management requirements, and keep the documents and materials properly. Securities companies
and securities service institutions that provide domestic enterprises with relevant securities services for overseas issuance and listing
of securities shall keep such archives they compile within the territory of the PRC and shall not transfer such archives to overseas institutions
or individuals, by any means, such as carrying, shipping or through any other information technologies, without the approval of the relevant
competent authorities. If the archives or duplicates of such archives are of important value to the state and society and needed to be
taken abroad, approval shall be obtained in accordance with relevant provisions. 

The Trial Measures, and the Draft Archives Rules if enacted, may subject
us to additional compliance requirements in the future, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to get the clearance of filing procedures
under the Trial Measures on a timely basis, or at all. Any failure by us to fully comply with new regulatory requirements, including but
limited to the failure to complete the filing procedures with the CSRC if required, may significantly limit or completely hinder our ability
to offer or continue to offer our Ordinary Shares, cause significant disruption to our business operations, and severely damage our reputation,
which would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and cause our Ordinary Shares to significantly
decline in value or become worthless.

Risks
Related to our Common Stock 

Our
failure to meet the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq could result in the de-listing of our Common Stock. 

On
January 3, 2022, the Company received notice from The NASDAQ Stock Market Nasdaq that, because the closing bid
price for the Company s Common Stock had fallen below 1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days, the Company no longer complied
with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to the Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2).
However the Nasdaq Listing Rules also provide the Company a compliance period of 180 calendar days (i.e. by July 5, 2022) in which to
regain compliance. 

If
we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, including the minimum closing bid price requirement, Nasdaq may take
steps to delist our Common Stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our Common Stock and would impair
your ability to sell or purchase our Common Stock when you wish to do so. 

On
August 12, 2022, the Company received a notification from the Nasdaq that it had determined that for the last 11 consecutive business
days, from July 28, 2022 to August 11, 2022, the closing bid price of the Company s Common Stock had been at 1.00 per share or
greater. Accordingly, the Company has regained compliance with Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) and the Nasdaq is treating this matter as now
closed. 

Future
sales of substantial amounts of the shares of Common Stock by existing shareholders could adversely affect the price of our Common Stock. 

If
our existing shareholders sell substantial amounts of the shares, then the market price of our Common Stock could fall. Such sales by
our existing shareholders might make it more difficult for us to issue new equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time
and place we deem appropriate. If any existing shareholders sell substantial amounts of shares, the prevailing market price for our shares
could be adversely affected. 

The
market price of our shares is likely to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as: 

variations
 in our actual and perceived operating results; 

news
 regarding gains or losses of customers or partners by us or our competitors; 

news
 regarding gains or losses of key personnel by us or our competitors; 

announcements
 of competitive developments, acquisitions or strategic alliances in our industry by us or our competitors; 

changes
 in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by financial analysts; 

potential
 litigation; 

general
 market conditions or other developments affecting us or our industry; and 

the
 operating and stock price performance of other companies, other industries and other events or factors beyond our control. 

In
addition, the securities markets have from time-to-time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to
the operating performance of certain companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of
the shares. 

In
case that our shares trade under 5.00 per share they will be considered penny stock. Trading in penny stocks has many restrictions and
these restrictions could severely affect the price and liquidity of our shares. 

If
our stock trades below 5.00 per share, our stock would be known as a penny stock , which is subject to various regulations
involving disclosures to be given to you prior to the purchase of any penny stock. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC has adopted regulations which generally define a penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price of less
than 5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Depending on market fluctuations, our Common Stock would be considered as a penny
stock . A penny stock is subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker/dealers who sell these securities
to persons other than established Members and accredited investors. For transactions covered by these rules, the broker/dealer must make
a special suitability determination for the purchase of these securities. In addition, he must receive the purchaser s written
consent to the transaction prior to the purchase. He must also provide certain written disclosures to the purchaser. Consequently, the
 penny stock rules may restrict the ability of broker/dealers to sell our securities and may negatively affect the ability
of holders of shares of our Common Stock to resell them. These disclosures require you to acknowledge that you understand the risks associated
with buying penny stocks and that you can absorb the loss of your entire investment. Penny stocks are low priced securities that do not
have a very high trading volume. Consequently, the price of the stocks is often volatile, and you may not be able to buy or sell the
stock when you want to. 

We
do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our Common Stock in the foreseeable future. 

We
do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Presently, we intend to retain all our earnings, if any, to finance
development and expansion of our business. Consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a positive return on your investment in us
will be if the market price of our Common Stock appreciates. 

Together,
our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Lee Chong Kuang, and our Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Loke Che Chan Gilbert own a large percentage of
our outstanding stock and could significantly influence the outcome of our corporate matters. 

Currently,
Mr. Lee Chong Kuang, our CEO, beneficially owns approximately 22 of our outstanding shares of Common Stock, and Mr. Loke Che Chan Gilbert,
our CFO, beneficially owns approximately 18 of our outstanding shares of Common Stock, collectively 40 . As a result, Messrs. Lee and
Loke are collectively able to exercise significant influence over all matters that require us to obtain shareholder approval, including
the election of directors to our board and approval of significant corporate transactions that we may consider, such as a merger or other
sale of our company or its assets. This concentration of ownership in our shares by executive officers will limit the other shareholders 
ability to influence corporate matters and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control over us.

The
following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition for fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, and
2021, should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes to those financial statements that are included elsewhere
in this Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this management s discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in
this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward
looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth
in the Risk Factors section of this Annual Report, our actual results could differ materially from the results described
in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report. 

Company
Overview 

Greenpro
Capital Corp. (the Company or Greenpro ), was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 19, 2013. We provide
cross-border business solutions and accounting outsourcing services to small and medium-size businesses located in Asia, with an initial
focus on Hong Kong, Malaysia and China. Greenpro provides a range of services as a package solution (the Package Solution to our clients and we believe that our clients can reduce their business costs and improve their revenues. 

In
addition to our business solution services, we also operate a venture capital business through Greenpro Venture Capital Limited, an Anguilla
corporation. One of our venture capital business segments focuses on (1) establishing a business incubator for start-up and high growth
companies to support such companies during critical growth periods, which will include education and support services, and (2) searching
the investment opportunities in selected start-up and high growth companies, which may generate significant returns to the Company. Our
venture capital business focuses on companies located in South-East Asia and East Asia, including Hong Kong, Malaysia, China, Thailand,
and Singapore. Another venture capital business segment focuses on rental activities of commercial properties and the sale of investment
properties.

For
information regarding our controls and procedures, see Part II, Item 9A - Controls and Procedures, of this Annual Report. 

During
the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, we principally operated in three regions: Hong Kong, China and Malaysia. We derived revenues
from provision of services, leasing and trading of our commercial properties, respectively.

Comparison
of the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021 

Total
Revenues 

Total
revenue was 3,673,997 and 2,949,780 for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The increase of 724,217 was primarily
due to the sale of three real estate property units. We expect revenue from both business service and real estate segments to steadily
improve when the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic becomes contained. 

Service
Business Revenue 

Revenue
from the provision of business services was 2,725,466 and 2,820,950 for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively.
It was derived principally from the provision of business consulting and advisory services as well as company secretarial, accounting,
and financial analysis services. We expect revenue from our business services segment to steadily improve as we are expanding our businesses
into new territories. 

Real
Estate Business 

Rental
Revenue 

Revenue
from rentals was 108,495 and 128,830 for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. It was derived principally from
leasing properties in Hong Kong and Malaysia. We expect our rental income will be stable. 

Sale
of Properties 

For
the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated revenue of 840,036 from the sale of three property units in Hong Kong. No revenue was
generated as no property was sold for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

As
opportunities permit, management expects the Company will continuously purchase and sell commercial properties. Accordingly, we expect
revenue and costs attributable to the sale of properties to fluctuate on a going forward basis. 

Total
Operating Costs and Expenses 

Total
operating costs and expenses were 5,192,500 and 5,704,464 for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. They consist
of cost-of-service revenue, cost of rental revenue and cost of real estate properties sold, and general and administrative expenses. 

Loss
from operations was 1,518,503 and 2,754,684 for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The decrease in loss from
operations was mainly due to a decrease in general and administrative expense by 1,062,781.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Use
of estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant accounting estimates include certain
assumptions related to, among others, the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, impairment analysis of real estate assets and other
long-term assets including goodwill, valuation allowance on deferred income taxes, and the accrual of potential liabilities. Actual results
may differ from these estimates. 

Revenue
recognition 

The
Company follows the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts . ASC 606 creates a five-step
model that requires entities to exercise judgment when considering the terms of contracts, which includes (1) identifying the contracts
or agreements with a customer, (2) identifying our performance obligations in the contract or agreement, (3) determining the transaction
price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the separate performance obligations, and (5) recognizing revenue as each performance
obligation is satisfied. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect
the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the services it transfers to its clients. 

The
Company s revenue consists of revenue from providing business consulting and corporate advisory services service revenue ),
revenue from the sale of real estate properties, and revenue from the rental of real estate properties. 

Impairment
of long-lived assets 

Long-lived
assets primarily include real estate held for investment, real estate held for use, and equipment and intangible assets. In accordance
with the provision of ASC 360, the Company generally conducts its annual impairment evaluation to its long-lived assets, usually in the
fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, such as a significant sustained change in the business
climate. The recoverability of long-lived assets is measured at the reporting unit level. If the total of the expected undiscounted future
net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying
amount of the asset. 

Recent
accounting pronouncements 

Refer
to Note 1 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

54 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Our
cash balance on December 31, 2022, was 3,911,535, as compared to 5,338,571 on December 31, 2021, it was decreased by 1,427,036. We
estimate the Company has sufficient cash available to meet its anticipated working capital for the next twelve months. 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets
and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company
incurred a net loss of 6,262,188 and net cash used in operations of 2,402,769. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that the financial statements are issued. In addition, the Company s
independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on the Company s financial statements on December 31, 2022, has expressed
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon improving its profitability and the continuing financial support
from its major shareholders. Management believes the existing shareholders or external financing will provide the additional cash to
meet the Company s obligations as they become due. 

Despite
the amount of funds that the Company has raised, no assurance can be given that any future financing, if needed, will be available or,
if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company can obtain additional financing, if
needed, it may contain undue restrictions on its operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for its shareholders,
in the case of equity financing.

notes of 5,093,720 and offset by amortization and interest expenses associated with convertible notes of 12,440,666, loss of extinguishment

receivable of 200,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022.

designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair
presentation of published financial statements. Management conducted assessments of the Company s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the framework and criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) (COSO). Based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of
December 31, 2022, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting were effective. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended December 31, 2022, that have materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Inherent
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 

Our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, intends that our disclosure controls and procedures and
internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. However, our management
does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors
and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that
the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints,
and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems,
no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because
of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two
or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions
about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under
all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance
with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due
to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Board
of Directors 

All
directors hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until their successors have been duly elected and qualified.
Directors are elected at the annual meetings to serve for one-year terms. Officers are elected by, and serve at the discretion of, the
board of directors. Our board of directors shall hold meetings on at least a quarterly basis. 

As
a Nasdaq listed company, we comply with the NASDAQ Listing Rules with respect to certain corporate governance matters. As a smaller reporting
company, under the NASDAQ rules we are required to maintain a board of directors comprised of majority of independent directors, and
an audit committee of at least three (3) members, comprised solely of independent directors who also meet the requirements of Rule 10A-3
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 

Director
Independence 

The
board of directors has reviewed the independence of our directors, applying the NASDAQ independence standards. Based on this review,
the board of directors determined that each of Chuchottaworn Srirat, Louis Ramesh Ruben, Glendening Brent Lewis, and Bringuier Christophe
Philippe Roland are independent within the meaning of the NASDAQ rules. In making this determination, our board of directors considered
the relationships that each of these non-employee directors has with us and all other facts and circumstances our board of directors
deemed relevant in determining their independence. As required under applicable NASDAQ rules that our independent directors will meet
on a regular basis as often as necessary to fulfill their responsibilities, including at least annually in executive session without
the presence of non-independent directors and management. 

59 

Board
Committees 

Our
board of directors has established standing committees in connection with the discharge of its responsibilities. These committees include
an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. Our board of directors has adopted
written charters for each of these committees. Copies of the charters are available on our website. Our board of directors may establish
other committees as it deems necessary or appropriate from time to time. 

Board
Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight 

Mr.
Loke Che Chan Gilbert holds the positions of Chief Financial Officer and Chairman of the Board of the Company. The Board believes that
Mr. Loke s services as both Chief Financial Officer and chairman of the Board is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders.
Mr. Loke possesses detailed and in-depth knowledge of the issues, opportunities and challenges facing the Company in its business and
is thus best positioned to develop agendas that ensure that the Board s time and attention are focused on the most critical matters
relating to the business of the Company. His combined role enables decisive leadership, ensures clear accountability, and enhances the
Company s ability to communicate its message and strategy clearly and consistently to the Company s shareholders, employees,
and customers. 

The
Board has not designated a lead director. Given the limited number of directors comprising the Board, the independent directors call
and plan their executive sessions collaboratively and, between meetings of the Board, communicate with management and one another directly.
Under these circumstances, the directors believe designating a lead director to take on responsibility for functions in which they all
currently participate might detract from rather than enhance performance of their responsibilities as directors. 

Management
is responsible for assessing and managing risk, subject to oversight by the board of directors. The board oversees our risk management
policies and risk appetite, including operational risks and risks relating to our business strategy and transactions. Various committees
of the board assist the board in this oversight responsibility in their respective areas of expertise. 

The
 Audit Committee assists the board with the oversight of our financial reporting, independent auditors, and internal controls. It
 is charged with identifying any flaws in business management and recommending remedies, detecting fraud risks, and implementing anti-fraud
 measures. The Audit Committee further discusses Greenpro s policies with respect to risk assessment, risk management and financial
 reporting. 

The
 Compensation Committee oversees compensation, retention, succession and other human resources-related issues and risks. 

The
 Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee overviews risks relating to our governance policies and initiatives. 

Audit
Committee 

Our
Audit Committee was established on March 23, 2016, and is currently comprised of all our independent directors: Mr. Louis Ramesh Ruben
(Chairman), Ms. Chuchottaworn Srirat, Mr. Glendening Brent Lewis and Mr. Bringuier Christophe Philippe Roland. Mr. Louis is Chair of
the Audit Committee, and he qualifies as the Audit Committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K promulgated
under the Securities Act. 

According
to its charter, the Audit Committee consists of at least three members, each of whom shall be a non-employee director who has been determined
by the Board to meet the independence requirements of NASDAQ, and Rule 10A-3(b)(1) of the SEC, subject to the exemptions provided in
Rule 10A-3(c). The Company s website contains a copy of the Audit Committee Charter. The Audit Committee Charter describes the
primary functions of the Audit Committee, including the following: 

Oversee
 the Company s accounting and financial reporting processes; 

Oversee
 audits of the Company s financial statements; 

Discuss
 policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management, and discuss the Company s major financial risk exposures and

Material
Changes to the Procedures by which Security Holders May Recommend Nominees to the Board 

We
do not currently have a procedure by which security holders may recommend nominees to the Board. 

Director
Qualifications 

The
board of directors is responsible for overseeing the Company s business consistent with their fiduciary duty to the stockholders.
This significant responsibility requires highly skilled individuals with various qualities, attributes and professional experience. There
are general requirements for service on the board that are applicable to directors and there are other skills and experience that should
be represented on the board as a whole, but not necessarily by each director. The board considers the qualifications of director candidates
individually and in the broader context of the board s overall composition and the Company s current and future needs. 

In
its assessment of each potential candidate, including those recommended by the stockholders, the board will consider the nominee s
judgment, integrity, experience, independence, understanding of the Company s business or other related industries and such other
factors it determines are pertinent in the light of the current needs of the board. The board also takes the ability of each potential
candidate into account, such as to evaluate the time and effort necessary to fulfill his or her responsibilities to the Company, business
experiences and specialized skills of each candidate. Diversity of background including diversity of race, ethnicity, international background,
gender and age, may be considered by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee when evaluating candidates for Board membership. 

Code
of Business Conduct and Ethics 

Our
board of directors has adopted a code of ethics that applies to all our directors, officers, and employees, including our principal executive
officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer. The code addresses, among other things, honesty and ethical conduct,
conflicts of interest, compliance with laws, regulations, and policies, including disclosure requirements under the federal securities
laws, confidentiality, trading on inside information, and reporting of violations of the code. The code of ethics is available on the
Company s website greenprocapital.com . 

SECTION

to file reports regarding ownership of, and transactions in, our securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission and to provide

our officers and directors regarding their compliance with applicable reporting requirements under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act,
we believe that all Section 16(a) filing requirements for our directors, executive officers and 10 stockholders, were met during the

ITEM
12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS 

The
following table sets forth, as of March 31, 2023, certain information concerning the beneficial ownership of our Common Stock by: 

(i) 
 each
 stockholder known by us to own beneficially five (5) percent or more of our outstanding Common Stock or series of Common Stock Principal
 Shareholders 

(ii) 
 each
 director; 

(iii) 
 each
 named executive officer; and 

(iv) 
 all
 our directors and executive officers as a group, and their percentage ownership and voting power Directors and Executive
 Officers ). 

The
information presented below regarding beneficial ownership of our voting securities has been presented in accordance with the rules of
the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not necessarily indicative of ownership for any other purpose. Under these rules, a person
is deemed to be a beneficial owner of a security if that person has or shares the power to vote or direct the voting of
the security or the power to dispose or direct the disposition of the security. A person is deemed to own beneficially any security as
to which such person has the right to acquire sole or shared voting or investment power within sixty (60) days through the conversion
or exercise of any convertible security, warrant, option, or other right. More than one (1) person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner
of the same securities. 

The
percentage of beneficial ownership by any person as of a particular date is calculated by dividing the number of shares beneficially
owned by such person, which includes the number of shares as to which such person has the right to acquire voting or investment power
within sixty (60) days, by the sum of the number of shares outstanding as of such date. Consequently, the denominator used for calculating
such percentage may be different for each beneficial owner. Except as otherwise indicated below and under applicable community property
laws, we believe that the beneficial owners of our Common Stock listed below have sole voting and investment power with respect to the
shares shown. 

The
calculations in the table below are based on 7,875,813 shares of our Common Stock, issued and outstanding as of March 31, 2023.

 of Common Stock within 60 days of March 31, 2023. Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the Securities
 and Exchange Commission and generally includes voting or investment power with respect to securities. Shares of Common Stock that
 a person has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of upon the exercise or conversion of options, convertible stock, warrants
 or other securities that are currently exercisable or convertible or that will become exercisable or convertible within 60 days of
 March 31, 2023, are deemed to be beneficially owned by the person holding such securities for the purpose of computing the number
 of shares beneficially owned and percentage of ownership of such person, but are not treated as outstanding for the purpose of computing
 the percentage ownership of any other person.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of 

 Greenpro Capital Corp. 

 B-7-5, Northpoint 

 Mid Valley City 

 No. 1, Medan Syed Putra Utara

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Greenpro Capital Corp. and subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the years ended of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related
notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards
of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform,
an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, for the years
ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred a net loss of 6,262,188 and negative cash flow from operating activities of 2,402,769.
These condition raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard
to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome
of this uncertainty. 

F- 2 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters are matters arising from
the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to those charged with governance
and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,
subjective, or complex judgements. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way of our opinion on the financial
statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical
audit matters or on the accounts or disclosure to which they relate. 

Investments
and Impairment Valuation 

The Company has significant investments as they represented
approximately 34.56 of total assets. As disclosed in Note 6 to the financial statements, the Company had equity securities investments
in companies without readily determinable market values. The Company adopted the guidance of ASC 321, Investments - Equity Securities,
which allows an entity to measure investments in equity securities without a readily determinable fair value using a measurement alternative
that measures these securities at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly
transactions for identical or similar investment of same issuer (the Measurement Alternative ). The Company made qualitative
assessments to evaluate whether the investments are impaired and concluded that the investments are not impaired. 

We identified the impairment valuation of investments
as a critical audit matter due to the significance of the balance to the financial statements as a whole. These investments require significant
judgements as they are private entities that are not trade on public exchange and require the Company to assess if there are any changes
in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount of an investment may require impairment. There were significant judgments made
by management to identify indicators of impairment and determine the fair valuation in the absence of observable prices in an active market
which led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in evaluating management s estimation of the fair value
of the investment including management s assessment of the equity investment financial condition, operating performance, prospects
and other company-specific information. 

Our audit procedure in this area included the following,
among others: 

a) Inspected Board minutes and other appropriate documentation of authorization
to assess whether the transactions were appropriately authorized; 
 
 b) Inquired management to obtain an understanding of the Company s process
in evaluating the indication of impairment and fair value assessments; 
 
 c) Evaluated the Company s assessment of impairment by reviewing valuation
reports by independent valuers of significant investees; 
 
 d) Evaluated the knowledge, skills and ability of the Company s specialist; and 
 
 e) Considered the adequacy of the disclosures in the financial statements in
relation to investments. 

(PCAOB: 

We have served as the Company s auditor since 2021.

 FOR
THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022, AND 2021 

 (Expressed
in U.S. Dollars) 

and net cash used in operating activities
of . These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year
of the date that the financial statements are issued. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary
if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon improving its profitability and the continuing financial support
from its major shareholders. Management believes the existing shareholders or external financing will provide the additional cash to
meet the Company s obligations as they become due. No assurance can be given that any future financing, if needed, will be available
or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company can obtain additional financing,
if needed, it may contain undue restrictions on its operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for its
stockholders, in the case of equity financing. 

(the Reverse Stock Split ),
effective as of July 28, 2022. On that date, every 10 issued and outstanding shares of the Company s Common Stock were automatically
converted into one outstanding share of Common Stock. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, the number of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock decreased from (pre-split) shares to (post-split) shares. In addition, by reducing the number of outstanding
shares, the Company s loss per share in all prior periods increased by a factor of 10. The Reverse Stock Split affected all shares
of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split. In addition, the Reverse Stock Split
effected a reduction in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrants outstanding immediately prior
to the effectiveness of the Reverse Stock Split, resulting in a reduction from (pre-split) shares to (post-split) shares
(see Note 11). 

No
fractional shares are issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders who otherwise would be entitled to receive fractional
shares because they hold a number of pre-reverse stock split shares of the Company s Common Stock not evenly divisible by 10, in
lieu of a fractional share, are entitled the number of shares rounded up to the nearest whole share. The Company will issue one whole
share of the post-Reverse Stock Split Common Stock to any stockholder who otherwise would have received a fractional share as a result
of the Reverse Stock Split. 

The
Reverse Stock Split affected all holders of Common Stock uniformly and did not affect any stockholder s percentage of ownership
interest. The par value of the Company s Common Stock remained unchanged at per share and the number of authorized shares
of Common Stock remained the same after the Reverse Stock Split. 

As
the par value per share of the Company s Common Stock remained unchanged at per share, the change in the Common Stock recorded
at par value has been reclassified to additional paid-in-capital on a retroactive basis. All references to shares of Common Stock and
per share data for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been adjusted to
reflect the Reverse Stock Split on a retroactive basis. 

compared to for the same period
in 2021. The increase in total revenue was mainly derived from the sale of real estate properties during the first quarter and third
quarter of 2022, respectively. When nation-wide shutdowns were mandated the first half of 2020, there was a corresponding decline in
demand for our business services. When business gradually resumed beginning the first half of 2021, we saw a corresponding increase in
orders of our business services. 

The
full extent of the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be reasonably estimated at this time as the pandemic is still ongoing.
The extent to which the COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted,
including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and its variants and the actions taken globally
to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, the efficacy of vaccines on COVID-19 and its variants, among others. Existing insurance
coverage may not provide protection for all costs that may arise from all such possible events. 

Additionally,
the COVID-19 pandemic may also affect our overall ability to react timely to mitigate the impact of this event and may hamper our efforts
to contact our service providers and advisors and to provide our investors with timely information and comply with our filing obligations
with the SEC, especially in the event of office closures, stay-in-place orders and a ban on travel or quarantines. We are still assessing
our business operations and the impact COVID-19 may have on our results and financial condition in the future, but there can be no assurance
that this analysis will enable us to avoid part or all of any impact from the spread of COVID-19 or its consequences, including downturns
in business sentiment generally or in our sector in particular.

leasehold represents three adjoining office units used by the Company located in a commercial building in Shenzhen, China. The office
leasehold is subject to a land lease with a term of years and is being depreciated over the remaining lease term. Expenditures for
maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation, classified as an operating expense, was and for the
years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Management
assesses the carrying value of property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may
not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment, management prepares an estimate of future cash flows expected to result from
the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment
loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company determined
there were no indicators of impairment of its property and equipment.

Equity
securities without readily determinable fair values are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values.
The Company adopted the guidance of ASC 321, Investments - Equity Securities, which allows an entity to measure investments in equity
securities without a readily determinable fair value using a measurement alternative that measures these securities at cost minus impairment,
if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investment of
same issuer (the Measurement Alternative ). The fair value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values
that have been remeasured due to impairment are classified within Level 3. Management assesses each of these investments on an individual
basis. Additionally, on a quarterly basis, management is required to make a qualitative assessment of whether the investment is impaired. 

The Company believes all the invested equity securities
are without readily determinable values even certain of the equity securities are listed in the over the counter (OTC) market, as their
securities are not actively traded on a securities exchange registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or in the

we recorded as other investments in our consolidated balance sheets. We reviewed all our cost method investments quarterly to determine
if impairment indicators were present; however, we were not required to determine fair value of these investments unless impairment indicators
exist. When impairment indicators exist, we generally adopt the valuation methods allowed under ASC820 Fair Value Measurement to evaluate the fair values of our
cost method investments approximated or exceeded their carrying values.
