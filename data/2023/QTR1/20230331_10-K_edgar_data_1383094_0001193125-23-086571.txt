the Southern District of New York alleging claims against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., in its capacity as trustee for a number of residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS trusts. Complaints raising similar allegations have been filed by
Commerzbank AG in the Southern District of New York and by IKB International and IKB Deutsche Industriebank in New York state court. In each case, the plaintiffs allege that Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee, caused losses to investors, and
plaintiffs assert causes of action based upon, among other things, the trustee s alleged failure to notify and enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations and warranties, notify investors of
alleged events of default, and abide by appropriate standards of care following alleged events of default. In July 2022, the district court dismissed Phoenix Light s claims and certain of the claims asserted by Commerzbank AG, and subsequently
entered judgment in each case in favor of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. In August 2022, Phoenix Light and Commerzbank AG appealed the district court s decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The Company previously
settled two class actions filed by institutional investors and an action filed by the National Credit Union Administration with similar allegations. In addition, Park Royal I LLC and Park Royal II LLC have filed substantially similar lawsuits in New
York state court alleging Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee, failed to take appropriate actions upon learning of defective mortgage loan documentation.

Exhibit 33.1 

Management s Assessment of Compliance with SEC Regulation AB Servicing Criteria 

1. 
 Management of Santander Consumer USA Inc. SC is responsible for assessing compliance with the
servicing criteria applicable to it under paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. The transactions covered by this report are all publicly registered transactions backed by auto loans for
which Santander Consumer USA Inc. is the servicer (the Platform ). See Appendix A. 

2. 
 SC s management has assessed SC s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in paragraph(d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB (See Appendix B), except for the following criteria which SC determined are not applicable to the
activities performed by SC or through its vendors with respect to the Platform: 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii), and 1122(d)(4)(xiii). 

3. 
 There were no external enhancements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, with respect to the
Platform taken as a whole. 

4. 
 With respect to servicing criterion, Item 1122(d)(1)(iii), some of the transactions included in the Platform
require the Company to utilize a backup servicer when certain events, which are specified within the transaction agreements, occur. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, the events that would require a backup servicer as listed in the
transaction documents did not occur, and therefore the requirement for a backup servicer does not apply. 

5. 
 SC has engaged vendors that are not servicers as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB to perform limited or
scripted activities with respect to the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor s activities as set forth in Appendix B of this report. SC elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the portion of the servicing criteria
applicable to each such vendor. SC has policies and procedures in place to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with the portion of the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. SC s
management is solely responsible for determining that it meets the requirements to apply Interpretation 200.06 of the SEC Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations. 

6. 
 SC has complied, in all material respects, with the applicable servicing criteria for which it is responsible,
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, with respect to the Platform taken as a whole. 

7. 
 SC s management has not identified and is not aware of any material instance of noncompliance by the
vendors with regard to the applicable servicing criteria, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, with respect to the Platform taken as a whole. 

8. 
 SC s management has not identified any material deficiency in its policies and procedures to monitor the
compliance by the vendors with the applicable servicing criteria, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, with respect to the Platform taken as a whole. 

9. 
 PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report
on SC s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Appendix B to the Company s Assessment of Compliance with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria Wells Fargo s transfer of its roles on the ABS Platform transactions to Computershare is ongoing. As of the beginning of the Period,
Wells Fargo has not transferred to Computershare the roles associated with its trustee (except Delaware trustee or owner trustee), paying agent services, and/or related services, and the duties, rights, and liabilities for such roles, under the
relevant agreements for any of the ABS Platform transactions. During the Period, for all the ABS Platform transactions, Wells Fargo engaged Computershare as a subservicer 1 to perform virtually all
of Wells Fargo s obligations under the transaction agreements. As a result, the Company has determined that Computershare is a party participating in the servicing function with respect to the ABS Platform and the applicable servicing criteria
relevant to the servicing activities performed by Computershare for the ABS Platform (the Computershare Applicable Servicing Criteria ). Accordingly, Computershare is taking, and Wells Fargo is not taking, responsibility for
assessing Computershare s compliance with the Computershare Applicable Servicing Criteria for the ABS Platform, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022.

 ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA 
 Computershare Corporate Trust- ABS Platform The management Management of the Computershare Corporate Trust division of Computershare Trust Company, National Association (the Company is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management has determined that the servicing criteria are applicable to the servicing platform for the period as follows: 
 Purchase of corporate trust business . On November 1, 2021, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Wells Fargo and certain of its affiliates
sold substantially all of its Corporate Trust Services CTS division to the Company, Computershare Delaware Trust Company CDTC ), and Computershare Limited Computershare Limited , and
collectively with the Company and CDTC, Computershare ). Virtually all CTS employees of Wells Fargo, along with most existing CTS systems, technology, and offices transferred to Computershare as part of the sale. 
 For the ABS Platform (defined below) transactions and during the Period, the Company either (i) served directly in the related trustee (except Delaware
trustee or owner trustee), paying agent services, and/or related services, (collectively, the ABS Platform Roles ), or (ii) served as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related ABS Platform Roles. More specifically,
since its acquisition of the Wells Fargo CTS business on November 1, 2021, the Company has closed new ABS transactions for which, during all or a portion of the Period, it performed the related ABS Platform Roles directly (the
 Company s Direct Role Transactions ). The Company s Direct Role Transactions comprise a small percentage of the overall ABS Platform transactions. For a significant majority of ABS Platform transactions, the Company
served, during all or a portion of the Period, as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related ABS Platform Roles (the Company s Agent Role Transactions ). Wells Fargo had not, as of the beginning of the Period,
transferred to Computershare the ABS Platform Roles for the Company s Agent Role Transactions, and therefore the Company performed, during all or a portion of the Period, virtually all of Wells Fargo s contractual duties for such
transactions as its agent. As a result, for the Company s Agent Role Transactions, the Company and Wells Fargo have determined that the Company is a party participating in the servicing function with respect to the ABS Platform, and
accordingly, the Company is taking responsibility for assessing its compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria (defined below) relevant to the servicing activities performed by the Company for the ABS Platform, as of and for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2022. Period : As of January 1, 2022 through and including December 31, 2022 (the Period ).
 Platform : The platform consists of asset-backed securities ABS transactions for which the Company provides trustee (except
Delaware trustee or owner trustee), paying agent services, and/or related services, either directly in the related role for such services or as the agent of the party performing such services, and for which either (i) some or all of the issued
securities for such ABS transactions were publicly offered pursuant to a registration statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (ii) the issued securities for such ABS transactions were privately offered pursuant to
an exemption from registration and the Company (and/or the party for whom it acts as agent) has an obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of
Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform excludes (a) any transactions for which the securities issued are mortgage-backed securities or mortgage-related asset-backed securities and (b) any ABS transactions for which the issuing
entity has a fiscal year that ends on a date other than the end of the calendar year (the ABS Platform ). Appendix A identifies the individual transactions defined by Management as constituting the ABS Platform for the
Period. 

Applicable Servicing Criteria : All servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are applicable to
either the Company s obligations, or the obligations of the party for whom the Company ultimately acts as agent, in either case under the related transaction agreements with respect to the ABS Platform for the Period (as applicable, the
 Company s Obligations ), except for the following servicing criteria: 1122(d)(1)(v), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(B), 1122(d)(3)(i)(C), 1122(d)(3)(i)(D), 1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(v), 1122(d)(4)(vi),

agreements with respect to the ABS Platform for the Period; provided however that, with respect to the ABS Platform (a) servicing criterion 1122(d)(3)(i)(A) is applicable only as it relates to the Company s Obligation to distribute or make

Company has engaged a vendor for certain transactions in the ABS Platform to handle making payments to investors and/or third parties by check, and such vendor also safeguards any unissued checks. Management has determined that the vendor is not
considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and Management elects to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the portion of the servicing criterion applicable to the vendor as permitted by the SEC s
 Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation C DI 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06 . The Company has policies and procedures in place designed to provide
reasonable assurance that the vendor s activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criterion applicable to the vendor. Management is solely responsible for determining that the Company meets the SEC requirements to apply
 C DI 200.06 for the vendor and the related servicing criterion. With respect to the ABS Platform and the Period, Management provides the
following assessment of the Company s compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria: 1. Management is responsible for assessing the
Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 2. Management has assessed the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria including the servicing criterion for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 as described above. In performing this assessment, Management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in
paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. 3. With respect to Applicable Servicing Criteria 1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(xv), Management has
determined that there were no activities performed during the Period with respect to the ABS Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities. 
 4. Based on such assessment for the Period, the Company has complied in all material respects with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Period.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Management of Santander Consumer USA Inc. 
 We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management s Assessment of Compliance with SEC Regulation AB Servicing
Criteria, that Santander Consumer USA Inc. (the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for all publicly registered transactions backed by
auto loans for which Santander Consumer USA Inc. is the servicer (the Platform ), as of December 31, 2022 and for the year then ended, excluding criteria 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x),
1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii), and 1122(d)(4)(xiii), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the servicing activities performed by it with respect to the Platform. As described in management s assertion, for servicing criteria
1122(d)(2)(i), 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii) and 1122(d)(4)(viii), the Company has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria. The Company has determined
that these vendors are not considered servicers as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted
by Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance s interpretations of the rules adopted under Regulation AB and the Securities Act and the Exchange Act Interpretation 200.06 ). As
permitted by Interpretation 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria
applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply Interpretation 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with
respect to the Company s determination of its eligibility to use Interpretation 200.06. Appendix A to management s assertion identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the
Platform. Santander Consumer USA Inc. s management is responsible for its assertion and for the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about
the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria based on our examination. Our examination was conducted in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about compliance with the applicable servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all material respects, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence
about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of selected asset-backed transactions and securities
that comprise the Platform, testing of selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria. Our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors
that may have occurred prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides, and that the evidence
we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide, a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria.

the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria based on our examination. Our examination was conducted in accordance with the

not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected
transactions or any other transactions. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria.
