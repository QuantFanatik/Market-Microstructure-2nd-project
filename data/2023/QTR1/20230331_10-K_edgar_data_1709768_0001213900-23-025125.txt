Cautionary
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

This
Annual Report on Form 10-K (this Annual Report ), including, without limitation, statements under the heading Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, includes forward-looking statements within the meaning
of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements
regarding our or our management team s expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions or strategies regarding the future. In addition,
any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying
assumptions, are forward-looking statements. The words anticipate, believe, continue, could, 
 estimate, expect, intend, look, may, might, plan, 
 possible, potential, predict, project, should, would 
and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not
forward-looking. There can be no assurance that actual results will not materially differ from expectations. Such statements include,
but are not limited to, any statements relating to our ability to consummate any acquisition or other business combination and any other
statements that are not statements of current or historical facts. These statements are based on management s current expectations,
but actual results may differ materially due to various factors, including, but not limited to: 

our
 inability to complete our initial business combination; 

the
 lack of a market for our securities; or 

our
 financial performance. 

The
forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments
and their potential effects on us. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that we have anticipated.
These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) or other assumptions
that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.
These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors described under the heading Risk Factors .
Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may
vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable
securities laws. These risks and others described under Risk Factors may not be exhaustive. 

By
their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that
may or may not occur in the future. We caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that
our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and developments in the industry in which we operate may differ
materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report. In addition, even if our
results or operations, financial condition and liquidity, and developments in the industry in which we operate are consistent with the
forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments
in subsequent periods.

PART
I 

Item
1. Business 

Introduction 

Sentinel
Energy Services Inc. (the Company was formed as a blank check company for the purpose of effecting a merger, amalgamation,
capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses.
The Company is a smaller reporting company as defined in the Exchange Act. 

The
Company was incorporated on June 5, 2017 in the Cayman Islands. On December 28, 2018, the Company changed its jurisdiction of incorporation
(the Domestication from the Cayman Islands Sentinel Cayman to the State of Delaware Sentinel Delaware and continued to be named Sentinel Energy Services Inc. As a result of the Domestication, the securities of Sentinel Cayman converted
into securities of Sentinel Delaware, such that Sentinel Cayman s issued and outstanding Class A ordinary shares (the Class
A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares (the Class B ordinary shares automatically converted by operation
of law into one share of Class A common stock Class A common stock and Class B common stock Class B common stock ),
of Sentinel Delaware, respectively. Similarly, each of Sentinel Cayman s outstanding units and warrants, automatically converted
by operation of law, on a one-for-one basis, into Units (defined below) of Sentinel Delaware and warrants, including the Private Placement
Warrants and Public Warrants (each as defined below) to acquire the corresponding number of shares of Class A common stock, respectively.
All references to the Company s capital stock both before and after the Domestication are referred to as shares of common
stock in this filing. 

As
of December 31, 2022, the Company has not yet commenced operations. All activity through December 31, 2022 related to (1) the Company s
formation and issuance of the Founder Shares in June 2017, (2) the Public Offering and sale of Private Placement Warrants (each as defined
below) which closed in November 2017, (3) the subsequent search for a business combination candidate, including activities in connection
with the announced and subsequently terminated proposed business combination with Strike Capital, LLC Strike and (4)
liquidation activities following the Company s inability to consummate a business combination prior to the November 7, 2019 deadline
under the Company s certificate of incorporation (the Charter ). The Company has not generated any operating revenues
since inception. The Company generated non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents from the proceeds
derived from the Public Offering and sale of Private Placement Warrants until November 2019. 

Our
management team is led by Andrew Gould, our Chairman, who has more than 42 years of experience in global energy and related business,
and Gerald Cimador, our Chief Financial Officer, who has extensive financial and accounting experience in account and private investment
management firms. To date, our efforts have been limited to organizational activities as well as activities related to the Public Offering
and sale of Private Placement Warrants, the identification and evaluation of prospective acquisition targets for a business combination,
and subsequent liquidation activities. 

Offerings
and Liquidation 

The
Company intended to finance its initial business combination with proceeds from Company s initial public offering (the Public
Offering of its units (the Units ), each of which consisted of (A) one share of the Company s Class A common
stock, par value 0.0001 per share (the Public Shares ), and (B) one-third of one warrant exercisable to purchase one share
of the Company s Class A common stock (each whole warrant, a Public Warrant ), and from the Company s private
placement sale of warrants exercisable to purchase one share of Company s Class A common stock (each, a Private Placement
Warrant to Sentinel Management Holdings, LLC (the Sponsor ). 

1 

The
Public Offering closing occurred in November 2017 for a total of 34,500,000 Units, including Units issued in connection with the exercise
of the underwriters overallotment option in the Public Offering, with gross proceeds of 345 million at a price of 10.00 per
Unit. The sale of the Private Placement Warrants also closed in November 2017 for a total of 5,933,333 Private Placement Warrants, including
an additional issuance to the Sponsor in connection with the exercise of the underwriter s overallotment option in the Public Offering,
with gross proceeds of approximately 8.9 million at a price of 1.50 per Private Placement Warrant. 

Following
the Public Offering and sale of the Private Placement Warrants, the Company searched for a business to combine with in a transaction
that would generate value for the Company s stockholders. However, over the same period, the energy sector experienced significant
headwinds, which increased the challenges faced by the Company in sourcing a compelling target business. Despite the Company s
best efforts, it was not able to consummate a business combination prior to the November 7, 2019 deadline under its Charter. As a result
and in accordance with the Charter, the Company commenced the liquidation of the trust account which had a balance of approximately 355.5
million (the Trust Account following a holdback of approximately 1.35 million for Company s income tax liability
for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and dissolution expenses, and returned the funds held therein to its public stockholders
by redeeming all of the Public Shares included in the Units at a price of approximately 10.30 per share on November 18, 2019. The Company
subsequently made a final distribution of 1,152,035, or approximately 0.03 per former Public Share, on May 4, 2020 following the Company s
payment of its income tax liability of 259,284 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and payment of settlement expenses of 100,351
in connection with the distribution. The Trust Account was subsequently closed with no balance remaining. 

In
addition, during the liquidation period, the Company and the holders of its Public Warrants executed an amendment to the Warrant Agreement,
dated as of November 2, 2017, between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company, which automatically converted the
Public Warrants into the right to receive 0.02 per whole Public Warrant, payable in cash. In December 2019, the Company paid 225,990
to the holders of the Public Warrants in connection with the conversion. The Sponsor forfeited the Private Placement Warrants as a result
of the Company being unable to consummate a business combination prior to the deadline in its Charter. 

As
of December 31, 2022, there are no Units, Public Shares, Public Warrants or Private Placement Warrants outstanding. Additional shares
of Class A common stock have been issued and shares of Class B common stock remain outstanding. For more information, please see Item
13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence-Certain Relationships and Related Transactions. 

Employees 

We
do not anticipate having any employees as we were unable to successfully consummate a business combination. We currently have two officers
and may elect additional officers from time to time, including an officer to serve as our Chief Executive Officer. Our officers are not
paid for their services to us and we do not expect any such payments as we were unable to successfully consummate a business combination.
These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters. The amount of time that they will devote in
any time period will vary. 

Available
Information 

We
are required to file Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
 SEC on a regular basis, and are required to disclose certain material events (e.g., changes in corporate control, acquisitions
or dispositions of a significant amount of assets other than in the ordinary course of business and bankruptcy) in a Current Report on
Form 8-K. The SEC maintains an Internet website that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding
issuers that file electronically with the SEC. The SEC s Internet website is located at http://www.sec.gov. In addition, the Company
will provide copies of these documents without charge upon request in writing at 700 Louisiana Street, Suite 2700, Houston, Texas 77002
or by telephone at (281) 407-0686. The Company does not have an Internet website.

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

You
should carefully consider all of the following risk factors and all the other information contained in this Annual Report, including
the financial statements. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially
and adversely affected. The risk factors described below are not necessarily exhaustive and you are encouraged to perform your own investigation
with respect to us and our business. 

The
Nasdaq Capital Market (the NASDAQ delisted our securities from trading on its exchange, which may limit investors 
ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions. 

Our
Class A common stock, warrants and units were listed on NASDAQ and were subsequently delisted. We cannot assure you that our securities
will be listed on NASDAQ in the future. 

We
may not have sufficient funds to satisfy indemnification claims of our directors and officers. 

We
have agreed to indemnify our officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by law. Accordingly, any indemnification provided
will be able to be satisfied by us only if we have sufficient funds or we consummate an initial business combination, which we were unable
to do by the deadline in our Charter. Our obligation to indemnify our officers and directors may discourage stockholders from bringing
a lawsuit against our officers or directors for breach of their fiduciary duties. These provisions also may have the effect of reducing
the likelihood of derivative litigation against our officers and directors, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise
benefit us and our stockholders. Furthermore, a stockholder s investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs
of settlement and damage awards against our officers and directors pursuant to these indemnification provisions. 

We
may file a winding up petition or a winding up petition may be filed against us that is not dismissed, and in that case a liquidator
may seek to recover the proceeds we distributed from the Trust Account and the members of our board of directors may be viewed as having
breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors, thereby potentially exposing the members of our board of directors and us to claims
of punitive damages. 

We
may file a winding up petition or a winding up petition may be filed against us that is not dismissed. Any distributions received by
stockholders from the Trust Account could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or insolvency laws as a voidable preference. 
As a result, a liquidator could seek to challenge the transaction and recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. In addition,
our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or having acted in bad faith, thereby
exposing itself and us to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims
of creditors. 

If
we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements
and our activities may be restricted. 

If
we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, our activities may be restricted, including: 

restrictions
 on the nature of our investments; and 

restrictions
 on the issuance of securities, each of which may make it difficult for us to complete our
 business combination, which we were unable to do by the deadline in our Charter. 

In
addition, we may have imposed upon us burdensome requirements, including: 

registration
 as an investment company; 

adoption
 of a specific form of corporate structure; and 

reporting,
 record keeping, voting, proxy and disclosure requirements and other rules and regulations. 

3 

In
order not to be regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, unless we can qualify for an exclusion, we would
need to ensure that we are engaged primarily in a business other than investing, reinvesting or trading of securities and that our activities
do not include investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading investment securities constituting more than 40 of our
assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. Our business would need to identify and complete
a business combination and thereafter operate the post-transaction business or assets for the long term. We do not plan to buy businesses
or assets with a view to resale or profit from their resale. We do not plan to buy unrelated businesses or assets or to be a passive
investor. We were unable to complete a business combination by the deadline in our Charter. 

Changes
in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect our business, including our ability
to negotiate and complete an initial business combination, and results of operations. 

We
are subject to laws and regulations enacted by national, regional and local governments. In particular, we will be required to comply
with certain SEC and other legal requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult,
time consuming and costly. Those laws and regulations and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and
those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to
comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business. We were
unable to complete a business combination by the deadline in our Charter. 

Our
stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them upon redemption
of their shares. 

If
we are forced to enter into an insolvent liquidation, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed as an unlawful payment
if it was proved that immediately following the date on which the distribution was made, we were unable to pay our debts as they fall
due in the ordinary course of business. As a result, a liquidator could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders.
Furthermore, our directors may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to us or our creditors and/or may have acted in bad
faith, thereby exposing themselves and our company to claims, by paying public stockholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing
the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. 

We
may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders, which could delay the opportunity for our stockholders to elect directors. 

We
may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders until after the consummation of an initial business combination, which could delay the
opportunity for our stockholders to elect directors. There is no requirement under the DGCL for us to hold annual or general meetings
to elect directors. Until we hold an annual meeting of stockholders, public stockholders may not be afforded the opportunity to elect
directors and to discuss company affairs with management. Our board of directors is divided into three classes with only one class of
directors being elected in each year and each class (except for those directors appointed prior to our first annual meeting of stockholders)
serving a three-year term. We were unable to complete a business combination by the deadline in our Charter, and thus a business combination
is unlikely. 

The
past performance of CSL, Mr. Gould, Mr. Shivram and other members of our management team may not be indicative of future performance
of an investment in the Company. 

Information
regarding performance by, or businesses associated with, CSL and its affiliates, Mr. Gould, and Mr. Shivram is presented for informational
purposes only. Past performance by CSL, Mr. Gould, Mr. Shivram and other members of our management team is not a guarantee either (i)
of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate or (ii) that we will be able to locate a suitable candidate for
our initial business combination. You should not rely on the historical record of CSL s or, Mr. Gould s, Mr. Shivram s
or other members of our management team s performance as indicative of our future performance of an investment in the company or
the returns the company will, or is likely to, generate going forward. None of our officers or directors have had experience with blank
check companies or special purpose acquisition companies in the past. Mr. Shivram resigned as Chief Executive Officer of the Company
effective as of December 30, 2020, and remains a member of the board of directors of the Company. We were unable to complete a business
combination by the deadline in our Charter, and thus a business combination is unlikely. 

4 

We
are dependent upon our officers and directors, and their loss could adversely affect our ability to operate. 

Our
operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of individuals and, in particular, our officers and directors. We believe that
our success depends on the continued service of our officers and directors. In addition, our officers and directors are not required
to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating their time among
various business activities. We do not have an employment agreement with, or key-man insurance on the life of, any of our directors or
officers. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our directors or officers could have a detrimental effect on us. 

Our
officers, directors, security holders and their respective affiliates may have competitive pecuniary interests that conflict with our
interests. 

We
have not adopted a policy that expressly prohibits our directors, officers, security holders or affiliates from having a direct or indirect
pecuniary or financial interest in any investment to be acquired or disposed of by us or in any transaction to which we are a party or
have an interest. We do not have a policy that expressly prohibits any such persons from engaging for their own account in business activities
of the types conducted by us. Accordingly, such persons or entities may have a conflict between their interests and ours. 

The
holders of the Founder Shares control a substantial interest in us and thus may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a
stockholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support. 

The
Founder Shares entitle the holders to elect all of our directors prior to an initial business combination. We were unable to complete
a business combination by the deadline in our Charter, and thus a business combination is unlikely. Holders of Class A common stock will
have no right to vote on the election of directors during such time. This provision of our Charter may only be amended by a resolution
passed by a majority of at least two-thirds of our common stock entitled to vote on such amendment. As a result, holders of Class A common
stock do not have any influence over the election of directors prior to an initial business combination. Accordingly, holders of Founder
Shares may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a stockholder vote, potentially in a manner that holders of Class A common
stock do not support, including amendments to our Charter and approval of major corporate transactions. If the holders of the Founder
Shares purchase any additional common stock in privately negotiated transactions, this would increase their control. Neither the holders
of the Founder Shares nor, to our knowledge, any of our officers or directors have any current intention to purchase additional securities,
other than in connection with funding our ongoing operations and expenses. In addition, our board of directors, whose members were elected
by the then-holders of the Founder Shares, is and will be divided into three classes, each of which will generally serve for a term of
three years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. We may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders to elect new
directors prior to the completion of a business combination, in which case all of the current directors will continue in office until
at least the completion of a business combination. If there is an annual meeting, as a consequence of our staggered board
of directors, only a minority of the board of directors will be considered for election and our Sponsor, because of its ownership position
through the Founder Shares, will have considerable influence regarding the outcome. 

We
are a smaller reporting company under the federal securities laws and will be subject to reduced
public company reporting requirements. 

We
are a smaller reporting company, and as such we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements
that are applicable to other public companies that are not smaller reporting companies, including, but not limited to,
reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We will remain a smaller
reporting company as long as, on each annual determination date, we either (a) have an unaffiliated public float of less than 250 million
on the annual determination date or (b) had annual revenues of less than 100 million as of the previously completed fiscal year for
which audited financial statements are available and on the annual determination date either (i) have no unaffiliated public float or
(ii) have an unaffiliated public float of less than 700 million. If we fail to satisfy these conditions on the annual determination
date in any year, we will cease to qualify as a smaller reporting company. If we do not qualify as a smaller reporting company, we may
incur additional costs complying with enhanced reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not smaller
reporting companies.

Cyber
incidents or attacks directed at us could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss. 

We
depend on digital technologies, including information systems, infrastructure and cloud applications and services, including those of
third parties with which we may deal. Sophisticated and deliberate attacks on, or security breaches in, our systems or infrastructure,
or the systems or infrastructure of third parties or the cloud, could lead to corruption or misappropriation of our assets, proprietary
information and sensitive or confidential data. As an early stage company without significant investments in data security protection,
we may not be sufficiently protected against such occurrences. We may not have sufficient resources to adequately protect against, or
to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to, cyber incidents. It is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of
them, could have adverse consequences on our business and lead to financial loss.

7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Overview 

The
Company was formed as a blank check company for the purpose of effecting a merger, amalgamation, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition,
stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. For more information about the Company, please
see Item 1. Business in this Annual Report. 

Results
of Operations 

We
have not generated any operating revenues to date, and we will likely not generate any operating revenues in the future. Our entire activity
up to December 31, 2022 has related (1) the Company s formation and issuance of the Founder Shares in June 2017, (2) the Public
Offering and sale of Private Placement Warrants which closed in November 2017, (3) the subsequent search for a business combination candidate,
including activities in connection with the announced and subsequently terminated proposed business combination with Strike, and (4)
liquidation activities following the Company s inability to consummate a business combination prior to the November 7, 2019 deadline
under the Company s Charter. 

For
the year ended December 31, 2022, we had a net loss of 101,621, which consisted of 101,621 of general and administrative expenses.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we had a net loss of 112,810, which consisted of 112,810 of general and administrative expenses.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

We
presently have no revenue; our net loss was 101,621 and 112,810 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and consisted
primarily of professional fees. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our liquidity needs were satisfied through funding from
our Sponsor. The Company does not expect to seek loans, advances or contributions from parties other than the Sponsor or an affiliate
of the Sponsor. 

Loans
and Advances from Related Party 

During
the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor incurred certain administrative expenses on behalf
of the Company in the amount of 0 and 11,188, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the outstanding balance on the expenses
paid on the Company s behalf was 0 and 0, respectively. The Company repaid 3,731 and 7,457 during the years ended December
31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, to the Sponsor using cash on hand. 

Contributions
from Related Party 

In
May 2021, the Company received a contribution of 35,000 from the Sponsor to fund ongoing operations and expenses. The amount advanced
by the Sponsor was treated as a capital contribution in exchange for which the Company issued to the Sponsor 3,500 shares of the Company s
Class A common stock at 10.00 per share on May 3, 2021. 

In
January 2022, the Company received a contribution of 25,000 from the Sponsor to fund ongoing operations and expenses. The amount advanced
by the Sponsor was treated as a capital contribution in exchange for which the Company issued to the Sponsor 2,500 shares of the Company s
Class A common stock at 10.00 per share on January 25, 2022. 

In
September 2022, the Company received a contribution of 30,000 from the Sponsor to fund ongoing operations and expenses. The amount
advanced by the Sponsor was treated as a capital contribution in exchange for which the Company issued to the Sponsor 3,000 shares of
the Company s Class A common stock at 10.00 per share on September 20, 2022. 

In
December 2022, the Company received a contribution of 60,000 from the Sponsor to fund ongoing operations and expenses. The amount advanced
by the Sponsor was treated as a capital contribution in exchange for which the Company issued to the Sponsor 6,000 shares of the Company s
Class A common stock at 10.00 per share on December 13, 2022. 

Mandatory
Liquidation 

We
were unable to complete an initial business combination by the November 7, 2019 deadline under our Charter and so we commenced the liquidation
of the assets in the Trust Account on November 8, 2019. This raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1 to the financial statements. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Liquidity
and Going Concern 

In
connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards
Board Accounting Standards Update 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going
Concern, the Company determined that it does not have sufficient liquidity to meet its future obligations; however, management
has determined that, pursuant to a commitment letter from the Sponsor, it has access to funds from the Sponsor that alleviate going concern.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had a working capital deficit of 293,132, current liabilities of 325,512 and cash of 21,963. 

Pursuant
a commitment letter from the Sponsor, the Sponsor intends to financially support the Company sufficient for the Company to satisfy its
working capital needs until at least March 31, 2023. For more information regarding our liquidity, see -Liquidity and Capital
Resources above.

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

Net
Loss per Share of Common Stock 

Net
loss per share of common stock is computed by dividing net loss applicable to the shares of common stock by the weighted average number
of shares outstanding for the periods. As a result of the redemption of Public Shares in November 2019, for the years ended December
31, 2022 and 2021, shares of Class A common stock have no specific redemption rights. Net loss per common share is calculated by dividing
the net loss by the weighted average number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock outstanding for the periods. 

JOBS
Act 

The
Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements
for qualifying public companies. Companies that qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act are allowed to
comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies and are
eligible for reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. We are no longer an emerging growth company after December 31,
2022 due to the passing the fifth anniversary of the completion of the Public Offering. As a result, we must adopt all accounting pronouncements
as of public company effective dates and are no longer eligible for reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2022. 

Contractual
Obligations 

We
do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities. 

The
underwriters in the Public Offering were entitled to deferred underwriting commissions of 12,075,000. The deferred underwriting commissions
would have become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that we complete an initial
business combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. The underwriters were not entitled to any interest accrued
on the deferred underwriting commissions. Because we were unable to complete an initial business combination under the November 7, 2019
deadline under our Charter, the underwriters will not receive the deferred underwriting commission.

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Sentinel Energy Services Inc. (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and
2021, and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit and cash flows for the years then ended, and the
related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Financial Officer (the Certifying Officer who is both our principal executive and principal financial officer, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on
the evaluation, our Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period
covered by this Annual Report. 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including
our Certifying Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

We
believe, however, that a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives
of the controls systems are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of
fraud or error, if any, within a company have been detected. 

Management s
Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined
in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision of our Chief Financial Officer, management conducted an evaluation
of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on the framework set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based
on that evaluation, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange
Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

Number
and Terms of Office of Executive Officers and Directors 

Our
board of directors is divided into three classes, each of which serves for a term of three years with only one class of directors being
elected in each year. There is no cumulative voting with respect to the election of directors, with the result that the holders of more
than 50 of the shares voted for the election of directors can elect all of the directors. Following the Domestication, the board of
directors assigned terms of office to our directors in office in accordance with the Charter filed in connection therewith. The term
of office of the first class of directors, consisting of Jon Marshall, was to expire at our first annual meeting of stockholders. The
term of office of the second class of directors, consisting of Marc Zenner and Mr. Shivram, was to expire at the second annual meeting
of stockholders. The term of office for the third class of directors, consisting of Messrs. Leykum and Gould, was to expire at the third
annual meeting of stockholders. We do not currently intend to hold an annual meeting of stockholders and no annual meeting has been held
since the Domestication. A director holds office until the annual meeting of stockholders for the year in which his or her term expires
and until his or her successor has been elected and qualified, subject, however, to such director s earlier death, resignation,
retirement, disqualification or removal. As a result, no term of office of any of the directors has expired by the passage of time. Messrs.
Zenner and Marshall have subsequently resigned on May 28, 2020. 

Our
officers are appointed by the board of directors and serve at the discretion of the board of directors, rather than for specific terms
of office. Our board of directors is authorized to appoint persons to the offices set forth in our bylaws as it deems appropriate. Our
bylaws provide that our officers may consist of a Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer,
Vice Presidents, Secretary, Treasurer and such other offices as may be determined by the board of directors. 

Delinquent
Section 16(a) Reports 

Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors, executive officers and persons who own more than 10 of the shares of our common stock
to file an initial report of ownership on Form 3 and changes in ownership on Form 4 or Form 5 with the SEC. The SEC rules require us
to disclose late filings of initial reports of stock ownership and changes in stock ownership by our directors, executive officers and
10 stockholders. 

Based
solely on a review of copies of Forms 3, 4 and 5 filed with the SEC, we believe that during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022,
all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to our directors, executive officers and 10 stockholders were completed in a timely
manner, except that our Sponsor, CSL Sentinel Holdings, LLC and Mr. Leykum each had one late form 4 filing on May 23, 2022 on which one
transaction was reported late, one late form 4 filing on November 14, 2022, on which one transaction was reported late and one late form
4 filing on March 31, 2023, on which one transaction was reported late. 

Director
Independence 

An
 independent director is defined generally as a person other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries
or any other individual having a relationship which in the opinion of the company s board of directors, would interfere with the
director s exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Our board of directors has not
determined that any of our directors are independent directors as defined in applicable SEC rules. 

Committees
of the Board of Directors 

In
connection with our liquidation due to our inability to complete an initial business combination prior to the November 7, 2019 deadline
in our Charter, we disbanded the audit committee, the compensation committee and the nominating and corporate governance committee in
order to consolidate our operations and implement cost-saving measures. 

12 

Compensation
Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 

None
of our executive officers currently serves, and in the past year has not served, as a member of the board of directors or compensation
committee of any entity that has one or more of its executive officers serving on our board of directors. 

Code
of Ethics 

We
have adopted a Code of Ethics applicable to our directors, executive officers and any future employees. We filed copies of our form of
Code of Ethics as exhibits to our registration statement in connection with our initial public offering. You will be able to review these
documents by accessing our public filings at the SEC s web site at www.sec.gov. In addition, a copy of the Code of Ethics will
be provided without charge upon request from us in writing at 700 Louisiana Street, Suite 2700, Houston, Texas 77002 or by telephone
at (281) 407-0686. We intend to disclose any amendments to or waivers of certain provisions of our Code of Ethics in a Current Report
on Form 8-K. 

Limitation
on Liability and Indemnification of Officers and Directors 

Our
Charter provides for the indemnification of our officers and directors by us to the fullest extent authorized by Delaware law, as it
now exists or may in the future be amended. In addition, our Charter provides that our directors will not be personally liable for monetary
damages to us or our stockholders for breaches of their fiduciary duty as directors, unless they violated their duty of loyalty to us
or our stockholders, acted in bad faith, knowingly or intentionally violated the law, authorized unlawful payments of dividends, unlawful
stock purchases or unlawful redemptions, or derived an improper personal benefit from their actions as directors. 

We
have entered into agreements with our officers and directors to provide contractual indemnification in addition to the indemnification
provided for in our Charter. Our bylaws also permit us to secure insurance on behalf of any officer, director or employee for any liability
arising out of his or her actions, regardless of whether Delaware law would permit such indemnification. We have purchased a policy of
directors and officers liability insurance that insures our officers and directors against the cost of defense, settlement
or payment of a judgment in some circumstances and insures us against our obligations to indemnify our officers and directors. 

These
provisions may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions
also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against officers and directors, even though such an action,
if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders. Furthermore, a stockholder s investment may be adversely affected
to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against officers and directors pursuant to these indemnification provisions. 

We
believe that these provisions, the directors and officers liability insurance and the indemnity agreements are necessary
to attract and retain talented and experienced officers and directors. 

Item
11. Executive Compensation 

None
of our executive officers or directors have received any cash or other compensation for services rendered to us. Our Sponsor, executive
officers, directors, or any of their respective affiliates, are reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with
activities on our behalf, including previous activities related to identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence
on suitable business combinations. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such persons
in connection with activities on our behalf. 

Item
12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters 

The
following table sets forth information available to us at March 31, 2023 regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock held
by: 

each
 person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5 of our outstanding common stock; 

each
 of our executive officers and directors that beneficially owns our common stock; and 

all
 our executive officers and directors as a group. 

13 

In
the table below, percentage ownership is based on 565,911 shares of Class A common stock, or the Founders Shares, and 862,500 shares
of Class B common stock issued and outstanding as of March 31, 2023. Voting power represents the combined voting power of Class A common
stock or Class B common stock owned beneficially by such person. On all matters to be voted upon, the holders of the Class A commons
stock and Class B common stock generally vote together as a single class. 

Unless
otherwise indicated, we believe that all persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all common
stock beneficially owned by them.

 be deemed to have or share beneficial ownership of the shares of common stock held directly by the Sponsor. Mr. Leykum and CSL Sentinel
 Holdings, LLC disclaim beneficial ownership of these shares in excess of their pecuniary interest, if any, therein. 

Item
13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence 

Certain
Relationships and Related Transactions 

The
following is a summary of transactions that occurred on or were in effect after January 1, 2021 to which we have been a party in which
the amount involved exceeded the lesser of 120,000 or one percent of the average of our total assets at year-end for the last two completed
fiscal years and in which any of our executive officers, directors or beneficial holders of more than 5 of our capital stock had or
will have a direct or indirect material interest. 

Registration
Rights 

Following
the redemption of the Public Shares, the conversion of the Public Warrants and the forfeiture of the Private Placement Warrants, the
only securities of the Company outstanding were shares of Class B common stock (the Founder Shares ). The holders of Founders
Shares that may be issued equity securities of the Company upon conversion of working capital loans may be entitled to registration rights
(in the case of the Founder Shares, only after conversion of such shares to shares of Class A common stock) pursuant to a registration
rights agreement, by and between the Company, the Sponsor and Mr. Zenner. The registration rights include certain demand and piggyback 
rights. 

14 

However,
the registration rights agreement provides that the Company will not permit any registration statement filed under the Securities Act
to become effective until termination of the applicable lock-up period for the securities to be registered. The Company will bear the
expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. 

Loans
and Advances from Related Party 

The
Company does not expect to seek loans, advances or contributions from parties other than the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor.
During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor incurred certain administrative expenses
on behalf of the Company in the amount of 0. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the outstanding balance on the expenses paid on the Company s
behalf was 0 and 0, respectively. The Company repaid the 3,730 incurred in the year ended December 31, 2021 to the Sponsor using cash
on hand. 

Contributions
from Related Party 

In
May 2021, the Company received a contribution of 35,000 from the Sponsor to fund ongoing operations and expenses. The amount advanced
by the Sponsor was treated as a capital contribution in exchange for which the Company issued to the Sponsor 3,500 shares of the Company s
Class A common stock at 10.00 per share on May 3, 2021. 

In
January 2022, the Company received a contribution of 25,000 from the Sponsor to fund ongoing operations and expenses. The amount advanced
by the Sponsor was treated as a capital contribution in exchange for which the Company issued to the Sponsor 2,500 shares of the Company s
Class A common stock at 10.00 per share on January 25, 2022. 

In
September 2022, the Company received a contribution of 30,000 from the Sponsor to fund ongoing operations and expenses. The amount
advanced by the Sponsor was treated as a capital contribution in exchange for which the Company issued to the Sponsor 3,000 shares of
the Company s Class A common stock at 10.00 per share on September 20, 2022. 

In
December 2022, the Company received a contribution of 60,000 from the Sponsor to fund ongoing operations and expenses. The amount advanced
by the Sponsor was treated as a capital contribution in exchange for which the Company issued to the Sponsor 6,000 shares of the Company s
Class A common stock at 10.00 per share on December 13, 2022. 

Administrative
Support Agreement 

Commencing
on the date the Units were first listed on the NASDAQ, the Company agreed to pay an affiliate of the Sponsor up to 10,000 per month
for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support. Since the Company was unable to complete its initial business
combination prior to the November 7, 2019 deadline in the Charter, pursuant to the Administrative Support Agreement, the Company ceased
paying these monthly fees. The Administrative Support Agreement, however, remains in place for the benefit of the Company. 

The
Company did not incur any expenses under the administrative service agreement for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

Item
14. Principal Accountant Fees and Services. 

The
firm of WithumSmith+Brown, PC acts as our independent registered public accounting firm. The following is a summary of fees paid to WithumSmith+Brown,
PC for services rendered. 

15 

Audit
Fees . Audit fees consist of fees billed for professional services rendered for the audit of our year-end financial statements and
services that are normally provided by WithumSmith+Brown, PC in connection with regulatory filings. The aggregate fees billed by WithumSmith+Brown,
PC for professional services rendered for the audit of our annual financial statements, and other required filings with the SEC for the
years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 totaled approximately 34,000 and 34,000, respectively. The above amounts include interim procedures
and audit fees. 

Audit-Related
Fees . Audit-related services consist of fees billed for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to performance
of the audit or review of our financial statements and are not reported under Audit Fees. These services include attest
services that are not required by statute or regulation and consultations concerning financial accounting and reporting standards. During
the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we did not pay for consultations concerning financial accounting and reporting standards. 

Tax
Fees . We paid 4,800 and 3,500, respectively, to WithumSmith+Brown, PC for tax planning and tax compliance for the years ended December
31, 2022 and 2021. 

All
Other Fees . We did not pay WithumSmith+Brown, PC for other services for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

Pre-Approval
Policy 

The
Company had no audit committee for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. Since our audit committee disbanded in late 2019, one of
our executive officers has approved and expects to pre-approve all auditing services and permitted non-audit services to be performed
for us by our auditors, including the fees and terms thereof (subject to the de minimis exceptions for non-audit services described in
the Exchange Act which are approved prior to the completion of the audit).
