 our ability to effectively manage our capital and liquidity, including under stress tests designed by our banking regulators; 
 the impact of current, pending and future legislation or changes thereto, regulation (including capital, leverage, funding, liquidity, consumer protection, and recovery and resolution requirements) and our ability to address such requirements; 
 uncertainty concerning fiscal or monetary policies established by central banks and financial regulators, government shutdowns, debt ceilings or funding; 
 changes to global trade policies, tariffs, interest rates, replacements of LIBOR and replacement or reform of other interest rate benchmarks; 
 legal and regulatory actions, including litigation and enforcement, in the U.S. and worldwide; 
 changes in tax laws and regulations globally; 
 the effectiveness of our risk management processes and related controls, including climate risk; 
 our ability to effectively respond to an economic downturn, or other market disruptions; 
 the effect of social, economic, and political conditions and geopolitical events, including as a result of changes in U.S. presidential administrations or Congress, and sovereign risk; 
 the actions and initiatives of current and potential competitors, as well as governments, central banks, regulators and self-regulatory organizations; 
 our ability to provide innovative products and services and execute our strategic initiatives, and costs related thereto, including with respect to the operational or technological integration related to such innovative and strategic initiatives; 
 the performance and results of our acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, partnerships, minority stakes or strategic alliances, or other strategic arrangements and related integrations; 
 investor, consumer and business sentiment and confidence in the financial markets;

Business 
 
 Overview 
 We are a global financial services firm that, through our subsidiaries and affiliates, advises, and originates, trades, manages and distributes capital for governments, institutions and individuals. We were originally incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1981, and our predecessor companies date back to 1924. We are a financial holding company FHC regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended BHC Act ). We conduct our business from our headquarters in and around New York City, our regional offices and branches throughout the U.S. and our principal offices in London, Tokyo, Hong Kong and other world financial centers. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms Morgan Stanley, the Firm, us, we and our mean Morgan Stanley (the Parent Company together with its consolidated subsidiaries. See the Glossary of Common Terms and Acronyms for the definition of certain terms and acronyms used throughout the 2022 Form 10-K. 
 Financial information concerning us, our business segments and geographic regions for each of the years ended December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 is included in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
 On March 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Eaton Vance Corp. Eaton Vance ), and on October 2, 2020, we completed the acquisition of E TRADE Financial Corporation E TRADE ). For further information, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business Segments Investment Management, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business Segments Wealth Management and Note 3 to the financial statements. 
 
 Business Segments 
 We are a global financial services firm that maintains significant market positions in each of our business segments: Institutional Securities, Wealth Management and Investment Management. Through our subsidiaries and affiliates, we provide a wide variety of products and services to a large and diversified group of clients and customers, including corporations, governments, financial institutions and individuals. Additional information related to our business segments, respective clients, and products and services provided is included under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 
 Competition 
 All aspects of our businesses are highly competitive, and we expect them to remain so. We compete in the U.S. and globally for clients, market share and human talent. Operating 

within the financial services industry on a global basis presents, among other things, technological, risk management, regulatory, infrastructure and other challenges that require effective resource allocation in order for us to remain competitive. Our competitive position depends on a number of factors, including our reputation, client experience, the quality and consistency of our long-term investment performance, innovation, execution, relative pricing and other factors, including entering into new or expanding current businesses as a result of acquisitions and other strategic initiatives. Our ability to sustain or improve our competitive position also depends substantially on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly qualified employees while managing compensation and other costs. We compete with commercial banks, investment banking firms, brokerage firms, insurance companies, exchanges, electronic trading and clearing platforms, financial data repositories, sponsors of mutual funds, hedge funds, real assets funds and private credit and equity funds, energy companies, financial technology firms and other companies offering financial or ancillary services in the U.S. and globally, including through the internet. In addition, restrictive laws and regulations applicable to certain global financial services institutions, which have been increasing in complexity and volume, may prohibit us from engaging in certain transactions, impose more stringent capital and liquidity requirements, increase costs, and can put us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors in certain businesses not subject to these same requirements. See also Supervision and Regulation herein and Risk Factors. 
 We compete directly in the U.S. and globally with other securities and financial services firms and broker-dealers and with others on a regional or product basis. Additionally, there is increased competition driven by established firms and asset managers, as well as the emergence of new firms and business models, including innovative uses of technology, competing for the same clients and assets or offering similar products and service s to retail and institutional customers. We also compete with companies that provide online trading and banking services, investment advisor services, robo-advice capabilities, access to digital asset capabilities and services, and other financial products and services. 
 Our ability to access capital at competitive rates (which is generally impacted by, among other things, our credit spreads and ratings) to commit and to deploy capital efficiently, particularly in our more capital-intensive businesses, including underwriting and sales, trading, financing and market-making activities, also affects our competitive position. We expect clients to continue to request that we provide loans or lending commitments in connection with certain investment banking activities. 
 It is possible that competition may become even more intense as we continue to compete with financial or other institutions that may be larger, or better capitalized, or may have a stronger local presence and longer operating history in certain geographies or products. Many of these firms have the ability 

1 
 December 2022 Form 10-K 

Table of Contents 

to offer a wide range of products and services through different platforms that may enhance their competitive position and could result in additional pricing pressure on our businesses. 
 We continue to experience price competition in some of our businesses. In particular, the ability to execute securities, derivatives and other financial instrument trades electronically on exchanges, swap execution facilities and other automated trading platforms, and the introduction and application of new technologies will likely continue the pressure on our revenues. The trend toward direct access to automated, electronic markets will likely continue as additional markets move to more automated trading platforms. We have experienced and will likely continue to experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future. 
 Our ability to compete successfully in the investment management industry is affected by several factors, including our reputation, investment objectives, quality of investment professionals, performance of investment strategies or product offerings relative to peers and appropriate benchmark indices, advertising and sales promotion efforts, fee levels, the effectiveness of and access to distribution channels and investment pipelines, the types and quality of products offered, and regulatory restrictions specific to FHCs. Our investment products, including alternative investment products, may compete with investments offered by other investment managers with passive investment products or who may be subject to less stringent legal and regulatory regimes than us. 
 
 Supervision and Regulation 
 As a major financial services firm, we are subject to extensive regulation by U.S. federal and state regulatory agencies and securities exchanges and by regulators and exchanges in each of the major markets where we conduct our business. 
 We continue to monitor the changing political, tax and regulatory environment. While it is likely that there will be changes in the way major financial institutions are regulated in both the U.S. and other markets in which we operate, it remains difficult to predict the exact impact these changes will have on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for a particular future period. We expect to remain subject to extensive supervision and regulation. 
 Financial Holding Company 
 Consolidated Supervision. We operate as a BHC and FHC under the BHC Act and are subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision, regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve. In particular, we are subject to (among other things): significant regulation and supervision; intensive scrutiny of our businesses and plans for expansion of those businesses; limitations on activities; a systemic risk regime that imposes heightened capital and liquidity requirements; 

restrictions on activities and investments imposed by a section of the BHC Act added by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act Dodd-Frank Act referred to as the Volcker Rule and comprehensive derivatives regulation. In addition, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB has primary rulemaking, enforcement and examination authority over us and our subsidiaries with respect to federal consumer protection laws. 
 Scope of Permitted Activities. The BHC Act limits the activities of BHCs and FHCs and grants the Federal Reserve authority to limit our ability to conduct activities. We must obtain the Federal Reserve s approval before engaging in certain banking and other financial activities both in the U.S. and internationally. 
 The BHC Act grandfathers activities related to the trading, sale or investment in commodities and underlying physical properties, provided that we were engaged in any of such activities as of September 30, 1997 in the U.S. and provided that certain other conditions that are within our reasonable control are satisfied. We currently engage in our commodities activities pursuant to the BHC Act grandfather exemption, as well as other authorities under the BHC Act. 
 Activities Restrictions under the Volcker Rule. The Volcker Rule prohibits banking entities, including us and our affiliates, from engaging in certain proprietary trading activities, as defined in the Volcker Rule, subject to exemptions for underwriting, market-making, risk-mitigating hedging and certain other activities. The Volcker Rule also prohibits certain investments and relationships by banking entities with covered funds, as defined in the Volcker Rule, subject to a number of exemptions and exclusions. For additional information on the Volcker Rule covered fund restrictions, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Regulatory Requirements Regulatory Developments and Other Matters Covered Fund Restrictions under the Volcker Rule. 
 Capital Requirements. The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements largely based on the Basel III capital standards established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision Basel Committee ), including well-capitalized standards, for large BHCs and evaluates our compliance with such requirements. The OCC establishes similar capital requirements and standards for Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. MSBNA and Morg an Stanley Private Bank, National Association MSPBNA (together, our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries ). 
 The Basel Committee has published a comprehe nsive set of revisions to its Basel III Framework. The impact on us of any revisions to the Basel Committee s capital standards is uncertain and depends on future rulemakings by the U.S. banking agencies.

In addition, many of our regulated subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements, including regulated subsidiaries provisionally registered as swap dealers with the CFTC or conditionally registered as security-based swap dealers with the SEC or registered as broker-dealers or futures commission merchants. 
 For more information about the specific capital requirements applicable to us and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, as well as our subsidiaries that are swap dealers and security-based swap dealers, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Regulatory Requirements and Note 17 to the financial statements. 
 Capital Planning, Stress Tests and Capital Distributions. The Federal Reserve has adopted capital planning and stress test requirements for large BHCs, including Morgan Stanley. For more information about our capital planning and stress test requirements, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Regulatory Requirements. 
 In addition, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC have the authority to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise, including us and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, if, in the banking regulator s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization. For information about the Federal Reserve s restrictions on capital distributions for large BHCs, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Regulatory Requirements Capital Plans, Stress Tests and the Stress Capital Buffer. All of these policies and other requirements could affect our ability to pay dividends and/or repurchase stock or require us to provide capital assistance to our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries under circumstances that we would not otherwise decide to do. 
 Liquidity Requirements. In addition to capital regulations, the U.S. banking agencies have adopted liquidity and funding standards, including the LCR, the NSFR, liquidity stress testing and associated liquidity reserve requirements. 
 For more information, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Balance Sheet Regulatory Liquidity Framework. 
 Systemic Risk Regime. Under rules issued by the Federal Reserve, large BHCs, including Morgan Stanley, must conduct internal liquidity stress tests, maintain unencumbered highly liquid assets to meet projected net cash outflows for 30 days over the range of liquidity stress scenarios used in internal stress tests, and comply with various liquidity risk management requirements. These large BHCs also must comply with a range of risk management and corporate governance requirements. 

The Federal Reserve also imposes single-counterparty credit limits SCCL for large banking organizations. U.S. G-SIBs, including us, are subject to a limit of 15 of Tier 1 capital for aggregate net credit exposures to any major counterparty (defined to include other U.S. G-SIBs, foreign G-SIBs and non-bank systemically important financial institutions supervised by the Federal Reserve). In addition, we are subject to a limit of 25 of Tier 1 capital for aggregate net credit exposures to any other unaffiliated counterparty. 
 Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve is required to adopt rules that would create a new early remediation framework to address financial distress or material management weaknesses. The Federal Reserve proposed such rules in 2012, but to date has not finalized these proposed rules. The Federal Reserve also has the ability to establish additional prudential standards, including those regarding contingent capital, enhanced public disclosures and limits on short-term debt, including off-balance sheet exposures. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Regulatory Requirements Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements. 
 If the Federal Reserve or the Financial Stability Oversight Council determines that a BHC with 250 billion or more in consolidated assets poses a grave threat to U.S. financial stability, the institution may be, among other things, restricted in its ability to merge or offer financial products and/or required to terminate activities and dispose of assets. See also Capital Requirements and Liquidity Requirements and Resolution and Recovery Planning herein. 
 Resolution and Recovery Planning. We are required to submit once every two years to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a resolution plan that describes our strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of our material financial distress or failure. Interim updates are required in certain limited circumstances, including material mergers or acquisitions or fundamental changes to our resolution strategy. 
 Our preferred resolution strategy, which is set out in our most recent resolution plan, is an SPOE strategy, which generally contemplates the provision of adequate capital and liquidity by the Parent Company to certain of its subsidiaries so that such subsidiaries have the resources necessary to implement the resolution strategy after the Parent Company has filed for bankruptcy. 
 Our next resolution plan is due July 1, 2023. Further, we submit an annual recovery plan to the Federal Reserve that outlines the steps that management could take over time to generate or conserve financial resources in times of prolonged financial stress. 
 Certain of our domestic and foreign subsidiaries are also subject to resolution and recovery planning requirements in

the jurisdictions in which they operate. For example, the FDIC currently requires certain insured depository institutions IDI ), including our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, to submit a resolution plan every three years, that describes the IDI s strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure of the IDI. 
 In addition, certain financial companies, including BHCs such as the Firm and certain of its subsidiaries, can be subject to a resolution proceeding under the orderly liquidation authority, with the FDIC being appointed as receiver, provided that determination of extraordinary financial distress and systemic risk is made by the U.S. Treasury Secretary in consultation with the U.S. President. Regulators have adopted certain orderly liquidation authority implementing regulations and may expand or clarify these regulations in the future. If we were subject to the orderly liquidation authority, the FDIC would have considerable powers, including: the power to remove directors and officers responsible for our failure and to appoint new directors and officers; the power to assign our assets and liabilities to a third party or bridge financial company without the need for creditor consent or prior court review; the ability to differentiate among our creditors, including treating certain creditors within the same class better than others, subject to a minimum recovery right on the part of disfavored creditors to receive at least what they would have received in bankruptcy liquidation; and broad powers to administer the claims process to determine distributions from the assets of the receivership. The FDIC has been developing an SPOE strategy that could be used to implement the orderly liquidation authority. 
 Regulators have also taken and proposed various actions to facilitate an SPOE strategy under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the orderly liquidation authority or other resolution regimes.

 Cyber and Information Security Risk Management and Protection of Client Information 
 The financial services industry faces increased global regulatory focus regarding cyber and information security risk management practices. Many aspects of our businesses are subject to cybersecurity legal and regulatory requirements enacted by U.S. federal and state governments and other non-U.S. jurisdictions. These requirements are generally aimed at codifying basic cybersecurity protections and mandating data breach notification requirements. 

Our businesses are also subject to increasing privacy and data protection legal requirements concerning the use and protection of certain personal information with regard to clients, employees and others. These requirements impose mandatory privacy and data protection obligations, including providing for individual rights, enhanced governance and accountability requirements, and significant fines and litigation risk for noncompliance. In addition, several jurisdictions have enacted or proposed personal data localization requirements and restrictions on cross-border transfer of personal data that may restrict our ability to conduct business in those jurisdictions or create additional financial and regulatory burdens to do so. 
 Numerous jurisdictions have passed laws, rules and regulations in these areas and many are considering new or updated ones that could impact our businesses, particularly as the application, interpretation and enforcement of these laws, rules and regulations are often uncertain and evolving. Many aspects of our businesses are subject to legal requirements concerning the use and protection of certain customer information, as well as the privacy and cybersecurity laws referenced above. We have adopted measures designed to comply with these and related applicable requirements in all relevant jurisdictions. 
 U.S. Bank Subsidiaries 
 The U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are FDIC-insured depository institutions subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the OCC and are subject to the OCC s risk governance guidelines, which establish heightened standards for a large IDI s risk governance framework and the oversight of that framework by the IDI s board of directors. The U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are also subject to prompt corrective action standards, which require the relevant federal banking regulator to take prompt corrective action with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards. In addition, BHCs, such as Morgan Stanley, are required to serve as a source of strength to their U.S. bank subsidiaries and commit resources to support these subsidiaries in the event such subsidiaries are in financial distress. 
 Our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are also subject to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, which impose restrictions on certain transactions with affiliates, including any extension of credit to, or purchase of assets from an affiliate. These restrictions limit the total amount of credit exposure that our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries may have to any one affiliate and to all affiliates and require collateral for those exposures. Section 23B requires affiliate transactions to be on market terms. 
 As commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institutions, each of the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries could be responsible for any loss to the FDIC from the failure of the other U.S. Bank Subsidiary.

Institutional Securities and Wealth Management 
 Broker-Dealer and Investment Adviser Regulation. Our primary U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries, Morgan Stanley Co. LLC MS Co. ), MSSB and E TRADE Securities LLC, are registered broker-dealers with the SEC and in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and are members of various self-regulatory organizations, including Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA ), and various securities exchanges and clearing organizations. Broker-dealers are subject to laws and regulations covering all aspects of the securities business, including sales and trading practices, securities offerings, publication of research reports, use of customers funds and securities, capital structure, risk management controls in connection with market access, recordkeeping and retention, and the conduct of their directors, officers, representatives and other associated persons. Broker-dealers are also regulated by securities administrators in those states where they do business. Our significant broker-dealer subsidiaries are members of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation. 
 MSSB is also a registered investment adviser with the SEC. MSSB s relationship with its investment advisory clients is subject to the fiduciary and other obligations imposed on investment advisers. The SEC and other supervisory bodies generally have broad administrative powers to address non-compliance, including the power to restrict or limit MSSB from carrying on its investment advisory and other asset management activities. 
 The Firm is subject to various regulations that affect broker-dealer sales practices and customer relationships, including the SEC s Regulation Best Interest, which requires broker-dealers to act in the best interest of retail customers at the time a recommendation is made without placing the financial or other interests of the broker-dealer ahead of the interest of the retail customer. 
 Margin lending by our broker-dealers is regulated by the Federal Reserve s restrictions on lending in connection with purchases and short sales of securities. Our broker-dealers are also subject to maintenance and other margin requirements imposed under FINRA and other self-regulatory organization rules. 
 Our U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the SEC s net capital rule and the net capital requirements of various exchanges, other regulatory authorities and self-regulatory organizations. For more information about these requirements, see Note 17 to the financial statements. 
 Research Regulation. In addition to research-related regulations currently in place in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, regulators continue to focus on research conflicts of interest and may impose additional regulations. 

Futures Activities and Certain Commodities Activities Regulation. MS Co. and E TRADE Futures LLC, as futures commission merchants, and MSSB, as an introducing broker, are subject to net capital requirements of, and certain of their activities are regulated by, the CFTC, the NFA, the CME Group, in its capacity as MS Co. s designated self-regulatory organization, and various commodity futures exchanges. Rules and regulations of the CFTC, NFA, the Joint Audit Committee and commodity futures exchanges address obligations related to, among other things, customer asset protections, including rules and regulations governing the segregation of customer funds, the use by futures commission merchants of customer funds, the margining of customer accounts and documentation entered into by futures commission merchants with their customers, recordkeeping and reporting obligations of futures commission merchants and introducing brokers, risk disclosure and risk management.

 CFTC and SEC rules require registration of swap dealers and security-based swap dealers, respectively, and impose numerous obligations on such registrants, including adherence to business conduct standards for all in-scope Swaps. We have provisionally or conditionally registered a number of U.S. and non U.S. swap dealers and security-based swap dealers. Swap dealers and security-based swap dealers regulated by a prudential regulator are subject to uncleared Swap margin requirements and minimum capital requirements established by the prudential regulators. Swap dealers and security-based swap dealers not subject to regulation by a prudential regulator are subject to uncleared Swap margin requirements and minimum capital requirements established by the CFTC and SEC, respectively. In some cases, the CFTC and SEC permit non-U.S. swap dealers and security-based swap dealers that do not have a prudential regulator to comply with applicable non-U.S. uncleared Swap margin and minimum capital requirements instead of direct compliance with CFTC or SEC requirements. 
 Investment Management 
 Many of the subsidiaries engaged in our investment management activities are registered as investment advisers with the SEC. Many aspects of our investment management activities are also subject to federal and state laws and regulations in place primarily for the protection of the investor or client. These laws and regulations generally grant supervisory agencies and bodies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict us from carrying on our investment management activities in the event that we fail to comply with such laws and regulations.

 U.S. Consumer Protection 
 We are subject to supervision and regulation by the CFPB with respect to U.S. federal consumer protection laws. Federal consumer protection laws to which we are subject include the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act s privacy provisions, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, Electronic Fund Transfer Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Truth in Lending Act and Truth in Savings Act, all of which are enforced by the CFPB. We are also subject to certain federal consumer protection laws enforced by the OCC, including the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. Furthermore, we are subject to certain state consumer protection laws, and under the Dodd-Frank Act, state attorneys general and other state officials are empowered to enforce certain federal consumer protection laws and regulations. These federal and state consumer protection laws apply to a range of our activities. 
 Non-U.S. Regulation 
 All of our businesses are regulated extensively by non-U.S. regulators, including governments, central banks and regulatory bodies, securities exchanges, commodity exchanges, and self-regulatory organizations, especially in those jurisdictions in which we maintain an office. Certain regulators have prudential, business conduct and other authority over us or our subsidiaries, as well as powers to limit or restrict us from engaging in certain businesses or to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censures, fines, asset seizures and forfeitures, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, or the suspension or expulsion of a regulated entity or its affiliates. Certain of our subsidiaries are 

subject to capital, liquidity, leverage and other prudential requirements that are applicable under non-U.S. law. 
 Financial Crimes Program 
 Our Financial Crimes program is coordinated and implemented on an enterprise-wide basis and supports our financial crime prevention efforts across all regions and business units, with responsibility for governance and oversight, as well as execution of our anti-money laundering AML ), economic sanctions Sanctions ), anti-boycott, anti-corruption, anti-tax evasion, and government and political activities compliance programs. 
 In the U.S., the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020, imposes significant obligations on financial institutions to detect and deter money laundering and terrorist financing activity, including requiring banks, BHCs and their subsidiaries, broker-dealers, futures commission merchants, introducing brokers and mutual funds to develop and implement AML programs, verify the identity of customers that maintain accounts, and monitor and report suspicious activity to appropriate law enforcement or regulatory authorities. Outside of the U.S., applicable laws, rules and regulations similarly require designated types of financial institutions to implement AML programs. 
 We are also subject to Sanctions, such as regulations and economic sanctions programs administered by the U.S. government, including the U.S. Treasury Department s Office of Foreign Assets Control OFAC and the U.S. Department of State, and similar sanctions programs imposed by foreign governments or global or regional multilateral organizations. In addition, we are subject to anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Anti-corruption laws generally prohibit offering, promising, giving or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a government official or private party in order to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage, such as to obtain or retain business. 
 
 Human Capital 
 Employees and Culture 
 Our employees are our most important asset. With offices in 41 countries, we have approximately 82 thousand employees across the globe as of December 31, 2022, whom we depend upon to build value for our clients and shareholders. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to make Morgan Stanley a diverse and inclusive workplace, with a strong culture and opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their career. We support our employees with competitive compensation, benefits, and health and wellbeing programs. 
 Our core values guide decision making aligned to the expectations of our employees, clients, shareholders,

regulators, directors and the communities in which we operate. These guiding values Put Clients First, Do the Right Thing, Lead with Exceptional Ideas, Commit to Diversity and Inclusion, and Give Back are at the heart of our workplace culture and underpin our success. Our Code of Conduct is central to our expectation that employees embody our values. Every new hire and every employee annually is required to certify to their understanding of and adherence to the Code of Conduct. We also invite employee feedback on our culture and workplace through our ongoing employee engagement surveys. For a further discussion of the culture, values, and conduct of employees, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk Risk Management. 
 Diversity and Inclusion 
 We believe a diverse and inclusive workforce is important to Morgan Stanley s continued success and our ability to serve our clients. Our programming to support our workforce helps build a sense of community and belonging for all colleagues. We have deepened our investments to recruit, advance and retain diverse talent through a holistic approach, focused on professional development, health and wellbeing, benefits, and culture. Consistent with this approach, we strive to increase diverse representation among our workforce and drive greater accountability for leaders. The Morgan Stanley Institute for Inclusion is also a key part of our strategy. 
 Talent Development and Retention 
 
 We are committed to the development of our workforce and supporting mobility and career growth. Our talent development programs are designed to provide employees with the resources they need to help achieve their career goals, build management skills and lead their organizations. We believe that supporting employee development and growth will help retention in the long run. As the work environment continues to evolve, we are making investments across technology platforms to modernize our approach to talent development, workforce planning and internal mobility. 
 
 We continue to focus on unlocking the potential of our employees by providing differentiated leadership programs. For these programs, we have curated content to support employees as they progress in their career at the firm. 
 Compensation, Financial and Employee Wellbeing 
 We provide responsible and effective compensation programs that reinforce our values and culture through four key objectives: deliver pay for sustainable performance, attract and retain top talent, align with shareholder interests and mitigate excessive risk taking. In addition to salaries, these programs (which vary by location) include annual bonuses, retirement savings plans with matching contributions, an employee stock purchase plan, student loan refinancing and a financial wellbeing program in the U.S. and the U.K. To promote equitable rewards for all employees, we have enhanced our practices to support fair and consistent 

compensation and reward decisions based on merit, perform ongoing reviews of compensation decisions, and conduct regular assessments of our rewards structure. 
 Our employees health is also central to our ongoing success. We support the physical, mental and financial wellbeing of our global workforce and their families by offering programs focusing on awareness, prevention and access. Offerings include: health care and insurance benefits; mental health resources; flexible spending and health savings accounts; paid time-off; flexible work schedules; family leave; child and elder care resources; financial help with fertility; adoption and surrogacy services; and tuition assistance, among many others. Onsite services in our principal locations include health centers, mental health counseling, fitness centers and physical therapy. 
 In 2022, we enhanced our programs to further support employees. Globally, we increased the amount of paid leave for new parents, introduced paid family caregiver leave and enhanced our fitness subsidy. In the U.S., we expanded our mental health benefit and partnered with a national provider that delivers concierge in-person and virtual primary care for adults and children. Additionally, our new Health Assistants help employees understand and maximize Firm resources and guide them through complex health issues.

Risk Factors 
 For a discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results and strategic objectives, see Forward-Looking Statements preceding Business and Return on Tangible Common Equity Goal in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 Market Risk 
 Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, spreads, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity, will result in losses for a position or portfolio owned by us. For more information on how we monitor and manage market risk, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk Market Risk. 
 Our results of operations may be materially affected by market fluctuations and by global financial market and economic conditions and other factors. 
 
 Our results of operations have been in the past and may, in the future, be materially affected by global financial market and economic conditions, both directly and indirectly through their impact on client activity levels. These include the level and volatility of equity, fixed income and commodity prices, the level and term structure of interest rates, inflation and currency values, the level of other market indices, fiscal or monetary policies established by central banks and financial regulators, and uncertainty concerning government shutdowns, debt ceilings or funding, which may be driven by economic conditions, market uncertainty or lack of confidence among investors and clients due to the effects of widespread events such as global pandemics, natural disasters, climate-related incidents, acts of war or aggression, geopolitical instability, changes to global trade policies and the implementation of tariffs or protectionist trade policies and other factors, or a combination of these or other factors. For example, in 2022, the global economic and geopolitical environment was characterized by persistent inflation, rising interest rates, volatility in global financial markets (leading to, among other things, a decline in equity prices), supply chain complications, recessionary fears, and geopolitical uncertainty regarding the war between Russia and Ukraine and its impact on the global markets, including the energy markets. 
 The results of our Institutional Securities business segment, particularly results relating to our involvement in primary and secondary markets for all types of financial products, are subject to substantial market fluctuations due to a variety of factors that we cannot control or predict with great certainty. These fluctuations impact results by causing variations in business flows and activity and in the fair value of securities and other financial products. Fluctuations also occur due to the level of global market activity, which, among other things, can be impacted by market uncertainty or lack of investor and client confidence due to unforeseen economic, geopolitical or 

market conditions that in turn affect the size, number and timing of investment banking client assignments and transactions and the realization of returns from our principal investments. 
 Periods of unfavorable market or economic conditions may have adverse impacts on the level of individual investor confidence and participation in the global markets and/or the level of and mix of client assets, which would negatively impact the results of our Wealth Management business segment. 
 Substantial market fluctuations could also cause variations in the value of our investments in our funds, the flow of investment capital into or from AUM, and the way customers allocate capital among money market, equity, fixed income or other investment alternatives, which could negatively impact the results of our Investment Management business segment. 
 The value of our financial instruments may be materially affected by market fluctuations. Market volatility, illiquid market conditions and disruptions in the markets may make it difficult to value and monetize certain of our financial instruments, particularly during periods of market uncertainty or displacement. Subsequent valuations in future periods, in light of factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the value of these instruments and may adversely impact historical or prospective fees and performance-based income (also known as incentive fees, which include carried interest) in respect of certain businesses. In addition, at the time of any sales and settlements of these financial instruments, the price we ultimately realize will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair value. Any of these factors could cause a decline in the value of our financial instruments, which may adversely affect our results of operations in future periods. 
 In addition, financial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied by a reduction in asset liquidity. Under these extreme conditions, hedging and other risk management strategies may not be as effective at mitigating trading losses as they would be under more normal market conditions. Moreover, under these conditions, market participants are particularly exposed to trading strategies employed by many market participants simultaneously and on a large scale, which could lead to increased individual counterparty risk for our businesses. Although our risk management and monitoring processes seek to quantify and mitigate risk to more extreme market moves, severe market events have historically been difficult to predict, and we could realize significant losses if extreme market events were to occur. 
 Holding large and concentrated positions may expose us to losses. 
 Concentration of risk may reduce revenues or result in losses in our market-making, investing, underwriting (including

Table of Contents 

block trading), and lending businesses (including margin lending) in the event of unfavorable market movements. We commit substantial amounts of capital to these businesses, which often results in our taking large positions in the securities of, or making large loans to, a particular issuer or issuers in a particular industry, country or region. In the event we hold a concentrated position larger than those held by competitors, we may incur larger losses. For further information regarding our country risk exposure, see also Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk Country and Other Risks. 
 Credit Risk 
 Credit risk refers to the risk of loss arising when a borrower, counterparty or issuer does not meet its financial obligations to us. For more information on how we monitor and manage credit risk, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk Credit Risk. 
 We are exposed to the risk that third-parties that are indebted to us will not perform their obligations. 
 We incur significant credit risk exposure through our Institutional Securities business segment. This risk may arise from a variety of business activities, including, but not limited to: extending credit to clients through various lending commitments; entering into swap or other derivative contracts under which counterparties have obligations to make payments to us; providing short- or long-term funding that is secured by physical or financial collateral whose value may at times be insufficient to fully cover the loan repayment amount; posting margin and/or collateral and other commitments to clearing houses, clearing agencies, exchanges, banks, securities firms and other financial counterparties; and investing and trading in securities and loan pools, whereby the value of these assets may fluctuate based on realized or expected defaults on the underlying obligations or loans. 
 We also incur credit risk in our Wealth Management business segment lending to mainly individual investors, including, but not limited to, margin- and securities-based loans collateralized by securities, and residential mortgage loans, including HELOCs. 
 
 Our valuations related to, and reserves for losses on, credit exposures rely on complex models, estimates, and subjective judgments about the future. While we believe current valuations and reserves adequately address our perceived levels of risk, future economic conditions, including inflation and changes in real estate values, that differ from or are more severe than forecast, inaccurate models or assumptions, or external factors such as global pandemics, natural disasters, or geopolitical events, could lead to inaccurate measurement of or deterioration of credit quality of our borrowers and counterparties or the value of collateral and result in unexpected losses. We may also incur higher than anticipated credit losses as a result of (i) disputes with counterparties over 

the valuation of collateral or (ii) actions taken by other lenders that may negatively impact the valuation of collateral. In cases where we foreclose on collateral, sudden declines in the value or liquidity of collateral may result in significant losses to us despite our (i) credit monitoring; (ii) over-collateralization; (iii) ability to call for additional collateral; or (iv) ability to force repayment of the underlying obligation, especially where there is a single type of collateral supporting the obligation. In addition, in the longer term, climate change may have a negative impact on the financial condition of our clients, which may decrease revenues from those clients and increase the credit risk associated with loans and other credit exposures to those clients. Certain of our credit exposures may be concentrated by counterparty, product, industry or country. Although our models and estimates account for correlations among related types of exposures, a change in the market environment for a concentrated product or an external factor impacting a concentrated counterparty, industry or country may result in credit losses in excess of amounts forecast. 
 In addition, as a clearing member of several central counterparties, we are responsible for the defaults or misconduct of our customers and could incur financial losses in the event of default by other clearing members. Although we regularly review our credit exposures, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee. 
 A default by a large financial institution could adversely affect financial markets. 
 
 The commercial soundness of many financial institutions and certain other large financial services firms may be closely interrelated as a result of credit, trading, clearing or other relationships among such entities. Increased centralization of trading activities through particular clearing houses, central agents or exchanges may increase our concentration of risk with respect to these entities. As a result, concerns about, or a default or threatened default by, one or more such entities could lead to significant market-wide liquidity and credit problems, losses or defaults by other institutions. This is sometimes referred to as systemic risk and may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing houses, clearing agencies, exchanges, banks and securities firms, with which we interact on a daily basis and, therefore, could adversely affect us. See also Systemic Risk Regime under Business Supervision and Regulation Financial Holding Company. 
 Operational Risk 
 
 Operational risk refers to the risk of loss, or of damage to our reputation, resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems, from human factors or from external events e.g. , cyber-attacks or third-party vulnerabilities) that may manifest as, for example, loss of information, business disruption, theft and fraud, legal and compliance risks, or damage to physical assets. We may incur operational risk across the full scope of

Table of Contents 

our business activities, including revenue-generating activities and support and control groups e.g. , information technology and trade processing). Legal, regulatory and compliance risk is included in the scope of operational risk and is discussed below under Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk. For more information on how we monitor and manage operational risk, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk Operational Risk. 
 We are subject to operational risks, including a failure, breach or other disruption of our operations or security systems or those of our third-parties (or third-parties thereof), as well as human error or malfeasance, which could adversely affect our businesses or reputation. 
 Our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process and report, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies. We may introduce new products or services or change processes or reporting, including in connection with new regulatory requirements, or integration of processes or systems of acquired companies, resulting in new operational risk that we may not fully appreciate or identify. 
 The trend toward direct access to automated, electronic markets and the move to more automated trading platforms has resulted in the use of increasingly complex technology that relies on the continued effectiveness of the programming code and integrity of the data to process the trades. We rely on the ability of our employees, our consultants, our internal systems and systems at technology centers maintained by unaffiliated third-parties to operate our different businesses and process a high volume of transactions. Unusually high trading volumes or site usage could cause our systems to operate at an unacceptably slow speed or even fail. Disruptions to, destruction of, instability of or other failure to effectively maintain our information technology systems or external technology that allows our clients and customers to use our products and services (including our self-directed brokerage platform) could harm our business and our reputation. 
 As a major participant in the global capital markets, we face the risk of incorrect valuation or risk management of our trading positions due to flaws in data, models, electronic trading systems or processes or due to fraud or cyber-attack. We also face the risk of operational failure or disruption of any of the clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our lending, securities and derivatives transactions. In addition, in the event of a breakdown or improper operation or disposal of our or a direct or indirect third-party s systems (or third-parties thereof), processes or information assets, or improper or unauthorized action by third-parties, including consultants and subcontractors or our employees, we have in the past and may receive regulatory sanctions, and could suffer financial loss, an impairment to our liquidity position, a disruption of our businesses, or damage to our reputation. 

In addition, the interconnectivity of multiple financial institutions with central agents, exchanges and clearing houses, and the increased importance of these entities, increases the risk that an operational failure at one institution or entity may cause an industry-wide operational failure that could materially impact our ability to conduct business. Furthermore, the concentration of Firm and personal information held by a handful of third-parties increases the risk that a breach at a key third-party may cause an industry-wide event that could significantly increase the cost and risk of conducting business. 
 
 There can be no assurance that our business contingency and security response plans fully mitigate all potential risks to us. Our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities where we are located. This may include a disruption involving physical site access; software flaws and vulnerabilities; cybersecurity incidents; terrorist activities; political unrest; disease pandemics; catastrophic events; climate-related incidents and natural disasters (such as earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes and wildfires); electrical outages; environmental hazards; computer servers; communication platforms or other services we use; and our employees or third-parties with whom we conduct business. Although we employ backup systems for our data, those backup systems may be unavailable following a disruption, the affected data may not have been backed up or may not be recoverable from the backup, or the backup data may be costly to recover, which could adversely affect our business. 
 Notwithstanding evolving technology and technology-based risk and control systems, our businesses ultimately rely on people, including our employees and those of third-parties with which we conduct business. As a result of human error or engagement in violations of applicable policies, laws, rules or procedures, certain errors or violations are not always discovered immediately by our technological processes or by our controls and other procedures, which are intended to prevent and detect such errors or violations. These can include calculation or input errors, inadvertent or duplicate payments, mistakes in addressing emails or other communications, errors in software or model development or implementation, or errors in judgment, as well as intentional efforts to disregard or circumvent applicable policies, laws, rules or procedures. Human errors and malfeasance, even if promptly discovered and remediated, can result in material losses and liabilities for us. 
 We conduct business in various jurisdictions outside the U.S., including jurisdictions that may not have comparable levels of protection for their corporate assets such as intellectual property, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, and customer information and records. The protection afforded in those jurisdictions may be less established and/or predictable than in the U.S. or other jurisdictions in which we operate. As a result, there may also be heightened risks associated with the potential theft of their data, technology and intellectual property in those jurisdictions by domestic or foreign actors, 

11 
 December 2022 Form 10-K 

Table of Contents 

including private parties and those affiliated with or controlled by state actors. Additionally, we are subject to complex and evolving U.S. and international laws and regulations governing cybersecurity, privacy and data governance, transfer and protection, which may differ and potentially conflict, in various jurisdictions. Any theft of data, technology or intellectual property may negatively impact our operations and reputation, including disrupting the business activities of our subsidiaries, affiliates, joint ventures or clients conducting business in those jurisdictions. 
 A cyber-attack, information or security breach or a technology failure of ours or a third-party could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business, manage our exposure to risk, or result in disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information and otherwise adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, as well as cause reputational harm. 
 Cybersecurity risks for financial institutions have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet, mobile telecommunications and cloud technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external extremist parties, including foreign state actors, in some circumstances as a means to promote political ends. Global events and geopolitical instability (including the war between Russia and Ukraine) may lead to increased nation state targeting of financial institutions in the U.S. and abroad. Any of these parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, clients, vendors, or other third-parties or users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our employees or clients. 
 Information security risks may also derive from human error, fraud or malice on the part of our employees or third-parties, or may result from accidental technological failure. For example, human error has led to the loss of the Firm's physical data-bearing devices in the past. These risks may be heightened by several factors, including remote work, or as a result of the integration of acquisitions and other strategic initiatives that may subject us to new technology, customers or third-party providers. In addition, third-parties with whom we do business or share information, our regulators, and each of their service providers, as well as the third-parties with whom our customers and clients share information used for authentication, may also be sources of cybersecurity and information security risks, particularly where activities of customers are beyond our security and control systems. There is no guarantee that the measures we take will provide absolute security or recoverability given that the techniques used in cyber-attacks are complex and frequently change, and are difficult to anticipate. 
 Like other financial services firms, the Firm, its third-party providers, and its clients continue to be the subject of unauthorized access attacks, mishandling or misuse of 

information, computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks designed to obtain confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage, ransomware, denial of service attacks, data breaches, social engineering attacks and other events. There can be no assurance that such unauthorized access, mishandling or misuse of information, or cyber incidents will not occur in the future, and they could occur more frequently and on a more significant scale. 
 We maintain a significant amount of personal and confidential information on our customers, clients and certain counterparties that we are required to protect under various state, federal and international data protection and privacy laws. These laws may be in conflict with one another or courts and regulators may interpret them in ways that we had not anticipated or that adversely affect our business. A cyber-attack, information or security breach, or a technology failure of ours or of a third-party could jeopardize our or our clients , employees , partners , vendors or counterparties personal, confidential, proprietary or other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our and our third-parties computer systems. Furthermore, such events could cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, our clients , employees , partners , vendors , counterparties or third-parties operations, as well as the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary and other information of ours, our employees, our customers or of other third-parties. Any of these events could result in reputational damage with our clients and the market, client dissatisfaction, additional costs to us to maintain and update our operational and security systems and infrastructure, violation of the applicable data protection and privacy laws, regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, litigation exposure, or fines or penalties, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Given our global footprint and the high volume of transactions we process, the large number of clients, partners, vendors and counterparties with which we do business, and the increasing sophistication of cyber-attacks, a cyber-attack, information or security breach could occur and persist for an extended period of time without detection. It could take considerable time for us to determine the scope, extent, amount and type of information compromised, and the impact of such an attack may not be fully understood. During such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, all or any of which would further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber-attack or data breach. 
 While many of our agreements with partners and third-party vendors include indemnification provisions, we may not be able to recover sufficiently, or at all, under such provisions to adequately offset any losses we may incur. In addition, although we maintain insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of cyber 

December 2022 Form 10-K 12 

Table of Contents 

and information security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses we may incur. 
 We continue to make investments with a view toward maintaining and enhancing our cybersecurity and information security posture. The cost of managing cyber and information security risks and attacks along with complying with new, increasingly expansive, and evolving regulatory requirements could adversely affect our results of operations and business. 
 Liquidity Risk 
 Liquidity risk refers to the risk that we will be unable to finance our operations due to a loss of access to the capital markets or difficulty in liquidating our assets. Liquidity risk also encompasses our ability (or perceived ability) to meet our financial obligations without experiencing significant business disruption or reputational damage that may threaten our viability as a going concern, as well as the associated funding risks triggered by the market or idiosyncratic stress events that may negatively affect our liquidity and may impact our ability to raise new funding. For more information on how we monitor and manage liquidity risk, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk Liquidity Risk. 
 Liquidity is essential to our businesses and we rely on external sources to finance a significant portion of our operations. 
 Liquidity is essential to our businesses. Our liquidity could be negatively affected by our inability to raise funding in the long-term or short-term debt capital markets, our inability to access the secured lending markets, our inability to attract and retain deposits, or unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral by customers or clients. Factors that we cannot control, such as disruption of the financial markets or negative views about the financial services industry generally, including concerns regarding fiscal matters in the U.S. and other geographic areas, could impair our ability to raise funding. 
 In addition, our ability to raise funding could be impaired if investors or lenders develop a negative perception of our long-term or short-term financial prospects due to factors such as an incurrence of large trading losses, a downgrade by the rating agencies, a decline in the level of our business activity, if regulatory authorities take significant action against us or our industry, or if we discover significant employee misconduct or illegal activity. 
 If we are unable to raise funding using the methods described above, we would likely need to finance or liquidate unencumbered assets, such as our investment portfolios or trading assets, to meet maturing liabilities or other obligations. We may be unable to sell some of our assets or we may have to sell assets at a discount to market value, 

either of which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 
 Our borrowing costs and access to the debt capital markets depend on our credit ratings. 
 The cost and availability of unsecured financing generally are impacted by (among other things) our long-term and short-term credit ratings. The rating agencies continue to monitor certain Firm-specific and industry-wide factors that are important to the determination of our credit ratings. These include governance, capital adequacy, the level and quality of earnings, liquidity and funding, risk appetite and management, asset quality, strategic direction, business mix, regulatory or legislative changes, macroeconomic environment and perceived levels of support, and it is possible that the rating agencies could downgrade our ratings and those of similar institutions. 
 Our credit ratings also can have an adverse impact on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where longer term counterparty performance is a key consideration, such as OTC and other derivative transactions, including credit derivatives and interest rate swaps. In connection with certain OTC trading agreements and certain other agreements associated with our Institutional Securities business segment, we may be required to provide additional collateral to, or immediately settle any outstanding liability balance with, certain counterparties in the event of a credit rating downgrade. 
 Termination of our trading and other agreements could cause us to sustain losses and impair our liquidity by requiring us to find other sources of financing or to make significant payments in the form of cash or securities. The additional collateral or termination payments that may occur in the event of a future credit rating downgrade vary by contract and can be based on ratings by either or both of Moody s Investors Service, Inc. and S P Global Ratings. See also Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Credit Ratings Incremental Collateral or Terminating Payments. 
 We are a holding company and depend on payments from our subsidiaries. 
 The Parent Company has no operations and depends on dividends, distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund dividend payments and to fund all payments on its obligations, including debt obligations. Regulatory restrictions, tax restrictions or elections and other legal restrictions may limit our ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from our subsidiaries. In particular, many of our subsidiaries, including our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to laws, regulations and self-regulatory organization rules that, in certain circumstances, limit, as well as permit regulatory bodies to block or reduce, the flow of funds to the Parent Company, or that prohibit such 

13 
 December 2022 Form 10-K 

Table of Contents 

transfers or dividends altogether, including steps to ring fence entities by regulators outside the U.S. to protect clients and creditors of such entities in the event of financial difficulties involving such entities. 
 These laws, regulations and rules may hinder our ability to access funds that we may need to make payments on our obligations. Furthermore, as a BHC, we may become subject to a prohibition or to limitations on our ability to pay dividends. The Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC have the authority, and under certain circumstances the duty, to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise, including us and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. See We may be prevented from paying dividends or taking other capital actions because of regulatory constraints or revised regulatory capital requirements under Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk herein. 
 Our liquidity and financial condition have in the past been, and in the future could be, adversely affected by U.S. and international markets and economic conditions. 
 Our ability to raise funding in the long-term or short-term debt capital markets or the equity markets, or to access secured lending markets, has in the past been, and could in the future be, adversely affected by conditions in the U.S. and international markets and economies. 
 In particular, our cost and availability of funding in the past have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by illiquid credit markets, interest rates, and wider credit spreads. Significant turbulence in the U.S., the E.U. and other international markets and economies could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the willingness of certain counterparties and customers to do business with us. 
 Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk 
 Legal, regulatory and compliance risk includes the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, including fines, penalties, judgments, damages and/or settlements, limitations on our business, or loss to reputation we may suffer as a result of our failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, related self-regulatory organization standards and codes of conduct applicable to our business activities. This risk also includes contractual and commercial risk, such as the risk that a counterparty s performance obligations will be unenforceable. It also includes compliance with AML, anti-corruption and terrorist financing rules and regulations. For more information on how we monitor and manage legal, regulatory and compliance risk, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk Legal and Compliance Risk. 
 The financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation, and changes in regulation will impact our business. 
 Like other major financial services firms, we are subject to extensive regulation by U.S. federal and state regulatory 

agencies and securities exchanges and by regulators and exchanges in each of the major markets where we conduct our business, including an increasing number of complex sanctions regimes. These laws and regulations, which continue to increase in volume and complexity, significantly affect the way and costs of doing business and can restrict the scope of our existing businesses and limit our ability to expand our product offerings and pursue certain investments. 
 The Firm and its employees are subject to wide-ranging regulation and supervision, which, among other things, subject us to intensive scrutiny of our businesses and any plans for expansion of those businesses through acquisitions or otherwise, limitations on new activities, a systemic risk regime that imposes heightened capital and liquidity and funding requirements and other enhanced prudential standards, resolution regimes and resolution planning requirements, requirements for maintaining minimum amounts of TLAC and external long-term debt, restrictions on activities and investments imposed by the Volcker Rule, comprehensive derivatives regulation, commodities regulation, market structure regulation, consumer protection regulation, tax regulations, antitrust laws, trade and transaction reporting obligations, and broadened fiduciary obligations. 
 Ongoing implementation of, our efforts to comply with, and/or changes to laws and regulations, including changes in the breadth, application, interpretation or enforcement of laws and regulations, could materially impact the profitability of our businesses and the value of assets we hold, expose us to additional theories of liability and additional costs, require changes to business practices or force us to discontinue businesses, adversely affect our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our stock or require us to raise capital, including in ways that may adversely impact our shareholders or creditors. 
 In addition, regulatory requirements that are imposed by foreign policymakers and regulators may be inconsistent or conflict with regulations that we are subject to in the U.S. and may adversely affect us. Legal and regulatory requirements continue to be subject to ongoing interpretation and change, which may result in significant new costs to comply with new or revised requirements, as well as to monitor for compliance on an ongoing basis. 
 The application of regulatory requirements and strategies in the U.S. or other jurisdictions to facilitate the orderly resolution of large financial institutions may pose a greater risk of loss for our security holders and subject us to other restrictions. 
 We are required to submit once every two years to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a resolution plan that describes our strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of material financial distress or failure. If the Federal Reserve and the FDIC were to jointly determine that our resolution plan submission was not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution, and if 

December 2022 Form 10-K 14 

Table of Contents 

we were unsuccessful in addressing any deficiencies identified by the regulators, we or any of our subsidiaries may be subject to more stringent capital, leverage, or liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth, activities or operations, or after a two-year period, we may be required to divest assets or operations. 
 In addition, provided that certain procedures are met, we can be subject to a resolution proceeding under the orderly liquidation authority under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act with the FDIC being appointed as receiver instead of being resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The FDIC s power under the orderly liquidation authority to disregard the priority of creditor claims and treat similarly situated creditors differently in certain circumstances, subject to certain limitations, could adversely impact holders of our unsecured debt. See Business Supervision and Regulation and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Regulatory Requirements. 
 Further, because both our resolution plan contemplates an SPOE strategy under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the FDIC has proposed an SPOE strategy through which it may apply its orderly liquidation authority powers, we believe that the application of an SPOE strategy is the reasonably likely outcome if either our resolution plan were implemented or a resolution proceeding were commenced under the orderly liquidation authority. An SPOE strategy generally contemplates the provision of adequate capital and liquidity by the Parent Company to certain of its subsidiaries so that such subsidiaries have the resources necessary to implement the resolution strategy, and the Parent Company has entered into a secured amended and restated support agreement with such entities, pursuant to which it would provide such capital and liquidity to such entities. 
 In addition, a wholly owned, direct subsidiary of the Parent Company, Morgan Stanley Holdings LLC Funding IHC ), serves as a resolution funding vehicle. The Parent Company has transferred, and has agreed to transfer on an ongoing basis, certain assets to the Funding IHC. In the event of a resolution scenario, the Parent Company would be obligated to contribute all of its material assets that can be contributed under the terms of the amended and restated support agreement (other than shares in subsidiaries of the Parent Company and certain other assets), to the Funding IHC. The Funding IHC would be obligated to provide capital and liquidity, as applicable, to certain supported subsidiaries, pursuant to the terms of the secured amended and restated support agreement. 
 The obligations of the Parent Company and of the Funding IHC, respectively, under the amended and restated support agreement are in most cases secured on a senior basis by the assets of the Parent Company (other than shares in subsidiaries of the Parent Company and certain other assets), and the assets of the Funding IHC, as applicable. As a result, claims of certain supported subsidiaries, including the 

Funding IHC, against the assets of the Parent Company with respect to such secured assets are effectively senior to unsecured obligations of the Parent Company. 
 Although an SPOE strategy, whether applied pursuant to our resolution plan or in a resolution proceeding under the orderly liquidation authority, is intended to result in better outcomes for creditors overall, there is no guarantee that the application of an SPOE strategy, including the provision of support to the Parent Company s supported subsidiaries pursuant to the secured amended and restated support agreement, will not result in greater losses for holders of our securities compared with a different resolution strategy for us. 
 Regulators have taken and proposed various actions to facilitate an SPOE strategy under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the orderly liquidation authority and other resolution regimes. For example, the Federal Reserve requires top-tier BHCs of U.S. G-SIBs, including the Firm, to maintain adequate TLAC, including equity and eligible long-term debt, in order to ensure that such institutions have enough loss-absorbing resources at the point of failure to be recapitalized through the conversion of debt to equity or otherwise by imposing losses on eligible TLAC where the SPOE strategy is used. The combined implication of the SPOE resolution strategy and the TLAC requirement is that our losses will be imposed on the holders of eligible long-term debt and other forms of eligible TLAC issued by the Parent Company before any losses are imposed on the creditors of our supported subsidiaries without requiring taxpayer or government financial support. 
 
 In addition, certain jurisdictions, including the U.K. and E.U. jurisdictions, have implemented, or are in the process of implementing, changes to resolution regimes to provide resolution authorities with the ability to recapitalize a failing entity organized in such jurisdiction by writing down certain unsecured liabilities or converting certain unsecured liabilities into equity. Such bail-in powers are intended to enable the recapitalization of a failing institution by allocating losses to its shareholders and unsecured creditors. This may increase the overall level of capital and liquidity required by us on a consolidated basis and may result in limitations on our ability to efficiently distribute capital and liquidity among our affiliated entities, including in times of stress. Non-U.S. regulators are also considering requirements that certain subsidiaries of large financial institutions maintain minimum amounts of TLAC that would pass losses up from the subsidiaries to the Parent Company and, ultimately, to security holders of the Parent Company in the event of failure. 
 We may be prevented from paying dividends or taking other capital actions because of regulatory constraints or revised regulatory capital requirements. 
 We are subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision, regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve, including with respect to regulatory capital requirements, stress testing and capital planning. We submit, on at least an annual basis, a capital plan to the Federal Reserve describing proposed 

15 
 December 2022 Form 10-K 

Table of Contents 

dividend payments to shareholders, proposed repurchases of our outstanding securities and other proposed capital actions that we intend to take. Our ability to take capital actions described in the capital plan is dependent on, among other factors, the results of supervisory stress tests conducted by the Federal Reserve and our compliance with regulatory capital requirements imposed by the Federal Reserve. 
 In addition, the Federal Reserve may change regulatory capital requirements to impose higher requirements that restrict our ability to take capital actions or may modify or impose other regulatory standards or restrictions that increase our operating expenses or constrain our ability to take capital actions. For additional information, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources herein. 
 The financial services industry faces substantial litigation and is subject to extensive regulatory and law enforcement investigations, and we may face damage to our reputation and legal liability. 
 As a global financial services firm, we face the risk of investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory organizations in all countries in which we conduct our business. Investigations and proceedings initiated by these authorities may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. In addition to the monetary consequences, these measures could cause collateral consequences. For example, such matters could impact our ability to engage in, or impose limitations on, certain of our businesses. 
 These investigations and proceedings, as well as the amount of penalties and fines sought, continue to impact the financial services industry, and certain U.S. and international governmental entities have brought criminal actions against, or have sought criminal convictions, pleas or deferred prosecution agreements from, financial institutions. Significant regulatory or law enforcement action against us could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations or cause us significant reputational harm, which could seriously harm our business. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act also provides compensation to whistleblowers who present the SEC or CFTC with information related to securities or commodities law violations that leads to a successful enforcement action. As a result of this compensation, it is possible we could face an increased number of investigations by the SEC or CFTC. 
 We have been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, as well as investigations or proceedings brought by regulatory agencies, arising in connection with our activities as a global diversified financial services institution. Certain of the actual or threatened legal or regulatory actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages, claims for indeterminate amounts of damages, or 

may result in material penalties, fines, or other results adverse to us. 
 
 In some cases, the issuers that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or are in financial distress. In other cases, including antitrust litigation, we may be subject to claims for joint and several liability with other defendants for treble damages or other relief related to alleged conspiracies involving other institutions. Like any large corporation, we are also subject to risk from potential employee misconduct, including non-compliance with policies, laws, rules and regulations, and improper use or disclosure of confidential information, or improper sales practices or other conduct. 
 We may be responsible for representations and warranties associated with commercial and residential real estate loans and may incur losses in excess of our reserves. 
 We originate loans secured by commercial and residential properties. Further, we securitize and trade in a wide range of commercial and residential real estate and real estate-related assets and products. In connection with these activities, we have provided, or otherwise agreed to be responsible for, certain representations and warranties. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to repurchase such assets or make other payments related to such assets if such representations and warranties were breached, and may incur losses as a result. We have also made representations and warranties in connection with our role as an originator of certain loans that we securitized in CMBS and RMBS. For additional information, see Note 15 to the financial statements. 
 A failure to address conflicts of interest appropriately could adversely affect our businesses and reputation. 
 As a global financial services firm that provides products and services to a large and diversified group of clients, including corporations, governments, financial institutions and individuals, we face potential conflicts of interest in the normal course of business. For example, potential conflicts can occur when there is a divergence of interests between us and a client, among clients, between an employee on the one hand and us or a client on the other, or situations in which we may be a creditor of a client. Moreover, we utilize multiple brands and business channels, including those resulting from our acquisitions, and continue to enhance the collaboration across business segments, which may heighten the potential conflicts of interest or the risk of improper sharing of information. 
 We have policies, procedures and controls that are designed to identify and address potential conflicts of interest, and we utilize various measures, such as the use of disclosure, to manage these potential conflicts. However, identifying and mitigating potential conflicts of interest can be complex and challenging and can become the focus of media and regulatory scrutiny. Indeed, actions that merely appear to 

December 2022 Form 10-K 16 

Table of Contents 

create a conflict can put our reputation at risk even if the likelihood of an actual conflict has been mitigated. It is possible that potential conflicts could give rise to litigation or enforcement actions, which may lead to our clients being less willing to enter into transactions in which a conflict may occur and could adversely affect our businesses and reputation. 
 Our regulators also have the ability to scrutinize our activities for potential conflicts of interest, including through detailed examinations of specific transactions. For example, our status as a BHC supervised by the Federal Reserve subjects us to direct Federal Reserve scrutiny with respect to transactions between our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries and their affiliates. Further, the Volcker Rule subjects us to regulatory scrutiny regarding certain transactions between us and our clients. 
 Risk Management 
 Our risk management strategies, models and processes may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposures in all market environments or against all types of risk, which could result in unexpected losses. 
 We have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management capabilities and expect to continue to do so in the future. Nonetheless, our risk management strategies, models and processes, including our use of various risk models for assessing market, credit, liquidity and operational exposures and hedging strategies, stress testing and other analysis, may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk, including risks that are unidentified or unanticipated. 
 As our businesses change and grow, including through acquisitions, and the markets in which we operate evolve, our risk management strategies, models and processes may not always adapt with those changes. Some of our methods of managing risk are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior and management s judgment. As a result, these methods may not predict future risk exposures, which could be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate. 
 In addition, many models we use are based on assumptions or inputs regarding correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators and, therefore, cannot anticipate sudden, unanticipated, or unidentified market or economic movements, such as the impact of a pandemic or a sudden geopolitical conflict, which could cause us to incur losses. 
 Management of market, credit, liquidity, operational, model, legal, regulatory and compliance risks requires, among other things, policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events, and these policies and procedures may not be fully effective. Our trading risk management strategies and techniques also seek to balance 

our ability to profit from trading positions with our exposure to potential losses. 
 While we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome or the timing of such outcomes. For example, to the extent that our trading or investing activities involve less liquid trading markets or are otherwise subject to restrictions on sales or hedging, we may not be able to reduce our positions and, therefore, reduce our risk associated with such positions. We may, therefore, incur losses in the course of our trading or investing activities. For more information on how we monitor and manage market and certain other risks and related strategies, models and processes, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk Market Risk. 
 Climate change manifesting as physical or transition risks could result in increased costs and risks and adversely affect our operations, businesses and clients. 
 
 There continues to be increasing concern over the risks of climate change and related environmental sustainability matters. The physical risks of climate change include harm to people and property arising from acute, climate-related events, such as floods, hurricanes, heatwaves, wildfires, and chronic, longer-term shifts in climate patterns, such as higher global average temperatures, rising sea levels, and droughts. Such events could disrupt our operations or those of our clients or third-parties on which we rely, including through direct damage to physical assets and indirect impacts from supply chain disruption and market volatility. Over the longer term, these events could impact the ability of certain of our clients or customers to repay their obligations, reduce the value of collateral, limit insurance coverage and result in other effects. 
 
 Additionally, transitioning to a low-carbon economy will likely require extensive policy, legal, technology and market changes. Transition risks, including changes in consumer and business sentiment, related technologies, shareholder preferences, and any additional regulatory and legislative requirements, including carbon taxes, could increase our expenses and adversely impact our strategies, including by limiting our ability to pursue certain business activities or offer certain products and services. Over the longer term, negative impacts to certain of our clients, such as decreased profitability and stranded assets, could also lead to increased credit and counterparty risk to us. 
 
 In addition, our reputation and client relationships may be adversely impacted as a result of our practices related to climate change, including our involvement, or our clients involvement, in certain industries, projects, or initiatives associated with causing, or potentially slowing solutions to, climate change, as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct or change our activities in response to considerations relating to climate change. Legislative or

regulatory uncertainties and change regarding climate-related risks, including inconsistent perspectives or requirements, are likely to result in higher regulatory, compliance, credit, reputational and other risks and costs. 
 
 Our ability to achieve our long-term climate-related goals and commitments could also result in reputational harm as a result of public sentiment, regulatory scrutiny, litigation and reduced investor and stakeholder confidence. If we are unable to achieve our objectives relating to climate change or our current response to climate change is perceived to be ineffective or insufficient, our business and reputation may suffer. 
 
 The risks associated with, and the perspective of regulators, governments, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders regarding, climate change are continuing to evolve rapidly, which can make it difficult to assess the ultimate impact on us of climate change-related risks and uncertainties. As climate risk is interconnected with other risk types, including geopolitical risks, we have developed and continue to enhance processes to embed climate risk considerations into our risk management strategies for risks such as market, credit and operational risks, as well as our governance structures. Despite our risk management strategies, the unpredictability surrounding the timing and severity of climate change events and societal or political changes in reaction to them make it difficult to predict, identify, monitor and effectively mitigate climate risk exposure. 
 
 In addition, the methodologies and data used to manage and monitor climate risk are still in early stages and continue to evolve. Current approaches utilize information and estimates that have been derived from information or factors released by third-party sources, which may not reflect the latest or most accurate data. Climate-related data, particularly greenhouse gas emissions for clients and counterparties, remains limited in availability and variable in quality. Certain third-party information may also change over time as methodologies evolve and are refined. While we believe this information is the best available at the time, we may only be able to complete limited validation. Furthermore, modeling capabilities and methodologies to analyze climate-related risks, although improving, remain nascent and emerging. These and other factors could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in the estimates and beliefs made by third-parties and by us, which could also impact our management of risk in this area. 
 Replacement of London Interbank Offered Rate and replacement or reform of other interest rate benchmarks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve, have sponsored initiatives in recent years to replace LIBOR and replace or reform certain other interest rate benchmarks (collectively, the IBORs ). A transition away from use of the IBORs to alternative rates and other potential 

interest rate benchmark reforms is underway and is a multi-year initiative. These reforms have caused and may in the future cause such rates to perform differently than in the past, or to cease entirely, or have other consequences that are contrary to market expectations. 
 The ongoing market transition away from IBORs and other interest rate benchmarks to alternative reference rates is complex and could have a range of adverse impacts on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, such transition or reform could: 
 Adversely impact the pricing, liquidity, value of, return on and trading for a broad array of financial products, including any IBOR-linked securities, loans and derivatives that are included in our financial assets and liabilities; 
 Require further extensive changes to documentation that governs or references IBOR or IBOR-based products, including, for example, pursuant to time-consuming renegotiations of existing documentation to modify the terms of outstanding securities and related hedging transactions; 
 Result in a population of products with documentation that governs or references IBOR or IBOR-based products but that cannot be amended due to an inability to obtain sufficient consent from counterparties or product owners; 
 Result in inquiries, reviews or other actions from regulators in respect of our (or the market s) preparation, readiness, transition plans and actions regarding the replacement of an IBOR with one or more alternative reference rates, including regulatory guidance regarding constraints on the entry into new U.S. dollar IBOR-linked contracts after December 31, 2021; 
 Result in disputes, litigation or other actions with clients, counterparties and investors in various scenarios, such as regarding the interpretation and enforceability of provisions in IBOR-based products such as fallback language or other related provisions, including in the case of fallbacks to the alternative reference rates, any economic, legal, operational or other impact resulting from the fundamental differences between the IBORs and the various alternative reference rates; 
 Require the additional transition and/or further development of appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition our risk management processes from IBORs to those based on one or more alternative reference rates in a timely manner, including by quantifying value and risk for various alternative reference rates, which may prove challenging given the limited history of the proposed alternative reference rates; and 
 Cause us to incur additional costs in relation to any of the above factors. 
 Other factors include the pace of the transition to the alternative reference rates, timing mismatches between cash and derivative markets, the specific terms and parameters for and market acceptance of any alternative reference rate, market conventions for the use of any alternative reference rate in connection with a particular product (including the

timing and market adoption of any conventions proposed or recommended by any industry or other group), prices of and the liquidity of trading markets for products based on alternative reference rates, and our ability to further transition and develop appropriate systems and analytics for one or more alternative reference rates. 
 See also Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Regulatory Requirements Regulatory Developments and Other Matters herein. 
 Competitive Environment 
 We face strong competition from financial services firms and others, which could lead to pricing pressures that could materially adversely affect our revenues and profitability. 
 The financial services industry and all aspects of our businesses are intensely competitive, and we expect them to remain so. We compete with commercial banks, investment banking firms, brokerage firms, insurance companies, exchanges, electronic trading and clearing platforms, financial data repositories, sponsors of mutual funds, hedge funds, real assets funds and private credit and equity funds, energy companies, financial technology firms and other companies offering financial or ancillary services in the U.S. and globally, including through the internet. We also compete with companies that provide online trading and banking services, investment advisor services, robo-advice capabilities, access to digital asset capabilities and services, and other financial products and services. We compete on the basis of several factors, including transaction execution, capital or access to capital, products and services, innovation, technology, reputation, risk appetite and price. 
 Over time, certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated, as institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have left businesses, been acquired by or merged into other firms, or have declared bankruptcy. Such changes could result in our remaining competitors gaining greater capital and other resources, such as the ability to offer a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity, or new competitors may emerge. 
 We have experienced and may continue to experience pricing pressures as a result of these factors and as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing prices, eliminating commissions or other fees, or providing more favorable terms of business. In addition, certain of our competitors may be subject to different and, in some cases, less stringent, legal and regulatory regimes than we are, thereby putting us at a competitive disadvantage. Some new competitors in the financial technology sector have sought to target existing segments of our businesses that could be susceptible to disruption by innovative or less regulated business models. For more information regarding the competitive environment in which we operate, see Business 

Competition and Business Supervision and Regulation. 
 Automated trading markets and the introduction and application of new technologies may adversely affect our business and may increase competition. 
 We continue to experience price competition in some of our businesses. In particular, the ability to execute securities, derivatives and other financial instrument trades electronically on exchanges, swap execution facilities and other automated trading platforms, and the introduction and application of new technologies will likely continue the pressure on revenues. The trend toward direct access to automated, electronic markets will likely continue as additional markets move to more automated trading platforms. We have experienced and will likely continue to experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future. 
 Our ability to retain and attract qualified employees is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance. 
 
 Our people are our most important asset. We compete with various other companies in attracting and retaining qualified and skilled personnel. If we are unable to continue to attract, integrate and retain highly qualified employees, or do so at levels or in forms necessary to maintain our competitive position, or if compensation costs required to attract and retain employees become more expensive, or the competitive market for talent further intensifies, our performance, including our competitive position and results of operations, could be materially adversely affected. 
 The financial industry has experienced and may continue to experience more stringent regulation of employee compensation, including limitations relating to incentive-based compensation, clawback requirements and special taxation, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to hire or retain the most qualified employees. 
 International Risk 
 We are subject to numerous political, economic, legal, tax, operational, franchise and other risks as a result of our international operations that could adversely impact our businesses in many ways. 
 We are subject to numerous political, economic, legal, tax, operational, franchise and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries, including risks of possible nationalization, expropriation, price controls, capital controls, exchange controls, increased taxes and levies, cybersecurity, data transfer and outsourcing restrictions, prohibitions on certain types of foreign and capital market activities, limitations on cross-border listings and other restrictive governmental actions, as well as the outbreak of hostilities or political and governmental instability, including tensions between China and the U.S. In many countries, the laws and 

19 
 December 2022 Form 10-K 

Table of Contents 

regulations applicable to the securities and financial services industries are uncertain, evolving and subject to sudden change or may be inconsistent with U.S. law. It may be also difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market or adapt to changes in law, which could adversely impact our businesses. Our inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market could have a significant and negative effect not only on our business in that market but also on our reputation generally. We are also subject to the risk that transactions we structure might not be legally enforceable in all cases. 
 Various emerging market countries have experienced severe political, economic or financial disruptions, including significant devaluations of their currencies, defaults or potential defaults on sovereign debt, capital and currency exchange controls, high rates of inflation and low or negative growth rates in their economies. Crime and corruption, as well as issues of security and personal safety, also exist in certain of these countries. These conditions could adversely impact our businesses and increase volatility in financial markets generally. 
 A disease pandemic, such as COVID-19 and its variants, or other widespread health emergencies, natural disasters, climate-related incidents, terrorist activities or military actions, such as the war between Russia and Ukraine, or social or political tensions, could create economic and financial disruptions in emerging markets or in other areas of the global economy that could adversely affect our businesses, or could lead to operational difficulties, including travel limitations, that could impair our ability to manage or conduct our businesses around the world. 
 As a U.S. company, we are required to comply with the economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by OFAC and similar multinational bodies and governmental agencies worldwide, which may be inconsistent with local law. We are also subject to applicable AML and anti-corruption laws in the U.S., as well as in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the Bank Secrecy Act, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. A violation of a sanction, embargo program, AML, or anti-corruption law could subject us, and individual employees, to a regulatory enforcement action, as well as significant civil and criminal penalties. 
 Acquisition, Divestiture and Joint Venture Risk 
 We may be unable to fully capture the expected value from acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, partnerships, minority stakes or strategic alliances, and certain acquisitions may subject our business to new or increased risk. 
 In connection with past or future acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, partnerships, minority stakes or strategic alliances (including with MUFG), we face numerous risks and uncertainties in combining, transferring, separating or 

integrating the relevant businesses and systems that may present operational and other risks, including the need to combine or separate accounting, data processing and other systems, management controls and legal entities, and to integrate relationships with clients, trading counterparties and business partners. Certain of these strategic initiatives, and integration thereof, may cause us to incur incremental expenses and may also require incremental financial, management and other resources. 
 In the case of joint ventures, partnerships and minority stakes, we are subject to additional risks and uncertainties because we may be dependent upon, and subject to liability, losses or reputational damage relating to systems, controls and personnel that are not under our control and conflicts or disagreements between us and any of our joint venture partners or partners may negatively impact the benefits to be achieved by the relevant joint venture or partnership, respectively. 
 For example, the integrations of E TRADE and Eaton Vance involve a number of risks, including failure to realize anticipated cost savings and difficulty integrating the businesses. It is possible that the remaining integration processes could also result in unanticipated disruptions of ongoing businesses, the loss of key employees, the loss of clients, or overall integrations that take longer than originally anticipated. 
 There is no assurance that any of our acquisitions, divestitures or investments will be successfully integrated or disaggregated or yield all of the positive benefits and synergies anticipated. If we are not able to integrate or disaggregate successfully our past and future acquisitions or dispositions, including aligning the processes, policies and procedures of the acquired entities with our standards, there is a risk that our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected. 
 Certain of our business initiatives, including expansions of existing businesses, may change our client or account profile or bring us into contact, directly or indirectly, with individuals and entities that are not within our traditional client and counterparty base and may expose us to new asset classes, services, competitors and new markets. These business activities expose us to new and enhanced risks, greater regulatory scrutiny of these activities, increased credit-related, sovereign, compliance and operational risks, as well as franchise and reputational concerns regarding the manner in which these assets are being operated or held, or services are being delivered.

Non-interest Expenses 1 
 in millions) 

1. The percentages on the bars in the chart represent the contribution of compensation and benefits expenses and non-compensation expenses to the total. 
 Compensation and benefits expenses of 23,053 million in 2022 decreased 6 from the prior year, primarily due to lower expenses related to certain deferred cash-based compensation plans linked to investment performance, lower discretionary incentive compensation on lower revenues, and lower stock-based compensation expense driven by the Firm s share price, partially offset by higher salary expenses driven in part by the impact of higher headcount. 
 
 2022 Compensation and benefits expenses included 133 million associated with a December employee action recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022. 
 Non-compensation expenses of 16,246 million in 2022 increased 5 from the prior year, primarily due to an increased spend on technology and higher legal expenses, including 200 million related to a regulatory matter in the second quarter of 2022. 
 Provision for Credit Losses 
 The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of 280 million in 2022 was due to portfolio growth and deterioration in macroeconomic outlook. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of 4 million in 2021 was primarily as a result of portfolio growth offset by the impact of changes in loan quality mix. 
 Income Taxes 
 The Firm's effective tax rate of 20.7 for 2022 was lower compared with the prior year, primarily driven by the realization of certain tax benefits.

 Management s Discussion and Analysis 

Russia and Ukraine War 
 We continue to monitor the war in Ukraine and its impact on both the Ukrainian and Russian economies, as well as related impacts on other world economies and the financial markets. Our direct exposure to both Russia and Ukraine remains limited. We are not entering any new business onshore in Russia and our activities in Russia are limited to helping global clients address and close out pre-existing obligations. 
 Refer to Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements for more information on the potential effects of geopolitical events and acts of war or aggression. 
 Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information 
 We prepare our financial statements using U.S. GAAP. From time to time, we may disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures in this document or in the course of our earnings releases, earnings and other conference calls, financial presentations, definitive proxy statement and otherwise. A non-GAAP financial measure excludes, or includes, amounts from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We consider the non-GAAP financial measures we disclose to be useful to us, investors, analysts and other stakeholders by providing further transparency about, or an alternate means of assessing or comparing our financial condition, operating results and capital adequacy. 
 These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, U.S. GAAP and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Whenever we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, we will also generally define it or present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, along with a reconciliation of the differences between the U.S. GAAP financial measure and the non-GAAP financial measure. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2022, we introduced new non-GAAP financial measures. These measures exclude the impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on investments associated with certain employee deferred cash-based compensation plans from net revenues and compensation expenses. These employee deferred cash-based compensation plans are primarily reflected in our Wealth Management business segment. We consider these new measures useful for analysts, investors, and other stakeholders to allow better comparability of period-to-period underlying operating performance and revenue trends, especially in our Wealth Management business segment. By excluding the impact of these items we are better able to describe the business drivers and resulting impact to net revenues and corresponding change to the associated compensation expenses. 
 Compensation expense for deferred cash-based compensation awards is calculated based on the notional value of the award granted, adjusted for changes in the fair value of the 

referenced investments that employees select. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period relevant to each separately vesting portion of deferred awards. 
 We invest directly, as a principal, in financial instruments and other investments to economically hedge certain of our obligations under these deferred cash-based compensation plans. Changes in the fair value of such investments, net of financing costs, are recorded in Net revenues, and included in Transactional revenues in the Wealth Management business segment. Although changes in compensation expense resulting from changes in the fair value of the referenced investments will generally be offset by changes in the fair value of investments recognized in net revenues, there is typically a timing difference between the immediate recognition of gains and losses on our investments and the deferred recognition of the related compensation expense over the vesting period. While this timing difference may not be material to our Income before provision for income taxes in any individual period, it may impact the Wealth Management business segment reported ratios and operating metrics in certain periods due to potentially significant impacts to net revenues and compensation expenses. For additional information on deferred cash-based compensation, refer to Other Matters herein. 
 The principal non-GAAP financial measures presented in this document are set forth in the following tables.

 2. Adjusted amounts exclude the effect of costs related to the integrations of E TRADE and Eaton Vance, net of tax as appropriate. 
 3. ROE and ROTCE represent earnings applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders as a percentage of average common equity and average tangible common equity, respectively. When excluding integration-related costs, both the numerator and average denominator are adjusted. 
 4. Average common equity and average tangible common equity for each business segment is determined using our Required Capital framework (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources Regulatory Requirements Attribution of Average Common Equity According to the Required Capital Framework herein). The sums of the segments Average common equity and Average tangible common equity do not equal the Consolidated measures due to Parent equity. 
 5. The calculation of ROE and ROTCE by segment uses net income applicable to Morgan Stanley by segment less preferred dividends allocated to each segment as a percentage of average common equity and average tangible common equity, respectively, allocated to each segment.

Return on Tangible Common Equity Goal 
 We have an ROTCE goal of over 20 . Our ROTCE goal is a forward-looking statement that was based on a normal market environment and may be materially affected by many factors. 
 See Risk Factors herein for further information on market and economic conditions and their potential effects on our future operating results. 
 For further information on non-GAAP measures (ROTCE excluding integration-related expenses), see Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information herein. 
 
 Business Segments 
 Substantially all of our operating revenues and operating expenses are directly attributable to our business segments. Certain revenues and expenses have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective net revenues, non-interest expenses or other relevant measures. See Note 23 to the financial statements for segment net revenues by income statement line item and information on intersegment transactions. 
 The global economic and geopolitical environment in 2022 was characterized by elevated inflation, rising interest rates and volatility in global financial markets and these factors have continued into 2023. This environment has impacted our businesses, as discussed further herein. 
 Net Revenues 
 Investment Banking 
 Investment banking revenues are derived from client engagements in which we act as an advisor, underwriter or distributor of capital. 
 Within the Institutional Securities business segment, these revenues are primarily composed of fees earned from underwriting equity and fixed income securities, syndicating loans and advisory services in relation to mergers and acquisitions, divestitures and corporate restructurings. 
 Within the Wealth Management business segment, these revenues are derived from the distribution of newly issued securities. 
 Trading 
 Trading revenues include the realized gains and losses from transactions in financial instruments, unrealized gains and losses from ongoing changes in the fair value of our positions, and gains and losses from financial instruments used to economically hedge compensation expense related to certain employee deferred compensation plans. 
 Within the Institutional Securities business segment, Trading revenues arise from transactions in cash instruments and 

derivatives in which we act as a market maker for our clients. In this role, we stand ready to buy, sell or otherwise transact with customers under a variety of market conditions and to provide firm or indicative prices in response to customer requests. Our liquidity obligations can be explicit in some cases, and in others, customers expect us to be willing to transact with them. In order to most effectively fulfill our market-making function, we engage in activities across all of our trading businesses that include, but are not limited to: 
 taking positions in anticipation of, and in response to, customer demand to buy or sell and depending on the liquidity of the relevant market and the size of the position to hold those positions for a period of time; 
 building, maintaining and rebalancing inventory held to facilitate client activity through trades with other market participants; 
 managing and assuming basis risk (risk associated with imperfect hedging) between risks incurred from the facilitation of client transactions and the standardized products available in the market to hedge those risks; 
 trading in the market to remain current on pricing and trends; and 
 engaging in other activities to provide efficiency and liquidity for markets. 
 In many markets, the realized and unrealized gains and losses from purchase and sale transactions will include any spreads between bids and offers. Certain fees received on loans carried at fair value and dividends from equity securities are also recorded in Trading revenues since they relate to positions carried at fair value. 
 Within the Wealth Management business segment, Trading revenues primarily include revenues from customers purchases and sales of fixed income instruments in which we act as principal, as well as gains and losses related to investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans. 
 Investments 
 Investments revenues are composed of realized and unrealized gains and losses derived from investments, including those associated with employee deferred compensation and co-investment plans. Estimates of the fair value of the investments that produce these revenues may involve significant judgment and may fluctuate significantly over time in light of business, market, economic and financial conditions, generally or in relation to specific transactions. 
 Within the Institutional Securities segment, gains and losses are primarily from business-related investments. Certain investments are subject to sale restrictions. 
 Within the Investment Management business segment, Investments revenues are primarily from performance-based fees in the form of carried interest, a portion of which is subject to reversal, and gains and losses from investments.

 Management s Discussion and Analysis 

The business is entitled to receive carried interest when the return in certain funds exceeds specified performance targets. Additionally, there are certain sponsored Investment Management funds consolidated by us where revenues are primarily attributable to holders of noncontrolling interests. 
 Commissions and Fees 
 Commissions and fees result from arrangements in which the client is charged a fee for executing transactions related to securities, services related to sales and trading activities, and sales of other products. 
 Within the Institutional Securities business segment, commissions and fees include fees earned from market-making activities, such as executing and clearing client transactions on major stock and derivative exchanges, as well as from OTC derivatives. 
 Within the Wealth Management business segment, commissions and fees arise from client transactions primarily in equity securities, insurance products, mutual funds, futures and options. Wealth Management also earns revenues from order flow payments for directing customer orders to broker-dealers, exchanges and market centers for execution . 
 Asset Management 
 Asset management revenues include fees associated with the management and supervision of assets and the distribution of funds and similar products. 
 Within the Wealth Management business segment, Asset management revenues are related to advisory services associated with fee-based assets, account service and administration, as well as distribution of products. These revenues are generally based on the net asset value of the account in which a client is invested. 
 Within the Investment Management business segment, Asset management revenues are primarily composed of fees received from investment vehicles on the basis of assets under management. Performance-based fees, not in the form of carried interest, are earned on certain products and separately managed accounts as a percentage of appreciation in value and, in certain cases, are based upon the achievement of performance criteria. These performance fees are generally recognized annually. 
 Net Interest 
 Interest income and Interest expense are functions of the level and mix of total assets and liabilities, including Trading assets and Trading liabilities, Investment securities, Securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell, Securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, Loans, Deposits and Borrowings. 
 Within the Institutional Securities business segment, Net interest is a function of market-making strategies, client 

activity, and the prevailing level, term structure and volatility of interest rates. Net interest is impacted by market-making activities as securities held by the Firm generally earn interest, as do securities borrowed and securities purchased under agreements to resell, while securities loaned and securities sold under agreements to repurchase generally incur interest expense. 
 Within the Wealth Management business segment, Interest income is driven by assets held including Investment securities, Loans and margin loans. Interest expense is driven by Deposits and other funding. Upon acquisition, E TRADE s Investment securities were recorded at fair value, and the resulting premium is being amortized over the life of the portfolio against interest income. 
 Other 
 Other revenues for Institutional Securities include revenues and losses from equity method investments, fees earned in association with lending activities, mark-to-market gains and losses on loans and lending commitments held for sale, as well as gains and losses on economic derivative hedges associated with certain held-for-sale and held-for-investment loans and lending commitments. 
 Other revenues for Wealth Management include realized gains and losses on AFS securities, account handling fees, referral fees and other miscellaneous revenues. 
 Provision for Credit Losses 
 The Provision for credit losses includes the provision for credit losses for loans and lending commitments held for investment. 
 Institutional Securities Fixed Income and Equities 
 Fixed income and Equities net revenues are composed of Trading revenues, Commissions and fees, Asset management revenues, Net interest, and certain Investments and Other revenues directly attributable to those businesses. These revenues, which can be affected by a variety of interrelated factors, including market volumes, bid-offer spreads and the impact of market conditions on inventory held to facilitate client activity, as well as the effect of hedging activity, are viewed in the aggregate when assessing the performance and profitability of our businesses. 
 Following is a description of the revenue-generating activities within our equity and fixed income businesses, as well as how their results impact the income statement line items. 
 Equity Financing. We provide financing, prime brokerage and fund administration services to our clients active in the equity markets through a variety of products, including margin lending, securities lending and swaps. Results from this business are largely driven by the difference between financing income earned and financing costs incurred, which are reflected in Net interest for securities lending products, 

December 2022 Form 10-K 28 

Table of Contents 
 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis 

and in Trading revenues for derivative products. Fees for providing fund administration services are reflected in Asset management revenues. 
 Equity Execution services. A significant portion of the results for this business is generated by commissions and fees from executing and clearing client transactions on major stock and derivative exchanges, as well as from OTC transactions. We make markets for our clients principally in equity-related securities and derivative products, including those that provide liquidity and are utilized for hedging. Market-making also generates gains and losses on inventory held to facilitate client activity, which are reflected in Trading revenues. Execution services also includes certain Investments and Other revenues. 
 Fixed income Within fixed income, we make markets in various flow and structured products in order to facilitate client activity as part of the following products and services: 
 Global macro products. We make markets for our clients in interest rate, foreign exchange and emerging market products, including exchange-traded and OTC securities and derivative instruments. The results of this market-making activity are primarily driven by gains and losses from buying and selling positions to stand ready for and satisfy client demand and are recorded in Trading revenues. 
 Credit products. We make markets in credit-sensitive products, such as corporate bonds and mortgage securities and other securitized products, and related derivative instruments. The values of positions in this business are sensitive to changes in credit spreads and interest rates, which result in gains and losses reflected in Trading revenues. We undertake lending activities, which include commercial mortgage lending, secured lending facilities and financing extended to sales and trading customers. Due to the amount and type of the interest-bearing securities and loans making up this business, a significant portion of the results is also reflected in Net interest revenues. 
 Commodities products and Other. We make markets in various commodity products related primarily to electricity, natural gas, oil and metals. Other activities primarily include results from the centralized management of our fixed income derivative counterparty exposures and the management of derivative counterparty risk. These activities are primarily recorded in Trading revenues. 
 Fixed income also includes certain Investments and Other revenues. 

Institutional Securities Other Net Revenues 
 Other net revenues include impacts from certain treasury functions, such as liquidity costs and gains and losses on economic hedges related to certain borrowings. Other net revenues also include mark-to-market gains and losses on held-for-sale corporate loans and lending commitments, as well as net interest and gain and losses on economic hedges associated with held-for-sale and held-for-investment corporate loans and lending commitments. Also included are gains and losses from financial instruments used to economically hedge compensation expense related to certain employee deferred compensation plans, as well as Investments and Other revenues that are not directly attributable to Fixed income and Equities businesses. 
 Compensation Expense 
 Compensation and benefits expenses include base salaries and fixed allowances, formulaic programs, discretionary incentive compensation, amortization of deferred cash and equity awards, changes in the fair value of investments to which certain deferred compensation plans are referenced, including the Firm s share price for certain awards, carried interest allocated to employees, severance costs, and other items such as health and welfare benefits. 
 The factors that drive compensation for our employees vary from period to period, from segment to segment and within a segment. For certain revenue-producing employees in the Wealth Management and Investment Management business segments, compensation is largely paid on the basis of formulaic payouts that link employee compensation to revenues. Compensation for other employees, including revenue-producing employees in the Institutional Securities business segment, include base salary and benefits and may also include incentive compensation that is determined following the assessment of the Firm s, business unit s and individual s performance. 
 Compensation expense for deferred cash-based compensation plans is recognized over the relevant vesting period and is adjusted based on the notional earnings of the referenced investments until distribution. Although changes in compensation expense resulting from changes in the fair value of the referenced investments will generally be offset by changes in the fair value of investments made by the Firm, there is typically a timing difference between the immediate recognition of gains and losses on the Firm's investments and the compensation expense recognized over the vesting period. 
 Income Taxes 
 The income tax provision for our business segments is generally determined based on the revenues, expenses and activities directly attributable to each business segment. Certain items have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective net revenues or other relevant measures.

 4. Includes Rule 144A and publicly registered issuances, non-convertible preferred stock, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, and taxable municipal debt. Excludes leveraged loans and self-led issuances. 
 Investment Banking Revenues 
 Investment banking revenues of 5,235 million in 2022 decreased 49 compared with the prior year, primarily reflecting a decrease in underwriting revenues in line with market levels, reflecting a significant decline in global volumes. 
 Advisory revenues decreased primarily due to fewer completed M A transactions. 
 Equity underwriting revenues decreased on lower volumes, with lower revenues across all products, notably in initial public offerings, secondary block share trades and follow-on offerings. 
 Fixed income underwriting revenues decreased primarily due to lower bond and loan issuances. 

In 2022, Investment Banking operated in a global economic environment characterized, particularly in the second half of 2022, by significantly reduced M A and underwriting activity in comparison to 2021 levels, amid elevated inflation, rising interest rates and market volatility. To the extent global announced M A transactions and underwriting volumes remain at levels similar to those in the second half of 2022, we would expect these market conditions to continue to have an adverse im pact on Investment Banking revenues compared to our performance in 2021.

 Net revenues of 10,769 million in 2022 decreased 6 compared with the prior year, reflecting a decrease in execution services driven by markdowns on certain business-related investments and lower levels of client activity amid challenging market conditions, partially offset by an increase in financing. 
 Financing revenues increased primarily due to the absence of a loss from a credit event for a single client in the prior year period, partially offset by the impact of lower average client balances. 
 Execution services revenues decreased primarily due to mark-to-market losses on certain business-related investments compared to gains in the fourth quarter of 2021, lower client activity, as well as the impact of market conditions on inventory held to facilitate client activity in

cash equities, partially offset by the absence of trading losses related to the aforementioned credit event. 
 Fixed Income 
 Net revenues of 9,022 million in 2022 increased 20 compared with the prior year, primarily reflecting an increase in global macro products, which benefited from strong client engagement and increased client flow activity in an environment characterized by inflationary pressures, central bank actions and fiscal activity driving higher volatility. 
 Global macro products revenues increased in rates and foreign exchange products, primarily due to the positive impact of market conditions on inventory held to facilitate client activity and increased client activity. 
 Credit products revenues decreased, reflecting the impact of widening credit spreads and market volatility, primarily due to the impact of market conditions on inventory held to facilitate client activity in securitized products. 
 Commodities products and other fixed income revenues increased primarily due to higher client activity in Commodities. 
 Other Net Revenues 
 Other net revenues reflected a loss of 633 million in 2022 compared to a gain in the prior year, primarily due to mark-to-market losses on corporate loans held for sale inclusive of hedges of 876 million in 2022 compared to 195 million in 2021, partially offset by higher net interest income and fees of 701 million in 2022 compared with 509 million in 2021. Also contributing to the decline were losses in 2022 compared with gains in 2021 on investments associated with certain employee deferred cash-based compensation plans and lower results from our Japanese joint venture, MUMSS. 
 Provision for Credit Losses 
 In 2022, the Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of 211 million was driven by portfolio growth and deterioration in macroeconomic outlook. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments was a net release of 7 million in 2021, primarily as the impact of changes in loan quality mix were offset by portfolio growth. 
 For further information on the Provision for credit losses, see Credit Risk herein. 
 Non-interest Expenses 
 Non-interest expenses of 17,467 million in 2022 decreased 3 compared with the prior year due to lower Compensation and benefits expenses, partially offset by higher Non-compensation expenses. 
 Compensation and benefits expenses decreased in the current year primarily due to lower discretionary incentive compensation on lower revenues, lower stock-based compensation expense driven by the Firm s share price, and 

lower expenses related to certain deferred cash-based compensation plans linked to investment performance, partially offset by higher salary expenses. 
 Non-compensation expenses increased in the current year primarily due to an increase in legal expenses, including 200 million related to a regulatory matter in the second quarter of 2022 and an increased spend on technology. 
 Income Tax Items 
 
 The effective tax rate of 19.5 for 2022 was lower compared with the prior year, primarily driven by the realization of certain tax benefits.

investments associated with certain employee deferred cash-based compensation plans and lower client activity in equities. 
 For further information on the impact of investments associated with certain employee deferred cash-based compensation plans, see Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information herein. 
 Net Interest 
 Net interest revenues of 7,429 million in 2022 increased 38 compared with the prior year, primarily due to net effect of higher interest rates and growth in bank lending. 
 
 The level and pace of interest rate changes and other macroeconomic factors may impact client demand for loans as well as preferences for cash allocation to other products, potentially resulting in changes in the deposit mix and associated interest expense. As such net interest income may be impacted in future periods. 
 Non-interest Expenses 
 Non-interest expenses of 17,765 million in 2022 decreased 2 compared with the prior year, as a result of lower Compensation and benefits expenses, partially offset by higher Non-compensation expenses. 
 Compensation and benefits expenses decreased, primarily due to lower expenses related to certain deferred cash-based compensation plans linked to investment performance and a decrease in the formulaic payout to Wealth Management representatives driven by lower compensable revenues, partially offset by the impact of higher headcount. 
 For further information on the impact of expenses related to certain employee deferred cash-based compensation plans linked to investment performance, see Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information herein. 
 Non-compensation expenses increased, primarily driven by spend on technology and higher marketing and business development costs.

Net Revenues 
 Asset Management and Related Fees 
 Asset management and related fees of 5,332 million in 2022 decreased 4 compared with the prior year, reflecting the impact of the decline in the equity markets, partially offset by incremental revenues as a result of the Eaton Vance acquisition and the impact of lower fee waivers in certain money market funds. 
 Asset management revenues are influenced by the level and relative mix of AUM and related fee rates. The current market environment may impact AUM and net flows within asset classes and therefore our asset management revenues. 
 See Assets under Management or Supervision herein. 
 Performance-based Income and Other 
 Performance-based income and other revenues were 43 million in 2022, representing a 93 decrease from the prior year, primarily due to lower accrued carried interest in certain private equity and real estate funds, losses on investments associated with certain employee deferred cash-based compensation plans, and mark-to-market losses on public investments. 
 Non-interest Expenses 
 Non-interest expenses of 4,568 million in 2022 were relatively unchanged from the prior year period, reflecting higher Non-compensation expenses offset by lower Compensation and benefits. 
 Compensation and benefits expenses decreased primarily due to lower discretionary incentive compensation driven by lower asset management revenues and lower compensation associated with carried interest, partially offset by the impact of incremental compensation as a result of the Eaton Vance acquisition. 
 Non-compensation expenses increased primarily due to higher marketing and business development costs and incremental expenses as a result of the Eaton Vance acquisition.

Other Matters 
 Deferred Cash-Based Compensation 
 The Firm sponsors a number of deferred cash-based compensation programs for current and former employees, which generally contain vesting, clawback and cancellation provisions. 
 Employees are permitted to allocate the value of their deferred awards among a menu of notional investments, whereby the value of their awards will track the performance of the referenced notional investments. The menu of investments, which is selected by the Firm, includes fixed income, equity, commodity and money market funds. 
 Compensation expense for deferred cash-based compensation awards is calculated based on the notional value of the award granted, adjusted for changes in the fair value of the referenced investments that employees select. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period relevant to each separately vesting portion of deferred awards. 
 We invest directly, as a principal, in financial instruments and other investments to economically hedge certain of our obligations under these deferred cash-based compensation plans. Changes in the fair value of such investments, net of financing costs, are recorded in Net revenues, and included in Transactional revenues in the Wealth Management business segment. Although changes in compensation expense resulting from changes in the fair value of the referenced investments will generally be offset by changes in the fair value of investments recognized in net revenues, there is typically a timing difference between the immediate recognition of gains and losses on our investments and the deferred recognition of the related compensation expense over the vesting period. While this timing difference may not be material to our Income before provision for income taxes in any individual period, it may impact the Wealth Management business segment reported ratios and operating metrics in certain periods due to potentially significant impacts to net revenues and compensation expenses. At December 31, 2022, substantially all employee notional investments that subjected the Firm to price risk were economically hedged.

Accounting Development Updates 
 The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued certain accounting updates that apply to us. Accounting updates not listed below were assessed and either determined to be not applicable or to not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations upon adoption. 
 We adopted the following accounting updates on January 1, 2023: 
 Financial Instruments Credit Losses. This accounting update eliminates the accounting guidance for Troubled Debt Restructurings TDRs and requires new disclosures regarding certain modifications of financing receivables i.e. , principal forgiveness, interest rate reductions, other-than-insignificant payment delays and term extensions) to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The update also requires disclosure of current period gross charge-offs by year of origination for financing receivables measured at amortized cost. We adopted this update on a prospective basis and noted no impact on our financial condition or results of operation upon adoption. 
 
 We are currently evaluating the following accounting update, however, we do not expect a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations upon adoption: 
 
 Fair Value Measurement . This accounting update clarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. The update also requires additional disclosures including the fair value of equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions, the nature and remaining duration of the restriction and circumstances that could cause the restriction to lapse. The ASU is effective January 1, 2024 with early adoption permitted. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions (see Note 1 to the financial statements). We believe that of our significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the financial statements), the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. 
 Fair Value 
 Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value 
 A significant number of our financial instruments are carried at fair value. The use of fair value to measure financial instruments is fundamental to our risk management practices and is our most critical accounting estimate. We make estimates regarding the valuation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value in preparing the financial statements. These assets and liabilities include, but are not limited to: 

December 2022 Form 10-K 38 

Table of Contents 
 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis 

Trading assets and Trading liabilities; 
 Investment Securities AFS; 
 Certain Securities purchased under agreements to resell; 
 Loans held-for-sale (measured at the lower of amortized cost or fair value); 
 Certain Deposits, primarily certificates of deposit; 
 Certain Securities sold under agreements to repurchase; 
 Certain Other secured financings; and 
 Certain Borrowings. 
 Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability i.e. , the exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. 
 In determining fair value, we use various valuation approaches. A hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable prices and inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable prices and inputs by requiring that the relevant observable inputs be used when available. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels, wherein Level 1 represents quoted prices in active markets, Level 2 represents valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, and Level 3 consists of valuation techniques that incorporate significant unobservable inputs and, therefore, require the greatest use of judgment. The fair values for the substantial majority of our financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are based on observable prices and inputs and are classified in level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Level 3 financial assets represented 1.4 and 1.1 of our total assets, as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 
 In periods of market disruption, the observability of prices and inputs, as well as market liquidity may be reduced for many instruments, which could cause an instrument to be recategorized from Level 1 to Level 2 or from Level 2 to Level 3. In addition, a downturn in market conditions could lead to declines in the valuation of many instruments carried at fair value. Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the Firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. For further information on the definition of fair value, Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 and related valuation techniques, and quantitative information about and sensitivity of significant unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value measurements, see Notes 2 and 5 to the financial statements. 
 Where appropriate, valuation adjustments are made to account for various factors such as liquidity risk (bid-ask adjustments), credit quality, model uncertainty, concentration risk and funding in order to arrive at fair value. For a further discussion of valuation adjustments that we apply, see Note 2 to the financial statements. 

Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
 Goodwill 
 We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of July 1 and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. Evaluating goodwill for impairment requires management to make significant judgments, including, in part, the use of unobservable inputs that are subject to uncertainty. Goodwill impairment tests are performed at the reporting unit level, which is generally at the level of or one level below our business segments. Goodwill no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition once it has been assigned to a reporting unit. As such, all the activities of a reporting unit, whether acquired or organically developed, are available to support the value of the goodwill. 
 For both the annual and interim tests, we have the option to either (i) perform a quantitative impairment test or (ii) first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, in which case the quantitative test would be performed. 
 When performing a quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the goodwill impairment loss is equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value, limited by the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. 
 The carrying value of each reporting unit is determined based on the capital allocated to the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of the reporting units is derived based on valuation techniques we believe market participants would use for each of the reporting units. The estimated fair value is generally determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology. In certain instances, we may also utilize methodologies that incorporate price-to-book and price-to-earnings multiples of certain comparable companies. 
 The discounted cash flow methodology uses projected future cash flows based on the reporting units earnings forecast. The discount rate used represents an estimate of the cost of equity for that reporting unit based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model. 
 At each annual goodwill impairment testing date, each of our reporting units with goodwill had a fair value that was substantially in excess of its carrying value. 
 Intangible Assets 
 Intangible assets are initially recorded at cost, or in the situation where acquired as part of a business combination, at the fair value determined as part of the acquisition method of accounting. Subsequently, amortizable intangible assets are carried in the balance sheet at amortized cost, where amortization is recognized over their estimated useful lives.

Indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested for impairment on an annual basis as of July 1 and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. 
 On a quarterly basis: 
 All intangible assets are assessed for the presence of impairment indicators. Where such indicators are present, an evaluation for impairment is conducted. 
 For amortizable intangible assets, an impairment loss exists if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows. 
 For indefinite-lived intangible assets, an impairment exists if the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value. 
 Amortizable intangible assets are assessed for any indication that the remaining useful life or the finite life classification should be revised. In such cases, the remaining carrying amount is amortized prospectively over the revised useful life, unless it is determined that the life of the intangible asset is indefinite, in which case the intangible asset is not amortized. 
 Indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for any indication that the life of the intangible asset is no longer indefinite; in such cases, the carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over its remaining useful life. 
 The initial valuation of an intangible asset as part of the acquisition method of accounting and the subsequent valuation of intangible assets as part of an impairment assessment are subjective and based, in part, on inputs that are unobservable and can be subject to uncertainty. These inputs include, but are not limited to, forecasted cash flows, revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates and discount rates. 
 For both goodwill and intangible assets, to the extent an impairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted. For amortizable intangible assets, the new cost basis is amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset. Unanticipated declines in our revenue generating capability, adverse market or economic events, and regulatory actions, could result in material impairment charges in future periods. 
 See Notes 2, 3 and 11 to the financial statements for additional information about goodwill and intangible assets. 
 Legal and Regulatory Contingencies 
 In the normal course of business, we have been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with our activities as a global diversified financial services institution. 

Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In some cases, the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or are in financial distress. 
 We are also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding our business and involving, among other matters, investment banking advisory services, capital markets activities, sales, trading, financing, prime-brokerage, market-making activities, wealth and investment management services, financial products or offerings sponsored, underwritten or sold by us, and accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, limitations on our ability to conduct certain business, or other relief. 
 Accruals for litigation and regulatory proceedings are generally determined on a case-by-case basis. Where available information indicates that it is probable a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and we can reasonably estimate the amount of that loss, we accrue the estimated loss by a charge to income. 
 In many proceedings and investigations, however, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible or to estimate the amount of any loss. In addition, even where a loss is possible or an exposure to loss exists in excess of the liability already accrued with respect to a previously recognized loss contingency, it is not always possible to reasonably estimate the size of the possible loss or range of loss, particularly for proceedings and investigations where the factual record is being developed or contested or where plaintiffs or government entities seek substantial or indeterminate damages, restitution, disgorgement or penalties. Numerous issues may need to be resolved before a loss or additional loss or range of loss or additional range of loss can be reasonably estimated for a proceeding or investigation, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters, determination of issues related to class certification and the calculation of damages or other relief, and consideration of novel or unsettled legal questions relevant to the proceedings or investigations in question. 
 Significant judgment is required in deciding when and if to make these accruals, and the actual cost of a legal claim or regulatory fine/penalty may ultimately be materially different from the recorded accruals. 
 See Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information on legal contingencies. 
 Income Taxes 
 We are subject to the income and indirect tax laws of the U.S., its states and municipalities and those of the foreign

 Management s Discussion and Analysis 

jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. These tax laws are complex and subject to interpretation by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. We must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes and the expense for indirect taxes and must also make estimates about when certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions. 
 Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. We periodically evaluate the likelihood of assessments in each taxing jurisdiction resulting from current and subsequent years examinations, and unrecognized tax benefits related to potential losses that may arise from tax audits are established in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. Once established, unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted when there is more information available or when an event occurs requiring a change. 
 Our provision for income taxes is composed of current and deferred taxes. Current income taxes approximate taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the applicable enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse. 
 Our deferred tax balances may also include deferred assets related to tax attribute carryforwards, such as net operating losses and tax credits that will be realized through reduction of future tax liabilities and, in some cases, are subject to expiration if not utilized within certain periods. We perform regular reviews to ascertain whether deferred tax assets are realizable. These reviews include management s estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable income and incorporate various tax planning strategies, including strategies that may be available to tax attribute carryforwards before they expire. 
 Once the deferred tax asset balances have been determined, we may record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset balances to reflect the amount we estimate is more likely than not to be realized at a future date. Both current and deferred income taxes may reflect adjustments related to our unrecognized tax benefits. 
 Significant judgment is required in estimating the consolidated provision for (benefit from) income taxes, current and deferred tax balances (including valuation allowance, if any), accrued interest or penalties and uncertain tax positions. Revisions in estimates and/or the actual costs of a tax assessment may ultimately be materially different from the recorded accruals and unrecognized tax benefits, if any. 
 See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information on our significant assumptions, judgments and 

interpretations associated with the accounting for income taxes and Note 22 to the financial statements for additional information on our tax examinations. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our liquidity and capital policies are established and maintained by senior management, with oversight by the Asset/Liability Management Committee and the Board of Directors Board ). Through various risk and control committees, senior management reviews business performance relative to these policies, monitors the availability of alternative sources of financing, and oversees the liquidity, interest rate and currency sensitivity of our asset and liability position. Our Treasury department, Firm Risk Committee, Asset/Liability Management Committee, and other committees and control groups assist in evaluating, monitoring and managing the impact that our business activities have on our balance sheet, liquidity and capital structure. Liquidity and capital matters are reported regularly to the Board and the Risk Committee of the Board. 
 
 Balance Sheet 
 We monitor and evaluate the composition and size of our balance sheet on a regular basis. Our balance sheet management process includes quarterly planning, business-specific thresholds, monitoring of business-specific usage versus key performance metrics and new business impact assessments. 
 We establish balance sheet thresholds at the consolidated and business segment levels. We monitor balance sheet utilization and review variances resulting from business activity and market fluctuations. On a regular basis, we review current performance versus established thresholds and assess the need to re-allocate our balance sheet based on business segment needs. We also monitor key metrics, including asset and liability size and capital usage.

 Liquidity Risk Management Framework 
 The primary goal of our Liquidity Risk Management Framework is to ensure that we have access to adequate funding across a wide range of market conditions and time horizons. The framework is designed to enable us to fulfill our financial obligations and support the execution of our business strategies. 
 The following principles guide our Liquidity Risk Management Framework: 
 Sufficient Liquidity Resources should be maintained to cover maturing liabilities and other planned and contingent outflows; 
 Maturity profile of assets and liabilities should be aligned, with limited reliance on short-term funding; 
 Source, counterparty, currency, region and term of funding should be diversified; and 
 Liquidity Stress Tests should anticipate, and account for, periods of limited access to funding. 
 The core components of our Liquidity Risk Management Framework are the Required Liquidity Framework, Liquidity Stress Tests and Liquidity Resources, which support our target liquidity profile. 
 Required Liquidity Framework 
 Our Required Liquidity Framework establishes the amount of liquidity we must hold in both normal and stressed environments to ensure that our financial condition and overall soundness are not adversely affected by an inability 

(or perceived inability) to meet our financial obligations in a timely manner. The Required Liquidity Framework considers the most constraining liquidity requirement to satisfy all regulatory and internal limits at a consolidated and legal entity level. 
 Liquidity Stress Tests 
 We use Liquidity Stress Tests to model external and intercompany liquidity flows across multiple scenarios and a range of time horizons. These scenarios contain various combinations of idiosyncratic and systemic stress events of different severity and duration. The methodology, implementation, production and analysis of our Liquidity Stress Tests are important components of the Required Liquidity Framework. 
 The assumptions used in our various Liquidity Stress Test scenarios include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 No government support; 
 No access to equity and limited access to unsecured debt markets; 
 Repayment of all unsecured debt maturing within the stress horizon; 
 Higher haircuts for and significantly lower availability of secured funding; 
 Additional collateral that would be required by trading counterparties, certain exchanges and clearing organizations related to credit rating downgrades; 
 Additional collateral that would be required due to collateral substitutions, collateral disputes and uncalled collateral; 
 Discretionary unsecured debt buybacks; 
 Drawdowns on lending commitments provided to third parties; and 
 Client cash withdrawals and reduction in customer short positions that fund long positions. 
 Liquidity Stress Tests are produced and results are reported at different levels, including major operating subsidiaries and major currencies, to capture specific cash requirements and cash availability across the Firm, including a limited number of asset sales in a stressed environment. The Liquidity Stress Tests assume that subsidiaries will use their own liquidity first to fund their obligations before drawing liquidity from the Parent Company and that the Parent Company will support its subsidiaries and will not have access to subsidiaries liquidity reserves. In addition to the assumptions underpinning the Liquidity Stress Tests, we take into consideration settlement risk related to intraday settlement and clearing of securities and financing activities. 
 At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we maintained sufficient Liquidity Resources to meet current and contingent funding obligations as modeled in our Liquidity Stress Tests.

Liquidity Resources 
 We maintain sufficient liquidity resources, which consist of HQLA and cash deposits with banks Liquidity Resources to cover daily funding needs and to meet strategic liquidity targets sized by the Required Liquidity Framework and Liquidity Stress Tests. We actively manage the amount of our Liquidity Resources considering the following components: unsecured debt maturity profile; balance sheet size and composition; funding needs in a stressed environment, inclusive of contingent cash outflows; legal entity, regional and segment liquidity requirements; regulatory requirements; and collateral requirements. 
 The amount of Liquidity Resources we hold is based on our risk appetite and is calibrated to meet various internal and regulatory requirements and to fund prospective business activities. The Liquidity Resources are primarily held within the Parent Company and its major operating subsidiaries. The Total HQLA values in the tables immediately following are different from Eligible HQLA, which, in accordance with the LCR rule, also takes into account certain regulatory weightings and other operational considerations.

Liquidity Resources may fluctuate from period to period based on the overall size and composition of our balance sheet, the maturity profile of our unsecured debt and estimates of funding needs in a stressed environment, among other factors. 
 Regulatory Liquidity Framework 
 Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratio 
 We and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum LCR and NSFR of 100 . The LCR requires that large banking organizations have sufficient Eligible HQLA to cover net cash outflows arising from significant stress over 30 calendar days, thus promoting the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banking organizations. In determining Eligible HQLA for LCR purposes, weightings (or asset haircuts) are applied to HQLA, and certain HQLA held in subsidiaries is excluded. The NSFR requires large banking organizations to maintain sufficiently stable sources of funding over a one-year time horizon. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are compliant with the minimum LCR and NSFR requirements of 100 .

 1. Under the LCR rule, Eligible HQLA is calculated using weightings and excluding certain HQLA held in subsidiaries. 
 2. Primarily includes U.S. Treasuries, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, sovereign bonds and investment grade corporate bonds. 
 Funding Management 
 We manage our funding in a manner that reduces the risk of disruption to our operations. We pursue a strategy of diversification of secured and unsecured funding sources (by product, investor and region) and attempt to ensure that the tenor of our liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed. Our goal is to achieve an optimal mix of durable secured and unsecured financing. 
 We fund our balance sheet on a global basis through diverse sources. These sources include our equity capital, borrowings, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities lending, deposits, letters of credit and lines of credit. We have active financing programs for both standard and structured products targeting global investors and currencies. 
 Secured Financing 
 The liquid nature of the marketable securities and short-term receivables arising principally from sales and trading

 Management s Discussion and Analysis 

activities in the Institutional Securities business segment provides us with flexibility in managing the composition of our balance sheet. Secured financing investors principally focus on the quality of the eligible collateral posted. Accordingly, we actively manage our secured financings based on the quality of the assets being funded. 
 We have established longer tenor secured funding requirements for less liquid asset classes, for which funding may be at risk in the event of a market disruption. We define highly liquid assets as government-issued or government-guaranteed securities with a high degree of fundability and less liquid assets as those that do not meet these criteria. 
 To further minimize the refinancing risk of secured financing for less liquid assets, we have established concentration limits to diversify our investor base and reduce the amount of monthly maturities for secured financing of less liquid assets. As a component of the Liquidity Risk Management Framework, we hold a portion of our Liquidity Resources against the potential disruption to our secured financing capabilities. 
 We generally maintain a pool of liquid and easily fundable securities, which takes into account HQLA classifications consistent with LCR definitions, and other regulatory requirements, and provides a valuable future source of liquidity.

 See Total Assets by Business Segment herein for additional information on the assets shown in the previous table and Notes 2 and 9 to the financial statements for additional information on collateralized financing transactions. 
 In addition to the collateralized financing transactions shown in the previous table, we engage in financing transactions collateralized by customer-owned securities, which are segregated in accordance with regulatory requirements. Receivables under these financing transactions, primarily margin loans, are included in Customer and other receivables in the balance sheet, and payables under these financing transactions, primarily to prime brokerage customers, are included in Customer and other payables in the balance sheet. 

Our risk exposure on these transactions is mitigated by collateral maintenance policies and the elements of our Liquidity Risk Management Framework. 
 Unsecured Financing 
 We view deposits and borrowings as stable sources of funding for unencumbered securities and non-security assets. Our unsecured financings include borrowings and certificates of deposit carried at fair value, which are primarily composed of: instruments whose payments and redemption values are linked to the performance of a specific index, a basket of stocks, a specific equity security, a commodity, a credit exposure or basket of credit exposures; and instruments with various interest rate-related features, including step-ups, step-downs and zero coupons. Also included are unsecured contracts which are not classified as OTC derivatives because they fail net investment criteria. As part of our asset/liability management strategy, when appropriate, we use derivatives to make adjustments to the interest rate risk profile of our borrowings (see Notes 7 and 14 to the financial statements).

This client cash held by third parties is not reflected in our balance sheet and is not immediately available for liquidity purposes. 
 Deposits are primarily sourced from our Wealth Management clients and are considered to have stable, low-cost funding characteristics. The increase in total deposits in 2022 was primarily driven by higher Savings and other and Time deposits, partially offset by a reduction in Brokerage sweep deposits.

 Management s Discussion and Analysis 

Borrowings of 238 billion as of December 31, 2022 were relatively unchanged when compared with 233 billion at December 31, 2021. 
 We believe that accessing debt investors through multiple distribution channels helps provide consistent access to the unsecured markets. In addition, the issuance of borrowings with original maturities greater than one year allows us to reduce reliance on short-term credit sensitive instruments. Borrowings with original maturities greater than one year are generally managed to achieve staggered maturities, thereby mitigating refinancing risk, and to maximize investor diversification through sales to global institutional and retail clients across regions, currencies and product types. 
 The availability and cost of financing to us can vary depending on market conditions, the volume of certain trading and lending activities, our credit ratings and the overall availability of credit. We also engage in, and may continue to engage in, repurcha ses of our borrowings as part of our market-making activities. 
 For further information on Borrowings, see Note 14 to the financial statements. 
 Credit Ratings 
 We rely on external sources to finance a significant portion of our daily operations. Our credit ratings are one of the factors in the cost and availability of financing and can have an impact on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where longer-term counterparty performance is a key consideration, such as certain OTC derivative transactions. When determining credit ratings, rating agencies consider both company-specific and industry-wide factors. See also Risk Factors Liquidity Risk.

 On December 16, 2022, Rating and Investment Information, Inc. revised the Parent Company outlook from stable to positive. 
 Incremental Collateral or Terminating Payments 
 In connection with certain OTC derivatives and certain other agreements where we are a liquidity provider to certain financing vehicles associated with the Institutional Securities business segment, we may be required to provide additional collateral, immediately settle any outstanding liability balances with certain counterparties or pledge additional collateral to certain clearing organizations in the event of a future credit rating downgrade irrespective of whether we are in a net asset or net liability position. See Note 7 to the financial statements for additional information on OTC derivatives that contain such contingent features. 
 While certain aspects of a credit rating downgrade are quantifiable pursuant to contractual provisions, the impact it would have on our business and results of operations in future periods is inherently uncertain and would depend on a number of interrelated factors, including, among other things, the magnitude of the downgrade, the rating relative to peers, the rating assigned by the relevant agency before the downgrade, individual client behavior and future mitigating actions we might take. The liquidity impact of additional collateral requirements is included in our Liquidity Stress Tests. 
 Capital Management 
 We view capital as an important source of financial strength and actively manage our consolidated capital position based upon, among other things, business opportunities, risks, capital availability and rates of return together with internal capital policies, regulatory requirements and rating agency guidelines. In the future, we may expand or contract our capital base to address the changing needs of our businesses.

 Regulatory Requirements 
 Regulatory Capital Framework 
 We are an FHC under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended BHC Act and are subject to the regulation and oversight of the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements for us, including well-capitalized standards, and evaluates our compliance with such capital requirements. The OCC establishes similar capital requirements and standards for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. The regulatory capital requirements are largely based on the Basel III capital standards established by the Basel Committee and also implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. For us to remain an FHC, we must remain well-capitalized in accordance with standards established by the Federal Reserve, and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries must remain well-capitalized in accordance with standards established by the OCC. In addition, many of our regulated 

subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements, including regulated subsidiaries provisionally registered as swap dealers with the CFTC or conditionally registered as security-based swap dealers with the SEC or registered as broker-dealers or futures commission merchants. For additional information on regulatory capital requirements for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, as well as our subsidiaries that are Swap Entities, see Note 17 to the financial statements. 
 Regulatory Capital Requirements 
 We are required to maintain minimum risk-based and leverage-based capital and TLAC ratios. For additional information on TLAC, see Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements herein. 
 Risk-Based Regulatory Capital . Risk-based capital ratio requirements apply to Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital (which includes Tier 2 capital), each as a percentage of RWA, and consist of regulatory minimum required ratios plus our capital buffer requirement. Capital requirements require certain adjustments to, and deductions from, capital for purposes of determining these ratios.

 2. For a further discussion of the G-SIB capital surcharge, see G-SIB Capital Surcharge herein. 
 3. The CCyB can be set up to 2.5 but is currently set by the Federal Reserve at zero. 
 The capital buffer requirement represents the amount of Common Equity Tier 1 capital we must maintain above the minimum risk-based capital requirements in order to avoid restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. Our capital buffer requirement computed under the standardized approaches for calculating credit risk and market RWAs Standardized Approach is equal to the sum of our SCB, G-SIB capital surcharge and CCyB, and our capital buffer requirement computed under the applicable advanced approaches for calculating credit risk, market risk and operational risk RWAs Advanced Approach is equal to our 2.5 capital conservation buffer, G-SIB capital surcharge and CCyB.

 1. Required ratios represent the regulatory minimum plus the capital buffer requirement. 
 Risk-Weighted Assets. RWA reflects both our on- and off-balance sheet risk, as well as capital charges attributable to the risk of loss arising from the following: 
 Credit risk: The failure of a borrower, counterparty or issuer to meet its financial obligations to us; 
 Market risk: Adverse changes in the level of one or more market prices, rates, spreads, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity; and 
 Operational risk: Inadequate or failed processes or systems, from human factors or from external events e.g. , fraud, theft, legal and compliance risks, cyber attacks or damage to physical assets). 
 Our risk-based capital ratios are computed under each of (i) the Standardized Approach and (ii) the Advanced Approach. The credit risk RWA calculations between the two approaches differ in that the Standardized Approach requires calculation of RWA using prescribed risk weights and exposure methodologies, whereas the Advanced Approach utilizes models to calculate exposure amounts and risk weights. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the differences between the actual and required ratios were lower under the Standardized Approach. 
 Leverage-Based Regulatory Capital. Leverage-based capital requirements include a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4 , a minimum SLR of 3 and an enhanced SLR capital buffer of at least 2 . 
 CECL Deferral. As of December 31, 2021, our risk-based and leverage-based capital amounts and ratios, as well as RWA, adjusted average assets and supplementary leverage exposure were calculated excluding the effect of the adoption of CECL based on the Firm s election to defer this effect over a five-year transition period that began on January 1, 2020. In 2022 t he deferral impacts began to phase in at 25 per year and will become fully phased-in beginning in 2025.

 Regulatory VaR VaR for regulatory capital requirements 
 
 In 2022, Credit risk RWA decreased under the Standardized Approach but was relatively unchanged under the Advanced Approach. Under the Standardized Approach, the decrease was primarily driven by lower equity, commodities, and credit Derivatives as well as lower Securities financing transactions from margin lending, partially offset by lending growth. Under the Advanced Approach, lending growth, higher foreign exchange Derivatives exposures and higher other assets exposures were offset by lower Investment securities and Equity Investments. 
 
 Market risk RWA decreased in 2022 under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches primarily driven by lower Incremental Risk Charge driven by exposure reduction in the Fixed Income business and lower Specific risk securitization and non-securitization standardized charges, partially offset by higher Regulatory VaR. 
 
 The increase in Operational risk RWA in 2022 reflects higher legal expenses and execution-related losses. 
 G-SIB Capital Surcharge 
 We and other U.S. G-SIBs are subject to an additional risk-based capital surcharge, the G-SIB capital surcharge, which must be satisfied using Common Equity Tier 1 capital and which functions as an extension of the capital conservation buffer. The surcharge is calculated based on the G-SIB s size, interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, and

complexity and substitutability Method 1 or use of short-term wholesale funding Method 2 ), whichever is higher. 
 Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements 
 The Federal Reserve has established external TLAC, long-term debt LTD and clean holding company requirements for top-tier BHCs of U.S. G-SIBs covered BHCs ), including the Parent Company. These requirements are designed to ensure that covered BHCs will have enough loss-absorbing resources at the point of failure to be recapitalized through the conversion of eligible LTD to equity or otherwise by imposing losses on eligible LTD or other forms of TLAC where an SPOE resolution strategy is used (see Business Supervision and Regulation Financial Holding Company Resolution and Recovery Planning and Risk Factors Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk ). 
 These TLAC and eligible LTD requirements include various restrictions, such as requiring eligible LTD to: be issued by the covered BHC; be unsecured; have a maturity of one year or more from the date of issuance; and not contain certain embedded features, such as a principal or redemption amount subject to reduction based on the performance of an asset, entity or index, or a similar feature. In addition, the requirements provide permanent grandfathering for debt instruments issued prior to December 31, 2016 that would be eligible LTD but for having impermissible acceleration clauses or being governed by foreign law. 
 A covered BHC is also required to maintain minimum external TLAC equal to the greater of (i) 18 of total RWA or (ii) 7.5 of its total leverage exposure (the denominator of its SLR). Covered BHCs must also meet a minimum external LTD requirement equal to the greater of (i) total RWA multiplied by the sum of 6 plus the higher of the Method 1 or Method 2 G-SIB capital surcharge applicable to the Parent Company or (ii) 4.5 of its total leverage exposure. 
 The final rule imposes TLAC buffer requirements on top of both the risk-based and leverage exposure-based external TLAC minimum requirements. The risk-based TLAC buffer is equal to the sum of 2.5 , our Method 1 G-SIB surcharge and the CCyB, if any, as a percentage of total RWA. The leverage exposure-based TLAC buffer is equal to 2 of our total leverage exposure. Failure to maintain the buffers would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers.

 1. Required ratios are inclusive of applicable buffers. 
 2. External TLAC consists of Common Equity Tier 1 capital and Additional Tier 1 capital (each excluding any noncontrolling minority interests), as well as eligible LTD. 
 3. Consists of TLAC-eligible LTD reduced by 50 for amounts of unpaid principal due to be paid in more than one year but less than two years from each respective balance sheet date. 
 Furthermore, under the clean holding company requirements, a covered BHC is prohibited from incurring any external debt with an original maturity of less than one year or certain other liabilities, regardless of whether the liabilities are fully secured or otherwise senior to eligible LTD, or entering into certain other prohibited transactions. Certain other external liabilities, including those with certain embedded features noted above, are subject to a cap equal to 5 of the covered BHC s outstanding external TLAC amount. Additionally, as of April 1, 2021, we and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are required to make certain deductions from regulatory capital for investments in certain unsecured debt instruments (including eligible LTD in the TLAC framework) issued by the Parent Company or other G-SIBs. 
 We are in compliance with all TLAC requirements as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 
 Capital Plans, Stress Tests and the Stress Capital Buffer 
 The Federal Reserve has capital planning and stress test requirements for large BHCs, which form part of the Federal Reserve s annual CCAR framework. 
 We must submit, on at least an annual basis, a capital plan to the Federal Reserve, taking into account the results of separate annual stress tests designed by us and the Federal Reserve, so that the Federal Reserve may assess our systems and processes that incorporate forward-looking projections of revenues and losses to monitor and maintain our internal capital adequacy. As banks with less than 250 billion of total assets, our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are not subject to company-run stress test regulatory requirements. 
 The capital plan must include a description of all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon, including any issuance or redemption of a debt or equity capital instrument, any capital distribution i.e. , payments of dividends or stock repurchases) and any similar action that the Federal Reserve determines could impact our consolidated

 Management s Discussion and Analysis 

capital. The capital plan must include a discussion of how we will maintain capital above the minimum regulatory capital ratios and how we will serve as a source of strength to our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries under supervisory stress scenarios. In addition, the Federal Reserve has issued guidance setting out its heightened expectations for capital planning practices at certain large financial institutions, including us. 
 As part of its annual capital supervisory stress testing process, the Federal Reserve determines an SCB for each large BHC, including us. The SCB applies only with respect to Standardized Approach risk-based capital requirements and replaced the Common Equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5 . The SCB is the greater of (i) the maximum decline in our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the severely adverse scenario over the supervisory stress test measurement period plus the sum of the four quarters of planned common stock dividends divided by the projected RWAs from the quarter in which the Firm s projected Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio reaches its minimum in the supervisory stress test and (ii) 2.5 . 
 The supervisory stress test assumes that BHCs generally maintain a constant level of assets and RWAs throughout the projection period. 
 A firm s SCB is subject to revision each year, taking effect from October 1 to reflect the results of the Federal Reserve s annual supervisory stress test. The Federal Reserve has discretion to recalculate a firm s SCB outside of the October 1 annual cycle and to require approval for certain actions, in some circumstances. The Federal Reserve also has the authority to impose restrictions on capital actions as a supervisory matter. 
 For the 2022 capital planning and stress test cycle, we submitted our capital plan and company-run stress test results to the Federal Reserve on April 5, 2022. On June 23, 2022, the Federal Reserve published summary results of its supervisory stress tests of each large BHC, in which the projected decline in our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio in the severely adverse scenario improved from the prior annual supervisory stress test, from 4.7 to 4.6 . Following the publication of the supervisory stress test results, and as a result of the increase in our common stock dividend and the resulting dividend add-on, we announced that our SCB will be 5.8 from October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023. Together with other features of the regulatory capital framework, this SCB results in an aggregate Standardized Approach Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 13.3 . 
 We also disclosed a summary of the results of our company-run stress tests on our Investor Relations website and increased our quarterly common stock dividend to 0.775 per share from 0.70, beginning with the common stock dividend announced on July 14, 2022. Additionally, our Board of Directors approved a new multi-year repurchase authorization of up to 20 billion of outstanding common stock, without a set expiration date, beginning in the third quarter of 2022, 

which will be exercised from time to time as conditions warrant. 
 Attribution of Average Common Equity According to the Required Capital Framework 
 Our required capital Required Capital estimation is based on the Required Capital framework, an internal capital adequacy measure. Common equity attribution to the business segments is based on capital usage calculated under the Required Capital framework, as well as each business segment s relative contribution to our total Required Capital. 
 The Required Capital framework is a risk-based and leverage-based capital measure, which is compared with our regulatory capital to ensure that we maintain an amount of going concern capital after absorbing potential losses from stress events, where applicable, at a point in time. The amount of capital allocated to the business segments is generally set at the beginning of each year and remains fixed throughout the year until the next annual reset unless a significant business change occurs e.g. , acquisition or disposition). We define the difference between our total average common equity and the sum of the average common equity amounts allocated to our business segments as Parent common equity. We generally hold Parent common equity for prospective regulatory requirements, organic growth, potential future acquisitions and other capital needs.

 3. The total average common equity and the allocation to the Investment Management business segment in 2021 reflect the Eaton Vance acquisition on March 1, 2021. 
 We continue to evaluate our Required Capital framework with respect to the impact of evolving regulatory requirements, as appropriate. 
 Resolution and Recovery Planning 
 We are required to submit once every two years to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a resolution plan that describes our strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of our material financial distress or failure. We submitted our 2021 targeted resolution plan on June 30, 2021. In November 2022, we received joint feedback on our 2021 resolution plan from the Federal Reserve and the FDIC Agencies ). The feedback indicated that there are no shortcomings or deficiencies in our 2021 resolution plan and that we had successfully addressed a prior

shortcoming identified by the Agencies in the review of our 2019 resolution plan. For more information about resolution planning requirements, see Business Supervision and Regulation Financial Holding Company Resolution and Recovery Planning. 
 As described in our most recent resolution plan, our preferred resolution strategy is an SPOE strategy. In line with our SPOE strategy, the Parent Company has transferred, and has agreed to transfer on an ongoing basis, certain assets to its wholly owned, direct subsidiary Morgan Stanley Holdings LLC (the Funding IHC ). In addition, the Parent Company has entered into an amended and restated support agreement with its material entities (including the Funding IHC) and certain other subsidiaries. In the event of a resolution scenario, the Parent Company would be obligated to contribute all of its contributable assets to our supported entities and/or the Funding IHC. The Funding IHC would be obligated to provide capital and liquidity, as applicable, to our supported entities. The combined implication of the SPOE resolution strategy and the requirement to maintain certain levels of TLAC is that losses in resolution would be imposed on the holders of eligible long-term debt and other forms of eligible TLAC issued by the Parent Company before any losses are imposed on creditors of our supported entities and without requiring taxpayer or government financial support. 
 The obligations of the Parent Company and the Funding IHC under the amended and restated support agreement are in most cases secured on a senior basis by the assets of the Parent Company (other than shares in subsidiaries of the Parent Company and certain other assets) and the assets of the Funding IHC. As a result, claims of our supported entities, including the Funding IHC, with respect to the secured assets, are effectively senior to unsecured obligations of the Parent Company. 
 For more information about resolution and recovery planning requirements and our activities in these areas, including the implications of such activities in a resolution scenario, see Business Supervision and Regulation Financial Holding Company Resolution and Recovery Planning and Risk Factors Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk. 
 Regulatory Developments and Other Matters 
 Covered Fund Restrictions under the Volcker Rule 
 The Volcker Rule prohibits certain investments and relationships by banking entities with covered funds, as defined in the Volcker Rule. During the current quarter, we have continued our assessment of conformance options permitted under the Volcker Rule with respect to certain legacy illiquid funds for which we previously received a conformance extension until July 21, 2023. These conformance options include, but are not limited to, restructuring our investments, selling a portion or all of our interests in certain legacy illiquid funds and relying on other applicable exemptions and exclusions under the Volcker Rule. 

As of December 31, 2022, the carrying value of our investments in those legacy illiquid funds approximated 230 million. 
 Replacement of London Interbank Offered Rate and Replacement or Reform of Other Interest Rate Benchmarks 
 Central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve, have sponsored initiatives in recent years to replace LIBOR and replace or reform certain other interest rate benchmarks (collectively, the IBORs ). A transition away from use of the IBORs to alternative rates and other potential interest rate benchmark reforms is underway and is a multi-year initiative. 
 The publication of most non-U.S. dollar LIBOR rates ceased as of the end of December 2021, although certain Sterling and Yen LIBOR rates have been published for a limited period following this date on the basis of a synthetic methodology (known as synthetic LIBOR ). The synthetic Yen LIBOR rates ceased as of the end of December 2022 and the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority UK FCA ), which regulates the publisher of LIBOR (ICE Benchmark Administration), has announced that publication of the one- and six-month tenors of synthetic Sterling LIBOR will cease at the end of March 2023 and the three-month synthetic Sterling LIBOR at the end of March 2024. 
 U.S. dollar LIBOR rates are expected to cease being published as of the end of June 2023. On March 15, 2022 the U.S. enacted federal legislation that is intended to minimize legal and economic uncertainty following U.S. dollar LIBOR s cessation by replacing LIBOR references in certain U.S. law-governed contracts under certain circumstances with a SOFR-based rate identified in a Federal Reserve rule plus a statutory spread adjustment. While some states have already adopted LIBOR legislation, the federal legislation expressly preempts any provision of any state or local law, statute, rule, regulation or standard. In addition, the UK FCA is considering the continued publication of the one-, three- and six-month tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR on a synthetic basis until the end of September 2024. This may result in certain non-U.S. law-governed contracts and U.S. law-governed contracts not covered by the federal legislation to remain on synthetic U.S. dollar LIBOR until the end of this period. 
 As of December 31, 2022, our LIBOR-referenced contracts were primarily concentrated in derivative contracts and, to a lesser extent, loans, floating rate notes, preferred shares, securitizations and mortgages. A significant majority of our derivative contracts, and a majority of our non-derivative contracts, contain fallback provisions or otherwise have an expected path that will allow for the transition to an alternative reference rate upon the cessation of the applicable LIBOR rate. 
 While we have made substantial progress in the transition away from the IBORs, we nonetheless currently remain party to a significant number of U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked

contracts. For the limited number of U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked contracts without a current market standard fallback, or to which the federal legislation does not apply, we are actively developing appropriate transition plans in light of the planned June 30, 2023 cessation date for the remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors. 
 Our IBOR transition plan is overseen by a global steering committee, with senior management oversight, and we continue to execute against our Firm-wide IBOR transition plan to complete the transition to alternative reference rates. 
 See also Risk Factors Risk Management for a further discussion of risks related to the planned replacement of the IBORs and/or reform of interest rate benchmarks.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk 
 
 Risk Management 
 Overview 
 Risk is an inherent part of our businesses and activities. We believe effective risk management is vital to the success of our business activities. Accordingly, we have an Enterprise Risk Management ERM framework to integrate the diverse roles of risk management into a holistic enterprise structure and to facilitate the incorporation of risk assessment into decision-making processes across the Firm. 
 We have policies and procedures in place to identify, measure, monitor, escalate, mitigate and control the principal risks involved in the activities of the Institutional Securities, Wealth Management and Investment Management business segments, as well as at the Parent Company level. The principal risks involved in our business activities are both financial and non-financial and include market (including non-trading risks), credit, liquidity, model, operational, compliance, cybersecurity, strategic, reputational and conduct risk. Strategic risk is integrated into our business planning, embedded in the evaluation of all principal risks and overseen by the Board. 
 The cornerstone of our risk management philosophy is the pursuit of risk-adjusted returns through prudent risk taking that protects our capital base and franchise. This philosophy is implemented through the ERM framework. Five key principles underlie this philosophy: integrity, comprehensiveness, independence, accountability and transparency. To help ensure the efficacy of risk management, which is an essential component of our reputation, senior 

management requires thorough and frequent reporting and the appropriate escalation of risk matters. The fast-paced, complex and constantly evolving nature of global financial markets requires us to maintain a risk management culture that is incisive, knowledgeable about specialized products and markets, and subject to ongoing review and enhancement. 
 Our risk appetite defines the aggregate level and types of risk that the Firm is willing to accept to achieve its business objectives, taking into account the interests of clients and fiduciary duties to shareholders, as well as capital and other regulatory requirements. This risk appetite is embedded in our risk culture and linked to our short-term and long-term strategic, capital and financial plans, as well as compensation programs. This risk appetite and the related Board-level risk limits and risk tolerance statements are reviewed and approved by the Risk Committee of the Board BRC and the Board on at least an annual basis. 
 Risk Governance Structure 
 Risk management at the Firm requires independent Firm-level oversight, accountability of our business divisions, and effective communication of risk matters across the Firm, to senior management and ultimately to the Board. Our risk governance structure is set forth in the following chart and also includes risk managers, committees, and groups within and across business segments and operating legal entities. The ERM framework, composed of independent but complementary entities, facilitates efficient and comprehensive supervision of our risk exposures and processes. 

RRP Resolution and Recovery Planning 
 1. Committees include the Capital Commitment Committee, Global Large Loan Committee, Equity Underwriting Committee, Leveraged Finance Underwriting Committee and Municipal Capital Commitment Committee. 
 2. Committees include the Securities Risk Committee, Wealth Management Risk Committee and Investment Management Risk Committee.

 The BRC assists the Board in its oversight of the ERM framework; oversees major risk exposures of the Firm, including market, credit, model and liquidity risk, against established risk measurement methodologies and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures; oversees our risk appetite statement, including risk limits and tolerances; reviews capital, liquidity and funding strategy and related guidelines and policies; reviews the contingency funding plan and capital planning process; oversees our significant risk management and risk assessment guidelines and policies; oversees the performance of the Chief Risk Officer; reviews reports from our Strategic Transactions Committee, CCAR Committee and RRP Committee; reviews new product risk, emerging risks, climate risk and regulatory matters; and reviews the Internal Audit Department reports on the assessment of the risk management, liquidity and capital functions. The BRC reports to the Board on a regular basis and coordinates with the Board and other Board committees with respect to oversight of risk management and risk assessment guidelines. 
 Audit Committee of the Board 
 The Audit Committee of the Board BAC oversees the integrity of our financial statements, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and system of internal controls; oversees risk management and risk assessment guidelines in coordination with the Board and other Board committees; reviews the major legal, compliance and conduct risk exposures of the Firm and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures; selects, determines the fees, evaluates and, when appropriate, replaces the independent auditor; oversees the qualifications, independence and performance of our independent auditor and pre-approves audit and permitted non-audit services; oversees the performance of our Chief Audit Officer; and, after review, recommends to the Board the acceptance and inclusion of the annual audited financial statements in the Firm s annual report on Form 10-K. The BAC reports to the Board on a regular basis. 

Operations and Technology Committee of the Board 
 The Operations and Technology Committee of the Board BOTC oversees our operations and technology strategy and significant investments in support of such strategy; oversees operations, technology and operational risk, including information security, fraud, vendor, data protection, privacy, business continuity and resilience, cybersecurity risks and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures; and reviews risk management and risk assessment guidelines in coordination with the Board and other Board committees, and policies regarding operations, technology and operational risk. The BOTC reports to the Board on a regular basis. 
 Firm Risk Committee 
 The Board has also authorized the Firm Risk Committee FRC ), a management committee appointed and co-chaired by the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Risk Officer, which includes the most senior officers of the Firm from the business, independent risk functions and control groups, to help oversee the ERM framework. The FRC s responsibilities include: oversight of our risk management principles, procedures and limits; the monitoring of capital levels and material market, credit, model, operational, liquidity, legal, compliance and reputational risk matters, and other risks, as appropriate; and the steps management has taken to monitor and manage such risks. The FRC also establishes and communicates risk tolerance, including aggregate Firm limits and tolerances, as appropriate. The Governance Process Review Subcommittee of the FRC oversees governance and process issues on behalf of the FRC. The FRC reports to the Board, the BAC, the BOTC and the BRC through the Chief Risk Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Legal Officer, and Head of Non-Financial Risk. 
 Functional Risk and Control Committees 
 Functional risk and control committees and other committees within the ERM framework facilitate efficient and comprehensive supervision of our risk exposures and processes. 
 Each business segment has a risk committee that is responsible for helping to ensure that the business segment, as applicable, adheres to established limits for market, credit, operational and other risks; implements risk measurement, monitoring, and management policies, procedures, controls and systems that are consistent with the risk framework established by the FRC; and reviews, on a periodic basis, our aggregate risk exposures, risk exception experience, and the efficacy of our risk identification, measurement, monitoring and management policies and procedures, and related controls.

Chief Risk Officer 
 The Chief Risk Officer, who is independent of business units, reports to the BRC and the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Risk Officer oversees compliance with our risk limits; approves exceptions to our risk limits; independently reviews material market, credit, model and liquidity risks; and reviews results of risk management processes with the Board, the BRC, the BOTC and the BAC, as appropriate. The Chief Risk Officer also coordinates with the Chief Financial Officer regarding capital and liquidity management and works with the Compensation, Management Development and Succession Committee of the Board to help ensure that the structure and design of incentive compensation arrangements do not encourage unnecessary and excessive risk taking. 
 Independent Risk Management Functions 
 The Financial Risk Management functions (Market Risk, Credit Risk, Model Risk and Liquidity Risk Management departments) and Non-Financial Risk Management functions (Compliance, Global Financial Crimes, and Operational Risk departments) are independent of our business units and report to the Chief Risk Officer and Head of Non-Financial Risk, respectively. These functions assist senior management and the FRC in monitoring and controlling our risk through a number of control processes. Each function maintains its own risk governance structure with specified individuals and committees responsible for aspects of managing risk. Further discussion about the responsibilities of the risk management functions may be found under Market Risk, Credit Risk, Operational Risk, Model Risk and Liquidity Risk and Legal and Compliance Risk herein. 
 Support and Control Groups 
 Our support and control groups include, but are not limited to, Legal, the Finance Division, Technology Division, Operations Division, the Human Resources Department, Corporate Services, and Firm Strategy and Execution. Our support and control groups coordinate with the business segment control groups to review the risk monitoring and risk management policies and procedures relating to, among other things, controls over financial reporting and disclosure; each business segment s market, credit and operational risk profile; liquidity risks; model risks; sales practices; reputational, legal enforceability, compliance, conduct and regulatory risk; and technological risks. Participation by the senior officers of the Firm and business segment control groups helps ensure that risk policies and procedures, exceptions to risk limits, new products and business ventures, and transactions with risk elements undergo thorough review. 
 Internal Audit Department 
 The Internal Audit Department IAD independently assesses the Firm s risk management processes and controls using methodology developed from professional auditing standards and regulatory guidance. IAD undertakes these 

responsibilities through periodic reviews of our business activities, operations and systems, as well as special investigations and retrospective reviews that may be specifically requested by the BAC or management. In addition to regular reports to the BAC, the Chief Audit Officer, who reports functionally to the BAC and administratively to the Chief Executive Officer, periodically reports to the BRC and BOTC on various matters of risks and controls. 
 Culture, Values and Conduct of Employees 
 Employees of the Firm are accountable for conducting themselves in accordance with our core values: Put Clients First, Do the Right Thing, Lead with Exceptional Ideas, Commit to Diversity and Inclusion, and Give Back . We are committed to reinforcing and confirming adherence to our core values through our governance framework, tone from the top, management oversight, risk management and controls, and three lines of defense structure (business, control functions such as Risk Management and Compliance, and Internal Audit). 
 The Board is responsible for overseeing the Firm s practices and procedures relating to culture, values and conduct, as set forth in the Firm s Corporate Governance Policies. Our Culture, Values and Conduct Committee, along with the Compliance and Conduct Risk Committee, are the senior management committees that oversee the Firmwide culture, values and conduct program and report regularly to the Board. A fundamental building block of this program is the Firm s Code of Conduct, which establishes standards for employee conduct that further reinforce the Firm s commitment to integrity and ethical conduct. Every new hire and every employee annually is required to certify to their understanding of and adherence to the Code of Conduct. The Firm s Global Conduct Risk Management Policy also sets out a consistent global framework for managing Conduct Risk i.e. , the risk arising from misconduct by employees or contingent workers) and Conduct Risk incidents at the Firm. 
 The employee annual performance review process includes evaluation of employee conduct related to risk management practices and the Firm s expectations. We also have several mutually reinforcing processes to identify employee conduct that may have an impact on employment status, current year compensation and/or prior year compensation. For example, the Global Incentive Compensation Discretion Policy sets forth standards for managers when making annual compensation decisions and specifically provides that managers must consider whether their employees effectively managed and/or supervised risk control practices during the performance year. Management committees from control functions periodically meet to discuss employees whose conduct is not in line with our expectations. These results are incorporated into identified employees performance reviews and compensation and promotion decisions.

 Risk Disclosures 

The Firm s clawback and cancellation provisions apply to deferred incentive compensation and cover a broad scope of employee conduct, including any act or omission (including with respect to direct supervisory responsibilities) that constitutes a breach of obligation to the Firm or causes a restatement of the Firm s financial results, constitutes a violation of the Firm s global risk management principles, policies and standards, or causes a loss of revenue associated with a position on which the employee was paid and the employee operated outside of risk management policies. 
 Risk Limits Framework 
 Risk limits and quantitative metrics provide the basis for monitoring risk-taking activity and avoiding outsized risk taking. Our risk-taking capacity is sized through the Firm s capital planning process where losses are estimated under the Firm s BHC Severely Adverse stress testing scenario. We also maintain a comprehensive suite of risk limits and quantitative metrics to support and implement our risk appetite statement. Our risk limits support linkages between the overall risk appetite, which is reviewed by the Board, and more granular risk-taking decisions and activities. 
 Risk limits, once established, are reviewed and updated on at least an annual basis, with more frequent updates as necessary. Board-level risk limits address the most important Firmwide aggregations of risk. Additional risk limits approved by the FRC address more specific types of risk and are bound by the higher-level Board risk limits. 
 Risk Management Process 
 In subsequent sections, we discuss our risk management policies and procedures for our primary risks involved in the activities of our Institutional Securities, Wealth Management and Investment Management business segments. These sections and the estimated amounts of our risk exposure generated by our statistical analyses are forward-looking statements. However, the analyses used to assess such risks are not predictions of future events, and actual results may vary significantly from such analyses due to events in the markets in which we operate and certain other factors described in the following paragraphs. 
 
 Market Risk 
 Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, spreads, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity, will result in losses for a position or portfolio. Generally, we incur market risk as a result of trading, investing and client facilitation activities, principally within the Institutional Securities business segment where the substantial majority of our VaR for market risk exposures is generated. In addition, we incur non-trading market risk, principally within the Wealth Management and Investment Management business segments. The Wealth Management business segment primarily incurs non-trading market risk (including interest 

rate risk) from lending and deposit-taking activities. The Investment Management business segment primarily incurs non-trading market risk from capital investments in its funds. 
 Market risk also includes non-trading interest rate risk. Non-trading interest rate risk in the banking book (amounts classified for regulatory capital purposes under the banking book regime) refers to the exposure that a change in interest rates will result in prospective earnings changes for assets and liabilities in the banking book. 
 Sound market risk management is an integral part of our culture. The various business units and trading desks are responsible for ensuring that market risk exposures are well-managed and prudent. The control groups help ensure that these risks are measured and closely monitored and are made transparent to senior management. The Market Risk Department is responsible for ensuring the transparency of material market risks, monitoring compliance with established limits and escalating risk concentrations to appropriate senior management. 
 To execute these responsibilities, the Market Risk Department monitors our risk against limits on aggregate risk exposures, performs a variety of risk analyses, routinely reports risk summaries, and maintains our VaR and scenario analysis systems. Market risk is also monitored through various measures: by use of statistics (including VaR and related analytical measures); by measures of position size and sensitivity; and through routine stress testing, which measures the impact on the value of existing portfolios of specified changes in market factors and scenarios designed by the Market Risk Department in collaboration with the business units. The material risks identified by these processes are summarized in reports produced by the Market Risk Department that are circulated to and discussed with senior management, the FRC, the BRC and the Board. 
 Trading Risks 
 Primary Market Risk Exposures and Market Risk Management 
 We have exposures to a wide range of risks related to interest rates and credit spreads, equity prices, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices as well as the associated implied volatilities, correlations and spreads of the global markets in which we conduct our trading activities. 
 We are exposed to interest rate and credit spread risk as a result of our market-making activities and other trading in interest rate-sensitive financial instruments (i.e., risk arising from changes in the level or implied volatility of interest rates, the timing of mortgage prepayments, the shape of the yield curve and/or credit spreads). The activities from which those exposures arise and the markets in which we are active include, but are not limited to, the following: derivatives, corporate and government debt across both developed and 

December 2022 Form 10-K 56

 Risk Disclosures 

emerging markets and asset-backed debt, including mortgage-related securities. 
 We are exposed to equity price, correlation, and implied volatility risk as a result of making markets in equity securities and derivatives and maintaining other positions, including positions in non-public entities. Positions in non-public entities may include, but are not limited to, exposures to private equity, venture capital, private partnerships, real estate funds and other funds. Such positions are less liquid, have longer investment horizons and are more difficult to hedge than listed equities. 
 We are exposed to foreign exchange rate, correlation, and implied volatility risk as a result of making markets in foreign currencies and foreign currency derivatives, from maintaining foreign exchange positions and from holding non-U.S. dollar-denominated financial instruments. 
 We are exposed to commodity price and implied volatility risk as a result of market-making activities in commodity products related primarily to electricity, natural gas, oil and precious metals. Commodity exposures are subject to periods of high price volatility as a result of changes in supply and demand. These changes can be caused by weather conditions; physical production and transportation; or geopolitical and other events that affect the available supply and level of demand for these commodities. 
 We manage our trading positions by employing a variety of risk mitigation strategies. These strategies include diversification of risk exposures and hedging. Hedging activities consist of the purchase or sale of positions in related securities and financial instruments, including a variety of derivative products e.g. , futures, forwards, swaps and options). Hedging activities may not always provide effective mitigation against trading losses due to differences in the terms, specific characteristics or other basis risks that may exist between the hedge instrument and the risk exposure that is being hedged. 
 We manage the market risk associated with our trading activities on a Firmwide basis, on a worldwide trading division level and on an individual product basis. We manage and monitor our market risk exposures in such a way as to maintain a portfolio that we believe is well-diversified in the aggregate with respect to market risk factors and that reflects our aggregate risk tolerance as established by our senior management. 
 Aggregate market risk limits have been approved for the Firm across all divisions worldwide. Additional market risk limits are assigned to trading desks and, as appropriate, products and regions. Trading division risk managers, desk risk managers, traders and the Market Risk Department monitor market risk measures against limits in accordance with policies set by our senior management. 

Value-at-Risk 
 The statistical technique known as VaR is one of the tools we use to measure, monitor and review the market risk exposures of our trading portfolios. The Market Risk Department calculates and distributes daily VaR-based risk measures to various levels of management. 
 We estimate VaR using a model based on a one-year equal weighted historical simulation for general market risk factors and name-specific risk in corporate equities and related derivatives, and Monte Carlo simulation for name-specific risk in bonds, loans and related derivatives. The model constructs a distribution of hypothetical daily changes in the value of trading portfolios based on historical observation of daily changes in key market indices or other market risk factors, and information on the sensitivity of the portfolio values to these market risk factor changes. 
 VaR for risk management purposes Management VaR is computed at a 95 level of confidence over a one-day time horizon, which is a useful indicator of possible trading losses resulting from adverse daily market moves. The 95 /one-day VaR corresponds to the unrealized loss in portfolio value that, based on historically observed market risk factor movements, would have been exceeded with a frequency of 5 , or five times in every 100 trading days, if the portfolio were held constant for one day. 
 Our VaR model generally takes into account linear and non-linear exposures to equity and commodity price risk, interest rate risk, credit spread risk and foreign exchange rates. The model also takes into account linear exposures to implied volatility risks for all asset classes and non-linear exposures to implied volatility risks for equity, commodity and foreign exchange referenced products. The VaR model also captures certain implied correlation risks associated with portfolio credit derivatives, as well as certain basis risks (e.g., corporate debt and related credit derivatives). 
 We use VaR as one of a range of risk management tools. Among their benefits, VaR models permit estimation of a portfolio s aggregate market risk exposure, incorporating a range of varied market risks and portfolio assets. One key element of the VaR model is that it reflects risk reduction due to portfolio diversification or hedging activities. However, VaR has various limitations, which include, but are not limited to: use of historical changes in market risk factors, which may not be accurate predictors of future market conditions and may not fully incorporate the risk of extreme market events that are outsized relative to observed historical market behavior or reflect the historical distribution of results beyond the 95 confidence interval; and reporting of losses in a single day, which does not reflect the risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or hedged in one day. A small proportion of market risk generated by trading positions is not included in VaR.

 Risk Disclosures 

The modeling of the risk characteristics of some positions relies on approximations that, under certain circumstances, could produce significantly different results from those produced using more precise measures. VaR is most appropriate as a risk measure for trading positions in liquid financial markets and will understate the risk associated with severe events, such as periods of extreme illiquidity. We are aware of these and other limitations and, therefore, use VaR as only one component in our risk management oversight process. This process also incorporates stress testing and scenario analyses and extensive risk monitoring, analysis and control at the trading desk, division and Firm levels. 
 We update our VaR model in response to changes in the composition of trading portfolios and to improvements in modeling techniques and systems capabilities. We are committed to continuous review and enhancement of VaR methodologies and assumptions in order to capture evolving risks associated with changes in market structure and dynamics. As part of our regular process improvements, additional systematic and name-specific risk factors may be added to improve the VaR model s ability to more accurately estimate risks to specific asset classes or industry sectors. 
 Since the reported VaR statistics are estimates based on historical data, VaR should not be viewed as predictive of our future revenues or financial performance or of our ability to monitor and manage risk. There can be no assurance that our actual losses on a particular day will not exceed the VaR amounts indicated in the following tables or that such losses will not occur more than five times in 100 trading days for a 95 /one-day VaR. VaR does not predict the magnitude of losses that, should they occur, may be significantly greater than the VaR amount. 
 VaR statistics are not readily comparable across firms because of differences in the firms portfolios, modeling assumptions and methodologies. These differences can result in materially different VaR estimates across firms for similar portfolios. The impact of such differences varies depending on the factor history assumptions, the frequency with which the factor history is updated and the confidence level. As a result, VaR statistics are more useful when interpreted as indicators of trends in a firm s risk profile rather than as an absolute measure of risk to be compared across firms. 
 Our regulators have approved the same VaR model we use for risk management purposes for use in regulatory calculations. 
 The portfolio of positions used for Management VaR differs from that used for Regulatory VaR. Management VaR contains certain positions that are excluded from Regulatory VaR.

 1. The high and low VaR values for the Total Management VaR and each of the component VaRs might have occurred on different days during the quarter, and, therefore, the diversification benefit is not an applicable measure. 
 2. Diversification benefit equals the difference between the total VaR and the sum of the component VaRs. This benefit arises because the simulated one-day losses for each of the components occur on different days; similar diversification benefits also are taken into account within each component. 
 Average Total Management VaR and Average Management VaR for the Primary Risk Categories increased in 2022 from 2021 primarily due to increased market volatility in the interest rate and credit spread categories, as well as the commodity price category which was partially offset by increased diversification benefit. 
 Distribution of VaR Statistics and Net Revenues 
 We evaluate the reasonableness of our VaR model by comparing the potential declines in portfolio values generated by the model with corresponding actual trading results for the Firm, as well as individual business units. For days where losses exceed the VaR statistic, we examine the drivers of trading losses to evaluate the VaR model s accuracy . There were 15 trading loss days in 2022, none of which exceeded 95 Total Management VaR, compared to 14 trading loss days in 2021, one of which exceeded 95 Total Management VaR.

Certain items such as fees, commissions, net interest income and counterparty default risk are excluded from daily net trading revenues and the VaR model. Revenues required for Regulatory VaR backtesting further exclude intraday trading. 
 Non-Trading Risks 
 We believe that sensitivity analysis is an appropriate representation of our non-trading risks. The following sensitivity analyses cover substantially all of the non-trading risk in our portfolio.

 Credit spread risk sensitivity for borrowings carried at fair value at December 31, 2022 decreased from December 31, 2021 primarily due to widening credit spreads, partially offset by new debt issuance. 
 
 The Wealth Management business segment reflects a substantial portion of our non-trading interest rate risk. Historically, net interest income sensitivity for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries was representative of such sensitivity for the Wealth Management business segment and, accordingly, we presented net interest income sensitivity for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. However, over time the Wealth Management business segment has grown its assets that generate net interest income outside of the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, such as margin and other lending on non-bank entities, and this growth has been further accelerated by the acquisition of E TRADE. Net interest income in the Wealth Management business segment primarily consists of interest income earned on non-trading assets held, including loans and investment securities, as well as margin and other lending on non-bank entities and interest expense incurred on non-trading liabilities, primarily deposits.

 We do not manage to any single rate scenario but rather manage net interest income in our Wealth Management business segment to optimize across a range of possible outcomes, including non-parallel rate change scenarios. The sensitivity analysis assumes that we take no action in response to these scenarios, assumes there are no changes in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates and includes subjective assumptions regarding customer and market re-pricing behavior and other factors.

 We have exposure to public and private companies through direct investments, as well as through funds that invest in these assets. These investments are predominantly equity positions with long investment horizons, a portion of which is for business facilitation purposes. The market risk related to these investments is measured by estimating the potential reduction in net revenues associated with a reasonably possible 10 decline in investment values and rel ated impact on performance-based income, as applicable. Investments sensitivity changed between December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 with an increase in sensitivity in Other Firm investments primarily due to new investments in Community Reinvestment Act affordable housing, as well as lower sensitivity in MUMSS driven by Yen depreciation. 
 Asset Management Revenue Sensitivity 
 Certain asset management revenues in the Wealth Management and Investment Management business segments are derived from management fees, which are based on fee-based client assets in Wealth Management or AUM in Investment Management (together, client holdings ). The assets underlying client holdings are primarily composed of equity, fixed income and alternative investments and are sensitive to changes in related markets. These revenues depend on multiple factors including, but not limited to, the level and duration of a market increase or decline, price volatility, the geographic and industry mix of client assets, and client behavior such as the rate and magnitude of client investments and redemptions. Therefore, overall revenues may not correlate completely with changes in the related markets. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 Credit risk refers to the risk of loss arising when a borrower, counterparty or issuer does not meet its financial obligations to us. We are primarily exposed to credit risk from institutions and individuals through our Institutional Securities and Wealth Management business segments. 
 We incur credit risk in our Institutional Securities business segment through a variety of activities, including, but not limited to, the following: 

extending credit to clients through loans and lending commitments; 
 entering into swap or other derivative contracts under which counterparties may have obligations to make payments to us; 
 providing short- or long-term funding that is secured by physical or financial collateral whose value may at times be insufficient to fully cover the repayment amount; 
 posting margin and/or collateral to clearinghouses, clearing agencies, exchanges, banks, securities firms and other financial counterparties; 
 placing funds on deposit at other financial institutions to support our clearing and settlement obligations; and 
 investing or trading in securities and loan pools, whereby the value of these assets may fluctuate based on realized or expected defaults on the underlying obligations or loans. 
 We incur credit risk in our Wealth Management business segment, primarily through lending to individuals and entities, including, but not limited to, the following: 
 margin loans collateralized by securities; 
 securities-based lending and other forms of secured loans, including tailored lending to high and ultra-high net worth clients; 
 single-family residential mortgage loans in conforming, non-conforming or HELOC form primarily to existing Wealth Management clients; and 
 employee loans granted primarily to recruit certain Wealth Management representatives. 
 Monitoring and Control 
 The Credit Risk Management Department CRM establishes Firmwide practices to evaluate, monitor and control credit risk at the transaction, obligor and portfolio levels. The CRM approves extensions of credit, evaluates the creditworthiness of the counterparties and borrowers on a regular basis, and helps ensure that credit exposure is actively monitored and managed. The evaluation of counterparties and borrowers includes an assessment of the probability that an obligor will default on its financial obligations and any losses that may occur when an obligor defaults. In addition, credit risk exposure is actively managed by credit professionals and committees within the CRM and through various risk committees, whose membership includes individuals from the CRM. A comprehensive and global Credit Limits Framework is utilized to manage credit risk levels across the Firm. The Credit Limits Framework is calibrated within our risk tolerance and includes single-name limits and portfolio concentration limits by country, industry and product type. 
 The CRM helps ensure timely and transparent communication of material credit risks, compliance with established limits and escalation of risk concentrations to appropriate senior management. The CRM also works closely with the Market Risk Department and applicable business units to monitor risk exposures and to perform stress tests to identify, analyze and control credit risk concentrations arising from lending and

trading activities. The stress tests shock market factors e.g. , interest rates, commodity prices, credit spreads), risk parameters e.g., probability of default and loss given default), recovery rates and expected losses in order to assess the impact of stresses on exposures, profit and loss, and our capital position. Stress tests are conducted in accordance with our established policies and procedures. 
 Credit Evaluation 
 The evaluation of corporate and institutional counterparties and borrowers includes assigning credit ratings, which reflect an assessment of an obligor s probability of default and loss given default. Credit evaluations typically involve the assessment of financial statements; leverage; liquidity; capital strength; asset composition and quality; market capitalization; access to capital markets; adequacy of collateral, if applicable; and, in the case of certain loans, cash flow projections and debt service requirements. The CRM also evaluates strategy, market position, industry dynamics, management and other factors such as country risks and legal and contingent risks that could affect the obligor s risk profile. Additionally, the CRM evaluates the relative position of our exposure in the borrower s capital structure and relative recovery prospects, as well as other structural elements of the particular transaction. 
 The evaluation of consumer borrowers is tailored to the specific type of lending. Securities-based loans are evaluated based on factors that include, but are not limited to, the amount of the loan and the amount, quality, diversification, price volatility and liquidity of the collateral. The underwriting of residential real estate loans includes, but is not limited to, review of the obligor s debt-to-income ratio, net worth, liquidity, collateral, LTV ratio and industry standard credit scoring models e.g. , FICO scores). Subsequent credit monitoring for individual loans is performed at the portfolio level, and collateral values are monitored on an ongoing basis. 
 Credit risk metrics assigned to our borrowers during the evaluation process are incorporated into the CRM maintenance of the allowance for credit losses. Such allowance serves as a reserve for probable inherent losses, as well as probable losses related to loans identified as impaired. For more information on the allowance for credit losses, see Notes 2 and 10 to the financial statements. 
 Risk Mitigation 
 We may seek to mitigate credit risk from our lending and trading activities in multiple ways, including collateral provisions, guarantees and hedges. At the transaction level, we seek to mitigate risk through management of key risk elements such as size, tenor, financial covenants, seniority and collateral. We actively hedge our lending and derivatives exposures. Hedging activities consist of the purchase or sale of positions in related securities and financial instruments, including a variety of derivative products e.g. , futures, 

forwards, swaps and options). Additionally, we may sell, assign or syndicate loans and lending commitments to other financial institutions in the primary and secondary loan markets. 
 In connection with our derivatives trading activities, we generally enter into master netting agreements and collateral arrangements with counterparties. These agreements provide us with the ability to demand collateral, as well as to liquidate collateral and offset receivables and payables covered under the same master agreement in the event of a counterparty default. A collateral management group monitors collateral levels against requirements and oversees the administration of the collateral function.

 1. Investment Management business segment loans are related to certain of our activities as an investment advisor and manager. Loans held at fair value are the result of the consolidation of investment vehicles (including CLOs) managed by Investment Management, composed primarily of senior secured loans to corporations. 
 2. FVO also includes the fair value of certain unfunded lending commitments. 
 3. Lending commitments represent the notional amount of legally binding obligations to provide funding to clients for lending transactions. Since commitments associated with these business activities may expire unused or may not be utilized to full capacity, they do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements. 
 We provide loans and lending commitments to a variety of customers, including large corporate and institutional clients, as well as high to ultra-high net worth individuals. In addition, we purchase loans in the secondary market. Loans and lending commitments are either held for investment, held for sale or carried at fair value. For more information on these loan classifications, see Note 2 to the financial statements. 
 In 2022, total loans and lending commitments increased by approximately 23 billion, primarily due to growth in Residential real estate loans and Securities-based loans within the Wealth Management business segment, as well as an increase in Secured lending facilities within the Institutional Securities business segment. 
 See Notes 5, 6, 10 and 15 to the financial statements for further information.

 Credit exposure arising from our loans and lending commitments is measured in accordance with our internal risk management standards. Risk factors considered in determining the allowance for credit losses for loans and lending commitments include the borrower s financial strength, industry, facility structure, LTV ratio, debt service ratio, collateral and covenants. Qualitative and environmental factors such as economic and business conditions, nature and volume of the portfolio and lending terms, and volume and severity of past due loans may also be considered. 
 
 The aggregate allowance for credit losses for loans and lending commitments increased in 2022, reflecting the Provision for credit losses due to portfolio growth and deterioration in macroeconomic outlook. 
 The base scenario used in our ACL models as of December 31, 2022 was generated using a combination of consensus economic forecasts, forward rates, and internally developed and validated models, and assumes weak economic growth over the forecast period. Given the nature of our lending portfolio, the most sensitive model input is U.S. gross domestic product.

loans; may have varying terms; may be senior or subordinated; may be secured or unsecured; are generally contingent upon representations, warranties and contractual conditions applicable to the borrower; and may be syndicated, traded or hedged. Relationship loans and lending commitments are extended to select institutional clients, primarily for general corporate purposes and generally with the intent to hold for the foreseeable future. Event-driven loans and lending commitments are extended in connection with specific client transactions and are explained in further detail in Institutional Securities Event-Driven Loans and Lending Commitments herein. 
 Secured lending facilities include loans provided to clients, which are collateralized by various assets, including residential and commercial real estate mortgage loans, investor commitments for capital calls, corporate loans and other assets. These facilities generally provide for overcollateralization. Credit risk with respect to these loans and lending commitments arises from the failure of a borrower to perform according to the terms of the loan agreement and/or a decline in the underlying collateral value. The Firm monitors collateral levels against the requirements of lending agreements. See Note 16 to the financial statements for information about our securitization activities. 
 Commercial real estate loans are primarily senior, secured by underlying real estate and are typically in term loan form. In addition, as part of certain of its trading and securitization activities, Institutional Securities may also hold residential real estate loans. 
 Securities-based lending and Other includes financing extended to sales and trading customers and corporate loans purchased in the secondary market.

 The principal Wealth Management business segment lending activities include Securities-based lending and Residential real estate loans. 
 Securities-based lending allows clients to borrow money against the value of qualifying securities, generally for any purpose other than purchasing, trading or carrying securities or refinancing margin debt. We establish approved credit lines against qualifying securities and m onitor limits daily and, pursuant to such guidelines, require customers to deposit additional collateral, or reduce debt positions, when necessary. These credit lines are primarily uncommitted loan facilities, as we reserve the right not to make any advances or may terminate these credit lines at any time. Factors considered in the review of these loans include, but are not limited to, the loan amount, the client s credit profile, the degree of leverage, collateral diversification, price volatility and liquidity of the collateral. 
 Residential real estate loans consist of first and second lien mortgages, including HELOCs. Our underwriting policy is designed to ensure that all borrowers pass an assessment of capacity and willingness to pay, which includes an analysis utilizing industry standard credit scoring models e.g. , FICO scores), debt-to-income ratios and assets of the borrower. LTV ratios are determined based on independent third-party property appraisals and valuations, and security lien positions are established through title and ownership reports. The vast majority of mortgage loans, including HELOCs, are held for investment in the Wealth Management business segment s loan portfolio.

 The Institutional Securities and Wealth Management business segments provide margin lending arrangements that allow customers to borrow against the value of qualifying securities, primarily for the purpose of purchasing additional securities, as well as to collateralize short positions. Institutional Securities primarily includes margin loans in the Equity Financing business. Wealth Management includes margin loans as well as non-purpose securities-based lending on non-bank entities. Amounts may fluctuate from period to period as overall client balances change as a result of market levels, client positioning and leverage. 
 Credit exposures arising from margin lending activities are generally mitigated by their short-term nature, the value of collateral held and our right to call for additional margin when collateral values decline. However, we could incur losses in the event that the customer fails to meet margin calls and collateral values decline below the loan amount. This risk is elevated in loans backed by collateral pools with significant concentrations in individual issuers or securities with similar risk characteristics.

 1. Counterparty credit ratings are determined internally by the CRM. 
 We are exposed to credit risk as a dealer in OTC derivatives. Credit risk with respect to derivative instruments arises from the possibility that a counterparty may fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. For a description of our risk mitigation strategies, see Credit Risk Risk Mitigation herein. 
 Credit Derivatives 
 A credit derivative is a contract between a seller and buyer of protection against the risk of a credit event occurring on one 

or more debt obligations issued by a specified reference entity. The buyer typically pays a periodic premium over the life of the contract and is protected for the period. If a credit event occurs, the seller is required to make payment to the beneficiary based on the terms of the credit derivative contract. Credit events, as defined in the contract, may be one or more of the following defined events: bankruptcy, dissolution or insolvency of the referenced entity, failure to pay, obligation acceleration, repudiation, payment moratorium and restructuring. 
 We trade in a variety of credit derivatives and may either purchase or write protection on a single name or portfolio of referenced entities. In transactions referencing a portfolio of entities or securities, protection may be limited to a tranche of exposure or a single name within the portfolio. We are an active market maker in the credit derivatives markets. As a market maker, we work to earn a bid-offer spread on client flow business and manage any residual credit or correlation risk on a portfolio basis. Further, we use credit derivatives to manage our exposure to residential and commercial mortgage loans and corporate lending exposures. The effectiveness of our CDS protection as a hedge of our exposures may vary depending upon a number of factors, including the contractual terms of the CDS. 
 We actively monitor our counterparty credit risk related to credit derivatives. A majority of our counterparties are composed of banks, broker-dealers, insurance and other financial institutions. Contracts with these counterparties may include provisions related to counterparty rating downgrades, which may result in the counterparty posting additional collateral to us. As with all derivative contracts, we consider counterparty credit risk in the valuation of our positions and recognize CVAs as appropriate within Trading revenues in the income statement. 
 For additional credit exposure information on our credit derivative portfolio, see Note 7 to the financial statements.

 Risk Disclosures 

Country Risk 
 Country risk exposure is the risk that events in, or that affect, a foreign country (any country other than the U.S.) might adversely affect us. We actively manage country risk exposure through a comprehensive risk management framework that combines credit and other market fundamentals and allows us to effectively identify, monitor and limit country risk. 
 Our obligor credit evaluation process may also identify indirect exposures, whereby an obligor has vulnerability or exposure to another country or jurisdiction. Examples of indirect exposures include mutual funds that invest in a single country, offshore companies whose assets reside in another country to that of the offshore jurisdiction and finance company subsidiaries of corporations. Indirect exposures identified through the credit evaluation process may result in a reclassification of country risk. 
 We conduct periodic stress testing that seeks to measure the impact on our credit and market exposures of shocks stemming from negative economic or political scenarios. When deemed appropriate by our risk managers, the stress test scenarios include possible contagion effects and second order risks. This analysis, and results of the stress tests, may result in the amendment of limits or exposure mitigation. 
 Our sovereign exposures consist of financial contracts and obligations entered into with sovereign and local governments. Our non-sovereign exposures consist of financial contracts and obligations entered into primarily with corporations and financial institutions. 
 Index credit derivatives are included in the following country risk exposure table. Each reference entity within an index is allocated to that reference entity s country of risk. Index exposures are allocated to the underlying reference entities in proportion to the notional weighting of each reference entity in the index, adjusted for any fair value receivable or payable for that reference entity. Where credit risk crosses multiple jurisdictions, for example, a CDS purchased from an issuer in a specific country that references bonds issued by an entity in a different country, the fair value of the CDS is reflected in the Net Counterparty Exposure row based on the country of the CDS issuer. Further, the notional amount of the CDS adjusted for the fair value of the receivable or payable is reflected in the Net Inventory row based on the country of the underlying reference entity.

 Risk Disclosures 

Operational Risk 
 Operational risk refers to the risk of loss, or of damage to our reputation, resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems, from human factors or from external events e.g. , cyber attacks or third-party vulnerabilities) that may manifest as, for example, loss of information, business disruption, theft and fraud, legal and compliance risks, or damage to physical assets. We may incur operational risk across the full scope of our business activities, including revenue-generating activities and support and control groups e.g. , information technology and trade processing). 
 We have established an operational risk framework to identify, measure, monitor and control risk across the Firm. Effective operational risk management is essential to reducing the impact of operational risk incidents and mitigating legal, regulatory and reputational risks. The framework is continually evolving to account for changes in the Firm and to respond to the changing regulatory and business environment. 
 We have implemented operational risk data and assessment systems to monitor and analyze internal and external operational risk events, to assess business environment and internal control factors, and to perform scenario analysis. The collected data elements are incorporated in the operational risk capital model. The model encompasses both quantitative and qualitative elements. Internal loss data and scenario analysis results are direct inputs to the capital model, while external operational incidents, business environment and internal control factors are evaluated as part of the scenario analysis process. 
 In addition, we employ a variety of risk processes and mitigants to manage our operational risk exposures. These include a governance framework, a comprehensive risk management program and insurance. Operational risks and associated risk exposures are assessed relative to the risk appetite reviewed and confirmed by the Board and are prioritized accordingly. 
 The breadth and range of operational risk are such that the types of mitigating activities are wide-ranging. Examples of activities include: continuous enhancement of defenses against cyber attacks; use of legal agreements and contracts to transfer and/or limit operational risk exposures; due diligence; implementation of enhanced policies and procedures; technology change management controls; exception management processing controls; and segregation of duties. 
 Primary responsibility for the management of operational risk is with the business segments, the control groups and the business managers therein. The business managers maintain processes and controls designed to identify, assess, manage, mitigate and report operational risk. Each of the business segments has a designated operational risk coordinator. The operational risk coordinator regularly reviews operational risk issues and reports to our senior management within each business. Each control group also has a designated operational 

risk coordinator and a forum for discussing operational risk matters with our senior management. Oversight of operational risk is provided by the Operational Risk Oversight Committee, legal entity risk committees, regional risk committees and senior management. In the event of a merger; joint venture; divestiture; reorganization; or creation of a new legal entity, a new product, or a business activity, operational risks are considered, and any necessary changes in processes or controls are implemented. 
 The Operational Risk Department ORD provides independent oversight of operational risk and assesses, measures and monitors operational risk against appetite. The ORD works with the divisions and control groups to embed a transparent, consistent and comprehensive framework for managing operational risk within each area and across the Firm. 
 The ORD scope includes oversight of technology risk, cybersecurity risk, information security risk, the fraud risk management and prevention program, and third-party risk management (supplier and affiliate risk oversight and assessment), among others. 
 Cybersecurity 
 Our cybersecurity and information security policies, procedures and technologies are designed to protect our own, our client and our employee data against unauthorized disclosure, modification or misuse and are also designed to address regulatory requirements. These policies and procedures cover a broad range of areas, including: identification of internal and external threats, access control, data security, protective controls, detection of malicious or unauthorized activity, incident response and recovery planning. 
 Firm Resilience 
 The Firm s critical processes and businesses could be disrupted by events including cyber attacks, failure or loss of access to technology and/or associated data, military conflicts, acts of terror, natural disasters, severe weather events and infectious disease. The Firm maintains a resilience program designed to provide for operational resilience and enable it to respond to and recover critical processes and supporting assets in the event of a disruption impacting our people, technology, facilities and third parties. The key elements of the Firm s resilience program include business continuity and technical recovery planning, and testing both internally and with critical third parties to validate recovery capability in accordance with business requirements. The Firm Resilience program is applied consistently Firmwide and is aligned with regulatory requirements. 
 Third-Party Risk Management 
 In connection with our ongoing operations, we utilize the services of third-party suppliers, which we anticipate will continue and may increase in the future. These services 

December 2022 Form 10-K 68 

Table of Contents 
 
 Risk Disclosures 

include, for example, outsourced processing and support functions and other professional services. Our risk-based approach to managing exposure to these services includes the performance of due diligence, implementation of service level and other contractual agreements, consideration of operational risks and ongoing monitoring of third-party suppliers performance. We maintain and continue to enhance our third-party risk management program, which is designed to align with our risk tolerance and meet regulatory requirements. The program includes appropriate governance, policies, procedures and enabling technology. The third-party risk management program includes the adoption of appropriate risk management controls and practices throughout the third-party management life cycle to manage risk of service failure, risk of data loss and reputational risk, among others. 
 Model Risk 
 Model risk refers to the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs. Model risk can lead to financial loss, poor business and strategic decision making or damage to our reputation. The risk inherent in a model is a function of the materiality, complexity and uncertainty around inputs and assumptions. 
 Model risk is generated from the use of models impacting financial statements, regulatory filings, capital adequacy assessments and the formulation of strategy. 
 Sound model risk management is an integral part of our Risk Management Framework. The Model Risk Management Department MRM is a distinct department in Risk Management responsible for the oversight of model risk. 
 The MRM establishes a model risk tolerance in line with our risk appetite. The tolerance is based on an assessment of the materiality of the risk of financial loss or reputational damage due to errors in design, implementation and/or inappropriate use of models. The tolerance is monitored through model-specific and aggregate business-level assessments, which are based upon qualitative and quantitative factors. 
 A guiding principle for managing model risk is the effective challenge of models. The effective challenge of models is defined as critical analysis by objective, informed parties who can identify model limitations and assumptions and drive appropriate changes. The MRM provides effective challenge of models, independently validates and approves models for use, annually recertifies models, identifies and tracks remediation plans for model limitations and reports on model risk metrics. The department also oversees the development of controls to support a complete and accurate Firmwide model inventory. 
 Liquidity Risk 
 Liquidity risk refers to the risk that we will be unable to finance our operations due to a loss of access to the capital markets or difficulty in liquidating our assets. Liquidity risk 

also encompasses our ability (or perceived ability) to meet our financial obligations without experiencing significant business disruption or reputational damage that may threaten our viability as a going concern. Liquidity risk also encompasses the associated funding risks triggered by the market or idiosyncratic stress events that may negatively affect our liquidity and may impact our ability to raise new funding. Generally, we incur liquidity and funding risk as a result of our trading, lending, investing and client facilitation activities. 
 Our Liquidity Risk Management Framework is critical to helping ensure that we maintain sufficient liquidity reserves and durable funding sources to meet our daily obligations and to withstand unanticipated stress events. The Liquidity Risk Department is a distinct area in Risk Management responsible for the oversight and monitoring of liquidity risk. The Liquidity Risk Department ensures transparency of material liquidity and funding risks, compliance with established risk limits and escalation of risk concentrations to appropriate senior management. 
 To execute these responsibilities, the Liquidity Risk Department establishes limits in line with our risk appetite, identifies and analyzes emerging liquidity and funding risks to ensure such risks are appropriately mitigated, monitors and reports risk exposures against metrics and limits, and reviews the methodologies and assumptions underpinning our Liquidity Stress Tests to ensure sufficient liquidity and funding under a range of adverse scenarios. 
 The Treasury Department and applicable business units have primary responsibility for evaluating, monitoring and controlling the liquidity and funding risks arising from our business activities and for maintaining processes and controls to manage the key risks inherent in their respective areas. The Liquidity Risk Department coordinates with the Treasury Department and these business units to help ensure a consistent and comprehensive framework for managing liquidity and funding risk across the Firm. See also Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources herein. 
 Legal and Compliance Risk 
 Legal and compliance risk includes the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, including fines, penalties, judgments, damages and/or settlements, limitations on our business, or loss to reputation that we may suffer as a result of failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, related self-regulatory organization standards and codes of conduct applicable to our business activities. This risk also includes contractual and commercial risk, such as the risk that a counterparty s performance obligations will be unenforceable. It also includes compliance with AML, terrorist financing, and anti-corruption rules and regulations. We are generally subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which we conduct our business (see 

69 
 December 2022 Form 10-K 

Table of Contents 
 
 Risk Disclosures 

also Business Supervision and Regulation and Risk Factors ). 
 We have established procedures based on legal and regulatory requirements on a worldwide basis that are designed to facilitate compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and to require that our policies relating to business conduct, ethics and practices are followed globally. In addition, we have established procedures to mitigate the risk that a counterparty s performance obligations will be unenforceable, including consideration of counterparty legal authority and capacity, adequacy of legal documentation, the permissibility of a transaction under applicable law and whether applicable bankruptcy or insolvency laws limit or alter contractual remedies. The heightened legal and regulatory focus on the financial services and banking industries globally presents a continuing business challenge for us. 
 Climate Risk 
 Climate change manifests as physical and transition risks. The physical risks of climate change include acute events, such as flooding, hurricanes, heatwaves and wildfires, and chronic, longer-term shifts in climate patterns, such as increasing global average temperatures, rising sea levels, and droughts. Transition risks are policy, legal, technological, and market changes to address climate risks and include changes in consumer behavior, shareholder preferences, and any additional regulatory and legislative requirements, such as carbon taxes. 
 Climate risk, which is not expected to have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition in the near-term, is an overarching risk that can impact other categories of risk over the longer-term. Physical risk may lead to increased credit risk by diminishing borrowers repayment capacity or impacting the value of collateral. In addition, physical risk could pose increased operational risk to our facilities and people. The impacts of transition risk may lead to and amplify credit risk or market risk by reducing our customers operating income or the value of their assets as well as exposing us to reputational and/or litigation risk due to increased legal and regulatory scrutiny or negative public sentiment. 
 As climate risk is interconnected with other risk types, including geopolitical risks, we have developed and continue to enhance processes to embed climate risk considerations into our risk management strategies, established for risks such as market, credit and operational risks, as well as our governance structures. The BRC oversees Firmwide risks, which include climate risk, and, as part of its oversight, receives updates on our risk management approach to climate risk, including our approaches towards scenario analysis and integration of climate risk into our existing risk management processes. Our climate risk management efforts are overseen by the Climate Risk Committee, which is co-chaired by our Chief Risk Officer and Chief Sustainability Officer and 

shapes our approach to managing climate-related risks in line with our overall risk framework.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 
 
 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Morgan Stanley: 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Morgan Stanley and subsidiaries (the Firm as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated income statements, comprehensive income statements, cash flow statements and statements of changes in total equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Firm as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Firm s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 24, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Firm s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Firm s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Firm s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Valuation of Level 3 Financial Assets and Liabilities Carried at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Refer to Note 5 to the financial statements 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 The Firm s trading and financing activities result in the Firm carrying material financial instruments having limited price transparency. These financial instruments can span a broad array of product types and generally include derivative, security, loan, and borrowing positions. As described in Note 5, these Level 3 financial instruments approximate 10.1 billion and 6.1 billion, respectively, of financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2022. Unlike financial instruments whose inputs are readily observable and, therefore, more easily independently corroborated, the valuation of financial instruments classified as Level 3 is inherently subjective and often involves the use of unobservable inputs and proprietary valuation models whose underlying algorithms and valuation methodologies are complex. 
 
 We identified the valuation of Level 3 financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis as a critical audit matter given the Firm uses complex valuation models and/or model inputs that are not observable in the marketplace to determine the respective fair values. Performing our audit procedures to evaluate the appropriateness of these models and inputs involved a high degree of auditor judgment, professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, and an increased extent of testing. 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 
 Our audit procedures related to the valuation of Level 3 financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis included the following, among others: 
 We tested the design and operating effectiveness of the Firm s internal controls that address fair value estimates, including model review and price verification. The Firm maintains these internal controls to assess the appropriateness of its valuation

methodologies and the relevant inputs and assumptions used to determine fair value estimates. 
 We independently evaluated the appropriateness of management s significant valuation methodologies, including the input assumptions, considering the expected assumptions of other market participants and external data when available. 
 We developed independent fair value estimates for selected Level 3 financial instruments, using externally sourced inputs and independent valuation models, and used such estimates to further evaluate management s fair value estimates. For certain of our selected Level 3 financial instruments, this included a comparison to the Firm s fair value estimates for similar transactions and an evaluation of the Firm s assumptions inclusive of the inputs, as applicable. 
 We tested the revenues arising from the trade date fair value estimates for selected structured transactions classified as Level 3 financial instruments. For certain of our selected transactions, we developed independent fair value estimates to test the valuation inputs and assumptions used by the Firm and evaluated whether these methods were consistent with relevant Firm valuation policies. 
 We assessed the consistency by which management has applied significant and unobservable valuation assumptions used in developing fair value estimates. 
 We performed a retrospective assessment of management s fair value estimates for certain of our selected Level 3 financial instruments, for which there were events or transactions occurring after the valuation date. We did so by comparing management s estimates to the relevant evidence provided by such events or transactions, as applicable.

and percent of the change in the fair value, cash flows, or carrying value (due to translation gains or losses) of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. The Firm considers the impact of valuation adjustments related to counterparty credit spreads and its own credit spreads to determine whether they would cause the hedging relationship to be ineffective. 
 Fair Value Hedges Interest Rate Risk 
 The Firm s designated fair value hedges consist of interest rate swaps designated as hedges of changes in the benchmark interest rate of certain fixed rate AFS securities and senior borrowings. The Firm also designates interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of changes in the benchmark interest rate of certain fixed rate deposits. The Firm is permitted to hedge the full, or part of the contractual term of the hedged instrument. The Firm uses regression analysis to perform an ongoing prospective and retrospective assessment of the effectiveness of these hedging relationships. For qualifying fair value hedges of benchmark interest rates, the change in the fair value of the derivative, offset by the change in the fair value attributable to the change in the benchmark interest rate risk of the hedged asset (liability), is recognized in earnings each period as a component of Interest income (expense). For AFS securities, the change in fair value of the hedged item due to changes other than the risk being hedged will continue to be reported in OCI. When a derivative is de-designated as a hedge, any basis adjustment remaining on the hedged asset (liability) is amortized to Interest income (expense) over the

Troubled Debt Restructurings 
 
 The Firm may modify the terms of certain loans for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower s financial difficulties by granting one or more concessions that the Firm would not otherwise consider. Such modifications are accounted for and reported as troubled debt restructurings TDR ). A loan that has been modified in a TDR is generally considered to be impaired and is evaluated individually. TDRs are also generally classified as nonaccrual and may be returned to accrual status only after the Firm expects repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest and there is sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period. 
 Nonaccrual 
 
 The Firm places financial instruments on nonaccrual status if principal or interest is not expected when contractually due or is past due for a period of 90 days or more unless the obligation is well-secured and is in the process of collection. 
 
 For any instrument placed on nonaccrual status, the Firm reverses any unpaid interest accrued with an offsetting reduction to Interest income. Principal and interest payments received on nonaccrual instruments are applied to principal if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of principal. If collection of the principal is not in doubt, interest income is realized on a cash basis. If the instrument is brought current and neither principal nor interest collection is in

 E TRADE s results were included in the Firm s consolidated results for the period from October 2, 2020 to December 31, 2020. For this period, Net revenues were approximately million, and Net income (loss) was not material. 
 Net income 
 The proforma financial information presented in the previous table was computed by combining the historical financial information of the Firm and E TRADE along with the effects of the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations as though the companies were combined on January 1, 2019. 
 The proforma information does not reflect the potential benefits of cost and funding synergies, opportunities to earn additional revenues or other factors, and, therefore, does not represent what the actual Net revenues and Net income would have been had the companies actually been combined as of this date.

 1. Net transfers in 2021 reflect the transfer in the third quarter of million of equity margin loans from Level 3 to Level 2 as a result of the reduced significance of the margin loan rate input. Net transfers in 2020 reflect the largely offsetting impacts of equity margin loan transfers of million into Level 3 in the first quarter and million out of Level 3 in the second quarter, both driven by changes in the significance level of the margin loan rate input based on changes in liquidity conditions. 
 2. Net transfers in 2021 reflect the transfer in the second quarter of billion of Corporate and other debt, billion of net Equity derivatives and billion of Borrowings from Level 3 to Level 2 as the unobservable inputs were not significant to the overall fair value measurements. 
 3. Net transfers in 2021 reflect the transfer in the first quarter of billion of AFS securities from Level 3 to Level 2 due to increased trading activity and observability of pricing inputs. Purchases of AFS investment securities in 2020 relate to securities acquired as part of the E TRADE transaction. For additional information on the acquisition of E TRADE, see Note 3. 
 Level 3 instruments may be hedged with instruments classified in Level 1 and Level 2. The realized and unrealized gains or losses for assets and liabilities within the Level 3 category presented in the previous tables do not reflect the related realized and unrealized gains or losses on hedging instruments that have been classified by the Firm within the Level 1 and/or Level 2 categories. 
 The unrealized gains (losses) during the period for assets and liabilities within the Level 3 category may include changes in fair value during the period that were attributable to both observable and unobservable inputs. Total realized and unrealized gains (losses) are primarily included in Trading revenues in the income statement. 
 Additionally, in the previous tables, consolidations of VIEs are included in Purchases, and deconsolidations of VIEs are included in Settlements.

 1. A single amount is disclosed for range and average when there is no significant difference between the minimum, maximum and average. Amounts represent weighted averages except where simple averages and the median of the inputs are more relevant. 
 2. Includes derivative contracts with multiple risks i.e. , hybrid products). 
 The previous table provides information on the valuation techniques, significant unobservable inputs, and the ranges and averages for each major category of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis with a significant Level 3 balance. The level of aggregation and breadth of products cause the range of inputs to be wide and not evenly distributed across the inventory of financial instruments. Further, the range of unobservable inputs may differ across firms in the financial services industry because of diversity in the types of products included in each firm s inventory. Generally, there are no predictable relationships between multiple significant unobservable inputs attributable to a given valuation technique. 
 During 2022, there were no significant revisions made to the descriptions of the Firm s significant unobservable inputs. 
 An increase (decrease) to the following significant unobservable inputs would generally result in a higher (lower) fair value. 
 Comparable Bond or Loan Price. A pricing input used when prices for the identical instrument are not available. Significant subjectivity may be involved when fair value is determined using pricing data available for comparable instruments. Valuation using comparable instruments can be done by calculating an implied yield (or spread over a liquid benchmark) from the price of a comparable bond or loan, then adjusting that yield (or spread) to derive a value for the bond or loan. The adjustment to yield (or spread) should account for relevant differences in the bonds or

 1. Investments in hedge funds may be subject to initial period lock-up or gate provisions, which restrict an investor from withdrawing from the fund during a certain initial period or restrict the redemption amount on any redemption date, respectively. 
 Amounts in the previous table represent the Firm s carrying value of general and limited partnership interests in fund investments, as well as any related performance-based income in the form of carried interest. The carrying amounts are measured based on the NAV of the fund taking into account the distribution terms applicable to the interest held. This same measurement applies whether the fund investments are accounted for under the equity method or fair value. 
 Private Equity. Funds that pursue multiple strategies, including leveraged buyouts, venture capital, infrastructure growth capital, distressed investments and mezzanine capital. In addition, the funds may be structured with a focus on specific geographic regions. 
 Real Estate. Funds that invest in real estate assets such as commercial office buildings, retail properties, multi-family residential properties, developments or hotels. In addition, the funds may be structured with a focus on specific geographic regions. 
 Investments in private equity and real estate funds generally are not redeemable due to the closed-end nature of these funds. Instead, distributions from each fund will be received as the underlying investments of the funds are disposed and monetized. 
 Hedge. Funds that pursue various investment strategies, including long-short equity, fixed income/credit, event-driven and multi-strategy. 
 See Note 15 for information regarding general partner guarantees, which include potential obligations to return performance fee distributions previously received. See Note 23 for information regarding unrealized carried interest at risk of reversal.

 2. Nonrecurring changes in the fair value of loans and lending commitments, which exclude the impact of related economic hedges, are calculated as follows: for the held-for-investment category, based on the value of the underlying collateral; and for the held-for-sale category, based on recently executed transactions, market price quotations, valuation models that incorporate market observable inputs where possible, such as comparable loan or debt prices and CDS spread levels adjusted for any basis difference between cash and derivative instruments, or default recovery analysis where such transactions and quotations are unobservable. 
 3. Losses related to Other assets Other investments were determined using techniques that included discounted cash flow models, methodologies that incorporate multiples of certain comparable companies and recently executed transactions.

 1. Investment grade/non-investment grade determination is based on the internal credit rating of the reference obligation. Internal credit ratings serve as the CRM s assessment of credit risk and the basis for a comprehensive credit limits framework used to control credit risk. The Firm uses quantitative models and judgment to estimate the various risk parameters related to each obligor.

 The Firm enters into credit derivatives, principally CDS, under which it receives or provides protection against the risk of default on a set of debt obligations issued by a specified reference entity or entities. A majority of the Firm s counterparties for these derivatives are banks, broker-dealers, and insurance and other financial institutions. 
 The fair value amounts as shown in the previous tables are prior to cash collateral or counterparty netting. 
 The purchase of credit protection does not represent the sole manner in which the Firm risk manages its exposure to credit derivatives. The Firm manages its exposure to these derivative contracts through a variety of risk mitigation strategies, which include managing the credit and correlation risk across single-name, non-tranched indices and baskets, tranched indices and baskets, and cash positions. Aggregate market risk limits have been established for credit derivatives, and market risk measures are routinely monitored against these limits. The Firm may also recover amounts on the underlying reference obligation delivered to the Firm under CDS where credit protection was sold. 
 Single-Name CDS. A CDS protects the buyer against the loss of principal on a bond or loan in case of a default by the issuer. The protection buyer pays a periodic premium (generally quarterly) over the life of the contract and is protected for the period. The Firm, in turn, performs under a CDS if a credit event as defined under the contract occurs. Typical credit events include bankruptcy, dissolution or insolvency of the referenced entity, failure to pay and restructuring of the obligations of the referenced entity. 
 Index and Basket CDS. Index and basket CDS are products where credit protection is provided on a portfolio of single-name CDS. Generally, in the event of a default on one of the underlying names, the Firm pays a pro rata portion of the total notional amount of the CDS. 
 The Firm also enters into tranched index and basket CDS where credit protection is provided on a particular portion of the portfolio loss distribution. The most junior tranches cover initial defaults, and once losses exceed the notional of the

 For AFS securities, the Firm believes there are no securities in an unrealized loss position that have credit losses after performing the analysis described in Note 2. Additionally, the Firm does not intend to sell these securities and is not likely to be required to sell these securities prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the securities in an unrealized loss position are predominantly investment grade. 
 The HTM securities net carrying amounts at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 reflect an ACL of million and million, respectively, predominantly related to Non-agency CMBS. See Note 2 for a description of the ACL methodology used for HTM Securities. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, Non-Agency CMBS HTM securities were predominantly on accrual status and investment grade.

Collateral that was sold or repledged 1 
 
 1. Does not include securities used to meet federal regulations for the Firm s U.S. broker-dealers. 
 The Firm receives collateral in the form of securities in connection with securities purchased under agreements to resell, securities borrowed, securities-for-securities transactions, derivative transactions, customer margin loans and securities-based lending. In many cases, the Firm is permitted to sell or repledge this collateral to secure securities sold under agreements to repurchase, to enter into securities lending and derivative transactions or to deliver to counterparties to cover short positions. 
 
 1. Securities segregated under federal regulations for the Firm s U.S. broker-dealers are sourced from Securities purchased under agreements to resell and Trading assets in the balance sheet. 
 Off balance sheet Collateral received 2 
 
 1. Other sovereign government obligations included in Trading assets primarily consist of obligations of the U.K., Japan and Brazil. 
 2. Collateral received is primarily related to Securities purchased under agreements to resell and Securities borrowed. 
 The Firm is subject to concentration risk by holding large positions in certain types of securities, loans or commitments to purchase securities of a single issuer, including sovereign governments and other entities, issuers located in a particular country or geographic area, public and private issuers involving developing countries or issuers engaged in a particular industry. 
 Positions taken and underwriting and financing commitments, including those made in connection with the Firm s private equity, principal investment and lending activities, often involve substantial amounts and significant exposure to individual issuers and businesses, including investment grade and non-investment grade issuers. 

The Firm provides margin lending arrangements that allow customers to borrow against the value of qualifying securities. Receivables from these arrangements are included within Customer and other receivables in the balance sheet. Under these arrangements, the Firm receives collateral, which includes U.S. government and agency securities, other sovereign government obligations, corporate and other debt, and corporate equities. Margin loans are collateralized by customer-owned securities held by the Firm. The Firm monitors required margin levels and established credit terms daily and, pursuant to such guidelines, requires customers to deposit additional collateral, or reduce positions, when necessary. 
 Margin loans are extended on a demand basis and generally are not committed facilities. Factors considered in the review of margin loans are the amount of the loan, the intended purpose, the degree of leverage being employed in the account and the amount of collateral, as well as an overall evaluation of the portfolio to ensure proper diversification or, in the case of concentrated positions, appropriate liquidity of the underlying collateral or potential hedging strategies to reduce risk. Underlying collateral for margin loans is reviewed with respect to the liquidity of the proposed collateral positions, valuation of securities, historic trading range, volatility analysis and an evaluation of industry concentrations. For these transactions, adherence to the Firm s collateral policies significantly limits its credit exposure in the event of a customer default. The Firm may request additional margin collateral from customers, if appropriate, and, if necessary, may sell securities that have not been paid for or purchase securities sold but not delivered from customers. 
 Also included in the amounts in the previous table is non-purpose securities-based lending on non-bank entities in the Wealth Management business segment. 
 Other Secured Financings 
 Other secured financings include the liabilities related to transfers of financial assets that are accounted for as financings rather than sales, consolidated VIEs where the Firm is deemed to be the primary beneficiary, and certain ELNs and other secured borrowings. These liabilities are generally payable from the cash flows of the related assets, which are accounted for as Trading assets (see Notes 14 and 16).

 Credit Quality 
 
 The CRM evaluates new obligors before credit transactions are initially approved and at least annually thereafter for corporate and commercial real estate loans. For Corporate, Secured lending facilities and Other loans, credit evaluations typically involve the evaluation of financial statements, assessment of leverage, liquidity, capital strength, asset composition and quality, market capitalization and access to capital markets, cash flow projections and debt service requirements, and the adequacy of collateral, if applicable. The CRM also evaluates strategy, market position, industry dynamics, obligor s management and other factors that could affect an obligor s risk profile. 
 For Commercial real estate loans, the credit evaluation is focused on property and transaction metrics, including property type, LTV ratio, occupancy levels, debt service ratio, prevailing capitalization rates and market dynamics. 
 For Residential real estate and Securities-based loans, the initial credit evaluation typically includes, but is not limited to, review of the obligor s income, net worth, liquidity, collateral, LTV ratio and credit bureau information. Subsequent credit monitoring for residential real estate loans is performed at the portfolio level. Securities-based loan collateral values are monitored on an ongoing basis. 
 For information related to credit quality indicators considered in developing the ACL, see Note 2.

 The aggregate allowance for credit losses for loans and lending commitments increased in 2022, reflecting the Provision for credit losses due to portfolio growth and deterioration in macroeconomic outlook. The base scenario used in our ACL models as of December 31, 2022 was generated using a combination of consensus economic forecasts, forward rates, and internally developed and validated models, and assumes weak economic growth over the forecast period. Given the nature of our lending portfolio, the most sensitive model input is U.S. gross domestic product.

 The Firm and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. MUFG formed a joint venture in Japan comprising their respective investment banking and securities businesses by forming two joint venture companies, Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co., Ltd. MUMSS and Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities Co., Ltd. MSMS (collectively, the Joint Venture ). The Firm owns a economic interest in the Joint Venture, and MUFG owns the other . 
 The Firm s voting interest in MUMSS is accounted for under the equity method within the Institutional Securities business segment and is included in the equity method investment balances above. The Firm consolidates MSMS into the Institutional Securities business segment, based on its voting interest. 
 The Firm engages in transactions in the ordinary course of business with MUFG and its affiliates; for example, investment banking, financial advisory, sales and trading, derivatives, investment management, lending, securitization and other financial services transactions. Such transactions are on substantially the same terms as those that would be available to unrelated third parties for comparable transactions.

Subordinated Total Weighted average stated maturity, in years 
 Certain senior debt securities are denominated in various non-U.S. dollar currencies and may be structured to provide a return that is linked to equity, credit, commodity or other indices e.g. , the consumer price index). Senior debt also may be structured to be callable by the Firm or extendible at the option of holders of the senior debt securities. 
 The Firm s Borrowings include notes carried and managed on a fair value basis. These include instruments whose payments and redemption values are linked to the performance of a specific index, a basket of stocks, a specific equity security, a commodity, a credit exposure or basket of credit exposures; and instruments with various interest rate-related features, including step-ups, step-downs and zero coupons. Also included are unsecured contracts which are not classified as OTC derivatives because they fail net investment criteria. To minimize the exposure from such instruments, the Firm has entered into various swap contracts and purchased options that effectively convert the borrowing costs into floating rates. The swaps and purchased options used to economically hedge the embedded features are derivatives and also are carried at fair value. Changes in fair value related to the notes and economic hedges are reported in Trading revenues. See Notes 2 and 6 for further information on borrowings carried at fair value. 
 Liquidity obligations 1 
 
 1. Includes obligations to support secondary market trading. 

Subordinated debt generally is issued to meet the capital requirements of the Firm or its regulated subsidiaries and primarily is U.S. dollar denominated. Maturities of subordinated debt range from 2023 to 2037. 
 Weighted average coupon after swaps 
 1. Weighted average coupon was calculated utilizing U.S. and non-U.S. dollar interest rates and excludes financial instruments for which the fair value option was elected. 

In general, other than securities inventories and customer balances financed by secured funding sources, the majority of the Firm s assets are financed with a combination of deposits, short-term funding, floating rate long-term debt or fixed rate long-term debt swapped to a floating rate. The Firm uses interest rate swaps to more closely match these borrowings to the duration, holding period and interest rate characteristics of the assets being funded and to manage interest rate risk. These swaps effectively convert certain of the Firm s fixed rate borrowings into floating rate obligations. In addition, for non-U.S. dollar currency borrowings that are not used to fund assets in the same currency, the Firm has entered into currency swaps that effectively convert the borrowings into U.S. dollar obligations. 
 The Firm s use of swaps for asset and liability management affects its effective average borrowing rate.

As of December 31, 2022, the carrying amount of standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees issued includes an allowance for credit losses of million. 
 3. Related to commercial and residential mortgage securitizations. 
 Types of Guarantees 
 Non-Credit Derivatives. Certain derivative contracts meet the accounting definition of a guarantee, including certain written options, contingent forward contracts and CDS (see Note 7 regarding credit derivatives in which the Firm has sold credit protection to the counterparty which are excluded from the previous table). For non-credit derivative contracts that meet the accounting definition of a guarantee the notional amount is used as the maximum potential payout for certain derivative contracts, such as written interest rate caps and written foreign currency options. The Firm evaluates collateral requirements for all derivatives, including derivatives that do not meet the accounting definition of a guarantee. For the effects of cash collateral and counterparty netting, see Note 7. 
 In certain situations, collateral may be held by the Firm for those contracts that meet the definition of a guarantee. Generally, the Firm sets collateral requirements by counterparty so that the collateral covers various transactions and products and is not allocated specifically to individual contracts. Also, the Firm may recover amounts related to the underlying asset delivered to the Firm under the derivative contract. 
 Standby Letters of Credit and Other Financial Guarantees Issued. In connection with its corporate lending business and other corporate activities, the Firm provides standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees to counterparties. Such arrangements represent obligations to make payments to third parties if the counterparty fails to fulfill its obligation under a borrowing arrangement or other contractual obligation. A majority of the Firm s standby letters of credit are provided on behalf of counterparties that are investment grade. If the counterparty fails to fulfill its contractual obligation, the Firm has access to collateral or recourse that would approximate its obligation. 

Market Value Guarantees. Market value guarantees are issued to guarantee timely payment of a specified return to investors in certain affordable housing tax credit funds. These guarantees are designed to return an investor s contribution to a fund and the investor s share of tax losses and tax credits expected to be generated by a fund. 
 Liquidity Facilities. The Firm has entered into liquidity facilities with SPEs and other counterparties, whereby the Firm is required to make certain payments if losses or defaults occur. Primarily, the Firm acts as liquidity provider to municipal bond securitization SPEs and for standalone municipal bonds in which the holders of beneficial interests issued by these SPEs or the holders of the individual bonds, respectively, have the right to tender their interests for purchase by the Firm on specified dates at a specified price. The Firm often may have recourse to the underlying assets held by the SPEs in the event payments are required under such liquidity facilities, as well as make-whole or recourse provisions with the trust sponsors. The recourse amount often exceeds the maximum potential payout amount of the guarantee. Substantially all of the underlying assets in the SPEs are investment grade. Liquidity facilities provided to municipal tender option bond trusts are classified as derivatives. 
 Whole Loan Sales Guarantees. The Firm has provided, or otherwise agreed to be responsible for, representations and warranties regarding certain whole loan sales. Under certain circumstances, the Firm may be required to repurchase such assets or make other payments related to such assets if such representations and warranties are breached. The Firm s maximum potential payout related to such representations and warranties is equal to the current UPB of such loans. Since the Firm no longer services these loans, it has no information on the current UPB of those loans, and, accordingly, the amount included in the previous table represents the UPB at the time of the whole loan sale or at the time when the Firm last serviced any of those loans. The current UPB balances could be substantially lower than the maximum potential payout amount included in the previous table. The related liability primarily relates to sales of loans to the federal mortgage agencies. 
 Securitization Representations and Warranties. As part of the Firm s Institutional Securities business segment s securitizations and related activities, the Firm has provided, or otherwise agreed to be responsible for, representations and warranties regarding certain assets transferred in securitization transactions sponsored by the Firm. The extent and nature of the representations and warranties, if any, vary among different securitizations. Under certain circumstances, the Firm may be required to repurchase certain assets or make other payments related to such assets if such representations and warranties are breached. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Firm could be required to make would be equal to the current outstanding balances of, or losses associated with, the assets subject to breaches of such representations and warranties. The amount included in the

The Firm s legal expenses can, and may in the future, fluctuate from period to period, given the current environment regarding government investigations and private litigation affecting global financial services firms, including the Firm. 
 In many proceedings and investigations, however, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible or to estimate the amount of any loss. In addition, even where a loss is possible or an exposure to loss exists in excess of the liability already accrued with respect to a previously recognized loss contingency, it is not always possible to reasonably estimate the size of the possible loss or range of loss, particularly for proceedings and investigations where the factual record is being developed or contested or where plaintiffs or government entities seek substantial or indeterminate damages, restitution, disgorgement or penalties. Numerous issues may need to be resolved before a loss or additional loss, or range of loss or additional range of loss, can be reasonably estimated for a proceeding or investigation, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters, determination of issues related to class certification and the calculation of damages or other relief, and consideration of novel or unsettled legal questions relevant to the proceedings or investigations in question. 
 For certain other legal proceedings and investigations, the Firm can estimate reasonably possible losses, additional losses, ranges of loss or ranges of additional loss in excess of amounts accrued but does not believe, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that such losses could have a material adverse effect on the Firm s financial statements as a whole, other than the matter referred to in the following paragraph. 
 Tax 
 In matters styled Case number 15/3637 and Case number 15/4353 , the Dutch Tax Authority Dutch Authority is challenging in the Dutch courts the prior set-off by the Firm of approximately million (approximately million) plus accrued interest of withholding tax credits against the Firm s corporation tax liabilities for the tax years 2007 to 2012. The Dutch Authority alleges that the Firm was not entitled to receive the withholding tax credits on the basis, inter alia, that a Firm subsidiary did not hold legal title to certain securities subject to withholding tax on the relevant dates. The Dutch Authority has also alleged that the Firm failed to provide certain information to the Dutch Authority and to keep adequate books and records. On April 26, 2018, the District Court in Amsterdam issued a decision dismissing the Dutch Authority s claims with respect to certain of the tax years in dispute.

 Consolidated VIE assets and liabilities are presented in the previous tables after intercompany eliminations. Generally, most assets owned by consolidated VIEs cannot be removed unilaterally by the Firm and are not available to the Firm while the related liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are non-recourse to the Firm. However, in certain consolidated VIEs, the Firm either has the unilateral right to remove assets or provides additional recourse through derivatives such as total return swaps, guarantees or other forms of involvement. 
 In general, the Firm s exposure to loss in consolidated VIEs is limited to losses that would be absorbed on the VIE net assets recognized in its financial statements, net of amounts absorbed by third-party variable interest holders.

Additional VIE assets owned represents the carrying value of total exposure to non-consolidated VIEs for which the maximum exposure to loss is less than specific thresholds, primarily interests issued by securitization SPEs. The Firm s maximum exposure to loss generally equals the fair value of the assets owned. These assets are primarily included in Trading assets and Investment securities and are measured at fair value (see Note 5). The Firm does not provide additional support in these transactions through contractual facilities, guarantees or similar derivatives.

 Securitization Activities 
 In a securitization transaction, the Firm transfers assets (generally commercial or residential mortgage loans or securities) to an SPE, sells to investors most of the beneficial interests, such as notes or certificates, issued by the SPE, and, in many cases, retains other beneficial interests. The purchase of the transferred assets by the SPE is financed through the sale of these interests. 
 In many securitization transactions involving commercial mortgage loans, the Firm transfers a portion of the assets to the SPE with unrelated parties transferring the remaining assets. In addition, mainly in securitization transactions involving residential mortgage loans, the Firm may also enter into derivative transactions, primarily interest rate swaps or interest rate caps, with the SPE. 
 Although not obligated, the Firm generally makes a market in the securities issued by SPEs in securitization transactions. As a market maker, the Firm offers to buy these securities from, and sell these securities to, investors. Securities purchased through these market-making activities are not considered to be retained interests; these beneficial interests generally are included in Trading assets Corporate and other debt and are measured at fair value. 
 The Firm enters into derivatives, generally interest rate swaps and interest rate caps, with a senior payment priority in many securitization transactions. The risks associated with these and similar derivatives with SPEs are essentially the same as similar derivatives with non-SPE counterparties and are managed as part of the Firm s overall exposure. See Note 7 for further information on derivative instruments and hedging activities. 
 Investment Securities 
 The Firm holds securities issued by VIEs within the Investment securities portfolio. These securities are composed of those related to transactions sponsored by the federal mortgage agencies and predominantly the most senior 

securities issued by VIEs backed by student loans and commercial mortgage loans. Transactions sponsored by the federal mortgage agencies include an explicit or implicit guarantee provided by the U.S. government. Additionally, the Firm holds certain commercial mortgage-backed securities issued by VIEs retained as a result of the Firm's securitization activities. See Note 8 for further information on the Investment securities portfolio. 
 Municipal Tender Option Bond Trusts 
 In a municipal tender option bond trust transaction, the client transfers a municipal bond to a trust. The trust issues short-term securities that the Firm, as the remarketing agent, sells to investors. The client generally retains a residual interest. The short-term securities are supported by a liquidity facility pursuant to which the investors may put their short-term interests. In most programs, a third-party provider will provide such liquidity facility; in some programs, the Firm provides this liquidity facility. 
 The Firm may, in lieu of purchasing short-term securities for remarketing, decide to extend a temporary loan to the trust. The client can generally terminate the transaction at any time. The liquidity provider can generally terminate the transaction upon the occurrence of certain events. When the transaction is terminated, the municipal bond is generally sold or returned to the client. Any losses suffered by the liquidity provider upon the sale of the bond are the responsibility of the client. This obligation is generally collateralized. Liquidity facilities provided to municipal tender option bond trusts are classified as derivatives. The Firm consolidates any municipal tender option bond trusts in which it holds the residual interest. 
 Credit Protection Purchased through Credit-Linked Notes 
 CLN transactions are designed to provide investors with exposure to certain credit risk on referenced assets. In these transactions, the Firm transfers assets (generally high-quality securities or money market investments) to an SPE, enters into a derivative transaction in which the SPE sells protection on an unrelated referenced asset or group of assets, through a credit derivative, and sells the securities issued by the SPE to investors. In some transactions, the Firm may also enter into interest rate or currency swaps with the SPE. Depending on the structure, the assets and liabilities of the SPE may be consolidated and recognized in the Firm s balance sheet or accounted for as a sale of assets. 
 Upon the occurrence of a credit event related to the referenced asset, the SPE will deliver securities collateral as payment to the Firm, which exposes the Firm to changes in the collateral s value. 
 Derivative payments by the SPE are collateralized. The risks associated with these and similar derivatives with SPEs are essentially the same as those with non-SPE counterparties and are managed as part of the Firm s overall exposure.

SCB N/A G-SIB capital surcharge CCyB 1 
 Capital buffer requirement 
 1. The CCyB can be set up to but is currently set by the Federal Reserve at . 
 The capital buffer requirement represents the amount of Common Equity Tier 1 capital the Firm must maintain above the minimum risk-based capital requirements in order to avoid restrictions on the Firm s ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. The Firm s capital buffer requirement computed under the standardized approaches for calculating credit risk and market risk RWA Standardized Approach is equal to the sum of the SCB, G-SIB capital surcharge and CCyB, and the capital buffer requirement computed under the applicable advanced approaches for calculating credit risk, market risk and opeational risk RWA Advanced Approach is equal to the capital conservation buffer, G-SIB capital surcharge and CCyB. 
 Tier 1 capital ratio Total capital ratio 
 1. Required ratios represent the regulatory minimum plus the capital buffer requirement. 
 Risk-Weighted Assets 
 RWA reflects both the Firm s on- and off-balance sheet risk, as well as capital charges attributable to the risk of loss arising from the following: 
 Credit Risk: The failure of a borrower, counterparty or issuer to meet its financial obligations to the Firm; 
 Market Risk: Adverse changes in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity; and 
 Operational Risk: Inadequate or failed processes or systems from human factors or from external events e.g. , fraud, theft, legal and compliance risks, cyber attacks or damage to physical assets). 

The Firm s risk-based capital ratios are computed under both (i) the Standardized Approach and (ii) the Advanced Approach. The credit risk RWA calculations between the two approaches differ in that the Standardized Approach requires calculation of RWA using prescribed risk weights, whereas the Advanced Approach utilizes models to calculate exposure amounts and risk weights. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the differences between the actual and required ratio were lower under the Standardized Approach.

 U.S. Bank Subsidiaries Regulatory Capital and Capital Ratios 
 The OCC establishes capital requirements for the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, and evaluates their compliance with such capital requirements. Regulatory capital requirements for the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are calculated in a similar manner to the Firm s regulatory capital requirements, although G-SIB capital surcharge and SCB requirements do not apply to the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. 
 The OCC s regulatory capital framework includes Prompt Corrective Action PCA standards, including well-capitalized PCA standards that are based on specified regulatory capital ratio minimums. For the Firm to remain an

 Additionally, MSBNA is conditionally registered with the SEC as a security-based swap dealer and is provisionally registered with the CFTC as a swap dealer. However, as MSBNA is prudentially regulated as a bank, its capital requirements continue to be determined by the OCC. 

Excess net capital 
 MS Co. is registered as a broker-dealer and a futures commission merchant with the SEC and the CFTC, respectively, and provisionally registered as a swap dealer with the CFTC. 
 As an Alternative Net Capital broker-dealer, and in accordance with Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act Rule 15c3-1, Appendix E, MS Co. is subject to minimum net capital and tentative net capital requirements and operates with capital in excess of its regulatory capital requirements. As a futures commission merchant and provisionally-registered swap dealer, MS Co. is subject to CFTC capital requirements. In addition, MS Co. must notify the SEC if its tentative net capital falls below certain levels. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, MS Co. exceeded its net capital requirement and had tentative net capital in excess of the minimum and notification requirements. 
 Other Regulated Subsidiaries 
 The following subsidiaries are also subject to various regulatory capital requirements and operated with capital in excess of their respective regulatory capital requirements as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, as applicable: 
 MSSB, a registered U.S. broker-dealer and introducing broker for the futures business, is subject to, respectively, the minimum net capital requirements of the SEC and CFTC. 
 MSIP, a London-based broker-dealer subsidiary, is subject to the capital requirements of the PRA. MSIP is also conditionally registered with the SEC as a security-based swap dealer and provisionally registered with the CFTC as a swap dealer, but is currently complying with home-country capital requirements in lieu of SEC and CFTC capital requirements pursuant to applicable substituted compliance rules and interim no-action relief. 
 Morgan Stanley Europe Holdings SE Group MSEHSE Group ), including MSESE, a Germany-based broker-dealer, is subject to the capital requirements of the European Central Bank, BaFin and the German Central Bank. MSESE is also conditionally registered with the SEC as a security-based swap dealer and provisionally registered with the CFTC as a swap dealer. Pursuant to interim no-action relief, MSESE is currently complying with home-country capital requirements in lieu of CFTC capital requirements.

 Performance-Based Stock Units 
 PSUs will vest and convert to shares of common stock only if the Firm satisfies predetermined performance and market-based conditions over a performance period. The number of PSUs that will vest ranges from to of the target award, based on the extent to which the Firm achieves the specified performance goals. One-half of the award is earned based on either the Firm s average return on equity, excluding certain adjustments MS Adjusted ROE or for awards granted beginning in 2021, the Firm s average return on tangible common equity excluding certain adjustments MS Adjusted ROTCE ). The other half of the award will be earned based on the Firm s total shareholder return, relative to the total shareholder return of the S P 500 Financials Sector Index Relative MS TSR ). PSUs have vesting, restriction and cancellation provisions that are generally similar to those of RSUs. At December 31, 2022, approximately million PSUs were outstanding. 

Relative MS TSR 
 The Relative MS TSR fair values on the award date were estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation and the following assumptions. 
 2021 2020 
 The risk-free interest rate was determined based on the yields available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues. The expected stock price volatility was determined using historical volatility. The correlation coefficient was developed based on historical price data of the Firm and the S P 500 Financials Sector Index.

 The Firm generally amortizes into net periodic benefit expense (income) the unrecognized net gains and losses exceeding 10 of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. The U.S. pension plans amortize the unrecognized net gains and losses over the average life expectancy of participants. The remaining plans generally amortize the unrecognized net gains and losses and prior service credit over the average remaining service period of active participants. 

Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets Rate of future compensation increases 
 The accounting for pension plans involves certain assumptions and estimates. The expected long-term rate of return for the U.S. Qualified Plan was estimated by computing a weighted average of the underlying long-term expected returns based on the investment managers target allocations.

 The pension plans included in the table above may differ based on their funding status as of December 31 of each year. 
 Rate of future compensation increase 
 
 The discount rates used to determine the benefit obligation were selected by the Firm, in consultation with its independent actuary. The U.S. pension plans use a pension discount yield curve based on the characteristics of the plans, each determined independently. The pension discount yield curve represents spot discount yields based on duration implicit in a representative broad-based Aa-rated corporate bond universe of high-quality fixed income investments. For all non-U.S. pension plans, the assumed discount rates are based on the nature of liabilities, local economic environments and available bond indices.

 The U.S. Qualified Plan assets represent and of the Firm s total pension plan assets at December 31, 2022 and December 2021, respectively. The U.S. Qualified Plan uses a combination of active and risk-controlled fixed income investment strategies. The fixed income asset allocation consists primarily of fixed income securities and related derivative instruments designed to approximate the expected cash flows of the plan s liabilities to help reduce plan exposure to interest rate variation and to better align assets with the obligation. The longer-duration fixed income allocation is expected to help protect the plan s funded status and maintain the stability of plan contributions over the long run. The investment portfolio performance is assessed by comparing actual investment performance with changes in the estimated present value of the U.S. Qualified Plan s benefit obligation. 
 Derivative instruments are permitted in the U.S. Qualified Plan s investment portfolio only to the extent that they comply with all of the plan s investment policy guidelines and are consistent with the plan s risk and return objectives. 
 As a fundamental operating principle, any restrictions on the underlying assets apply to the respective derivative product. This includes percentage allocations and credit quality. Derivatives are used solely for the purpose of enhancing

 Transactions with Subsidiaries 
 The Parent Company has transactions with its consolidated subsidiaries determined on an agreed-upon basis and has guaranteed certain unsecured lines of credit and contractual obligations on certain of its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 Guarantees 
 In the normal course of its business, the Parent Company guarantees certain of its subsidiaries obligations on a transaction-by-transaction basis under various financial arrangements. The Parent Company has issued guarantees on behalf of its subsidiaries to various U.S. and non-U.S. exchanges and clearinghouses that trade and clear securities and/or futures contracts. Under these guarantee arrangements, the Parent Company may be required to pay the financial obligations of its subsidiaries related to business transacted on or with the exchanges and clearinghouses in the event of a subsidiary s default on its obligations to the exchange or the clearinghouse. The Parent Company has not recorded any contingent liability in its condensed financial statements for these arrangements and believes that any potential requirements to make payments under these arrangements are remote. 
 The Parent Company also, in the normal course of business, provides standard indemnities to counterparties on behalf of its subsidiaries for taxes, including U.S. and foreign withholding taxes, on interest and other payments made on derivatives, securities and stock lending transactions, and certain annuity products, and may also provide indemnities to or on behalf of affiliates from time to time for other arrangements. These indemnity payments could be required, as applicable, based on a change in the tax laws, change in interpretation of applicable tax rulings or claims arising from contractual relationships between affiliates. Certain contracts contain provisions that enable the Parent Company to terminate the agreement upon the occurrence of such events. The maximum potential amount of future payments that the Parent Company could be required to make under these indemnifications cannot be estimated. The Parent Company has not recorded any contingent liability in its condensed financial statements for these indemnifications and believes that the occurrence of any events that would trigger payments under these contracts is remote.

Under the amended and restated secured support agreement, in the event of a resolution scenario, the Parent Company would be obligated to contribute all of its contributable assets to its supported entities and/or the Funding IHC. The Funding IHC would be obligated to provide capital and liquidity, as applicable, to its supported entities. The obligations of the Parent Company and the Funding IHC under the amended and restated support agreement are in most cases secured on a senior basis by the assets of the Parent Company (other than shares in subsidiaries of the Parent Company and certain other assets) and the assets of the Funding IHC.

The Firm s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). 

The internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 
 Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Firm; 
 Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Firm s management and directors; and 
 Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Firm assets that could have a material effect on the Firm s financial statements.

Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 None. 
 
 Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections 
 Not applicable. 
 
 Unresolved Staff Comments 
 The Firm, like other well-known seasoned issuers, from time to time receives written comments from the staff of the SEC regarding its periodic or current reports under the Exchange Act. There are no comments that remain unresolved that the Firm received not less than 180 days before the end of the year to which this report relates that the Firm believes are material. 
 
 Properties 
 We have offices, operations and data centers located around the world. Our global headquarters and principal executive offices are located at 1585 Broadway, New York, New York. Our other principal offices include locations in Manhattan and the greater New York metropolitan area, London, Hong Kong and Tokyo. Our current facilities are adequate for our present and future operations for each of our business segments, although we may add regional offices, depending upon our future operations. 
 
 Legal Proceedings 
 
 In addition to the matters described below, in the normal course of business, the Firm has been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with its activities as a global diversified financial services institution. Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In some cases, the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or are in financial distress. These actions include, but are not limited to, antitrust claims, claims under various false claims act statutes, and matters arising from our sales and trading businesses, and our activities in the capital markets. 
 The Firm is also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by 

governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding the Firm s business, and involving, among other matters, sales, trading, financing, prime brokerage, market-making activities, investment banking advisory services, capital market activities, financial products or offerings sponsored, underwritten or sold by the Firm, wealth and investment management services, and accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, limitations on our ability to conduct certain business, or other relief. 
 The Firm contests liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter. Where available information indicates that it is probable a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the Firm can reasonably estimate the amount of that loss, the Firm accrues the estimated loss by a charge to income. The Firm s legal expenses can, and may in future, fluctuate from period to period, given the current environment regarding government investigations and private litigation affecting global financial services firms, including the Firm. 
 In many proceedings and investigations, however, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible or to estimate the amount of any loss. The Firm cannot predict with certainty if, how or when such proceedings or investigations will be resolved or what the eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief, if any, may be, particularly for proceedings and investigations where the factual record is being developed or contested or where plaintiffs or government entities seek substantial or indeterminate damages, restitution, disgorgement or penalties. Numerous issues may need to be resolved before a loss or additional loss or range of loss or additional range of loss can be reasonably estimated for a proceeding or investigation, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters, determination of issues related to class certification and the calculation of damages or other relief, and consideration of novel or unsettled legal questions relevant to the proceedings or investigations in question. Subject to the foregoing, the Firm believes, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that the outcome of such proceedings and investigations will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Firm, although the outcome of such proceedings or investigations could be material to the Firm s operating results and cash flows for a particular period depending on, among other things, the level of the Firm s revenues or income for such period. 
 While the Firm has identified below certain proceedings or investigations that the Firm believes to be material, individually or collectively, there can be no assurance that additional material losses will not be incurred from claims that have not yet been asserted or are not yet determined to be material. See also Contingencies Legal in Note 15 to the Financial Statements.

Because Morgan Stanley s certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting rights, the holders of a majority of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to be voted generally in the election of directors, which is referred to as the voting stock, represented at a meeting will be able to elect all the directors standing for election at the meeting.

Upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Morgan Stanley, the holders of the common stock will share pro rata in the assets remaining after payments to creditors and holders of any offered preferred stock and any other class or series of stock having preference over the common stock upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up that may be then outstanding. 
 Because Morgan Stanley is a holding company, its rights and the rights of holders of its capital stock, including the holders of its common stock, to participate in the distribution of assets of any of Morgan Stanley s subsidiaries upon the subsidiary s liquidation or recapitalization will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors and preferred shareholders, except to the extent Morgan Stanley may itself be a creditor with recognized claims against the subsidiary or a holder of preferred stock of the subsidiary.

 Morgan Stanley refers to the above series of preferred stock represented by depositary shares collectively as the Listed Preferred Stock. 
 The shares of each series of Listed Preferred Stock have been deposited under a deposit agreement for such series among Morgan Stanley, The Bank of New York Mellon, acting as depositary, which is referred to as the Preferred Stock Depositary, and the holders from time to time of depositary receipts issued under the agreement (each such deposit agreement, with respect to the series of Listed Preferred Stock to which it relates, a deposit agreement ). Subject to the terms of the deposit agreement, each holder of a depositary share will be entitled, in proportion to the fraction of a share of Listed Preferred Stock represented by that depositary share, to all the rights and preferences of the Listed Preferred Stock represented by that depositary share, including dividend, voting and liquidation rights. 
 The depositary shares are evidenced by depositary receipts issued under the deposit agreement. Depositary receipts are distributed to those persons purchasing the fractional shares of the related series of Listed Preferred Stock. Immediately following the issuance of shares of a series of Listed Preferred Stock, Morgan Stanley deposited those shares with the Preferred Stock Depositary, which then issued and delivered the depositary receipts to the purchasers. Depositary receipts have been and will only be issued evidencing whole depositary shares. A depositary receipt may evidence any number of whole depositary shares. 
 Dividends and Other Distributions . The Preferred Stock Depositary will distribute all cash dividends or other cash distributions received on the related series of Listed Preferred Stock to the record holders of depositary receipts relating to those series in proportion to the number of the depositary shares evidenced by depositary receipts those holders own. 
 If Morgan Stanley makes a distribution other than in cash, the Preferred Stock Depositary will distribute the property it receives to the record holders of depositary receipts in proportion to the number of depositary shares evidenced by depositary receipts those holders own, unless the Preferred Stock Depositary determines that the distribution cannot be made proportionately among those holders or that it is not feasible to make the distribution. In that event, the Preferred Stock Depositary may, with Morgan Stanley s approval, sell the property and distribute the net proceeds to the holders in proportion to the number of depositary shares evidenced by depositary receipts they own. 
 2 

The amount distributed to holders of depositary shares will be reduced by any amounts required to be withheld by Morgan Stanley or the Preferred Stock Depositary on account of taxes or other governmental charges. 
 Withdrawal of Stock . Upon surrender of the depositary receipts at the corporate trust office of the Preferred Stock Depositary and upon payment of the taxes, charges and fees provided for in the deposit agreement and compliance with any other requirement of the deposit agreement, the holder of the depositary shares evidenced by those depositary receipts is entitled to delivery of the number of whole shares of the related series of Listed Preferred Stock and all money or other property, if any, represented by those shares. Holders of depositary receipts representing any number of whole shares of Listed Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive whole shares of the related series of Listed Preferred Stock, but those holders of whole shares of Listed Preferred Stock will not thereafter be entitled to deposit those shares of Listed Preferred Stock with the Preferred Stock Depositary or to receive depositary shares therefor. If the depositary receipts delivered by the holder evidence a number of depositary shares in excess of the number representing whole shares of the related series of Listed Preferred Stock to be withdrawn, the Preferred Stock Depositary will deliver to the holder at the same time a new depositary receipt evidencing the excess number of depositary shares. 
 Voting the Listed Preferred Stock . Upon receiving notice of any meeting at which the holders of any series of the Listed Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, the Preferred Stock Depositary will mail the information contained in the notice of the meeting to the record holders of the depositary receipts relating to that series of Listed Preferred Stock. Each record holder of the depositary receipts on the record date, which will be the same date as the record date for the related series of Listed Preferred Stock, may instruct the Preferred Stock Depositary how to exercise his or her voting rights. The Preferred Stock Depositary will endeavor, insofar as practicable, to vote or cause to be voted the maximum number of whole shares of the Listed Preferred Stock represented by those depositary shares in accordance with those instructions received sufficiently in advance of the meeting, and Morgan Stanley will agree to take all reasonable action that may be deemed necessary by the Preferred Stock Depositary in order to enable the Preferred Stock Depositary to do so. The Preferred Stock Depositary will abstain from voting shares of the Listed Preferred Stock for which it does not receive specific instructions from the holder of the depositary shares representing them. 
 Redemption of Depositary Shares . Depositary shares will be redeemed from any proceeds received by the Preferred Stock Depositary resulting from the redemption, in whole or in part, of the series of the Listed Preferred Stock represented by those depositary shares. The redemption price per depositary share will equal the applicable fraction of the redemption price per share payable with respect to the series of the Listed Preferred Stock. If Morgan Stanley redeems shares of a series of Listed Preferred Stock held by the Preferred Stock Depositary, the Preferred Stock Depositary will redeem as of the same redemption date the number of depositary shares representing the shares of Listed Preferred Stock that it redeems. If less than all the depositary shares will be redeemed, the depositary shares to be redeemed will be selected by lot or substantially equivalent method determined by the Preferred Stock Depositary. 
 After the date fixed for redemption, the depositary shares called for redemption will no longer be deemed to be outstanding, and all rights of the holders of the depositary shares will cease, except the right to receive the monies payable and any other property to which the holders were entitled upon the redemption upon surrender to the Preferred Stock Depositary of the depositary receipts evidencing the depositary shares. Any funds deposited by Morgan Stanley with the Preferred Stock Depositary for any depositary shares that the holders fail to redeem will be returned to it after a period of two years from the date the funds are deposited. 
 Amendment and Termination of the Deposit Agreement . Morgan Stanley may amend the form of depositary receipt evidencing the depositary shares and any provision of the deposit agreement at any time and from time to time by agreement with the Preferred Stock Depositary. However, any amendment that materially and adversely alters the rights of the holders of depositary receipts will not be effective unless it has been approved by the holders of at least a majority of the depositary shares then outstanding, and no amendment may impair the right of any holder of any depositary receipts, described above under -Withdrawal of Stock, to receive shares of the related series of Listed Preferred Stock and any money or other property represented by those depositary shares, except in order to comply with mandatory provisions of applicable law. Morgan Stanley may terminate the deposit agreement at any time with at least 60 days prior written notice to the Preferred Stock Depositary. Within 30 days of the date of the notice, the Preferred Stock Depositary will deliver or make available for delivery to holders of depositary receipts, upon surrender of the depositary receipts evidencing the depositary shares and upon payment of any applicable taxes or governmental charges to be paid by the holders as described below, the number of whole shares of the related series of Listed Preferred Stock as are represented by the depositary receipts. The deposit agreement will automatically terminate after there has been a final distribution on the related series of Listed Preferred Stock in connection with any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Morgan Stanley and that distribution has been made to the holders of depositary shares. 
 Charges of Preferred Stock Depositary . Morgan Stanley will pay all transfer and other taxes and governmental charges arising solely from the existence of the depositary arrangements. Morgan Stanley will pay all charges of the Preferred Stock Depositary in connection with the initial deposit of the related series of Listed Preferred Stock, the 
 3 

initial issuance of the depositary shares, all withdrawals of shares of the related series of Listed Preferred Stock by holders of depositary shares and the registration of transfers of title to any depositary shares. However, holders of depositary shares will pay other transfer and other taxes and governmental charges and the other charges expressly provided in the deposit agreement to be for their accounts. 
 Limitation on Liability of Company and Preferred Stock Depositary . Neither the Preferred Stock Depositary nor Morgan Stanley will be liable if it is prevented or delayed by law, by any provision of Morgan Stanley s certificate of incorporation or of the depositary shares or by any circumstance beyond its control from performing its obligations under the deposit agreement. The obligations of Morgan Stanley and the Preferred Stock Depositary under the deposit agreement will be limited to performance with best judgment and in good faith of their duties thereunder, except that they will be liable for negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of their duties thereunder, and they will not be obligated to appear in, prosecute or defend any legal proceeding related to any depositary receipts, depositary shares or related series of Listed Preferred Stock unless satisfactory indemnity is furnished. 
 Corporate Trust Office of Preferred Stock Depositary . The address of the Preferred Stock Depositary s corporate trust office is 240 Greenwich Street, 7E, New York, New York 10286. The Preferred Stock Depositary will act as transfer agent, registrar and redemption agent for depositary receipts. 
 Resignation and Removal of Preferred Stock Depositary . The Preferred Stock Depositary may resign at any time by delivering to Morgan Stanley written notice of its election to do so, and Morgan Stanley may at any time remove the Preferred Stock Depositary. Any resignation or removal will take effect upon the appointment of a successor Preferred Stock Depositary. A successor must be appointed by Morgan Stanley within 60 days after delivery of the notice of resignation or removal and must be a bank or trust company having its principal office in the United States and a combined capital and surplus of at least 50,000,000. 
 Reports to Holders . Morgan Stanley will deliver all required reports and communications to holders of the Listed Preferred Stock to the Preferred Stock Depositary, and it will forward those reports and communications to the holders of depositary shares. 
 Inspection by Holders . Upon request, the Preferred Stock Depositary will provide for inspection to the holders of depositary shares the transfer books of the depositary and the list of holders of receipts provided that any requesting holder certifies to the Preferred Stock Depositary that such inspection is for a proper purpose reasonably related to such person s interest as an owner of depositary shares evidenced by the receipts.

The depositary shares representing the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series E Preferred Stock, the Series F Preferred Stock, the Series I Preferred Stock, the Series K Preferred Stock, the Series L Preferred Stock, the Series O Preferred Stock and the Series P Preferred Stock are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbols MS PA, MS PE, MS PF, MS PI, MS PK, MS PL, MS PO and MS PP, respectively.

If at any time Morgan Stanley has failed to pay accumulated dividends on any preferred stock that is senior to a series of Existing Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends, Morgan Stanley may not pay any dividends on the junior series of Existing Preferred Stock or redeem or otherwise repurchase any shares of the junior series of Existing Preferred Stock until it has paid in full, or set aside for payment, such accumulated but unpaid dividends on those senior shares. 
 Morgan Stanley will not declare or pay or set aside for payment, dividends for the latest dividend period on any series of offered preferred stock ranking on a parity as to payment of dividends with any series of Existing Preferred Stock, unless it also declares or pays or sets aside for payment the accrued dividends on the outstanding shares of such series for the latest dividend payment period. Morgan Stanley must declare, pay or set aside for payment any 
 5 

amounts on the offered preferred stock ratably in proportion to the respective amounts of unpaid dividends described in the preceding sentence. 
 Except as described above, and subject to some additional exceptions set forth in the relevant certificate of designations, unless Morgan Stanley has paid full accrued dividends on the outstanding shares of each series of Existing Preferred Stock for the latest dividend payment period with respect to each such series, Morgan Stanley may not during a divided period for any series 
 declare or pay a dividend or distribution on common stock or any preferred stock that ranks junior to such series as to dividend rights and as to rights on liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or 
 redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire Morgan Stanley s common stock or any preferred stock that ranks junior to, or, in the case of Series M Preferred Stock and Series N Preferred Stock, that ranks junior to or on a parity with, such series as to dividend rights and as to rights on liquidation, dissolution or winding up.

 Voting Rights . Holders of Existing Preferred Stock do not have any voting rights except as described below or as otherwise from time to time required by law. Whenever dividends on any series of Existing Preferred Stock have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of six or more dividend periods (or, for the Series M Preferred Stock and the Series N Preferred Stock, three semi-annual or six quarterly full dividend periods), whether or not consecutive, the authorized number of directors of Morgan Stanley shall be automatically increased by two and the holders of shares of Existing Preferred Stock, voting together as a class with holders of any and all other series of preferred stock having similar voting rights that are exercisable, will be entitled to elect two directors to fill such newly created directorships at Morgan Stanley s next annual meeting of stockholders (or at a special meeting called for that purpose prior to such next annual meeting) and at each subsequent annual meeting. These voting rights will continue for each series of Existing Preferred Stock until dividends on such shares have been fully paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of such dividends shall have been set aside for such payment) for at least four regular dividend periods (or, for the Series M Preferred Stock and the Series N Preferred Stock, the equivalent of two consecutive semi-annual dividend periods or four consecutive quarterly dividend periods) following the nonpayment. The term of office of all directors elected by the holders of preferred stock will terminate immediately upon the termination of the right of holders of preferred stock to vote for directors. 
 So long as any shares of Existing Preferred Stock remain outstanding, Morgan Stanley will not, without the consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of Existing Preferred Stock outstanding at the time, voting together as a single class with holders of any and all other series of preferred stock having similar voting rights that are exercisable 
 amend or alter any provision of Morgan Stanley s amended and restated certificate of incorporation or the certificate of designations of preferences and rights with respect to any series of the Existing Preferred Stock to authorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any class or series of stock ranking senior to any series of Existing Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up 
 amend, alter or repeal any provision of Morgan Stanley s amended and restated certificate of incorporation or the certificate of designations of preferences and rights with respect to any series of the Existing Preferred Stock if such amendment, alteration or repeal would cause a material and adverse effect with respect to the special rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of any Existing Preferred Stock, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise. For purposes of the preceding sentence any increase in the authorized amount of common stock or preferred stock or the creation and issuance of other series of Morgan Stanley s common stock or preferred stock ranking on a parity with or junior to the Existing Preferred Stock as to dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up will not be deemed to materially and adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of any Existing Preferred Stock or 
 consummate any binding share exchange or reclassification involving any series of Existing Preferred Stock, or merger or consolidation of Morgan Stanley with another entity, unless in each case (x) the shares of Existing Preferred Stock remain outstanding or are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, and (y) such shares remain outstanding or such preference securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Existing Preferred Stock immediately prior to such consummation, taken as a whole.

MSFL may create and issue additional notes with the same terms as previous issuances of Series A medium-term notes, so that the additional notes will be considered as part of the same issuance as the earlier notes. 
 The Notes are not deposits or savings accounts and are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency or instrumentality, nor are they obligations of, or guaranteed by, a bank. 
 The terms of the MSFL Senior Debt Indenture have been amended since the 2026 Notes were issued and those amendments do not apply to the 2026 Notes.

 General Terms of the 2026 Notes 
 In the below sections, all references to debt securities refer to Series A medium-term notes issued by MSFL under the MSFL Senior Debt Indenture. The following description of the terms of the debt securities contains certain general terms that may apply to the debt securities, including the 2026 Notes. 
 MSFL has summarized below the material provisions of the MSFL Senior Debt Indenture and the debt securities, including the guarantee of Morgan Stanley. These descriptions are only summaries, and each investor should refer to the MSFL Senior Debt Indenture and any applicable supplements thereto, which describe completely the terms and definitions summarized below and contain additional information regarding the debt securities. Where appropriate, MSFL uses parentheses to refer you to the particular sections of the MSFL Senior Debt Indenture. Any reference to particular sections or defined terms of the MSFL Senior Debt Indenture in any statement qualifies the entire statement and incorporates by reference the applicable section or definition into that statement. 
 Morgan Stanley Guarantee of Debt Securities Issued by MSFL 
 The payments due, including any property deliverable under any debt securities issued by MSFL, will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Morgan Stanley. If, for any reason, MSFL does not make any required payment in respect of any debt security issued by it when due, Morgan Stanley will cause the payment to be made at the same address at which MSFL is obligated to make such payment. MSFL has no independent operations beyond the issuance and administration of its securities and will have no independent assets available for distributions to holders of MSFL securities if they make claims in respect of the securities in a bankruptcy, resolution or similar proceeding. Accordingly, holders will have recourse only to a single claim against Morgan Stanley and its assets under the guarantee. Morgan Stanley s guarantees of the payments due on debt securities issued by MSFL will be unsecured senior obligations of Morgan Stanley. In addition, if MSFL were to merge with and into Morgan Stanley pursuant to the terms of the MSFL Senior Debt Indenture, the guarantee will terminate. 
 Indenture 
 The 2026 Notes are issued under the MSFL Senior Debt Indenture. 
 Covenants Restricting Pledges, Mergers and Other Significant Corporate Actions 
 Negative Pledge of Morgan Stanley . Because Morgan Stanley is a holding company, its assets consist primarily of the securities of its subsidiaries. The negative pledge provisions of the MSFL Senior Debt Indenture limit Morgan Stanley s ability to pledge some of these securities. The MSFL Senior Debt Indenture provides that Morgan Stanley will not, and will not permit any subsidiary to, create, assume, incur or guarantee any indebtedness for borrowed money that is secured by a pledge, lien or other encumbrance except for liens specifically permitted by such senior indenture on 
 10 

the voting securities of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC or any subsidiary succeeding to any substantial part of the business now conducted by any of those corporations, which are referred to collectively as the principal subsidiaries, or 
 the voting securities of a subsidiary that owns, directly or indirectly, the voting securities of any of the principal subsidiaries, other than directors qualifying shares, 
 without making effective provisions so that the guarantee issued under the MSFL Senior Debt Indenture will be secured equally and ratably with indebtedness so secured. 
 For these purposes, subsidiary means any corporation, partnership or other entity of which at the time of determination Morgan Stanley owns or controls directly or indirectly more than 50 of the shares of the voting stock or equivalent interest, and voting securities means stock of any class or classes having general voting power under ordinary circumstances to elect a majority of the board of directors, managers or trustees of the relevant subsidiary, other than stock that carries only the conditional right to vote upon the happening of an event, whether or not that event has happened. (MSFL Senior Debt Indenture, Section 13.10). 
 Merger or Consolidation of MSFL, as Issuer, or Morgan Stanley, as Guarantor, Under the MSFL Senior Debt Indenture . The MSFL Senior Debt Indenture provides that neither MSFL, as issuer, nor Morgan Stanley, as guarantor, will merge or consolidate with any other person, unless 
 MSFL or Morgan Stanley, as applicable, will be the continuing person or 
 the successor person by merger or consolidation to MSFL or Morgan Stanley, as applicable 
 will be a person organized under the laws of the United States, a state of the United States or the District of Columbia and 
 will expressly assume all of MSFL s or Morgan Stanley s obligations, as applicable, under the indenture and the debt securities or the guarantees, as applicable, issued under the indenture and 
 immediately after the merger or consolidation, MSFL, Morgan Stanley or that successor person, as the case may be, in its capacity as issuer or guarantor, as applicable, will not be in default in the performance of the covenants and conditions of the indenture applicable to it. (MSFL Senior Debt Indenture, Sections 9.01 and 13.11). 
 For the avoidance of doubt, the successor person referred to in this section may be Morgan Stanley or any subsidiary of Morgan Stanley. 
 Sale, Lease or Conveyance by MSFL, as Issuer, or Morgan Stanley, as Guarantor, Under the MSFL Senior Debt Indenture . The MSFL Senior Debt Indenture provides that neither MSFL, as issuer, nor Morgan Stanley, as guarantor, will sell, lease or convey all or substantially all of its assets to any other person, unless 
 the person that acquires all or substantially all of the assets of MSFL or of Morgan Stanley, as applicable 
 will be a person organized under the laws of the United States, a state of the United States or the District of Columbia and 
 will expressly assume all of MSFL s or Morgan Stanley s obligations, as applicable, under the indenture and the debt securities or the guarantees, as applicable, issued under the indenture and 
 immediately after the sale, lease or conveyance, that acquiring person, in its capacity as issuer or guarantor, as applicable, will not be in default in the performance of the covenants and conditions of the indenture applicable to it. (MSFL Senior Debt Indenture, Sections 9.01 and 13.11). 
 For the avoidance of doubt, the acquiring person referred to in this section may be Morgan Stanley or any subsidiary of Morgan Stanley. 
 Absence of Protections against All Potential Actions of the Issuer and the Guarantor . There are no covenants or other provisions in the MSFL Senior Debt Indenture that would afford holders of debt securities additional protection in the event of a recapitalization transaction, a change of control of the issuer or the guarantor, as applicable, or a highly leveraged transaction. The merger covenants described above would only apply if the recapitalization transaction, change of control or highly leveraged transaction were structured to include a merger or consolidation of the issuer or the guarantor, as applicable, or a sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the issuer or the guarantor, as applicable. 
 11 

Events of Default 
 The MSFL Senior Debt Indenture provides holders of debt securities with remedies if MSFL, as issuer, fails to perform specific obligations or if MSFL becomes bankrupt. The MSFL Senior Debt Indenture permits the issuance of debt securities in one or more series, and, in many cases, whether an event of default has occurred is determined on a series by series basis. 
 An event of default is defined under the MSFL Senior Debt Indenture, with respect to any series of debt securities issued by MSFL under that indenture, as being 
 default in payment of any principal of the debt securities of that series, either at maturity or upon any redemption, by declaration or otherwise 
 default for 30 days in payment of any interest on any debt securities of that series 
 default for 60 days after written notice in the observance or performance by MSFL of any covenant or agreement in the debt securities of that series or the indenture (other than a covenant or warranty with respect to the debt securities of that series the breach or nonperformance of which is otherwise included in the definition of event of default 
 events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of MSFL or 
 any other event of default provided in the supplemental indenture under which that series of debt securities is issued. (MSFL Senior Debt Indenture, Section 5.01). 
 The 2026 Notes do not have the benefit of any cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions with other indebtedness of MSFL or Morgan Stanley. In addition, under the MSFL Senior Debt Indenture, a covenant default by Morgan Stanley, as guarantor, or an event of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of Morgan Stanley, as guarantor, does not constitute an event of default . 
 Acceleration of Debt Securities upon an Event of Default. The MSFL Senior Debt Indenture provides that 
 if an event of default due to the default in payment of principal of, or any premium or interest on, any series of debt securities issued under that indenture, or due to the default in the performance or breach of any other covenant or warranty of the issuer applicable to the debt securities of that series but not applicable to all outstanding debt securities issued under that indenture occurs and is continuing, either the trustee or the holders of not less than 25 in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of each affected series, voting as one class, by notice in writing to the issuer and to the trustee, if given by security holders, may declare the principal of all debt securities of all affected series and interest accrued thereon to be due and payable immediately and 
 if an event of default due to a default in the performance of any other covenants or agreements of the issuer in that indenture applicable to all outstanding debt securities issued under that indenture or due to specified events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the issuer, occurs and is continuing, either the trustee or the holders of not less than 25 in aggregate principal amount of all outstanding debt securities issued under that indenture, voting as one class, by notice in writing to the issuer and to the trustee, if given by security holders, may declare the principal of all those debt securities and interest accrued thereon to be due and payable immediately. (MSFL Senior Debt Indenture, Section 5.01). 
 Notwithstanding these notice provisions, the holders of debt securities issued by MSFL and guaranteed by Morgan Stanley under the MSFL Senior Debt Indenture have no right to declare the principal of those debt securities and interest accrued thereon to be due and payable immediately if Morgan Stanley fails to observe or perform any covenant under such indenture or in the event of the bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of Morgan Stanley, as guarantor of such securities . 
 Annulment of Acceleration and Waiver of Defaults . The MSFL Senior Debt Indenture provides that 
 In some circumstances, if any and all events of default under that indenture, other than the non-payment of the principal of the securities that has become due as a result of an acceleration, have been cured, waived or otherwise remedied, then the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of all series of outstanding debt securities affected, voting as one class, may waive past defaults and rescind and annul past declarations of acceleration of the debt securities. (MSFL Senior Debt Indenture, Section 5.01). 
 Prior to the acceleration of any debt securities, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of all series of outstanding debt securities with respect to which an event of default has occurred and is continuing, voting as one class, may waive any past default or event of default, other than a default in the payment of principal or 
 12 

interest (unless such default has been cured and an amount sufficient to pay all matured installments of interest and principal due otherwise than by acceleration has been deposited with the trustee) or a default in respect of a covenant or provision in that indenture that cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the holder of each debt security affected. (MSFL Senior Debt Indenture, Section 5.10). 
 Indemnification of Trustee for Actions Taken on Your Behalf . The MSFL Senior Debt Indenture contains a provision entitling the trustee, subject to the duty of the trustee during a default to act with the required standard of care, to be indemnified by the holders of debt securities issued under that indenture before proceeding to exercise any trust or power at the request of holders. (MSFL Senior Debt Indenture, Section 6.02). Subject to these provisions and some other limitations, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of each series of outstanding debt securities of each affected series, voting as one class, may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the trustee. (MSFL Senior Debt Indenture, Section 5.09). 
 Limitation on Actions by You as an Individual Holder . The MSFL Senior Debt Indenture provides that no individual holder of debt securities may institute any action against the issuer or the guarantor under that indenture, except actions for payment of overdue principal and interest, unless the following actions have occurred 
 the holder must have previously given written notice to the trustee of the continuing default 
 the holders of not less than 25 in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of each affected series, treated as one class, must have (1) requested the trustee to institute that action and (2) offered the trustee reasonable indemnity 
 the trustee must have failed to institute that action within 60 days after receipt of the request referred to above and 
 the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of each affected series, voting as one class, must not have given directions to the trustee inconsistent with those of the holders referred to above. (MSFL Senior Debt Indenture, Sections 5.06 and 5.09). 
 Annual Certification . The MSFL Senior Debt Indenture contains a covenant that the issuer will file annually with the trustee a certificate of no default or a certificate specifying any default that exists. (MSFL Senior Debt Indenture, Section 3.05). 
 Discharge, Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance 
 The issuer or the guarantor has the ability to eliminate most or all of the obligations of the issuer and the guarantor on any series of debt securities prior to maturity if the issuer or the guarantor complies with the following provisions. (MSFL Senior Debt Indenture, Section 10.01). 
 Discharge of Indenture . If at any time the issuer has 
 paid or caused to be paid the principal of and interest on all of the outstanding debt securities in accordance with their terms (or the guarantor has done the same) 
 delivered to the trustee for cancellation all of the outstanding debt securities or 
 irrevocably deposited with the trustee cash or, in the case of a series of debt securities payable only in U.S. dollars, U.S. government obligations in trust for the benefit of the holders of any series of debt securities issued under that indenture that have either become due and payable, or are by their terms due and payable within one year or are scheduled for redemption within one year, in an amount certified to be sufficient to pay on each date that they become due and payable, the principal of and interest on, and any mandatory sinking fund payments for, those debt securities (or the guarantor has done the same) 
 and if, in any such case, the issuer or the guarantor also pays or causes to be paid all other sums payable by the issuer or the guarantor under the indenture with respect to the securities of such series, then that indenture shall cease to be of further effect with respect to the securities of such series, except as to certain rights and with respect to the transfer and exchange of securities, rights of the holders to receive payment and certain other rights and except that the deposit of cash or U.S. government obligations for the benefit of holders of a series of debt securities that are due and payable or are due and payable within one year or are scheduled for redemption within one year will discharge obligations under the indenture relating only to that series of debt securities. 
 Defeasance of a Series of Securities at Any Time . The issuer or the guarantor may also discharge all obligations of the issuer and the guarantor, other than as to transfers and exchanges, under any series of debt securities at any time, which is referred to as defeasance. 
 13 

The issuer and the guarantor, may be released with respect to any outstanding series of debt securities from the obligations imposed by Section 13.10 and Section 13.11 and Section 9.01, which sections contain the covenants described above limiting liens and consolidations, mergers, asset sales and leases, and elect not to comply with those sections without creating an event of default or a default. Discharge under those procedures is called covenant defeasance. 
 Defeasance or covenant defeasance may be effected only if, among other things 
 The issuer or the guarantor irrevocably deposits with the trustee cash or, in the case of debt securities payable only in U.S. dollars, U.S. government obligations, as trust funds in an amount certified to be sufficient to pay on each date that they become due and payable or a combination of the above sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on, and any mandatory sinking fund payments for, all outstanding debt securities of the series being defeased. 
 The issuer or the guarantor delivers to the trustee an opinion of counsel to the effect that 
 the beneficial owners of the series of debt securities being defeased will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the defeasance or covenant defeasance and 
 the defeasance or covenant defeasance will not otherwise alter those beneficial owners U.S. federal income tax treatment of principal and interest payments on the series of debt securities being defeased. 
 In the case of a defeasance, but not in the case of covenant defeasance, this opinion must be based on a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service or a change in U.S. federal income tax law occurring after the date of this prospectus, since that result would not occur under current tax law. 
 Modification of the MSFL Senior Debt Indenture 
 Modifications Without Consent of Holders . The issuer, the guarantor and the trustee may enter into supplemental indentures without the consent of the holders of debt securities issued under a particular indenture to 
 secure any debt securities (and to secure the guarantee of any debt securities securities)

The mutilated debt securities must be delivered to the trustee, the paying agent and the registrar, in the case of registered debt securities, or satisfactory evidence of the destruction, loss or theft of the debt securities must be delivered to the issuer, the guarantor, the paying agent, the registrar, in the case of registered debt securities, and the trustee.

 Global Medium-Term Notes, Series A, Floating Rate Notes Due 2029 
 MSFL issued the 2029 Notes in an aggregate principal amount of 15,001,000. The 2029 Notes were issued in minimum denominations of 1,000 and integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof. The 2029 Notes will mature on June 27, 2029. As of December 31, 2022, 15,001,000 in aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes was outstanding. 
 Listing 
 The 2029 Notes are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol MS 29. 
 Interest Payments 
 The 2029 Notes bear interest at a variable rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Spread, subject to the Minimum Interest Rate. 
 Base Rate. The Secured Overnight Financing Rate (compounded daily over a quarterly Interest Payment Period in accordance with the specific formula described under -How Interest Is Calculated below) compounded SOFR ). As further described below, (i) in determining the Base Rate for a U.S. government securities business day, the Base Rate generally will be the rate in respect of such day that is provided on the following U.S. government securities business day and (ii) in determining the Base Rate for any other day, such as a Saturday, Sunday or 
 15 

holiday, the Base Rate generally will be the rate in respect of the immediately preceding U.S. government securities business day that is provided on the following U.S. government securities business day. 
 Index Maturity. Daily. 
 Spread. Plus 1.375 (to be added to the accrued interest compounding factor for an Interest Payment Period). 
 Minimum Interest Rate. 0.10 per annum. 
 Index Currency. U.S. Dollars. 
 Interest Payment Periods. Quarterly. With respect to an Interest Payment Date, the period from and including the second most recent Interest Payment Period End-Date (or from and including the original issue date in the case of the first Interest Payment Period) to but excluding the immediately preceding Interest Payment Period End-Date provided that (i) the Interest Payment Period with respect to the final Interest Payment Date (i.e., the maturity date) will be the period from and including the second-to-last Interest Payment Period End-Date to but excluding the maturity date (the final Interest Payment Period End-Date) and (ii) with respect to such final Interest Payment Period, the level of SOFR for each calendar day in the period from and including the Rate Cut-Off Date to but excluding the maturity date shall be the level of SOFR in respect of such Rate Cut-Off Date. 
 Interest Payment Period End-Dates. Each March 27, June 27, September 27 and December 27, commencing September 2022 and ending on the maturity date provided that if any scheduled Interest Payment Period End-Date, other than the maturity date, falls on a day that is not a business day, it will be postponed to the following business day. If the scheduled final Interest Payment Period End-Date for the notes (i.e., the maturity date) falls on a day that is not a business day, the payment of principal and interest will be made on the next succeeding business day, but interest on that payment will not accrue during the period from and after the scheduled final Interest Payment Period End-Date. 
 Interest Payment Dates . The second business day following each Interest Payment Period End-Date provided that the Interest Payment Date with respect to the final Interest Payment Period will be the maturity date. If the scheduled maturity date falls on a day that is not a business day, the payment of principal and interest will be made on the next succeeding business day, but interest on that payment will not accrue during the period from and after the scheduled maturity date. 
 Rate Cut-Off Date . The second U.S. government securities business day prior to the maturity date. 
 How Interest Is Calculated . Accrued interest on the 2029 Notes will be calculated by multiplying the principal amount of the 2029 Notes by an accrued interest factor. This accrued interest factor will be computed by adding the interest factors calculated for each day in the Interest Payment Period for which interest is being paid. The interest factor for each day is computed by dividing the interest rate applicable to that day by 360. The interest rate applicable to a given day is the sum of the accrued interest compounding factor plus the Spread. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the interest rate payable for any Interest Payment Period be less than the Minimum Interest Rate. 
 On each Interest Payment Date, accrued interest will be paid for the most recently completed Interest Payment Period. Interest on the 2029 Notes will accrue from and including the most recent Interest Payment Period End-Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, or if no interest has been paid or duly provided for, from and including the original issue date. Interest will accrue to but excluding the next Interest Payment Period End-Date. 
 The calculation agent will notify the paying agent of each determination of the interest rate applicable to the 2029 Notes promptly after the determination is made. 
 With respect to any Interest Payment Period, the accrued interest compounding factor means the rate of return of a daily compound interest investment computed in accordance with the following formula (with the resulting percentage rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with 0.000005 being rounded upwards to 0.00001) 
 
 16 

d 0 , for any Interest Payment Period, is the number of U.S. Government Securities Business Days in the relevant Interest Payment Period. 
 i is a series of whole numbers from one to d 0 , each representing the relevant U.S. Government Securities Business Days in chronological order from, and including, the first U.S. Government Securities Business Day in the relevant Interest Payment Period. 
 SOFR i , for any day i in the relevant Interest Payment Period, is a reference rate equal to SOFR in respect of that day. 
 n i is the number of calendar days in the relevant Interest Payment Period on which the rate is SOFR i . 
 d is the number of calendar days in the relevant Interest Payment Period. 
 For these calculations, the interest rate in effect on any U.S. Government Securities Business Day will be the applicable rate as reset on that date. The interest rate applicable to any other day is the interest rate from the immediately preceding U.S. Government Securities Business Day. 
 Acceleration Amount in Case of an Event of Default. In case an event of default with respect to the 2029 Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the amount declared due and payable per note upon any acceleration of the 2029 Notes shall be determined by the calculation agent, after consultation with the issuer, and shall be an amount in cash equal to the Stated Principal Amount plus accrued and unpaid interest calculated as if the date of such acceleration were the maturity date, final Interest Payment Period End-Date (if applicable) and final Interest Payment Date. 
 Determination of SOFR 
 The 2029 Notes will bear interest at the interest rate specified above. That interest rate will be based on SOFR with the Index Maturity specified above. 
 SOFR means, with respect to any U.S. Government Securities Business Day 
 (1) the Secured Overnight Financing Rate in respect of such U.S. Government Securities Business Day as provided by the New York Federal Reserve, as the administrator of such rate (or a successor administrator) on the New York Federal Reserve s Website on or about 5 00 p.m. (New York time) on the U.S. Government Securities Business Day immediately following such U.S. Government Securities Business Day or 
 (2) if the Secured Overnight Financing Rate in respect of such U.S. Government Securities Business Day does not appear as specified in paragraph (1), unless both a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate in respect of the last U.S. Government Securities Business Day for which such rate was published on the New York Federal Reserve s Website or 
 (3) if a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred

 General Terms of the 2029 Notes 
 In the below sections, all references to debt securities refer to Series A medium-term notes issued by MSFL under the MSFL Senior Debt Indenture. The following description of the terms of the debt securities contains certain general terms that may apply to the debt securities, including the 2029 Notes. 
 MSFL has summarized below the material provisions of the MSFL Senior Debt Indenture and the debt securities, including the guarantee of Morgan Stanley. These descriptions are only summaries, and each investor should refer to the MSFL Senior Debt Indenture and any applicable supplements thereto, which describe completely the terms and definitions summarized below and contain additional information regarding the debt securities. Where appropriate, MSFL uses parentheses to refer you to the particular sections of the MSFL Senior Debt Indenture. Any reference to particular sections or defined terms of the MSFL Senior Debt Indenture in any statement qualifies the entire statement and incorporates by reference the applicable section or definition into that statement. 
 Morgan Stanley Guarantee of Debt Securities Issued by MSFL 
 The payments due, including any property deliverable under any debt securities issued by MSFL, will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Morgan Stanley. If, for any reason, MSFL does not make any required payment 
 19 

in respect of any debt security issued by it when due, Morgan Stanley will cause the payment to be made at the same address at which MSFL is obligated to make such payment. MSFL has no independent operations beyond the issuance and administration of its securities and will have no independent assets available for distributions to holders of MSFL securities if they make claims in respect of the securities in a bankruptcy, resolution or similar proceeding. Accordingly, holders will have recourse only to a single claim against Morgan Stanley and its assets under the guarantee. Morgan Stanley s guarantees of the payments due on debt securities issued by MSFL will be unsecured senior obligations of Morgan Stanley. In addition, if MSFL were to merge with and into Morgan Stanley pursuant to the terms of the MSFL Senior Debt Indenture, the guarantee will terminate. 
 Indenture 
 The 2029 Notes are issued under the MSFL Senior Debt Indenture. 
 Covenants Restricting Pledges, Mergers and Other Significant Corporate Actions 
 Negative Pledge of Morgan Stanley . Because Morgan Stanley is a holding company, its assets consist primarily of the securities of its subsidiaries. The negative pledge provisions of the MSFL Senior Debt Indenture limit Morgan Stanley s ability to pledge some of these securities. The MSFL Senior Debt Indenture provides that Morgan Stanley will not, and will not permit any subsidiary to, create, assume, incur or guarantee any indebtedness for borrowed money that is secured by a pledge, lien or other encumbrance except for liens specifically permitted by such senior indenture on 
 the voting securities of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC or any subsidiary succeeding to any substantial part of the business now conducted by any of those corporations, which are referred to collectively as the principal subsidiaries, or 
 the voting securities of a subsidiary that owns, directly or indirectly, the voting securities of any of the principal subsidiaries, other than directors qualifying shares, 
 without making effective provisions so that the guarantee issued under the MSFL Senior Debt Indenture will be secured equally and ratably with indebtedness so secured. 
 For these purposes, subsidiary means any corporation, partnership or other entity of which at the time of determination Morgan Stanley owns or controls directly or indirectly more than 50 of the shares of the voting stock or equivalent interest, and voting securities means stock of any class or classes having general voting power under ordinary circumstances to elect a majority of the board of directors, managers or trustees of the relevant subsidiary, other than stock that carries only the conditional right to vote upon the happening of an event, whether or not that event has happened. (MSFL Senior Debt Indenture, Section 13.10). 
 Merger or Consolidation of MSFL, as Issuer, or Morgan Stanley, as Guarantor, Under the MSFL Senior Debt Indenture . The MSFL Senior Debt Indenture provides that neither MSFL, as issuer, nor Morgan Stanley, as guarantor, will merge or consolidate with any other person, unless 
 MSFL or Morgan Stanley, as applicable, will be the continuing person or 
 the successor person by merger or consolidation to MSFL or Morgan Stanley, as applicable 
 will be a person organized under the laws of the United States, a state of the United States or the District of Columbia and 
 will expressly assume all of MSFL s or Morgan Stanley s obligations, as applicable, under the indenture and the debt securities or the guarantees, as applicable, issued under the indenture and 
 immediately after the merger or consolidation, MSFL, Morgan Stanley or that successor person, as the case may be, in its capacity as issuer or guarantor, as applicable, will not be in default in the performance of the covenants and conditions of the indenture applicable to it. (MSFL Senior Debt Indenture, Sections 9.01 and 13.11). 
 For the avoidance of doubt, the successor person referred to in this section may be Morgan Stanley or any subsidiary of Morgan Stanley. 
 Sale, Lease or Conveyance by MSFL, as Issuer, or Morgan Stanley, as Guarantor, Under the MSFL Senior Debt Indenture . The MSFL Senior Debt Indenture provides that neither MSFL, as issuer, nor Morgan Stanley, as guarantor, will sell, lease or convey all or substantially all of its assets to any other person (other than the sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all of Morgan Stanley s assets to one or more of Morgan Stanley s subsidiaries), unless 
 20 

the person that acquires all or substantially all of the assets of MSFL or of Morgan Stanley, as applicable 
 will be a person organized under the laws of the United States, a state of the United States or the District of Columbia and 
 will expressly assume all of MSFL s or Morgan Stanley s obligations, as applicable, under the indenture and the debt securities or the guarantees, as applicable, issued under the indenture and 
 immediately after the sale, lease or conveyance, that acquiring person, in its capacity as issuer or guarantor, as applicable, will not be in default in the performance of the covenants and conditions of the indenture applicable to it. (MSFL Senior Debt Indenture, Sections 9.01 and 13.11). 
 For the avoidance of doubt, the acquiring person referred to in this section may be Morgan Stanley or any subsidiary of Morgan Stanley. 
 For the avoidance of doubt, the sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all of MSFL s or Morgan Stanley s assets to one or more of Morgan Stanley s subsidiaries is not subject to any restrictions under the MSFL Senior Debt Indenture. 
 Absence of Protections against All Potential Actions of the Issuer and the Guarantor . There are no covenants or other provisions in the MSFL Senior Debt Indenture that would afford holders of debt securities additional protection in the event of a recapitalization transaction, a change of control of the issuer or the guarantor, as applicable, or a highly leveraged transaction. The merger covenants described above would only apply if the recapitalization transaction, change of control or highly leveraged transaction were structured to include a merger or consolidation of the issuer or the guarantor, as applicable, or a sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the issuer or the guarantor, as applicable. 
 Events of Default 
 The MSFL Senior Debt Indenture provides holders of debt securities with remedies if MSFL, as issuer, fails to perform specific obligations or if MSFL becomes bankrupt. The MSFL Senior Debt Indenture permits the issuance of debt securities in one or more series, and, in many cases, whether an event of default has occurred is determined on a series by series basis. 
 An event of default is defined under the MSFL Senior Debt Indenture, with respect to any series of debt securities issued by MSFL under that indenture, as being 
 default for 30 days in payment of any principal of the debt securities of that series, either at maturity or upon any redemption, by declaration or otherwise 
 default for 30 days in payment of any interest on any debt securities of that series 
 events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of MSFL or 
 any other event of default provided in the supplemental indenture under which that series of debt securities is issued. (MSFL Senior Debt Indenture, Section 5.01). 
 The 2029 Notes do not have the benefit of any cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions with other indebtedness of MSFL or Morgan Stanley. 
 In the case of a default in payment of any principal or any interest with respect to the debt securities issued under the MSFL Senior Debt Indenture, there will only be an event of default, and therefore a right of acceleration, if such default continues for a period of 30 days. In addition, under the MSFL Senior Debt Indenture, a covenant default by Morgan Stanley, as guarantor, or an event of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of Morgan Stanley, as guarantor, does not constitute an event of default . 
 Acceleration of Debt Securities upon an Event of Default. The MSFL Senior Debt Indenture provides that 
 if an event of default due to the default in payment of principal of, or any premium or interest on, any series of debt securities issued under that indenture occurs and is continuing, either the trustee or the holders of not less than 25 in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of each affected series, voting as one class, by notice in writing to the issuer and to the trustee, if given by security holders, may declare the principal of all debt securities of all affected series and interest accrued thereon to be due and payable immediately and 
 21 

if an event of default due to specified events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the issuer, occurs and is continuing, either the trustee or the holders of not less than 25 in aggregate principal amount of all outstanding debt securities issued under that indenture, voting as one class, by notice in writing to the issuer and to the trustee, if given by security holders, may declare the principal of all those debt securities and interest accrued thereon to be due and payable immediately. (MSFL Senior Debt Indenture, Section 5.01). 
 There will be no event of default, and therefore no right of acceleration, in the case of a default in the performance of any covenant or obligation with respect to the debt securities issued under the MSFL Senior Debt Indenture (other than a covenant or warranty which is specifically dealt with above). If any such default occurs and is continuing, the trustee may pursue legal action to enforce the performance of any provision in the indenture to protect the rights of the trustee and the holders of the debt securities issued under such indenture. (MSFL Senior Debt Indenture, Section 5.04). 
 Annulment of Acceleration and Waiver of Defaults . The MSFL Senior Debt Indenture provides that 
 In some circumstances, if any and all events of default under that indenture, other than the non-payment of the principal of the securities that has become due as a result of an acceleration, have been cured, waived or otherwise remedied, then the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of all series of outstanding debt securities affected, voting as one class, may waive past defaults and rescind and annul past declarations of acceleration of the debt securities. (MSFL Senior Debt Indenture, Section 5.01). 
 Prior to the acceleration of any debt securities, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of all series of outstanding debt securities with respect to which an event of default or a covenant breach has occurred and is continuing, voting as one class, may waive any past default or event of default or any past covenant breach, other than a default in the payment of principal or interest (unless such default has been cured and an amount sufficient to pay all matured installments of interest and principal due otherwise than by acceleration has been deposited with the trustee) or a default in respect of a covenant or provision in that indenture that cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the holder of each debt security affected. (MSFL Senior Debt Indenture, Section 5.10). 
 Indemnification of Trustee for Actions Taken on Your Behalf . The MSFL Senior Debt Indenture contains a provision entitling the trustee, subject to the duty of the trustee during a default to act with the required standard of care, to be indemnified by the holders of debt securities issued under that indenture before proceeding to exercise any trust or power at the request of holders. (MSFL Senior Debt Indenture, Section 6.02). Subject to these provisions and some other limitations, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of each series of outstanding debt securities of each affected series, voting as one class, may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the trustee. (MSFL Senior Debt Indenture, Section 5.09). 
 Limitation on Actions by You as an Individual Holder . The MSFL Senior Debt Indenture provides that no individual holder of debt securities may institute any action against the issuer or the guarantor under that indenture, except actions for payment of overdue principal and interest, unless the following actions have occurred 
 the holder must have previously given written notice to the trustee of the continuing default 
 the holders of not less than 25 in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of each affected series, treated as one class, must have (1) requested the trustee to institute that action and (2) offered the trustee reasonable indemnity 
 the trustee must have failed to institute that action within 60 days after receipt of the request referred to above and 
 the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of each affected series, voting as one class, must not have given directions to the trustee inconsistent with those of the holders referred to above. (MSFL Senior Debt Indenture, Sections 5.06 and 5.09). 
 Annual Certification . The MSFL Senior Debt Indenture contains a covenant that the issuer will file annually with the trustee a certificate of no default or a certificate specifying any default that exists. (MSFL Senior Debt Indenture, Section 3.05). 
 Discharge, Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance 
 The issuer or the guarantor has the ability to eliminate most or all of the obligations of the issuer and the guarantor on any series of debt securities prior to maturity if the issuer or the guarantor complies with the following provisions. (MSFL Senior Debt Indenture, Section 10.01). 
 22 

Discharge of Indenture . If at any time the issuer has 
 paid or caused to be paid the principal of and interest on all of the outstanding debt securities in accordance with their terms (or the guarantor has done the same) 
 delivered to the trustee for cancellation all of the outstanding debt securities or 
 irrevocably deposited with the trustee cash or, in the case of a series of debt securities payable only in U.S. dollars, U.S. government obligations in trust for the benefit of the holders of any series of debt securities issued under that indenture that have either become due and payable, or are by their terms due and payable within one year or are scheduled for redemption within one year, in an amount certified to be sufficient to pay on each date that they become due and payable, the principal of and interest on, and any mandatory sinking fund payments for, those debt securities (or the guarantor has done the same) 
 and if, in any such case, the issuer or the guarantor also pays or causes to be paid all other sums payable by the issuer or the guarantor under the indenture with respect to the securities of such series, then that indenture shall cease to be of further effect with respect to the securities of such series, except as to certain rights and with respect to the transfer and exchange of securities, rights of the holders to receive payment and certain other rights and except that the deposit of cash or U.S. government obligations for the benefit of holders of a series of debt securities that are due and payable or are due and payable within one year or are scheduled for redemption within one year will discharge obligations under the indenture relating only to that series of debt securities. 
 Defeasance of a Series of Securities at Any Time . The issuer or the guarantor may also discharge all obligations of the issuer and the guarantor, other than as to transfers and exchanges, under any series of debt securities at any time, which is referred to as defeasance. 
 The issuer and the guarantor, may be released with respect to any outstanding series of debt securities from the obligations imposed by Section 13.10 and Section 13.11 and Section 9.01, which sections contain the covenants described above limiting liens and consolidations, mergers, asset sales and leases, and elect not to comply with those sections without creating an event of default, covenant breach or a default. Discharge under those procedures is called covenant defeasance. 
 Defeasance or covenant defeasance may be effected only if, among other things 
 The issuer or the guarantor irrevocably deposits with the trustee cash or, in the case of debt securities payable only in U.S. dollars, U.S. government obligations, as trust funds in an amount certified to be sufficient to pay on each date that they become due and payable or a combination of the above sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on, and any mandatory sinking fund payments for, all outstanding debt securities of the series being defeased. 
 The issuer or the guarantor delivers to the trustee an opinion of counsel to the effect that 
 the beneficial owners of the series of debt securities being defeased will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the defeasance or covenant defeasance and 
 the defeasance or covenant defeasance will not otherwise alter those beneficial owners U.S. federal income tax treatment of principal and interest payments on the series of debt securities being defeased. 
 In the case of a defeasance, but not in the case of covenant defeasance, this opinion must be based on a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service or a change in U.S. federal income tax law occurring after the date of this prospectus, since that result would not occur under current tax law. 
 Modification of the MSFL Senior Debt Indenture 
 Modifications Without Consent of Holders . The issuer, the guarantor and the trustee may enter into supplemental indentures without the consent of the holders of debt securities issued under a particular indenture to 
 secure any debt securities (and to secure the guarantee of any debt securities securities)

The mutilated debt securities must be delivered to the trustee, the paying agent and the registrar, in the case of registered debt securities, or satisfactory evidence of the destruction, loss or theft of the debt securities must be delivered to the issuer, the guarantor, the paying agent, the registrar, in the case of registered debt securities, and the trustee. At the expense of the holder, an indemnity that is satisfactory to the issuer, the guarantor, the principal paying agent, the registrar, in the case of registered debt securities, and the trustee may be required before a replacement debt security will be issued.

 Year Long-Term Incentive Program Award 
 Award Certificate 
 
 Morgan Stanley has awarded you a year long-term incentive program award LTIP Award as an incentive for you to remain in Employment and provide services to the Firm. This Award Certificate sets forth the general terms and conditions of your year LTIP Award. Your year LTIP Award consists of a Target Award of performance stock units. The number of performance stock units comprising the Target Award has been communicated to you independently. 
 Your LTIP Award is made pursuant to the Plan. References to performance stock units and units (which terms are used interchangeably) in this Award Certificate mean only those performance stock units included in your year LTIP Award, and the terms and conditions herein apply only to such award. If you receive any other award under the Plan or another equity compensation plan, it will be governed by the terms and conditions of the applicable award documentation, which may be different from those herein. 
 The purpose of your LTIP Award is, among other things, to align your interests with the interests of the Firm and Morgan Stanley s stockholders, to reward you for your continued Employment and service to the Firm in the future and your compliance with the Firm s policies (including the Code of Conduct), to protect the Firm s interests in non-public, confidential and or proprietary information, products, trade secrets, customer relationships, and other legitimate business interests, and to ensure an orderly transition of responsibilities. In view of these purposes, the number of performance stock units that you earn will depend on the Company s performance during the Performance Period. Moreover, you will earn your LTIP Award only if you (1) remain in continuous Employment through the Scheduled Vesting Date (subject to limited exceptions set forth below), (2) do not engage in any activity that is a cancellation event set forth in Section 10(c) below and (3) satisfy obligations you owe to the Firm as set forth in Section 12 below. Even if your LTIP Award has vested, you will have no right to your award if a cancellation event occurs under the circumstances set forth in Section 10(c) below. As Morgan Stanley deems appropriate, Morgan Stanley will require you to provide a written certification or other evidence, from time to time in its sole discretion, to confirm that no cancellation event has occurred, including upon a termination of Employment and or during a specified period of time prior to the Scheduled Conversion Date. If you fail to timely provide any required certification or other evidence, Morgan Stanley will cancel your award. It is your responsibility to provide the Executive Compensation Department with your up-to-date contact information. 
 Capitalized terms used in this Award Certificate that are not defined in the text have the meanings set forth in Section 23 below. Capitalized terms used in this Award Certificate that are not defined in the text or in Section 23 below have the meanings set forth in the Plan. 
 1. Performance stock units generally . 
 Each performance stock unit included in your LTIP Award corresponds to one share of Morgan Stanley common stock. A performance stock unit constitutes a contingent and unsecured promise of Morgan Stanley to pay you one share of Morgan Stanley common stock on the conversion date for the unit. As the holder of the LTIP Award, you have only the rights of a 
 2 

general unsecured creditor of Morgan Stanley. You will not be a stockholder with respect to the shares of Morgan Stanley common stock corresponding to your performance stock units unless and until such units convert to shares. 
 2. Performance measures . 1 
 The portion, if any, of your LTIP Award that you earn will be based on Morgan Stanley performance against the performance measures set forth in this Section 2 and the other terms and conditions of this Award Certificate, and may vary from zero to 1.5 times the number of performance stock units included in the Target Award. In no event will the aggregate multiplier exceed 1.0 if MS ROTCE (excluding any of the specified adjustments) over the Performance Period is less than 9 . 
 (a) Morgan Stanley s Return on Equity Return on Tangible Common Equity . One-half of the Target Award will be earned based on MS ROE ROTCE . The number of performance stock units that you earn (subject to vesting and the other terms and conditions of your award) based on MS ROE ROTCE will be determined by multiplying the number of performance stock units representing one-half of the Target Award by a multiplier determined as follows 
 MS ROE ROTCE Multiplier or more Less than 0.00 
 If MS ROE ROTCE is between two thresholds, then the multiplier will be obtained by straight-line interpolation between the two thresholds. If MS ROE ROTCE is less than , you will not earn any portion of your LTIP Award as a result of the MS ROE ROTCE measure, and one-half of the Target Award will be canceled. 
 (b) Relative Total Shareholder Return Relative Return on Tangible Common Equity . One-half of the Target Award will be earned based on Morgan Stanley s Total Shareholder Return MS ROTCE as compared to the Total Shareholder Return of each member of the Index Group ROTCE of each member of the Comparison Group . The number of performance stock units that you earn (subject to vesting and the other terms and conditions of your award) based on Morgan Stanley s TSR as compared to the TSR of the Index Group will be determined by (i) subtracting the Index Group TSR from Morgan Stanley s TSR Relative TSR and (ii) MS ROTCE (excluding any of the specified adjustments) over the Performance Period as compared to the ROTCE of each member of the Comparison Group, as reported in each firm s most recently filed Form 10-K (or equivalent annual report) for each fiscal year during the Performance Period Relative ROTCE will be determined by multiplying the number of performance stock units representing one-half of the Target Award by a multiplier determined as follows provided that , in no event shall the 
 
 1 The performance measures presented in this form of Award Certificate are indicative. The performance measures applicable to awards may vary. 
 3 

Relative TSR multiplier exceed 1.00 if Morgan Stanley s TSR for the Performance Period is negative 
 Relative TSR ROTCE Multiplier or more Less than 0.00 
 If the Relative TSR ROTCE is between the thresholds, then the multiplier will be obtained by straight-line interpolation between the two points. 
 In the event that any member of the Comparison Group is involved in any event that results in such member ceasing to be traded on a national exchange at any time during the Performance Period or in the event that the Compensation, Management Development and Succession Committee (the Committee determines, in its sole discretion, that a change in circumstances of a member of the Comparison Group during the Performance Period would cause the inclusion of such entity in the Comparison Group to no longer be appropriate, including, but not limited to, the disposition of or exit from a material business segment, withdrawal from or entry into a geographical region, or a material change in the entity s business or revenue mix, then, in each case, such entity shall be removed as a member of the Comparison Group. 
 (c) Equitable Adjustments. If an event occurs with respect to Morgan Stanley that renders, in the sole determination of the Committee, any of the performance measures set forth in Section 2(a) or Section 2(b) to no longer be appropriate, then the Committee shall equitably adjust the calculation of such measures, as it deems appropriate in its sole discretion, to maintain the intended economics and to carry out the intent of the original terms of your LTIP Award provided that, with respect to a member of the Comparison Group s ROTCE, such adjustment shall only be based on publicly reported information. For example, in the event of any unusual or non-recurring event affecting MS ROE ROTCE , either positively or negatively, including but not limited to, any gain or loss associated with any acquisition, divestiture or similar event or changes in regulatory regimes, taxation, legislation or accounting principles or accounting standard or any change in applicable tax, legal or regulatory requirements or accounting methods, practices or policies , the Committee shall make equitable adjustments as it deems appropriate in its sole discretion, to MS ROE ROTCE and any other provision of your LTIP Award. 
 3. Vesting and conversion . 
 (a) Vesting schedule. 2 Except as otherwise provided in this Award Certificate, you will vest in the portion of your LTIP Award that is earned in accordance with Section 2 on the Scheduled Vesting Date. Except as otherwise provided in this Award Certificate, such portion of your LTIP Award will vest only if you continue to provide future services to the Firm by remaining in continuous Employment through the Scheduled Vesting Date and providing value added services to the Firm during this timeframe. The special vesting terms set forth in Sections 5, 6 and 7 of this Award Certificate apply (i) if your Employment terminates by reason of your death or Disability, (ii) upon your Full Career Retirement, (iii) if the Firm terminates your employment in an involuntary termination under the circumstances described in Section 6 or (iv) upon a Governmental Service Termination. Any veste 
 
 2 The vesting schedule and vesting date presented in this form of Award Certificate are indicative. The vesting schedule and vesting date applicable to awards may vary. 
 4 

d portion of your LTIP Award remains subject to the cancellation and withholding provisions set forth in this Award Certificate. 
 (b) Conversion. 3 Except as otherwise provided in this Award Certificate, your LTIP Award, to the extent earned and vested, will convert to shares of Morgan Stanley common stock on the Scheduled Conversion Date, with any fractional shares to be distributed in cash. The special conversion provisions set forth in Sections 5(a), 5(b) and 7 of this Award Certificate apply (i) if your Employment terminates by reason of your death or your death occurs after termination of your Employment or (ii) upon your Governmental Service Termination or your employment at a Governmental Employer following your termination of employment with the Firm under circumstances set forth in Section 7(b). 
 No portion of your LTIP Award will convert to shares of Morgan Stanley common stock following the end of the Performance Period until the Committee certifies the extent to which the performance criteria set forth in Section 2 have been satisfied. 
 The shares delivered upon conversion of your LTIP Award pursuant to this Section 3(b) will not be subject to any transfer restrictions, other than those that may arise under the securities laws, the Firm s policies or Section 12 below, or to cancellation under the circumstances set forth in Section 10(c), but will be subject to repayment as set forth in Section 3(c). 
 (c) Repayment Recapture. In the event and to the extent the Committee reasonably determines that the performance certified by the Committee, and on the basis of which your LTIP Award was converted to shares of Morgan Stanley common stock, was based on materially inaccurate financial statements or other performance metric criteria, you will be obligated to repay to the Firm 
 (1) the number of shares that were delivered upon conversion of your LTIP Award, less the number of shares that would have been delivered had your LTIP Award converted to shares based on accurate financial statements or other performance metric criteria (such number of shares determined in each case by the Committee and before satisfaction of tax or other withholding obligations pursuant to Section 11) (the Repayment Shares provided , however , that to the extent that any of the Repayment Shares have been transferred, you shall repay to the Firm an amount equal to the number of Repayment Shares so transferred multiplied by the fair market value, determined using a valuation methodology established by Morgan Stanley, of Morgan Stanley common stock on the date your LTIP Award converted to shares of Morgan Stanley common stock plus 
 (2) any dividend equivalents that were paid on the Repayment Shares when your LTIP Award converted to shares plus 
 (3) interest on the amounts described in the preceding clauses (1) and (2) at the average rate of interest Morgan Stanley paid to borrow money from financial institutions during the period from the date of such conversion through the date preceding the repayment date. 
 
 3 The conversion schedule and conversion date presented in this form of Award Certificate are indicative. The conversion schedule and conversion date applicable to awards may vary. 
 5 

For the avoidance of doubt, your LTIP Award will not be deemed earned if payment of such award is based on materially inaccurate financial statements or other performance metric criteria. 
 (d) Accelerated conversion. Morgan Stanley shall have no right to accelerate the conversion of any portion of your LTIP Award or the payment of any of your dividend equivalents, except to the extent that such acceleration is not prohibited by Section 409A and would not result in your being required to recognize income for United States federal income tax purposes before your LTIP Award converts to shares of Morgan Stanley common stock or your dividend equivalents are paid or your incurring additional tax or interest under Section 409A. If your LTIP Award converts to shares of Morgan Stanley common stock or any dividend equivalents are paid prior to the Scheduled Conversion Date pursuant to this Section 3(d), these shares or dividend equivalents may not be transferable and may remain subject to applicable vesting, cancellation and withholding provisions, as determined by Morgan Stanley. 
 (e) Rule of construction for timing of conversion . Whenever this Award Certificate provides for your LTIP Award to convert to shares, or your dividend equivalents to be paid, on the Scheduled Conversion Date or upon a different specified event or date, such conversion or payment will be considered to have been timely made, and neither you nor any of your beneficiaries or your estate shall have any claim against the Firm for damages based on a delay in conversion of your LTIP Award (or delivery of Morgan Stanley shares following conversion) or payment of your dividend equivalents, as applicable, and the Firm shall have no liability to you (or to any of your beneficiaries or your estate) in respect of any such delay, as long as conversion or payment, as applicable, is made by December 31st of the year in which occurs the Scheduled Conversion Date or such other specified event or date or, if later, by the 15th day of the third calendar month following such specified event or date, or, in connection with any such conversion due to death, to the extent permissible under Section 409A, by the end of the calendar year following the year of your death. Similarly, neither you nor any of your beneficiaries or your estate shall have any claim against the Firm for damages, and the Firm shall have no liability to you (or to any of your beneficiaries or your estate), based on any acceleration of the conversion of your LTIP Award or payment of your dividend equivalents pursuant to Section 3(d), as applicable. 
 
 4. Dividend equivalent payments . 
 If Morgan Stanley pays a regular or ordinary dividend on its common stock, you will be credited with a dividend equivalent with respect to your LTIP Award to the extent it is outstanding on the dividend record date in an amount equal to the amount of the dividend that would have been paid on a number of shares of Morgan Stanley common stock corresponding to the Target Award. Morgan Stanley will credit the dividend equivalents when it pays the corresponding dividend on its common stock. Your dividend equivalents will vest and be paid in cash at the same time as, and subject to the same vesting and cancellation provisions set forth in this Award Certificate with respect to, your LTIP Award provided that, subject to Section 3(e), the dividend equivalents may be paid following the date on which the LTIP Award converts to shares of Morgan Stanley common stock on the next administratively practicable payroll date). The amount of dividend equivalents paid to you will be based on the number of performance stock units that actually convert to shares and will be paid only if your LTIP Award converts to shares. 
 In the event your LTIP Award is canceled in full on or before the Scheduled Conversion Date, all dividend equivalents credited to you in respect of regular or ordinary 
 6 

dividends will be canceled. No dividend equivalents will be paid to you on any portion of your LTIP Award that is canceled. 
 The decision to pay a dividend and, if so, the amount of any such dividend, is determined by Morgan Stanley in its sole discretion. 
 5. Death, Disability and Full Career Retirement . 
 The following special earning, vesting and payment terms apply to your LTIP Award 
 (a) Death during Employment. If your death occurs while Employed, then the number of performance stock units that will vest, and the number of shares of Morgan Stanley common stock the beneficiary you have designated pursuant to Section 14 or the legal representative of your estate, as applicable, will receive as of the date of your death, will be determined by multiplying (i) the number of shares earned based on the performance measures set forth in Section 2 but applied as though the Performance Period ended with the last Morgan Stanley quarter ending simultaneously with or before the date of your death, for which the respective Form 10-K or Form 10-Q has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC as of the date of your death by (ii) the Pro Ration Fraction, provided that your beneficiary or estate notifies the Firm of your death within 60 days following your death provided further , that if your death occurs on or following the Scheduled Vesting Date, then your beneficiary or estate, as applicable, will receive shares (if any) in an amount and at such time that you would have received such shares had your death not occurred provided further , if your death occurs prior to the filing of the Form 10-K for the first year of the Performance Period, then your beneficiary or estate, as applicable, will receive as of the date of your death a number of shares determined by multiplying (i) the number of shares earned based on a 1.0x multiplier by (ii) the Pro Ration Fraction . For example, if your death occurs following the end of Morgan Stanley s third quarter (but prior to the end of the fourth quarter) of the second year of the Performance Period and the Form 10-Q has not been filed with the SEC by Morgan Stanley for such quarter, the performance measures will be applied as though the Performance Period ended with Morgan Stanley s second quarter provided Morgan Stanley has filed the Form 10-Q for such quarter with the SEC). 
 After your death, the cancellation provisions set forth in Section 10(c) will no longer apply. The shares delivered upon conversion of your LTIP Award pursuant to this Section 5(a) will not be subject to any transfer restrictions (other than those that may arise under the securities laws or the Firm s policies) but will be subject to repayment as set forth in Section 3(c). 
 (b) Death after termination of Employment. If your death occurs following your termination of Employment as a result of your Disability, Full Career Retirement or an involuntary termination not involving any cancellation event and your LTIP Award was not canceled in connection with your termination or thereafter, then the number of performance stock units that will vest, and the number of shares of Morgan Stanley common stock the beneficiary you have designated pursuant to Section 14 or the legal representative of your estate, as applicable, will receive as of the date of your death, will be determined by multiplying (i) the number of shares that would have been delivered to you based on applying the performance measures set forth in Section 2 as though the Performance Period ended with the last Morgan Stanley quarter ending simultaneously with or before the date of your death for which the respective Form 10-K or Form 10-Q has been filed with the SEC as of the date of your death by (ii) the Pro Ration Fraction determined upon your termination of Employment, provided that your beneficiary or estate notifies the Firm of your death within 60

The cancellation and withholding provisions set forth in this Award Certificate will continue to apply until the Scheduled Conversion Date. 
 (d) Full Career Retirement. 
 (1) If your Employment terminates in a termination that satisfies the definition of Full Career Retirement, and other than due to your death or Governmental Service Termination, then subject to any transfer restrictions and the cancellation provisions described herein, and provided that, in the event of an involuntary termination, you sign an agreement and release satisfactory to the Firm, you will vest in a number of performance stock units, and receive a number of shares of Morgan Stanley common stock on the Scheduled Conversion Date, equal to the number of shares that would have been delivered to you, based on the performance measures set forth in Section 2, had you remained in Employment through the Scheduled Conversion Date. The cancellation and withholding provisions set forth in this Award Certificate will continue to apply until the Scheduled Conversion Date.
