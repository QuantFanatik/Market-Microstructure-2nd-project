 ITEM 1117 OF REGULATION AB. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 The Sponsor and the Servicer 
 
 The sponsor is subject to various pending and potential legal and regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including litigation, arbitration, claims, investigations, examinations, subpoenas and enforcement proceedings. Some litigation against the sponsor could take the form of class actions. The outcome of these proceedings is inherently uncertain, and thus the sponsor cannot confidently predict how or when proceedings will be resolved. An adverse outcome in one or more of these proceedings could result in substantial damages, settlements, fines, penalties, diminished income or reputational harm to the sponsor, and could materially and adversely affect the interests of the noteholders or the servicer s ability to perform its duties under the Transaction Documents. 
 
 The Trustee and the Trust Collateral Agent 
 
 In December 2014, Phoenix Light SF Limited and certain related entities and the National Credit Union Administration filed complaints in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Wells Fargo, alleging claims against Wells Fargo in its capacity as trustee for a number of residential mortgage-backed securities trusts. Complaints raising similar allegations have been filed by Commerzbank AG in the Southern District of New York and by IKB International and IKB Deutsche Industriebank in New York state court. In each case, the plaintiffs allege that Wells Fargo, as trustee, caused losses to investors, and plaintiffs assert causes of action based upon, among other things, the trustee s alleged failure to notify and enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations and warranties, notify investors of alleged events of default, and abide by appropriate standards of care following alleged events of default. Wells Fargo previously settled two class action lawsuits with similar allegations that were filed in November 2014 and December 2016 by institutional investors in the Southern District of New York and New York state court, respectively. 
 
 In addition to the foregoing cases, in August 2014 and August 2015 Nomura Credit & Capital Inc., or Nomura, and Natixis Real Estate Holdings, LLC, or Natixis, filed a total of seven third-party complaints against Wells Fargo in New York state court. In the underlying first-party actions, Nomura and Natixis have been sued for alleged breaches of representations and warranties made in connection with residential mortgage-backed securities sponsored by them. In the third-party actions, Nomura and Natixis allege that Wells Fargo, as master servicer, primary servicer or securities administrator, failed to notify Nomura and Natixis of their own breaches, failed to properly oversee the primary servicers, and failed to adhere to accepted 

servicing practices. Natixis additionally alleges that Wells Fargo failed to perform default oversight duties. Wells Fargo has asserted counterclaims alleging that Nomura and Natixis failed to provide Wells Fargo notice of their representation and warranty breaches. 
 
 With respect to each of the foregoing litigations, Wells Fargo believes the plaintiffs claims are without merit and intends to contest the claims vigorously, but there can be no assurances as to the outcome of the litigations or the possible impact of the litigations on Wells Fargo or the related RMBS trusts.

ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA 
 Computershare Corporate Trust- ABS Platform 
 
 The management Management of the Computershare Corporate Trust division of Computershare Trust Company, National Association (the Company is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management has determined that the servicing criteria are applicable to the servicing platform for the period as follows 
 Purchase of corporate trust business . On November 1, 2021, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Wells Fargo and certain of its affiliates sold substantially all of its Corporate Trust Services CTS division to the Company, Computershare Delaware Trust Company CDTC ), and Computershare Limited Computershare Limited , and collectively with the Company and CDTC, Computershare ). Virtually all CTS employees of Wells Fargo, along with most existing CTS systems, technology, and offices transferred to Computershare as part of the sale. 
 For the ABS Platform (defined below) transactions and during the Period, the Company either (i) served directly in the related trustee (except Delaware trustee or owner trustee), paying agent services, and or related services, (collectively, the ABS Platform Roles ), or (ii) served as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related ABS Platform Roles. More specifically, since its acquisition of the Wells Fargo CTS business on November 1, 2021, the Company has closed new ABS transactions for which, during all or a portion of the Period, it performed the related ABS Platform Roles directly (the Company s Direct Role Transactions ). The Company s Direct Role Transactions comprise a small percentage of the overall ABS Platform transactions. For a significant majority of ABS Platform transactions, the Company served, during all or a portion of the Period, as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related ABS Platform Roles (the Company s Agent Role Transactions ). Wells Fargo had not, as of the beginning of the Period, transferred to Computershare the ABS Platform Roles for the Company s Agent Role Transactions, and therefore the Company performed, during all or a portion of the Period, virtually all of Wells Fargo s contractual duties for such transactions as its agent. As a result, for the Company s Agent Role Transactions, the Company and Wells Fargo have determined that the Company is a party participating in the servicing function with respect to the ABS Platform, and accordingly, the Company is taking responsibility for assessing its compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria (defined below) relevant to the servicing activities performed by the Company for the ABS Platform, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. 
 Period As of January 1, 2022 through and including December 31, 2022 (the Period ). 
 Platform The platform consists of asset-backed securities ABS transactions for which the Company provides trustee (except Delaware trustee or owner trustee), paying agent services, and or related services, either directly in the related role for such services or as the agent of the party performing such services, and for which either (i) some or all of the issued securities for such ABS transactions were publicly offered pursuant to a registration statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (ii) the issued securities for such ABS transactions were privately offered pursuant to an exemption from registration and the Company (and or the party for whom it acts as agent) has an obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB provided however that, the platform excludes (a) any transactions for which the securities issued are mortgage-backed securities or mortgage-related asset-backed securities and (b) any ABS transactions for which the issuing entity has a fiscal year that ends on a date other than the end of the calendar year (the ABS Platform ). Appendix A identifies the individual transactions defined by Management as constituting the ABS Platform for the Period. 

Applicable Servicing Criteria All servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are applicable to either the Company s obligations, or the obligations of the party for whom the Company ultimately acts as agent, in either case under the related transaction agreements with respect to the ABS Platform for the Period (as applicable, the Company s Obligations ), except for the following servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(v), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(B), 1122(d)(3)(i)(C), 1122(d)(3)(i)(D), 1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(v), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii), 1122(d)(4)(viii), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii), 1122(d)(4)(xiii), and 1122(d)(4)(xiv), which Management has determined are not applicable to the Company s Obligations in the related transaction agreements with respect to the ABS Platform for the Period provided however that, with respect to the ABS Platform (a) servicing criterion 1122(d)(3)(i)(A) is applicable only as it relates to the Company s Obligation to distribute or make available to investors, in accordance with the timeframes set forth in the transaction agreements, the relevant investor reports received by the Company from the entity preparing such reports (b) servicing criterion 1122(d)(3)(ii) is applicable only as it relates to the Company s Obligation to make remittances to investors in accordance with the transaction agreements and (c) servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable only as it relates to the Company s Obligation to obtain an Officer s Certificate from the servicer and report any additions, removals and substitutions to investors on the relevant investor report, in each case, in accordance with the transaction agreements (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ). 
 Third parties classified as vendors With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(2)(vi), the Company has engaged a vendor for certain transactions in the ABS Platform to handle making payments to investors and or third parties by check, and such vendor also safeguards any unissued checks. Management has determined that the vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and Management elects to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the portion of the servicing criterion applicable to the vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation C&DI 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C&DI 200.06 . The Company has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor s activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criterion applicable to the vendor. Management is solely responsible for determining that the Company meets the SEC requirements to apply C&DI 200.06 for the vendor and the related servicing criterion. 
 With respect to the ABS Platform and the Period, Management provides the following assessment of the Company s compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria 
 1. Management is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 
 2. Management has assessed the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria including the servicing criterion for which compliance is determined based on C&DI 200.06 as described above. In performing this assessment, Management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. 
 3. With respect to Applicable Servicing Criteria 1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(xv), Management has determined that there were no activities performed during the Period with respect to the ABS Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities. 
 4. Based on such assessment for the Period, the Company has complied in all material respects with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Period.

 AmeriCredit Financial Services, Inc. 
 
 We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management s Assertion Regarding Compliance with SEC Regulation AB Servicing Criteria, that AmeriCredit Financial Services, Inc. (the Company) complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the publicly issued consumer auto loan and lease asset-backed securities transactions for which the Company acted as servicer involving consumer auto loans and leases (the Platform as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 except for 1122 (d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii), 1122(d)(4)(xiii), and 1122(d)(4)(xv) which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities performed by them with respect to the servicing platform covered by this report. See Appendix B of management s assertion for the asset backed transactions covered by this platform. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 
 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than all of the individual asset backed transactions and securities that comprise the platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities related to the Platform and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria and as permitted by Regulation AB Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations of the Division of Corporation Finance, Section 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C&DI 200.06). Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

We are required to be independent of AmeriCredit Financial Services, Inc. and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements related to our examination engagement. 
 
 Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 
 
 As described in management s assertion, for servicing criteria 1122 (d)(2)(i), 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(ii) and 1122 (d)(4)(iv), the Company has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria. The Company has determined that these vendors are not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by C&DI 200.06. As permitted by C&DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C&DI 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s eligibility to apply C&DI 200.06. 
 
 In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB, including servicing criteria 1122 (d)(2)(i), 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(ii) and 1122 (d)(4)(iv) for which compliance is determined based on C&DI 200.06 as described above, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 for the Platform, is fairly stated, in all material respects.
