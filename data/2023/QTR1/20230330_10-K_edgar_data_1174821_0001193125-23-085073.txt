Item 1117 of Regulation AB: Legal Proceedings. 
 Litigation Regarding JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association 
 A number of lawsuits seeking class action certification have been filed in both state and federal courts against JPMorgan Chase Bank. These lawsuits challenge
certain policies and practices of JPMorgan Chase Bank s credit card business. A few of these lawsuits have been conditionally certified as class actions. JPMorgan Chase Bank has defended itself against claims in the past and intends to continue
to do so in the future. While it is impossible to predict the outcome of any of these lawsuits, JPMorgan Chase Bank believes that any liability that might result from any of these lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on the credit card
receivables. Industry Litigation Groups of
merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of
antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the cases for a cash payment, but that settlement was reversed on appeal and remanded to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (the District Court ).
 The original class action was divided into two separate actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other seeking primarily injunctive relief.
In September 2018, the parties to the monetary class action finalized an agreement which amends and supersedes the prior settlement agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants collectively contributed an additional 900 million to
the approximately 5.3 billion previously held in escrow from the original settlement. In December 2019, the amended settlement agreement was approved by the District Court. Certain merchants appealed the District Court s approval order,
and in March 2023, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed that approval order. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended class settlement, 700 million has been returned to the defendants from the
settlement escrow in accordance with the settlement agreement. The injunctive class action continues separately, and in September 2021, the District Court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification in part, and denied the motion in
part. Of the merchants who opted out of the amended damages class settlement, certain merchants filed individual actions raising similar allegations
against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against JPMorgan Chase Bank and other banks. While some of those actions remain pending, the defendants have reached settlements with the merchants who opted out representing over half of the combined
Mastercard-branded and Visa-branded payment card sales volume. Litigation Regarding Wells Fargo Bank, National Association 
 In December 2014, Phoenix Light SF Limited Phoenix Light and certain related entities filed a complaint in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York alleging claims against Wells Fargo Bank, National Association Wells Fargo Bank ), in its capacity as trustee for a number of residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS trusts. Complaints
raising similar allegations have been filed by Commerzbank AG in the Southern District of New York and by IKB International and IKB Deutsche Industriebank in New York state court. In each case, the plaintiffs allege that Wells Fargo Bank, as
trustee, caused losses to investors, and plaintiffs assert causes of action based upon, among other things, the trustee s alleged failure to notify and enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of
representations and warranties, notify investors of alleged events of default, and abide by appropriate standards of care following alleged events of default. In July 2022, the district court dismissed Phoenix Light s claims and certain of the
claims asserted by Commerzbank AG, and subsequently entered judgment in each case in favor of Wells Fargo Bank. In August 2022, Phoenix Light and Commerzbank AG appealed the district court s decision to the United States Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit. The Company previously settled two class actions filed by institutional investors and an action filed by the National Credit Union Administration with similar allegations. In addition, Park Royal I LLC and Park Royal II LLC have
filed substantially similar lawsuits in New York state court alleging Wells Fargo Bank, as trustee, failed to take appropriate actions upon learning of defective mortgage loan documentation.

Appendix B to the Company s Assessment of Compliance with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria Wells Fargo s transfer of its roles on the ABS Platform transactions to Computershare is ongoing. As of the beginning of the Period,
Wells Fargo has not transferred to Computershare the roles associated with its trustee (except Delaware trustee or owner trustee), paying agent services, and/or related services, and the duties, rights, and liabilities for such roles, under the
relevant agreements for any of the ABS Platform transactions. During the Period, for all the ABS Platform transactions, Wells Fargo engaged Computershare as a subservicer 1 to perform virtually all
of Wells Fargo s obligations under the transaction agreements. As a result, the Company has determined that Computershare is a party participating in the servicing function with respect to the ABS Platform and the applicable servicing criteria
relevant to the servicing activities performed by Computershare for the ABS Platform (the Computershare Applicable Servicing Criteria ). Accordingly, Computershare is taking, and Wells Fargo is not taking, responsibility for
assessing Computershare s compliance with the Computershare Applicable Servicing Criteria for the ABS Platform, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022.

 ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA 
 Computershare Corporate Trust- ABS Platform The management Management of the Computershare Corporate Trust division of Computershare Trust Company, National Association (the Company is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management has determined that the servicing criteria are applicable to the servicing platform for the period as follows: 
 Purchase of corporate trust business . On November 1, 2021, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Wells Fargo and certain of its affiliates
sold substantially all of its Corporate Trust Services CTS division to the Company, Computershare Delaware Trust Company CDTC ), and Computershare Limited Computershare Limited , and
collectively with the Company and CDTC, Computershare ). Virtually all CTS employees of Wells Fargo, along with most existing CTS systems, technology, and offices transferred to Computershare as part of the sale. 
 For the ABS Platform (defined below) transactions and during the Period, the Company either (i) served directly in the related trustee (except Delaware
trustee or owner trustee), paying agent services, and/or related services, (collectively, the ABS Platform Roles ), or (ii) served as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related ABS Platform Roles. More specifically,
since its acquisition of the Wells Fargo CTS business on November 1, 2021, the Company has closed new ABS transactions for which, during all or a portion of the Period, it performed the related ABS Platform Roles directly (the
 Company s Direct Role Transactions ). The Company s Direct Role Transactions comprise a small percentage of the overall ABS Platform transactions. For a significant majority of ABS Platform transactions, the Company
served, during all or a portion of the Period, as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related ABS Platform Roles (the Company s Agent Role Transactions ). Wells Fargo had not, as of the beginning of the Period,
transferred to Computershare the ABS Platform Roles for the Company s Agent Role Transactions, and therefore the Company performed, during all or a portion of the Period, virtually all of Wells Fargo s contractual duties for such
transactions as its agent. As a result, for the Company s Agent Role Transactions, the Company and Wells Fargo have determined that the Company is a party participating in the servicing function with respect to the ABS Platform, and
accordingly, the Company is taking responsibility for assessing its compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria (defined below) relevant to the servicing activities performed by the Company for the ABS Platform, as of and for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2022. Period : As of January 1, 2022 through and including December 31, 2022 (the Period ).
 Platform : The platform consists of asset-backed securities ABS transactions for which the Company provides trustee (except
Delaware trustee or owner trustee), paying agent services, and/or related services, either directly in the related role for such services or as the agent of the party performing such services, and for which either (i) some or all of the issued
securities for such ABS transactions were publicly offered pursuant to a registration statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (ii) the issued securities for such ABS transactions were privately offered pursuant to
an exemption from registration and the Company (and/or the party for whom it acts as agent) has an obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of
Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform excludes (a) any transactions for which the securities issued are mortgage-backed securities or mortgage-related asset-backed securities and (b) any ABS transactions for which the issuing
entity has a fiscal year that ends on a date other than the end of the calendar year (the ABS Platform ). Appendix A identifies the individual transactions defined by Management as constituting the ABS Platform for the
Period. 

Applicable Servicing Criteria : All servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are applicable to
either the Company s obligations, or the obligations of the party for whom the Company ultimately acts as agent, in either case under the related transaction agreements with respect to the ABS Platform for the Period (as applicable, the
 Company s Obligations ), except for the following servicing criteria: 1122(d)(1)(v), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(B), 1122(d)(3)(i)(C), 1122(d)(3)(i)(D), 1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(v), 1122(d)(4)(vi),
1122(d)(4)(vii), 1122(d)(4)(viii), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii), 1122(d)(4)(xiii), and 1122(d)(4)(xiv), which Management has determined are not applicable to the Company s Obligations in the related transaction
agreements with respect to the ABS Platform for the Period; provided however that, with respect to the ABS Platform (a) servicing criterion 1122(d)(3)(i)(A) is applicable only as it relates to the Company s Obligation to distribute or make
available to investors, in accordance with the timeframes set forth in the transaction agreements, the relevant investor reports received by the Company from the entity preparing such reports; (b) servicing criterion 1122(d)(3)(ii) is
applicable only as it relates to the Company s Obligation to make remittances to investors in accordance with the transaction agreements; and (c) servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable only as it relates to the Company s
Obligation to obtain an Officer s Certificate from the servicer and report any additions, removals and substitutions to investors on the relevant investor report, in each case, in accordance with the transaction agreements (the
 Applicable Servicing Criteria ). Third parties classified as vendors : With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(2)(vi), the
Company has engaged a vendor for certain transactions in the ABS Platform to handle making payments to investors and/or third parties by check, and such vendor also safeguards any unissued checks. Management has determined that the vendor is not
considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and Management elects to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the portion of the servicing criterion applicable to the vendor as permitted by the SEC s
 Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation C DI 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06 . The Company has policies and procedures in place designed to provide
reasonable assurance that the vendor s activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criterion applicable to the vendor. Management is solely responsible for determining that the Company meets the SEC requirements to apply
 C DI 200.06 for the vendor and the related servicing criterion. With respect to the ABS Platform and the Period, Management provides the
following assessment of the Company s compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria: 1. Management is
responsible for assessing the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 2. Management has assessed the
Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria including the servicing criterion for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 as described above. In performing this assessment, Management used the criteria set
forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. 3. With respect to Applicable
Servicing Criteria 1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(xv), Management has determined that there were no activities performed during the Period with respect to the ABS Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to
perform such activities. 4. Based on such assessment for the Period, the Company has complied in all material respects with the
Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Period.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Management of JPMorgan Chase Bank, National
Association: We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Certification Regarding Compliance with Applicable Servicing
Criteria , that JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (the Bank complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the asset-backed securities
transactions involving credit card receivables, for which transactions the Bank acted as servicer, that were registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, on or after January 1, 2006,
where the related asset-backed securities were outstanding, as listed in Appendix B of the Certification Regarding Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria (the Platform ), as of and for the year ended December 31,
2022, excluding criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(vi), 1122(d)(3)(iii), 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi) 1122(d)(4)(xii), 1122(d)(4)(xiii), and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Bank has determined are
not applicable to the activities performed by it with respect to the Platform. JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association s management is responsible for its assertion and for the Bank s compliance with the applicable servicing
criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Bank s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria based on our examination. 
 As described in management s assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(iv), the Bank has engaged vendors to perform the activities required by this
servicing criteria. The Bank has determined that these vendors are not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Bank has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing
criteria applicable to these vendors as permitted by Interpretation 200.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance s interpretations of the rules adopted under Regulation AB and the Securities Act and the Exchange Act Interpretation
200.06 ). As permitted by Interpretation 200.06, the Bank has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with the servicing
criteria applicable to these vendors. The Bank is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply Interpretation 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures
with respect to the Bank s determination of its eligibility to use Interpretation 200.06. Our examination was conducted in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about compliance with the applicable servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all material respects, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence
about the Bank s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of selected asset-backed transactions and securities that
comprise the Platform, testing of selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Bank processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the applicable servicing
criteria. Our procedures were limited to the

selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Bank during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that
may have occurred prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Bank during the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides, and that evidence we obtained
was sufficient and appropriate to provide, a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Bank s compliance with the servicing criteria. 
 We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements related to the engagement.
 In our opinion, management s assertion that JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association complied with the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 for asset-backed securities transactions involving credit card receivables, for which transactions the Bank acted as servicer, that were registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission
pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, on or after January 1, 2006, where the related asset-backed securities were outstanding, as listed in Appendix B of the Certification Regarding Compliance with Applicable Servicing
Criteria is fairly stated, in all material respects. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
