The forward-looking statements in this Annual Report are based on our beliefs, assumptions and expectations of future performance, taking into account the information currently available to us. These statements are only predictions based upon our current expectations and projections about future events. Our actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements may differ materially from the results, level of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. Other sections of this Annual Report may include additional factors that could adversely impact our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make in this Annual Report.

 Undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements, which are inherently uncertain. Except as may be required by law, we undertake no obligation to revise or update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date of this Annual Report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

PART I 
 Item 1. B usiness. 
 Our Company 
 We are a vertically integrated real estate finance company founded in 2004. We primarily originate and manage investor loans secured by 1-4 unit residential rental and commercial properties, which we refer to collectively as investor real estate loans. We originate loans nationwide across our extensive network of independent mortgage brokers which we have built and refined over the 18 years since our inception. Our objective is to be the preferred and one of the most recognized brands in our core market, particularly within our network of mortgage brokers. 
 We operate in a large and highly fragmented market with substantial demand for financing and limited supply of institutional financing alternatives. We have developed the highly-specialized skill set required to effectively compete in this market, which we believe has afforded us a durable business model capable of generating attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders throughout various business cycles. We offer competitive pricing to our borrowers by pursuing low-cost financing strategies and by driving front-end process efficiencies through customized technology designed to control the cost of originating a loan. Furthermore, by originating loans through our efficient and scalable network of approved mortgage brokers, we are able to maintain a wide geographical presence and nimble operating infrastructure capable of reacting quickly to changing market environments. 
 We believe there is a substantial and durable market opportunity for investor real estate loans across 1-4 unit residential rental and small commercial properties, and that our institutionalized approach to serving these fragmented market segments underpins our long-term business strategy. Our growth to date has validated the need for scaled lenders with dedication to individual investors who own ten or fewer properties, a base which we believe represents the vast majority of activity across our core market. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, since 1965, the U.S. home rentership rate (the inverse of the home ownership rate) has averaged approximately 35 . According to an estimate published by Zillow in January 2021, the value of the U.S. residential housing sector is over 43 trillion. Ownership of residential properties for rent has historically been concentrated among smaller investors. According to data published by the Urban Institute in August and October 2017, an estimated 45 of single-family rental units (attached or detached) are owned by investors who own just one unit and an estimated 87 of investors own 10 or fewer units, while institutional ownership comprises less than 3 of the market. 
 Our primary growth strategy is predicated on organically continuing to serve and build loyalty within our network of mortgage brokers, while also expanding our network with new mortgage brokers through targeted marketing and improved brand awareness. We believe our reputation and 18-year history within our core market position us well to capture future growth opportunities. We continue to opportunistically pursue inorganic growth strategies such as acquiring portfolios of loans that meet our investment criteria and acquisitions of businesses that align with our strategic vision. 
 We make loans for business purposes only, which we believe limits our exposure to the regulatory constraints of consumer lending. We do not make consumer loans or lend on raw land. 
 On January 16, 2020, we converted from a limited liability company to a corporation incorporated under the law of the State of Delaware by filing a certificate of conversion with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and changed our name from Velocity Financial, LLC to Velocity Financial, Inc. 
 On December 28, 2021, the Company acquired an 80 ownership interest in Century Health Housing Capital, LLC Century . Century is a licensed Ginnie Mae issuer/servicer that provides government-insured Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgage financing for multifamily housing, senior housing and long-term care/assisted living facilities. Century originates loans through its borrower-direct origination channel and services the loans through its in-house servicing platform, which enables the formation of long-term relationships with its clients and drives strong portfolio retention. Century earns origination fees and servicing fees from the mortgage servicing rights on its servicing portfolio.

Market Uncertainties in 2023 
 Our operational and financial performance will depend on the certain market developments, including any lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia/Ukraine war, a global recession, heightened stress in the commercial real estate and corporate debt markets, and macroeconomic conditions and market fundamentals, which can all affect each of these factors and potentially impact our business performance. 
 Our Competitive Advantages 
 We believe that the following competitive advantages enhance our ability to execute our business strategy and position us well for future growth: 
 Established Franchise with Strong Brand Recognition 
 We believe our reputation and deep history within the real estate lending community position us as a preferred lender for mortgage brokers. We have been originating and acquiring loans in our core market since our inception in 2004, making us a recognizable brand with a proven ability to execute. Additionally, we have successfully executed twenty-five securitizations of our investor real estate loans, issuing 5.4 billion in principal amount of securities between 2011 and the year ended December 31, 2022. We have a keen understanding of this securitization market, including complicated structural issues, investor expectations and rating agency requirements. We executed our twentieth through twenty-fifth securitizations in 2022. We believe this demonstrates that we have a strong reputation with investors in the securitization market, which enables us to maintain efficient access to debt capital that ultimately improves our ability to offer competitive pricing to our borrowers. 
 Customized Technology and Proprietary Data Analytics 
 We have invested in and customized automated systems to support our use of data analytics which drives our lending process. We believe the investor real estate lending market requires a highly-specialized skill set and infrastructure. To effectively compete and execute on a sustainable long-term business strategy, lenders must control the cost to originate and manage loans without sacrificing credit quality. We believe our investment in technology and use of data analytics helps us achieve these critical objectives and positions our business for sustainable, long-term growth. 
 We apply the same asset-driven underwriting process to all of the loans in our portfolio, regardless of whether we originate or acquire these loans. Our credit and underwriting philosophy encompasses individual borrower and property due diligence, taking into consideration several factors. Our access to 18 years of proprietary data allows us to perform analytics that inform our lending decisions efficiently and effectively, which we believe is a strong competitive advantage. 
 Large In-Place Portfolio with Attractive, Long-Term Financing 
 We believe our in-place portfolio provides a significant and stable income stream for us to invest in future earnings growth. Our loans are structured to provide interest rate protection. The majority of our loans are fixed-rate loans and a smaller portion of our loans are floating after an initial fixed-rate period, subject to a floor equal to the starting fixed rate. The loans are mainly financed with long-term fixed-rate debt, resulting in a spread that could increase over time, but not decrease. As a result, our in-place portfolio generally benefits from rising interest rates. We generated 112.6 million in portfolio related net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2022, representing a 3.64 net interest margin during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Our In-House Asset Management Results in Successful Loss Mitigation 
 Direct management of individual loans is critical to avoiding or minimizing credit losses and we work with our third-party primary servicers with whom we have developed strong relationships to emphasize disciplined loan monitoring and early contact with delinquent borrowers to resolve delinquencies. We have a dedicated asset management team that, augmented with primary servicing from our loan servicers, focuses exclusively on resolving delinquent loans. Our hands-on approach enables us to generally preserve the value of our assets and helps us to minimize losses. We believe this expertise, combined with our outsourced servicing relationships, gives us a distinct competitive advantage. 
 2 

Our Experienced Management Team 
 Led by co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Christopher Farrar, our management team averages more than 25 years of experience in the financial services and real estate lending industries, including extensive experience in commercial and residential lending, structured finance and capital markets. We have successfully navigated both positive and negative economic cycles and retained our core team of experienced professionals in appraisal, underwriting, processing and production, while bolstering our finance and asset management team with professionals possessing extensive experience in financial reporting and real estate management. We believe our in-depth knowledge of our core market provides a distinct competitive advantage. 
 Our Growth Strategy 
 The market for investor real estate loans is large and highly fragmented. We have built a dedicated and scalable national lending platform focused specifically on serving this market and believe our capabilities position us well to maintain our reputation as a preferred lender in this market. Our organic growth strategy is predicated on further penetrating our existing network of mortgage brokers and expanding our network with new mortgage brokers. A key element of our implementation of this strategy is the growth and development of our team of account executives, as well as targeted marketing initiatives. We will continue to supplement the extension of our broker network with the development of new products to support the evolving needs of borrowers in our core market. 
 We continue to opportunistically pursue inorganic growth strategies such as acquiring portfolios of loans that meet our investment criteria and acquisitions of businesses that align with our strategic vision. 
 Further Penetrate Our Existing Mortgage Broker Network 
 We strive to be the preferred lender within our network of approved mortgage brokers. We have developed a strong reputation in the market for high quality execution and timely closing, which we believe are the most important qualities our mortgage brokers value in selecting a lender. There is significant opportunity for us to further penetrate the approximately 3,137 mortgage brokers with whom we have done business over the last five years. Approximately 64 of loan originators originated five or fewer loans with us during the year ended December 31, 2022. We believe this presents a compelling opportunity for us to capture incremental volume from our existing broker network. 
 Expand Our Network with New Mortgage Brokers 
 We believe that our targeted sales effort, combined with consistent high-quality execution, positions us well to continue adding to the network of mortgage brokers that rely on us to serve their borrower clients. 
 Despite the adverse macroeconomic conditions caused by inflation and rising interest rates, we funded 4,135 loans sourced by 1,269 different mortgage brokers during the year ended December 31, 2022. We believe that represents a small portion of the mortgage originators in the United States, which consisted of approximately 939,000 state-licensed mortgage originators by the end of 2021 according to the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System. The size of the mortgage broker market presents an attractive opportunity for us to capture significant growth with very small increases in the share of mortgage brokers that recognize our platform capabilities and utilize us as a preferred lender in our core market. 
 Develop New Products 
 Our primary products are a 30-year amortizing term loan with a three-year fixed-rate period which floats at a spread to the prime rate thereafter subject to a floor equal to the starting fixed rate, and a 30-year fixed-rate amortizing term loan. These loans comprised 92.6 of our loan originations during the year ended December 31, 2022. These products are used by borrowers to finance stabilized long-term real estate investments. We believe these products have strong receptivity in our market, as evidenced by our success in growing loan originations over time. Since our inception, we have continued to expand our product offering in response to developing market opportunities and the evolving financing needs of our broker network. For example, in 2013, in response to the increased demand for rental properties, we moved aggressively into the market for 1-4 unit residential rental loans, which comprised 52.7 of our held for investment loan portfolio as of December 31, 2022. 
 3 

In March 2017, we began originating short-term, interest-only loans to be used for acquiring, repositioning or improving the quality of 1-4 unit residential investment properties. This product typically serves as an interim solution for borrowers and/or properties that do not meet the investment criteria of our primary 30-year product. The short-term, interest-only loan allows borrowers to address any qualifying issues with their credit and/or the underlying property before bridging into a longer-term loan. In June 2018, we added a second short-term, interest-only loan product which allows borrower draws for rehabbing residential rental property. Historically, we have aggregated and sold most of these short-term, interest-only loans at a premium to par to institutional investors, which has generated attractive income for us with limited capital while also allowing us to establish an underwriting track record and monitor the performance of these loans. In December 2021 we added a new HUD multi-family and healthcare loan product offering with our acquisition of a majority interest in Century. 
 Opportunistically Acquire Portfolios of Loan and Acquire Strategically-Aligned Businesses 
 We continually assess opportunities to acquire portfolios of loans that meet our investment criteria. Over the past 18 years, our management team has developed relationships with many financial institutions and intermediaries that have been active investor real estate loan originators or investors. We believe that our experience, reputation, and ability to effectively manage these loans makes us an attractive buyer for this asset class, and we are regularly asked to review pools of loans available for purchase. In our experience, portfolio acquisition opportunities have generally been more attractive and plentiful during market conditions when origination opportunities are less favorable. Accordingly, we believe our acquisition strategy not only augments our origination business, but also provides a counter-cyclical benefit to our overall business. 
 Our Portfolio 
 Loans Held for Investment 
 Our typical investor real estate loan is secured by a first lien on the underlying property with the added protection of a personal guarantee and, based on the loans in our portfolio as of December 31, 2022, has an average balance of approximately 395,000. As of December 31, 2022, our portfolio of loans held for investment totaled 3.5 billion of unpaid principal balance, or UPB, on properties in 45 states and the District of Columbia. Of the 8,893 loans held for investment as of December 31, 2022, 98.9 of the portfolio, as measured by UPB, was attributable to our loan origination business, while the remaining 1.1 of the portfolio, or 68 loans, totaling 40.1 million in UPB, were related to acquisitions. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we originated 4,135 and 3,105 loans to be held for investment totaling 1.5 billion and 1.3 billion, respectively. 
 As of December 31, 2022, 85.7 of our loans held for investment, as measured by UPB, were fully-amortizing over 30 years. The principal amount of a fully-amortizing loan is repaid ratably over the term of the loan, as compared to a balloon loan where all, or a substantial portion of, the original loan amount is due in a single payment at the maturity date. We believe that fully-amortizing loans face a lower risk of default than balloon loans, as the final payment due under the balloon loan may require the borrower to refinance or sell the property. 
 We target investor real estate loans with loan-to-value ratios, or LTVs, between 60 and 75 at origination as we believe that borrower equity of 25 to 40 provides significant protection against credit losses. As of December 31, 2022, our loans held for investment had a weighted average LTV at origination of 68.2 . Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, borrowers personally guaranteed 100.0 of the loans in our held for investment portfolio and had a weighted average credit score at origination of 719, excluding the 1.3 of loans for which a credit score is not available.

(3) The approximately 3 portion of our loans held for investment with an LTV greater than 75 consists primarily of acquired loans. 

We typically do not lend on any property located in a city with a population less than 25,000 and outside a 25-mile radius of a city with a population in excess of 100,000. We generally prefer to lend in larger metropolitan statistical areas.

Our Financing Strategy 
 We typically finance our new loan originations using warehouse facilities. Once we have originated between approximately 175 million and 400 million in new loans, we securitize the loans through a real estate mortgage investment conduit, or REMIC, structure and issue the bonds to third parties through individual trust vehicles. All our securitizations are issued as private placements pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and utilize a REMIC structure except for the 2020 MC1 and 2022 MC1 transactions which were issued as one class of bonds treated as debt for tax purposes. The REMIC transactions can create significant U.S. GAAP versus tax differences. The U.S. GAAP treatment considers each REMIC as a variable interest entity that is required to be consolidated in our financial statements, accounting for the securitization as a secured borrowing. Under IRS rules, the REMICs require sale treatment where we are required to either recognize taxable income or loss to the extent the fair market value of the REMICs is greater than or less than our cost basis, the payment of which creates either a deferred tax asset or a deferred tax liability. We are the sole beneficial interest holder of each of the trusts, through our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Proceeds from the issuance of the securities are then used to pay down the balances on our warehouse facilities. As of December 31, 2022, we had successfully executed twenty-five securitizations of our investor real estate loans, issuing 5.4 billion in principal amount of securities. See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information about our warehouse repurchase facilities and securitizations. 
 In February 2021, we entered into a five-year 175.0 million syndicated corporate debt agreement 2021 Term Loan ). The 2021 Term Loan bore interest at a rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 8.00 , with a 1.00 LIBOR floor, and was set to mature in February 2026. In March 2022, we entered into a five-year 215.0 million syndicated corporate debt agreement the 2022 Term Loan ). The 2022 Term Loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 7.125 and matures on March 15, 2027. A portion of the net proceeds from the 2022 Term Loan was used to redeem all the amounts owed pursuant to the 2021 Term Loan. 
 Depending on market conditions, we may increase leverage on our investments with an amount of debt we deem prudent, subject to applicable risk retention rules. Our decision to use leverage to finance our assets will be based on our assessment of a variety of factors, including, among others, the anticipated liquidity and price volatility of the assets in our investment portfolio, the potential for losses and extension risk in our portfolio, the availability of credit at favorable prices, the credit quality of our assets and the outlook for our borrowing costs relative to the interest income earned on our assets and, where applicable, regulatory requirements with respect to securitizations. 
 Going forward, our financing sources may include borrowings in the form of additional bank credit facilities (including term loans and revolving facilities), additional warehouse repurchase facilities, structured financing arrangements, future securitizations and public and private equity and debt issuances, in addition to transaction or asset-specific funding arrangements. We intend to use leverage primarily to finance our portfolio and not for speculating on changes in the level of interest rates. We are not required to employ specific debt levels, and we believe the appropriate leverage for the particular assets we may finance depends on the factors discussed above. 
 We expect to continue financing our loan portfolio with equity and our financing arrangements, including warehouse lines for short-term financing and securitizations for long-term financing. We believe using securitizations to finance our investor real estate loans fits well with our strategy of holding interest-earning assets over the long-term to earn a spread. This type of financing structure more closely matches the asset duration with the duration of the financing.

Competition 
 The business of financing investor real estate loans is competitive. We compete with specialty finance companies, regional and community banks and thrifts, public and private entities, institutional investors, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, investment banking firms, and other financial institutions, and we expect that additional competitors may be organized or otherwise enter our core market in the future. We believe we compete favorably through diversified borrower access driven by our extensive network of mortgage brokers and by emphasizing a high level of real estate and financial expertise, customer service, and flexibility in structuring transactions, as well as by attracting and retaining experienced managerial and marketing personnel. However, we may not be able to achieve our business goals or expectations due to the competitive risks that we face. Some of our competitors may be better positioned to market their services and financing programs because of their ability to offer more favorable rates and terms and other services. Such rates may be impacted by the competitor s size, cost of funds, and access to funding sources that are not available to us. 
 Government Regulation 
 Certain states in which we conduct business require approval, registration or licensing. Typically, the mortgage broker that originates the loan that we make, fund or acquire is licensed or exempt from licensing in the state where the loan is made. We also hold a Federal Housing Administration, or FHA, Title II approval from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which permits us to make certain government-insured loans. With the acquisition of Century, we are now a licensed Ginnie Mae (GNMA) issuer/servicer that provides government-insured Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgage financing for multifamily housing, senior housing and long-term care/assisted living facilities. As a licensed Ginnie Mae issuer/servicer, we are subject to GNMA's regulations. 
 We may be required to obtain licenses to originate investor real estate loans in the various additional jurisdictions in which we conduct our business or to acquire investor real estate loans. If we are required to obtain additional licenses to originate or acquire investor real estate loans, the process may be costly and could take several months. There is no assurance that we will obtain the licenses required or that we will not experience significant delays in seeking these licenses. Furthermore, we may be subject to various reporting and other requirements to maintain these licenses, and there is no assurance that we may satisfy those requirements. Our failure to maintain or obtain licenses may restrict our investment options and could harm our business. 
 Human Capital Resources 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of 194 employees, a decrease of 10 from the prior year . None of our employees are represented by a labor union. The decrease in our employees was a result of our planned reduction in loan origination due to the dislocation in the current macroeconomic environment. 
 A driving force in our ability to generate revenue comes from the work of our Account Executives, or AEs. Our AEs generate business for us through their relationships with third-party brokers. Our ability to retain and attract AEs is essential to the growth of our business. A significant number of our employees are AEs, representing 30 of our workforce at year-end. 
 Our employment strategy is to create a culture that allows us to attract and retain the very best talent in our industry, provide competitive pay and benefits, and to ensure a healthy work environment comprised of an employee base that is considerate, collaborative, productive and driven. We are committed to building a great place to work for all of our employees. We provide an hourly wage or salary to our employees as well as the potential for discretionary bonuses. AEs are also eligible to receive additional quarterly bonuses based partially on the AEs revenue-generating results during the quarter. 
 While we have not adopted any diversity quotas, 65 of our employees are men and 35 are women. 
 We are committed to the health, safety, and wellness of our employees. In response to the pandemic, we implemented precautionary policies and significant operational changes to protect and support our employees, including remote working. As of December 31, 2022, substantially all our employees have been able, and continue, to work remotely.

We and our employees are also committed to improving the communities in which we work and live. Through our charitable donations and Velocity Volunteers, we pick local charitable causes and projects to support and encourage our employees to donate their time and needed materials.

Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with Item 6. Selected Financial Data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes and the other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report . This discussion contains forward-looking statements, as described above under the heading Forward-Looking Statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report. 
 Business 
 We are a vertically integrated real estate finance company founded in 2004. We primarily originate and manage investor loans secured by 1-4 unit residential rental and commercial properties, which we refer to collectively as investor real estate loans. 
 Our primary source of revenue is interest income earned on our loan portfolio. Our typical loan is secured by a first lien on the underlying property with a personal guarantee and, based on all loans in our portfolio as of December 31, 2022, has an average balance of approximately 395,000. As of December 31, 2022, our loan portfolio totaled 3.5 billion of UPB on properties in 45 states and the District of Columbia. The total portfolio had a weighted average loan-to-value ratio, or LTV at origination, of 68.2 , and was concentrated in 1-4 unit residential rental loans, which we refer to as investor 1-4 loans, representing 52.7 of the UPB. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the yield on our total portfolio was 7.77 . 
 We fund our portfolio primarily through a combination of committed and uncommitted secured warehouse facilities, securitizations, corporate debt and equity. The securitization market is our primary source of long-term financing. We have successfully executed 25 securitizations, issuing 5.4 billion in principal amount of securities from May 2011 through December 2022. 
 One of our core profitably measurements is our portfolio related net interest margin, which measures the difference between interest income earned on our loan portfolio and interest expense paid on our portfolio-related debt, relative to the amount of loans outstanding over the period. Our portfolio-related debt consists of our warehouse facilities and securitizations and excludes our corporate debt. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our portfolio related net interest margin was 3.64 . We generate profits to the extent that our portfolio related net interest income exceeds our interest expense on corporate debt, provision for loan losses and operating expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2022, including net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, we generated income before income taxes and net income of 44.6 million and 32.5 million, respectively, and earned a pre-tax return on equity and return on equity of 12.2 and 8.9 , respectively. 
 Items Affecting Comparability of Results 
 Due to a number of factors, our historical financial results may not be comparable, either from period to period, or to our financial results in future periods. We have summarized the key factors affecting the comparability of our financial results below. 
 Income Taxes 
 Our REMIC transactions can create significant U.S. GAAP versus tax differences. The U.S. GAAP treatment considers each REMIC as a variable interest entity that is required to be consolidated in our financial statements, accounting for the securitization as a secured borrowing. Under IRS rules, the REMICs require sale treatment and we are required to either recognize taxable income or loss to the extent the fair market value of the REMICs is greater than or less than our cost basis, the payment of which creates either a deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability. 
 We will continue to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of our existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the statements of operations in the period that included the enactment date, as applicable.

Interest Expense on Corporate Debt 
 The 2021 Term Loan was a five-year 175.0 million syndicated corporate debt agreement. We incurred 20.6 million of interest expense related to our corporate debt during the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 In March 2022, we entered into a five-year 215.0 million syndicated corporate debt agreement the 2022 Term Loan ). A portion of the net proceeds from the 2022 Term Loan was used to redeem all the amounts owed pursuant to the 2021 Term Loan. The remaining portion of the net proceeds from the 2022 Term Loan is used for loan originations and general corporate purposes. We incurred 29.5 million of interest expense related to our corporate debt during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Fair Value Option Accounting 
 We have made an election to apply the fair value option FVO accounting to all our originated mortgage loans on a go-forward basis beginning October 1, 2022. The fair value option loans will be presented on a separate line item in the consolidated balance sheet. We will not record a CECL loan loss reserve on fair value option loans. 
 We utilize a third-party model to estimate the fair value of the FVO loan portfolio in accordance with ASC 820. We use a discounted cash flow methodology, that forecasts contractual cash flows, adjusting for projected prepayments and defaults, followed by discounting these cash flows back to a present value, using a reasonable discount rate. 
 Recent Developments 
 Securitizations 
 In January 2023, we completed the securitization of 240.3 million of investor real estate loans, measured by UPB. 
 Continued Market Uncertainties 
 Our operational and financial performance will depend on certain market developments, including any lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia/Ukraine war, a global recession, heightened stress in the commercial real estate and corporate debt markets, and macroeconomic conditions and market fundamentals, which can all affect each of these factors and potentially impact our business performance. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies 
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP in the United States and follow general practices within the financial services industry. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The most significant accounting policies we follow are summarized in Note 2 Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. 
 Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical to reported financial results if (1) the accounting estimates require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain, and (2) different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, results of operations, or liquidity. Our critical accounting estimates are summarized below.

Allowance for Loan Losses 
 For our loans held for investment where we have not elected fair value option FVO accounting, we calculate an allowance for loan losses. Under the current expected credit loss CECL methodology, the allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist. We identified the following portfolio segments based on risk characteristics of the loans in its loan portfolio (pool): 
 Residential 1 4 Unit Purchase (loans to purchase 1 4 unit residential rental properties); 

Residential 1 4 Unit Refinance (refinance loans on 1 4 unit residential rental properties); 

Commercial Purchase (loans to purchase traditional commercial properties); 

Commercial Refinance (refinance loans on traditional commercial properties); 

Short Term 1 4 Unit Purchase (short-term loans to purchase 1 4 unit residential rental properties); and 

Short Term 1 4 Unit Refinance (short-term refinance loans on 1 4 unit residential rental properties). 

We determined the collectability of our loans by evaluating certain risk characteristics. The segmentation of our loan portfolio was determined based on analyses of our loan portfolio performance over the past nine years. Based on analyses of the loan portfolio s historical performance, we concluded that loan purpose and product types are the most significant risk factors in determining our expectation of future loan losses. Loan purpose considers whether a borrower is acquiring the property or refinancing an existing property. Our historical experience shows that refinance loans have higher loss rates than loans for property acquisitions. Product type includes residential 1-4 unit property and traditional commercial property. Our historical experience shows that traditional commercial property loans have higher loss rates than residential 1-4 unit property. Short Term loans have a maturity of one to two years from origination. Long term loans have a maturity of up to 30 years from origination. 
 We estimate the allowance for loan losses using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to historical performance, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable macroeconomic forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are considered for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency levels, or term, as well as for changes in environmental conditions, such as unemployment rates, property values and changes in the competitive or regulatory environment. 
 14 

We use an open pool loss rate methodology to model expected credit losses. To determine the loss rates using the open pool method, we start with our historical database of losses, segmenting the loans by loan purpose, product type and repayment period. A third-party model applying the open pool method is used to estimate an annual average loss rate by dividing the respective pool's quarterly historical losses by the pool's respective prior quarters ending unamortized loan cost balance and deriving an annual average loss rate from the historical quarterly loss rates. The model then adjusts the annual average loss rates based upon macroeconomic forecasts over a reasonable and supportable period, followed by a straight-line reversion to the historical loss rates. The adjusted annual average loss rates are applied to the forecasted pool balance within each segment. The forecasted balances in the loan pool segments are calculated based on a principal amortization using contractual maturity, factoring in further principal reductions from estimated prepayments. Estimated prepayments, or Constant Prepayment Rates CPRs are developed from multiple loan characteristic considerations, such as property types, FICO scores, loan purpose, and prepayment penalty terms, which is the most significant driver of prepayment activity. The prepayment penalty terms differ between the short-term and long-term loans, and we have developed a CPR curve for our short-term loans (2-year or less) and one for our long-term loans (30-year). Data from 2012-2022 is used to develop prepayment rates for our long-term loans. Because of the prepayment penalty structure in our long-term loans, prepayments during the active penalty term are historically low and begin to ramp up after the prepayment penalty term. The active prepayment penalty term is considered for existing and new loans over the reasonable and supportable forecast period in determining estimated prepayments. We back-test the CPR curves on a quarterly basis and adjust the CPR curves as appropriate. The reasonable and supportable period is meant to represent the period in which we believe the forecasted macroeconomic variables can be reasonably estimated. Significant variables or assumptions incorporated in the macroeconomic forecasts include U.S. unemployment, treasury yields, U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP), and U.S. real estate housing prices. We consider multiple scenarios from different macroeconomic forecasts and use different forecast and revision periods for estimating lifetime expected credit losses. 
 We have determined that once a loan becomes nonperforming (90 or more days past due), it no longer shares the same risk characteristics of the other loans within its segment of homogeneous loans (pool). We pull these loans out of the segments and evaluate the loans individually using the practical expedient to determine the credit exposure. Nonperforming loans are considered collateral dependent. Using the practical expedient, the fair value of the underlying collateral, less estimated selling costs, is compared to the carrying value of the loan in the determination of a credit loss. 
 The allowance for loan losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. Loans are charged off against the allowance when we believe the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off. 
 The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level deemed adequate by management to provide for expected losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet date. While we use available information to estimate our required allowance for loan losses, future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in estimates resulting from economic and other conditions. 
 We made the accounting policy election not to measure an allowance for loan losses for accrued interest receivables. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the accrued and unpaid interest is reversed as a reduction of interest income and accrued interest receivable. Accrued interest receivable is excluded from the amortized cost of loans and it is presented as accrued interest receivable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Fair Value Option Accounting 
 We have made an election to apply the fair value option accounting to all our originated mortgage loans on a go-forward basis beginning October 1, 2022. We will consider applying FVO accounting to acquired loans on a case-by-case basis. The fair value option loans will be presented on a separate line item in the consolidated balance sheet. We will not record a CECL loan loss reserve on fair value option loans. 
 We utilize a third-party model to estimate the fair value of the FVO loan portfolio in accordance with ASC 820. We use a discounted cash flow methodology, that forecasts contractual cash flows, adjusting for projected prepayments and defaults, followed by discounting these cash flows back to a present value, using a reasonable discount rate. 
 15 

Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities 
 Our deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We determine whether a deferred tax asset is realizable based on facts and circumstances, including our current and projected future tax position, the historical level of our taxable income, and estimates of our future taxable income. In most cases, the realization of deferred tax assets is based on our future profitability. If we were to experience either reduced profitability or operating losses in a future period, the realization of our deferred tax assets may no longer be considered more likely than not and, accordingly, we could be required to record a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets by charging earnings. 
 How We Assess Our Business Performance 
 Net income is the primary metric by which we assess our business performance. Accordingly, we closely monitor the primary drivers of net income which consist of the following: 
 Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income is the largest contributor to our net income and is monitored on both an absolute basis and relative to provisions for loan losses and operating expenses. We generate net interest income to the extent that the rate at which we lend in our portfolio exceeds the cost of financing our portfolio, which we primarily achieve through long-term securitizations. Accordingly, we closely monitor the financing markets and maintain consistent dialogue with investors and financial institutions as we evaluate our financing sources and cost of funds. 
 To evaluate net interest income, we measure and monitor: (1) the yields on our loans, (2) the costs of our funding sources, (3) our net interest spread and (4) our net interest margin. Net interest spread measures the difference between the rates earned on our loans and the rates paid on our funding sources. Net interest margin measures the difference between our annualized interest income and annualized interest expense, or net interest income, as a percentage of average loans outstanding over the specified time period. 
 Periodic changes in net interest income are primarily driven by: (1) origination volume and changes in average outstanding loan balances and (2) interest rates and changes in interest earned on our portfolio or paid on our debt. Historically, origination volume and portfolio size have been the largest contributors to the growth in our net interest income. We measure net interest income before and after interest expense related to our corporate debt and before and after our provisions for loan losses. 
 Credit Losses 
 We strive to minimize actual credit losses through our rigorous screening and underwriting process and life of loan portfolio management and special servicing practices. We closely monitor the credit performance of our loan portfolio, including delinquency rates and expected and actual credit losses, as a key factor in assessing our overall business performance. 
 Operating Expenses 
 We incur operating expenses from compensation and benefits related to our employee base, rent and other occupancy costs associated with our leased facilities, our third-party primary loan servicing vendors, professional fees to the extent we utilize third-party legal, consulting and advisory firms, and costs associated with the resolution and disposition of real estate owned, among other items. We monitor and strive to prudently manage operating expenses and to balance current period profitability with investment in the continued development of our platform. Because volume and portfolio size determine the magnitude of the impact of each of the above factors on our earnings, we also closely monitor origination volume along with all key terms of new loan originations, such as interest rates, loan-to-value ratios, estimated credit losses and expected duration. 
 Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations 
 We believe there are a number of factors that impact our business, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report. 
 16 

Our results of operations depend on, among other things, the level of our net interest income, the credit performance of our loan portfolio and the efficiency of our operating platform. These measures are affected by a number of factors, including the demand for investor real estate loans, the competitiveness of the market for originating or acquiring investor real estate loans, the cost of financing our portfolio, operating costs, the availability of funding sources and the underlying performance of the collateral supporting our loans. While we have been successful at managing these elements in the past, there are certain circumstances beyond our control, including any lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia/Ukraine war, an expected recession, and macroeconomic conditions and market fundamentals, which can all affect each of these factors and potentially impact our business performance. 
 Origination Volume 
 Portfolio related net interest income is the largest contributor to our net income. We grew our portfolio related net interest income by 16.0 million or 16.7 from 96.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 112.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The growth in net interest income is largely attributable to new loan originations which we have achieved by executing our principal strategies of expanding our broker network and further penetrating our network of existing brokers. We anticipate that our future performance will continue to depend on growing our origination/acquisition volume and believe that the large and highly fragmented nature of our core market provides meaningful opportunity to achieve this. We intend to grow our portfolio by continuing to serve and build loyalty within our existing network of brokers while expanding our network with new brokers through targeted marketing and improved brand awareness. 
 Our future performance could be impacted to the extent that our origination volumes decline as we rely on new loans to offset maturities and prepayments in our existing portfolio. To augment our core origination business, we continually assess opportunities to acquire portfolios of loans that meet our investment criteria. In our experience, portfolio acquisition opportunities have generally been more attractive and plentiful during market conditions when origination opportunities are less favorable. Accordingly, we believe our acquisition strategy not only expands our core business, but also provides a counter-cyclical benefit. 
 Competition 
 The investor real estate loan market is highly competitive which could affect our profitability and growth. We believe we compete favorably through diversified borrower access driven by our extensive network of mortgage brokers and by emphasizing a high level of real estate and financial expertise, customer service, and flexibility in structuring transactions, as well as by attracting and retaining experienced managerial and marketing personnel. However, some of our competitors may be better positioned to market their services and financing programs because of their ability to offer more favorable rates and terms and other services. 
 Availability and Cost of Funding 
 Our primary funding sources have historically included cash from operations, warehouse facilities, term securitizations, corporate debt and equity. We believe we have an established brand in the term securitization market and that this market will continue to support our portfolio growth with long-term financing. Changes in macroeconomic conditions can adversely impact our ability to issue securitizations and, thereby, limit our options for long-term financing. In consideration of this potential risk, we have entered into a credit facility for longer-term financing that will provide us with capital resources to fund loan growth in the event we are not able to issue securitizations. 
 17 

Two of our seven warehouse repurchase and revolving loan facilities have interest payment obligations tied to the one-month USD London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR. Five of our warehouse repurchase and revolving loan facilities have interest payment obligations tied to the Secured Overnight Offering Rate SOFR ). The authorized administrator of LIBOR confirmed during March 2021 that it intended to cease the publication or loss of representativeness of LIBOR. In particular, the last date of publication or representativeness of one-month USD LIBOR will be June 30, 2023. We expect that the index used in the calculation of the interest rate for our warehouse facilities and corporate debt will transition from LIBOR to a Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR or a suitable replacement index prior to June 30, 2023. As we renew our financing agreements with our warehouse facilities, we are working with our warehouse facilities to include language on the transition to SOFR. We do not expect the cessation of LIBOR nor the transition to a replacement index to have a material adverse effect on our cost of funding, results of operations or financial condition. 
 Loan Performance 
 We underwrite and structure our loans to minimize potential losses. We believe our fully amortizing loan structures and avoidance of large balloon payments, coupled with meaningful borrower equity in properties, limit the probability of losses and that our proven in-house asset management capability allows us to minimize potential losses in situations where there is insufficient equity in the property. Our income is highly dependent upon borrowers making their payments and resolving delinquent loans as favorably as possible. Macroeconomic conditions can, however, impact credit trends in our core market and have an adverse impact on financial results. 
 Macroeconomic Conditions 
 The investor real estate loan market may be impacted by a wide range of macroeconomic factors such as interest rates, residential and commercial real estate prices, home ownership and unemployment rates, and availability of credit, among others. We believe our prudent underwriting, conservative loan structures and interest rate protections, and proven in-house asset management capability leave us well positioned to manage changing macroeconomic conditions. 
 Operating Efficiency 
 We generate positive operating leverage to the extent that our revenue grows at a faster rate than our expenses. We believe our platform is highly scalable and that we can generate positive operating leverage in future periods, primarily due to the technology and other investments we have made in our platform to date and our focus on a scalable, cost-effective mortgage broker network to generate new loan originations.

Average Loan Balance. Average loan balance reflects the average UPB at the end of the period (i.e., total loans divided by loan count). 
 Weighted Average Coupon. Weighted average coupon reflects the weighted average loan rate at the end of the period. 
 Weighted Average Loan-to-Value. Loan-to-value, or LTV, reflects the ratio of the original loan amount to the appraised value of the underlying property at the time of origination. In instances where the LTV at origination is not available for an acquired loan, the LTV reflects our best estimate of value at the time of acquisition. Weighted average LTV is calculated for the population of loans outstanding at the end of each specified period using the original loan amounts and appraised LTVs at the time of origination of each loan. LTV is a key statistic because requiring the borrower to invest more equity in the collateral minimizes our exposure for future credit losses. 
 Nonperforming Loans. Loans that are 90 or more days past due, except for certain loans in our COVID-19 forbearance program, in bankruptcy, in foreclosure, or not accruing interest are considered nonperforming loans. The dollar amount of nonperforming loans presented in the table above reflects the UPB of all loans that meet this definition.

Allowance for Loan Losses 
 Our allowance for loan losses increased to 4.9 million as of December 31, 2022, from 4.3 million as of December 31, 2021. The increase in allowance is primarily due to the increase in our loans held for investment carried at amortized cost from 2.5 billion as of December 31, 2021 to 3.3 billion as of December 31, 2022. 
 Our allowance decreased to 4.3 million as of December 31, 2021, from 5.8 million as of December 31, 2020. The decrease in allowance is primarily due to the broad improvement in the U.S economy in 2021 as the U.S. economy recovered from the adverse impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 Our allowance for loan losses is based on an analysis of historical loan loss data from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2022, adjusted for macroeconomic forecasts. We strive to minimize actual credit losses through our rigorous screening and underwriting process, life of loan portfolio management and special servicing practices. Additionally, we believe borrower equity of 25 to 40 provides significant protection against credit losses should a loan become impaired. The various scenarios, the weighting of scenarios, as well as the forecast period and reversion to historical loss, is subject to change as conditions in the market change and the Company s ability to forecast economic events evolves. 
 To estimate the allowance for loan losses in our non-FVO loans held for investment portfolio, we follow a detailed internal process, considering a number of different factors including, but not limited to, our ongoing analyses of loans, historical loss rates, relevant environmental factors, relevant market research, trends in delinquencies, effects and changes in credit concentrations, and ongoing evaluation of fair values.

Other than loans while they were in the COVID-19 forbearance program, loans that are 90+ days past due, in bankruptcy, in foreclosure, or not accruing interest are considered nonperforming loans. Nonperforming loans were 292.8 million, or 8.3 of our held for investment loan portfolio as of December 31, 2022, compared to 273.1 million, or 10.9 as of December 31, 2021, and 332.8 million, or 17.2 of the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2020. The decrease in total nonperforming loans as of December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021 and 2020 was primarily attributable to loan resolutions by our Special Servicing department, along with improvement in the U.S. economy as the U.S economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Resolutions of non-performing loans 
 Historically, most loans that become nonperforming resolve prior to converting to REO. This is due to low LTVs at origination and our active management of the portfolio. The following tables summarize the resolution activities of loans that were nonperforming or became nonperforming during the periods indicated. We resolved 142.2 million, 201.9 million, and 83.4 million of long-term and short-term nonperforming loans during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. We also resolved 16.2 million, 10.7 million, and 4.4 million of nonperforming loans transferred to REO during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. From these resolution activities, we realized net gains of 10.8 million, 7.5 million, and 2.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. This is largely the result of collecting default interest and prepayment penalties in excess of the contractual interest due and collected. 
 The table below includes nonperforming loan resolutions for our long-term loans and REO's.

The table below includes resolutions for our short-term nonperforming loans and REO's, now being held for investment, and also includes loans that were granted a COVID-19 forbearance in 2020. Prior to January 1, 2020, nonperforming loan resolutions presented only consisted of long-term nonperforming loans held for investment since the short-term loans, or loans with a maturity of two-year or less, were being held for sale until later in 2020. The short-term loans do not require prepayment fees and usually result in a lower gain when paid in full, as compared to long term loans.

Real Estate Owned (REO) 
 REO includes real estate we acquire through foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. REO assets are initially recorded at fair value, less estimated costs to sell, on the date of foreclosure. Adjustments that reduce the carrying value of the loan to the fair value of the real estate at the time of foreclosure are recognized as charge-offs in the allowance for loan losses. Positive adjustments at the time of foreclosure are recognized in other operating income. After foreclosure, we periodically obtain new valuations and any subsequent changes to fair value, less estimated costs to sell, are reflected as valuation adjustments. 
 As of December 31, 2022, our REO included 27 properties with a carrying value of 13.3 million compared to 34 properties with a carrying value of 17.6 million as of December 31, 2021.

Average Loans 
 Average loans reflects the daily average of total outstanding loans, including both loans held for investment and loans held for sale, as measured by UPB, over the specified time period. 
 Portfolio Yield 
 Portfolio yield is an annualized measure of the total interest income earned on our loan portfolio as a percentage of average loans over the given period. Interest income includes interest earned on performing loans, cash interest received on nonperforming loans, default interest and prepayment fees. Portfolio yield is lower in 2022 primarily from a delay in the recovery of delinquent interest as compared to 2021. 
 Average Debt Portfolio Related and Total Company 
 Portfolio-related debt consists of borrowings related directly to financing our loan portfolio, which includes our warehouse repurchase facilities and securitizations. Total company debt consists of portfolio- related debt and corporate debt. The measures presented here reflects the monthly average of all portfolio- related and total company debt, as measured by outstanding principal balance, over the specified time period. 
 Cost of Funds Portfolio Related and Total Company 
 Portfolio related cost of funds is an annualized measure of the interest expense incurred on our portfolio-related debt as a percentage of average portfolio-related debt outstanding over the given period. Total company cost of funds is an annualized measure of the interest expense incurred on our portfolio-related debt and corporate debt outstanding over the given period. Interest expense includes the amortization of expenses incurred in connection with our portfolio related financing activities and corporate debt. Through the issuance of long-term securitizations, we have been able to fix a significant portion of our borrowing costs over time. The strong credit performance on our securitizations has allowed us to issue debt at attractive rates. Our portfolio related cost of funds decreased to 4.64 for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 4.71 and 4.87 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 Net Interest Margin Portfolio Related and Total Company 
 Portfolio related net interest margin measures the difference between the interest income earned on our loan portfolio and the interest expense paid on our portfolio-related debt as a percentage of average loans over the specified time period. Total company net interest margin measures the difference between the interest income earned on our loan portfolio and the interest expense paid on our portfolio-related debt and corporate debt as a percentage of average loans over the specified time period.

Charge-Offs 
 The charge-offs ratio reflects charge-offs as a percentage of average loans held for investment carried at amortized cost over the specific time period. We do not record charge-offs on FVO loans which are carried at estimated fair value. We also do not record charge-offs on our loans held for sale which are carried either at fair value, or carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value.

Components of Results of Operations 
 Interest Income 
 We accrue interest on the UPB of our loans in accordance with the individual terms and conditions of each loan, discontinuing interest and reversing previously accrued interest once a loan becomes 90 days or more past due (nonaccrual status). When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the accrued and unpaid interest is reversed as a reduction to interest income and accrued interest receivable. Interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash payments are received or when the loan has returned to accrual status. Payments received on nonaccrual loans are first applied to interest due, then principal. Interest accrual resumes once a borrower has made all principal and interest payments due, bringing the loan back to current status. 
 Interest income on loans held for investment is comprised of interest income on loans and prepayment fees less the amortization of deferred net costs related to the origination of loans. Interest income on loans held for sale is comprised of interest income earned on loans prior to their sale. The net fees and costs associated with loans held for sale are deferred as part of the carrying value of the loan and recognized as a gain or loss on the sale of the loan. 
 Interest Expense Portfolio Related 
 Portfolio related interest expense is incurred on the debt we incur to fund our loan origination and portfolio activities and consists of our warehouse repurchase facilities and securitizations. Portfolio related interest expense also includes the amortization of expenses incurred as a result of issuing the debt, which are amortized using the level yield method. Key drivers of interest expense include the debt amounts outstanding, interest rates, and the mix of our securitizations and warehouse liabilities. 
 Net Interest Income Portfolio Related 
 Portfolio related net interest income represents the difference between interest income and portfolio related interest expense. 
 Interest Expense Corporate Debt 
 Interest expense on corporate debt primarily consists of interest expense paid with respect to the 2021 Term Loan and the 2022 Term Loan, as reflected on our consolidated balance sheets, and the related amortization of deferred debt issuance costs. 
 26 

Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income represents the difference between portfolio related net interest income and interest expense on corporate debt. 
 Provision for Loan Losses 
 Effective January 1, 2020 , we adopted ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments replacing the incurred loss accounting approach with the current expected credit loss (CECL) approach. Under the CECL methodology, the allowance for credit losses is calculated using a third-party model with our historical loss rates by segment, loans position as of the balance sheet date, and assumptions from us. 
 Other Operating Income 
 Gain on Disposition of Loans. When we sell a loan held for sale, we record a gain or loss that reflects the difference between the proceeds received for the sale of the loans and their respective carrying values. The gain or loss that we ultimately realize on the sale of our loans held for sale is primarily determined by the terms of the originated loans, current market interest rates and the sales price of the loans. In addition, when we transfer a loan to REO, we record the REO at its fair value at the time of the transfer. The difference between the fair value of the real estate and the carrying value of the loan is recorded as a gain or loss. Lastly, when our acquired loans, which were purchased at a discount, pay off, we record a gain related to the recognition of the remaining purchase discount. 
 Unrealized Gain/(Loss) on Fair Value Loans. We have elected to apply the fair value option accounting to all of our originated mortgage loans on a go-forward basis beginning October 1, 2022. We also elected to account for certain purchased distressed loans at fair value using FASB ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments (ASC 825). We regularly estimate the fair value of these loans as discussed more fully in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Changes in fair value are reported as a component of other operating income within our consolidated statements of income. 
 Other Income. Other income includes the following: 
 Unrealized Gains/(Losses) on Retained Interest Only Securities . As part of the proceeds received for the sale of our held for sale loans, we may receive an interest only security that we mark to fair value at the end of each period.

Provision for Income Taxes 
 The provision for income taxes consists of the current and deferred U.S. federal and state income taxes we expect to pay, currently and in future years, with respect to the net income for the year. The amount of the provision is derived by adjusting our reported pretax income with various permanent differences. The tax-adjusted income amount is then multiplied by the applicable federal and state income tax rates to arrive at the provision for income taxes.

Interest Income. Interest income increased by 58.4 million, or 32.1 , to 240.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 182.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to higher portfolio balances offset by a decrease in the average yield. The average yield decreased to 7.77 from 8.56 . Average loans increased 966.4 million, or 45.4 , from 2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 3.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in average yield is attributable to higher collection of delinquent and default interest in 2021. 
 The following table distinguishes between the change in interest income attributable to change in volume and the change in interest income attributable to change in rate. The effect of changes in volume is determined by 
 28 

multiplying the change in average loan balance 966.4 million) by the previous period s average yield (8.56 ). Similarly, the effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average yield (0.79 by the current period s average loan balance 3.1 billion).

Interest Expense Portfolio Related. Portfolio related interest expense consists of interest incurred on our warehouse facilities and securitizations, which increased by 42.3 million, or 49.4 , to 127.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from 85.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in portfolio related interest expense in 2022 was primarily attributable to an increase in loan portfolio.

Interest Expense Corporate Debt . Corporate debt interest expense increased by 8.9 million from 20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 29.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to the fees associated with paying off our 2021 term loan early. The corporate debt balance was 215.0 million as of December 31, 2022 compared to 170.8 million as of December 31, 2021, as a result of the 2022 Term Loan agreement we entered into in March 2022. 
 Provision for (reversal of) Loan Losses . Our provision for loan losses increased by approximately 1.4 million from the reversal of 0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to a provision of 1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in provision for loan losses is primarily attributable to an increase in general reserve resulting from the increased non-FVO loan portfolio.

Other Operating Income 
 The table below presents the various components of other operating income for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The 14.0 million net increase is primarily due to the unrealized gains related to loans originated after September 30, 2022 and the 2022 election of fair value option for our Century mortgage servicing rights.

Compensation and Employee Benefits . Compensation and employee benefits increased from 19.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 to 30.5 million during year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was attributable to higher commission expense driven by the increase in loan originations and not deferring compensations costs attributable to loan origination activities on FVO loans starting on October 1, 2022. 
 Rent and Occupancy . Rent and occupancy expenses remained relatively consistent between 1.7 million to 1.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 Loan Servicing . Loan servicing expenses increased from 8.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 to 12.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. The 4.0 million increase during the year ended December 31, 2022 is mainly due to the increase in our loan portfolio. 
 Professional Fees . Professional fees remained relatively consistent from 3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Net Expenses of Real Estate Owned . Net expenses of real estate owned decreased from 3.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 to income of 70 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2022. The 3.2 million decrease is mainly due to a higher gain on sale of REOs resolved by our special servicing team. 
 30 

Other Operating Expenses. Other operating expenses increased from 8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, mainly due to an increase in appraisal costs on higher origination volume and resumed marketing activity via trade shows after a pandemic-impacted 2021. 
 Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense was 12.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our consolidated effective tax rate as a percentage of pre-tax income for 2022 was 27.2 , compared to 26.6 for 2021. The 2021 effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 21 principally because of state taxes.

Interest Income. Interest income increased by 14.6 million, or 8.8 , to 182.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 167.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily attributable to the increase in average yield and an increase in average loans (volume). The average yield increased to 8.56 from 8.19 . Average loans increased 82.2 million, or 4.0 , from 2.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 to 2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in average yield is primarily attributable to the recognition of default interest and prepayment fees for resolutions of nonperforming loans. 
 The following table distinguishes between the change in interest income attributable to change in volume and the change in interest income attributable to change in rate. The effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in average loan balance (i.e., 82.2 million) by the previous period s average yield (i.e., 8.19 ). Similarly, the effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average yield (i.e., 0.37 by the current period s average loan balance (i.e., 2.1 billion).

Interest Expense Portfolio Related. Portfolio related interest expense consists of interest incurred on our warehouse facilities and securitizations, which decreased by 2.4 million, or 2.8 , to 85.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from 87.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in portfolio related interest expense in 2021 was primarily attributable to the lower cost of funds, which decreased to 4.71 for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 4.87 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in cost of funds was partially offset by the increase in average debt balance. The lower cost of funds was mainly attributable to improved securitization spreads.

Interest Expense Corporate Debt. Corporate debt interest expense increased by 8.6 million from 12.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to 20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to the increase in corporate debt balance. The corporate debt balance was 170.8 million as of December 31, 2021 compared to 78.0 million as of December 31, 2020, as a result of 2021 Term Loan agreement we entered into in February 2021. 
 Provision for Loan Losses. Our provision for loan losses decreased by approximately 5.4 million from the provision of 5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to a reversal of 0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in provision for loan losses is primarily attributable to the improvement in the U.S economy as the U.S economy continues to recover from the negative impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. 
 Other Operating Income 
 The table below presents the various components of other operating income for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The 1.9 million net increase is primarily due to the unrealized loss in 2020 related to interest-only securities that matured in 2020. The unrealized loss on interest-only securities is included in other income (expense).

Compensation and Employee Benefits . Compensation and employee benefits decreased from 20.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 to 19.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. During April through August of 2020, when loan originations were suspended and staff was working on offering existing borrowers the COVID-19 forbearance program, compensation costs for the employees were expensed when, under normal operating conditions, the same compensation costs would be deferred over new loan production. 
 Rent and Occupancy . Rent and occupancy expenses remained relatively consistent at approximately 1.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021 due to no change in office space. 
 Loan Servicing . Loan servicing expenses increased from 7.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 to 8.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. The 0.5 million increase during the year ended 2021 is mainly due to the increase in our loan portfolio. 
 Professional Fees . Professional fees decreased from 4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to 3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 mainly due to the decrease in legal fees related to the IPO class action lawsuit which was dismissed in January 2021. 
 Net Expenses of Real Estate Owned . Net expenses of real estate owned increased from 2.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 to 3.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. The 0.5 million increase is mainly due to a smaller gain on disposition and the increase in taxes and insurance for the properties. 
 Other Operating Expenses . Other operating expenses slightly increased from 8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to 8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 mainly due to the increase in appraisal fee expenses. 
 Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense was 10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our consolidated effective tax rate as a percentage of pre-tax income for 2021 was 26.6 , compared to 23.1 for 2020. The 2021 effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 21 principally because of state taxes.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources and Uses of Liquidity 
 We fund our lending activities primarily through borrowings under our warehouse repurchase facilities, securitizations, other corporate-level debt, equity and debt securities, and net cash provided by operating activities to manage our business. We use cash to originate and acquire investor real estate loans, repay principal and interest on our borrowings, fund our operations and meet other general business needs. 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 Our total liquidity plus available warehouse capacity was 559.3 million as of December 31, 2022 comprised of 45.2 million in cash, 14.0 million of available borrowings for unencumbered loans and 500.1 million of available warehouse capacity. 
 As of December 31, 2021, we had liquidity of approximately 47.0 million in cash and cash equivalents comprised of approximately 36.0 million of unrestricted cash and 11.0 million of available liquidity on unfinanced loans. As of December 31, 2021, we had 349.9 million of available capacity under our warehouse and repurchase facilities. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated approximately 14.5 million of net cash and cash equivalents from operations, investing and financing activities. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we used approximately 27.3 million of net cash and cash equivalents from operations, investing and financing activities. 
 34 

Warehouse Facilities 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had five non-mark-to-market warehouse facilities and one modified mark-to-market warehouse facility to support our loan origination and acquisition facilities. One agreement is a two-year warehouse repurchase facility, three agreements are one-year warehouse repurchase facilities and two agreements are three-year warehouse facilities. The borrowings are collateralized by primarily performing loans, two of the warehouse facilities bear interest at one-month LIBOR and four warehouse facility at SOFR, all at margins that range from 2.75 to 4.50 . We also had a short term repurchase agreement with a maximum borrowing capacity of 18.8 million. Borrowing under these facilities was 331.7 million with 500.1 million of available capacity under our warehouse and repurchase facilities as of December 31, 2022. 
 As of December 31, 2021, we had four non-mark-to-market warehouse facilities and one modified mark-to-market warehouse facility to support our loan origination and acquisition facilities. One agreement is a two-year warehouse repurchase facility, two agreements are one-year warehouse repurchase facilities and two agreements are three-year warehouse facilities. The borrowings are collateralized by primarily performing loans, bearing interest at one-month LIBOR with a 0.75 floor plus a margin that ranges from 2.75 to 4.50 . Borrowing under these facilities was 300.1 million with 349.9 million of available capacity under our warehouse and repurchase facilities as of December 31, 2021. 
 All warehouse facilities fund less than 100 of the principal balance of the mortgage loans we own requiring us to use working capital to fund the remaining portion. We may need to use additional working capital if loans become delinquent, because the amount permitted to be financed by the facilities may change based on the delinquency performance of the pledged collateral. 
 All borrower payments on loans financed under the warehouse facilities are segregated into pledged accounts with the loan servicer. All principal amounts in excess of the interest due are applied to reduce the outstanding borrowings under the warehouse facilities, which then allows us to draw additional funds on a revolving basis under the facilities. The revolving warehouse facilities also contain customary covenants, including but not limited to financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum net worth, a maximum debt-to-net worth ratio and a ratio of a minimum earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to interest expense. If we fail to meet any of the covenants or otherwise default under the facilities, the lenders have the right to terminate their facility and require immediate repayment, which may require us to sell our loans at less than optimal terms. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with these covenants. 
 Securitizations 
 From May 2011 through December 2022, we have completed 25 securitizations, issuing 5.4 billion in principal amount of securities to third parties. All borrower payments are segregated into remittance accounts at the primary servicer and remitted to the trustee of each trust monthly. We are the sole beneficial interest holder of the applicable trusts, which are variable interest entities included in our consolidated financial statements. The transactions are accounted for as a secured borrowings under U.S. GAAP. Tables summarizing the investor real estate loans securitized, securities issued, securities retained by the Company at the time of the securitization, and as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the stated maturity for each securitization, the outstanding bond balances, and the weighted average rate on the securities for the Trusts as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, are included in Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules. The securities are callable by us when the stated principal balance is less than a certain percentage, ranging from 10 30 , of the original stated principal balance of loans at issuance. As a result, the actual maturity date of the securities issued will likely be earlier than their respective stated maturity date. 
 Our intent is to use the proceeds from the issuance of new securities primarily to repay our warehouse borrowings and originate new investor real estate loans in accordance with our underwriting guidelines, as well as for general corporate purposes. Our financing sources may include borrowings in the form of additional bank credit facilities (including term loans and revolving credit facilities), repurchase agreements, warehouse repurchase facilities and other sources of private financing. We also plan to continue using securitization as long-term financing for our portfolio, and we do not plan to structure any securitizations as sales or utilize off-balance-sheet vehicles. We believe any financing of assets and/or securitizations we may undertake will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements.

Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements

 New Accounting Standards 
 ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. The amendments in this ASU eliminate the recognition and measurement guidance for troubled debt restructuring by Creditors and require enhanced disclosures for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. ASU 2022-02 requires that an entity disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables. This ASU is effective January 1, 2023 for the Company. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Intentionally omitted pursuant to smaller reporting company reduced disclosure requirements.

Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) for the Company. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures that: 
 Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; 

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and 

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Our management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, the end of our fiscal year. Management based its assessment on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2022. 
 The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by , our independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report, which appears herein in Item 8.

Report of Independent Regist ered Public Accounting Firm 
 Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Velocity Financial, Inc. 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Velocity Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders'/members equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013, and our report dated March 13, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Emphasis of Matter 
 As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has elected to change its method of accounting to record loans originated on or after October 1, 2022, at fair value. The 2022 financial statements reflect the accounting method change. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 F- 2 

Valuation of allowance for loan losses management s assessment of forecasted economic scenarios 
 As described in Notes 2 and 6 to the financial statements, the Company s allowance for loan losses totaled 4.9 million as of December 31, 2022. The allowance for loan losses is calculated under the expected credit loss model and is an estimate of life-of-loan losses for the Company s loans held for investment. 
 The allowance for loan losses consists of an asset-specific component for estimating loan losses for individual loans that do not share risk characteristics with other loans and a collective pooled component for estimating loan losses for pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics. The allowance for the collective pooled component is derived from an estimate of expected loan losses primarily using an expected loss methodology that incorporates certain risk characteristics that are derived from internally developed and third-party models using the open pool method. 
 To determine the loss rates for the open pool method, the Company starts with its historical database of losses, segmenting the loans by loan purpose, product type and repayment period to estimate annual average loss rates. The model then adjusts the annual average loss rates for macroeconomic forecasts over a reasonable and supportable period, followed by a straight-line reversion to the historical loss rates. 
 Management considered multiple scenarios from different macroeconomic forecasts and selected one forecast scenario with a reasonable and supportable forecast period of eight quarters as of December 31, 2022. 
 The estimation of the allowance for loan losses for pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics involves many inputs and assumptions. These inputs and assumptions include, among others, the selection, evaluation and measurement of the reasonable and supportable forecast scenarios discussed above, which requires management to apply judgment and that is subject to change as forecasted economic events evolve. 
 We identified the determination and evaluation of the forecasted economic component of the allowance for loan losses as a critical audit matter because auditing the underlying assumptions and evaluation of the forecasts used in the allowance for loan losses involved a degree of complexity and auditor judgment. Our audit procedures related to management s evaluation and establishment of the forecasted economic scenarios in the allowance for loan losses included the following, among others: 
 We obtained an understanding of the relevant controls related to the evaluation and establishment of the forecasted economic scenarios component of the allowance for loan losses and tested such controls for design and operating effectiveness, including controls related to the assessment and review of the forecasted economic scenarios and management s review and approval of the allowance for loan losses calculation. 

We tested management s process and significant judgments in the evaluation and establishment of the forecasted economic scenarios component of the allowance for loan losses which included: 

o Evaluating management s considerations and data utilized as a basis for the selection of forecasted economic scenarios. 

o Evaluating the reasonableness of management s judgments related to the selection of forecasted scenarios. 

o Agreeing management s calculated adjustments for forecasted economic scenarios to the allowance for loan losses calculation. 

F- 3 

Accounting for loans at fair value significant assumptions used in the valuation model that are unobservable inputs 
 As described in Notes 2, 6 and 26 to the financial statements, the Company has elected the fair value option to measure all loans originated on or after October 1, 2022, at fair value. As of December 31, 2022, loans held for investment, at fair value, were 276 million. The Company utilized a third-party valuation model and unobservable inputs to estimate the fair value of the loans held for investment recorded at fair value. Management determines the fair value of these loans using a discounted cash flow model that estimates future cash flows of these loans using key loan metrics and significant unobservable inputs. The significant assumptions used in the valuation model include those related to prepayment speeds, loss severity, default rates and discount rates. 
 We have identified the fair value of loans held for investment as a critical audit matter because of the unobservable inputs management uses to estimate fair value and the fact that the assumptions noted above could result in a significant change in the loans fair value measurement. Auditing the significant assumptions involved a degree of complexity, a high degree of auditor judgment and increased audit effort through the use of auditor-employed valuation specialists. 
 Our audit procedures related to testing management s evaluation and establishment of significant assumptions included the following, among others: 
 Testing the effectiveness of internal controls over the fair value of loans held for investment, including management s controls over the evaluation of the reasonableness of unobservable inputs used in the valuation. 

Testing the completeness and accuracy of the source information derived from the Company s loan data, which is used in the valuation model. 

Evaluating the related assumptions for reasonableness, including significant unobservable inputs, with the use of auditor employed valuation specialists. 

Comparing the actual prices of loans sold in January 2023 to the fair value estimated by management using the model described above and comparing the key characteristics of the loans sold to the characteristics of the remaining loans held for investment carried at fair value.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Velocity Financial, Inc. 
 Opinion on the Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited Velocity Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income,, stockholders /members equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated March 13, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 F- 5 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 
 
 for the purpose of acquiring all membership units in Velocity Commercial Capital, LLC (VCC). On January 16, 2020, Velocity Financial, LLC converted from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation and changed its name to Velocity Financial, Inc. Upon completion of the conversion, the Velocity Financial, LLC s Class A equity units of and Class D equity units of were converted to shares of Velocity Financial, Inc. common stock. On January 22, 2020, the Company completed its initial public offering of shares of common stock at a price to the public of per share. On January 28, 2020, the Company completed the sale of an additional shares of its common stock, representing the full exercise of the underwriters option to purchase additional shares, at a public offering price of per share. The Company s stock trades on The New York Stock Exchange under the symbol VEL . VCC, a California LLC formed on June 2, 2004, is a mortgage lender that originates and acquires small balance investor real estate loans, providing capital to the investor real estate loan market. The Company is licensed as a California Finance Lender and, as such, is required to maintain a minimum net worth of thousand. The Company does not believe there is any potential risk of not being able to meet this regulatory requirement. The Company uses its equity capital and borrowed funds to originate and invest in investor real estate loans and seeks to generate income based on the difference between the yield on its investor real estate loan portfolio and the cost of its borrowings. The Company does not engage in any other significant line of business or offer any other products or services, nor does it originate or acquire investments outside of the United States of America. The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, is the sole beneficial owner of the Velocity Commercial Capital Loan Trusts, from the 2016-1 Trust through and including the 2022-5 Trust, all of which are New York common law trusts, with the exception of VCC 2022-MC1 Trust which is a Delaware statutory trust. The Trusts are bankruptcy remote, variable interest entities (VIE) formed for the purpose of providing secured borrowings to the Company and are consolidated with the accounts of the Company. On December 28, 2021, the Company acquired an ownership interest in Century Health Housing Capital, LLC Century ). Century is a licensed Ginnie Mae issuer/servicer that provides government-insured Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgage financing for multifamily housing, senior housing and long-term care/assisted living facilities. Century originates loans through its borrower-direct origination channel and services the loans through its in-house servicing platform, which enables the formation of long-term relationships with its clients and drives strong portfolio retention. Century is a consolidated subsidiary of the Company as of completion of the acquisition. In addition, as a servicer of Ginnie Mae loans, Century is required to maintain a minimum net worth, and Century is in compliance with this requirement as of December 31, 2022. 

The deferred loans under the Company s forbearance program are considered current at the time of deferral, and the Company continues to accrue interest on these loans. Deferred loans that subsequently went 90 days past due after the deferral date were placed on nonaccrual status with any accrued interest income reversed through earnings. The Company evaluates the COVID-19 forbearance-granted loans on an individual basis to determine if a reserve should be established on the collectability of the unamortized cost and accrued interest, and whether any loans should be placed on nonaccrual status. For originated loans prior to October 1, 2022, carried at amortized cost, net deferred loan origination costs are amortized to interest income using the level yield method. Loan origination fees and costs on loans originated or acquired after September 30, 2022 are expensed as incurred. Loans are classified as held for sale when management has the intent to sell them. Loans held for sale originated prior to October 1, 2022 are carried at lower of cost or estimated fair value. Loans held for sale originated or acquired effective October 1, 2022 are carried at estimated fair value. The Century loans are considered as held for sale until they meet the sale criteria describe in the following paragraphs, which is generally when they are delivered to GNMA in exchange for GNMA securities. The Company will service the loan for Ginnie Mae. On occasion, as part of the Company s management strategy of the loans held in its portfolio, the Company will transfer loans from held for investment to held for sale. Upon transfer of any loans that were held at amortized cost, any associated allowance for loan loss is charged off and the carrying value of the loan is adjusted to the lower of cost or estimated fair value. The net deferred fees and costs associated with loans held for sale are deferred (not accreted or amortized to interest income) until the related loans are sold. The Company recognizes transfers of loans as sales when it surrenders control over the loans. Control over transferred loans is deemed to be surrendered when (1) the loans have been isolated from the Company, (2) the transferee has the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred loans, and (3) the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred loans through either (a) an agreement that entitles and obligates the Company to repurchase or redeem them before their maturity or (b) the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return the specific loans. Gains or losses on the sale of these loans are included in Gain on disposition of loans in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Interest income on loans held for sale is recognized over the life of the loans using their contractual interest rates. Income recognition is suspended, and the unpaid interest receivable is reversed against interest income when loans become 90 days delinquent, or when, in management s opinion, a full recovery of interest and principal becomes doubtful. Income recognition is resumed when the loan becomes contractually current. 
 
 from origination. Long term loans have a maturity of up to from origination. The Company estimates the allowance for loan losses using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to historical performance, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable macroeconomic forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are considered for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency levels, or term, as well as for changes in environmental conditions, such as unemployment rates, property values and changes in the competitive or regulatory environment. The Company uses an open pool loss rate methodology to model expected credit losses. To determine the loss rates for the open pool method, the Company starts with its historical database of losses, segmenting the loans by loan purpose, product type and repayment period. A third-party model applying the open pool method is used to estimate an annual average loss rates by dividing the respective pool's quarterly historical losses by the pool's respective prior quarter s ending unamortized loan cost balance and deriving an annual average loss rate from the historical quarterly loss rates. The model then adjusts the annual average loss rates based upon macroeconomic forecasts over a reasonable and supportable period, followed by a straight-line reversion to the historical loss rates. The adjusted annual average loss rates are applied to the forecasted pool balance within each segment. The forecasted balances in the loan pool segments are calculated based on a principal amortization using contractual maturity, factoring in further principal reductions from estimated prepayments. Estimated prepayments, or Constant Prepayment Rates CPRs are developed from multiple loan characteristic considerations, such as property types, FICO scores, loan purpose, and prepayment penalty terms, which is the most significant driver of prepayment activity. The prepayment penalty terms differ between the short-term and long-term loans, and the Company has developed a CPR curve for its short-term loans or less) and one for its long-term loans ). Data from 2012-2022 is used to develop prepayment rates for the Company s long-term loans. Because of the prepayment penalty structure in the Company s long-term loans, prepayments during the active penalty term are historically low and begin to ramp up after the prepayment penalty term. The active prepayment penalty term is considered for existing and new loans over the reasonable and supportable forecast period in determining estimated prepayments. The Company back-tests the CPR curves on a quarterly basis and adjusts the CPR curves as appropriate. The reasonable and supportable period is meant to represent the period in which the Company believes the forecasted macroeconomic variables can be reasonably estimated. Significant variables or assumptions incorporated in the macroeconomic forecasts include U.S. unemployment, treasury yields, U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP), and U.S. real estate housing prices. The Company considers multiple scenarios from different macroeconomic forecasts and uses different forecast and revision periods for estimating lifetime expected credit losses. For the December 31, 2020 CECL estimate, the Company considered a COVID-19 adverse stress scenario and a COVID-19 severe stress scenario, both with a five-quarter reasonable and supportable forecast period followed by a four-quarter straight-line reversion period. Management decided that using only the adverse stress scenario did not factor for recent additional COVID-related risks such as the post-holiday spike in infections and deaths, unknown impact of a recent mutant virus, success of the vaccine, and impact of recent Presidential executive orders. Management concluded that applying a 50 weight to the adverse and severe stress scenarios was appropriate given the status of the pandemic at year-end. The various scenarios, the weighting of scenarios, as well as the forecast period and reversion to historical loss is subject to change as conditions in the market change and the Company s ability to forecast economic events evolves. For the December 31, 2021 CECL estimate, the Company considered a COVID-19 severe stress scenario with a five-quarter reasonable and supportable forecast period followed by a four-quarter straight-line reversion period. The various scenarios, as well as the forecast period and reversion to historical loss is subject to change as conditions in the market change and the Company s ability to forecast economic events evolves. For the December 31, 2022 CECL estimate, the Company considered a severe stress scenario with an eight-quarter reasonable and supportable forecast period followed by a two-quarter straight-line reversion period. The various scenarios, as well as the forecast period and reversion to historical loss is subject to change as conditions in the market change and the Company s ability to forecast economic events evolves. The Company has determined that once a loan becomes nonperforming (90 or more days past due), it no longer shares the same risk characteristics of the other loans within its segment of homogeneous loans (pool). The Company pulls these loans out of the segments and evaluates the loans individually using the practical expedient to determine the credit exposure. Nonperforming loans are considered collateral dependent by the Company. Using the practical expedient, the fair value of the underlying collateral, less estimated selling costs, is compared to the carrying value of the loan in the determination of a credit loss. The allowance for loan losses for individually assessed or evaluated loans is the difference between the fair value of the collateral underlying the loans at the reporting date, adjusted for estimated selling costs, and the amortized cost basis. The allowance for loan losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. Loans are charged off against the allowance when the Company believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level deemed adequate by management to provide for expected losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet date. While management uses available information to estimate its required allowance for loan losses, future additions to the allowance for credit losses may be necessary based on changes in estimates resulting from economic and other conditions. The Company has made the accounting policy election not to measure an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivables. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the accrued and unpaid interest is reversed as a reduction of interest income and accrued interest receivable. Accrued interest receivable is excluded from the amortized cost of loans and it is presented as accrued interest receivable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Effective October 1, 2022, the Company elected to apply FVO accounting to its newly originated loans. Loans carried at fair value do not require a separate allowance for loan loss since any loan impairment will be reflected in the fair value of the loan. All loans originated or acquired prior to October 1, 2022, are carried at amortized cost and are subject to a CECL reserve. 

. Software is amortized over the estimated useful lives of the specific assets, which range from three to using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lives of the respective leases or the service lives of the improvements, whichever is shorter. 
 
 off-balance-sheet assets or liabilities with credit exposure. 
 In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the DTA will or will not be realized. The Company's ultimate realization of the DTA is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the nature and amount of historical and projected future taxable income, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and available tax planning strategies in making this assessment. The amount of deferred taxes recognized could be impacted by changes to any of these variables. The Company determines whether its tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authorities, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the positions in question. Income tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An income tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that management believes has a greater than 50 likelihood of realization upon settlement. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. 
 of the lesser of the fair market value of the stock on the first or the last trading day of each offering period. The Company records compensation expenses related to the discount given to participating employees. Compensation expense for performance stock units is measured using the fair value at the date of grant and recorded over each vesting period, and may be adjusted over the vesting period based on interim estimates of performance against the pre-set objectives. Compensation expense for all stock-based awards is recognized in the consolidated financial statements on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally defined as the vesting period. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur and the income tax effects of awards are recognized in the consolidated statements of income when awards vest or are settled.

The Company has made the accounting policy election not to measure an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivables. The Company has also made the accounting policy election to write off accrued interest receivables by reversing interest income when loans are placed on nonaccrual status, or 90 days or more past due, other than the COVID-19 forbearance-granted loans. Any future payments received for these loans will be recognized on a cash basis. The Company continues to evaluate the COVID-19 forbearance-granted loans on an individual basis to determine if a reserve should be established on the collectability of the accrued interest and whether any loans should be placed on nonaccrual status at a future date.

(c) Credit Quality Indicator 

 A credit quality indicator is a statistic used by the Company to monitor and assess the credit quality of loans held for investment, excluding loans held for investment at fair value. The Company monitors its charge-off rate in relation to its nonperforming loans as its credit quality indicator. The charge-offs over the average nonperforming loans were , , and for the years ended December 31, 2022 , 2021 and 2020 , respectively. The recovery rates on long-term nonperforming assets were , and for the years ended December 31, 2022 , 2021 and 2020 , respectively. On short-term nonperforming assets, the recovery rates were and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Short-term loans were classified as held for sale during the year ended December 31, 2020. Other credit quality indicators include aging status and accrual status. Nonperforming loans are loans that are 90 or more days past due, in bankruptcy, in foreclosure, or not accruing interest. million and million loans in the Company s COVID-19 forbearance program as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively (in thousands):

The Company s main temporary difference is due to the difference between the U.S. income tax and U.S. GAAP treatment with respect to its REMIC securities. For tax purposes, the issuances are considered taxable sales; whereas, for U.S. GAAP purposes, the REMIC issuances are considered financings. Federal net operating loss NOL carryforwards of million generated after 2017 are available to offset future U.S. federal taxable income over an indefinite period. State NOL carryforwards totaling million are available to offset future taxable income and began to expire in . NOL carryforward periods for the various states jurisdictions generally range from to years. The Company had valuation allowance as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Based on the Company s estimates of taxable income over the years in which the items giving rise to the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences. The Company files tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by federal, state, and local jurisdictions, where applicable. As of December 31, 2022, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. tax examinations for years before 2019 and is no longer subject to state tax examinations for years before 2018. The Company periodically reviews its income tax positions based on tax laws and regulations and financial reporting considerations, and records adjustments as appropriate. This review takes into consideration the status of current taxing authorities' examinations of the Company's tax returns, recent positions taken by the taxing authorities on similar transactions, if any, and the overall tax environment. The Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of million recorded as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 . If recognized, million of the unrecognized tax benefit would affect the 2022 annual effective tax rate. Interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits is reported by the Company as a component of tax expense, and the Company recorded interest and penalties in its consolidated statements of income in the amount of million, million, and million as of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , the accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits remained at million. There are no positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within 12 months of the reporting date.

newly issued shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value per share (the Preferred ), at a price per share of 1,000 , plus warrants (the Warrants to purchase an aggregate of shares of the Company s common stock to funds affiliated with Snow Phipps and a fund affiliated with Pacific Investment Management Company LLC (TOBI). Snow Phipps and TOBI are considered affiliates and, therefore, are related parties to the Company. On October 8, 2021, the Company exercised its option to convert all of its outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock into shares of its common stock. In the ordinary course of business, the Company sells held for sale loans to various financial institutions through a market bidding process. As a result of this process, the Company may sell held for sale loans to an affiliate. The Company sold 188.4 million and 0.1 million in UPB of loans to an affiliate during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

 The Company determines the fair value estimate of loans held for investment using a third-party loan valuation model, a Level 3 measurement. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s mortgage loans held for investment are discount rates, prepayment speeds, loss severity, and default rates. Significant changes in any of those inputs could result in a significant change to the loans fair value measurement. d) Collateral Dependent or Loans Individually Evaluated 

 Nonaccrual loans held for investment at amortized cost are evaluated individually and are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. To the extent such a loan is collateral dependent, the Company determines the allowance for credit losses based on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral. The fair value of each loan s collateral is generally based on appraisals or broker price opinions obtained, less estimated costs to sell, a Level 3 measurement. e) Loans Held for Sale 

 Loans held for sale that were originated prior to October 1, 2022, are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, with fair value adjustments recorded on a nonrecurring basis. The Company uses a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of loans held for sale, a Level 3 measurement. f) Loans Held for Sale, at Fair Value 

 Loans held for sale that are originated effective October 1, 2022, are carried at fair value. The Company determines the fair value estimate of loans held for sale using a third-party loan valuation model, a Level 3 measurement. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s mortgage loans held for investment are discount rates, prepayment speeds, loss severity, and default rates. Significant changes in any of those inputs could result in a significant change to the loans fair value measurement. The Company has also elected to account for certain loans originated with the intent to sell to Ginnie Mae at fair value. These loans are measured based on the fair value of securities backed by similar mortgage loans, adjusted for certain factors to approximate the fair value, including the value attributable to mortgage servicing and credit risk, and current commitments to purchase loans, a Level 2 measurement. Management identified all of these loans to be accounted for at estimated fair value at the instrument level. Changes in fair value are reflected in income as they occur. g) Interest-Only Strips 

 The Company retains an interest-only strip on certain sales of held for sale loans. The interest-only strips are classified as trading securities under FASB ASC Topic 320, Investments-Debt Securities . The interest-only strips are measured based on their estimated fair values using a discounted cash flow model, a Level 3 measurement. Changes in fair value are reflected in income as they occur. h) Loans Held for Investment, at Fair Value 

 The Company has elected to account for certain purchased distressed loans held for investment, at fair value (the FVO Loans) using FASB ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments (ASC 825). The FVO loans are measured based on their estimated fair values. Management identified all of these loans to be accounted for at estimated fair value at the instrument level. Changes in fair value are reflected in income as they occur. The Company uses a modified discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value at instrument level, a Level 3 measurement. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s mortgage loans held for investment, at fair value are discount rate, property values, prepayment speeds, loss severity, and default rates. Significant changes in any of those inputs in isolation could result in a significant change to the loans fair value measurement. i) Real Estate Owned, Net (REO) 

 Real estate owned, net is initially recorded at the property s estimated fair value, based on appraisals or broker price opinions obtained, less estimated costs to sell, at the acquisition date, a Level 3 measurement. From time to time, nonrecurring fair value adjustments are made to real estate owned, net based on the current updated appraised value of the property, or management s judgment and estimation of value based on recent market trends or negotiated sales prices with potential buyers. j) Mortgage Servicing Rights 

 The Company determined the fair values based on a third-party valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income, a Level 3 measurement. k) Secured Financing, Net (Corporate Debt) 

 The Company determined the fair values estimate of the secured financing using the estimated cash flows discounted at an appropriate market rate, a Level 3 measurement. l) Warehouse Repurchase Facilities, Net 

 Warehouse repurchase facilities are recorded at historical cost. The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value as these instruments have short-term maturities of one-year or less and interest rates that approximate market plus a spread, a Level 2 measurement. m) Securitizations, Net 

 The fair value estimate of securities issued is determined by using estimated cash flows discounted at an appropriate market rate, a Level 3 measurement. n) Accrued Interest Receivable and Accrued Interest Payable 

 The carrying amounts of accrued interest receivable and accrued interest payable approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments, a Level 1 measurement. The Company does not have any off-balance sheet financial instruments. o) Receivables Due From Servicers 

 The carrying amounts of receivables due from servicers approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments, a Level 1 measurement. p) Fair Value Disclosures

The Company estimates the fair value of certain financial instruments on a quarterly basis. These instruments are recorded at fair value using a valuation allowance only if they are impaired. As described above, these adjustments to fair value usually result from the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting or write-downs of individual assets. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , the only financial assets measured at fair value were certain impaired loans held for investment, loans held for sale, interest-only strips, REO and FVO loans, which were measured using unobservable inputs, including appraisals and broker price opinions on the values of the underlying collateral. Impaired loans were carried at approximately million and million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , net of specific allowance for loan losses of approximately million and million, respectively. A financial instrument is cash, evidence of an ownership interest in an entity, or a contract that creates a contractual obligation or right to deliver or receive cash or another financial instrument from a second entity on potentially favorable terms. The methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of the Company s financial instruments are described above.
