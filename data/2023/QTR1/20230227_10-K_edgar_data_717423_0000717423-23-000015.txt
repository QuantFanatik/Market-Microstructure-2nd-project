 Summary 
 Murphy Oil Corporation is a global oil and natural gas exploration and production company, with both onshore and offshore operations and properties. As used in this report, the terms Murphy, Murphy Oil, we, our, its and Company may refer to Murphy Oil Corporation or any one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 The Company was originally incorporated in Louisiana in 1950 as Murphy Corporation. It was reincorporated in Delaware in 1964, at which time it adopted the name Murphy Oil Corporation and was reorganized in 1983 to operate primarily as a holding company of its various businesses. In 2013, the U.S. downstream business was separated from Murphy Oil Corporation s oil and natural gas exploration and production business. For reporting purposes, Murphy s exploration and production activities are subdivided into three geographic segments, including the United States, Canada and all other countries. Additionally, the Corporate segment includes interest income, interest expense, foreign exchange effects, corporate risk management activities and administrative costs not allocated to the exploration and production segments. The Company s corporate headquarters are located in Houston, Texas following relocation from El Dorado, Arkansas in 2020. 
 As part of the Company s underlying operations, the Company is continually monitoring its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and impact on the environment as well as other social and environmental aspects of its business. See Sustainability on page 10. 
 In addition to the following information about each business activity, data about Murphy s operations, properties and business segments, including revenues by class of products and financial information by geographic area, are provided on pages 32 through 47, 80 through 81, 104 through 106, 110 through 125 and 127 of this Form 10-K report.

 U.S. in 2022. These amounts represented 92.2 of the Company s total worldwide oil and natural gas liquids and 23.0 of worldwide natural gas production volumes. 
 Offshore 
 The Company holds rights to approximately 620 thousand gross acres in the Gulf of Mexico. During 2022, approximately 70 of total U.S. hydrocarbon production was produced at fields in the Gulf of Mexico, of which approximately 79 was derived from nine fields, including Khaleesi, Mormont, Cascade, Chinook, Neidermeyer, Dalmatian, St. Malo, Kodiak and Lucius. Total average daily production in the Gulf of Mexico in 2022 was 70,008 barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids and 63 MMCF of natural gas. At December 31, 2022, Murphy had total proved reserves for Gulf of Mexico fields of 162.3 million barrels of oil and natural gas liquids and 124.9 billion cubic feet of natural gas. 
 The Company has various operated and non-operated fields in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The most significant fields are St. Malo, Khaleesi, Mormont, Samurai, Lucius and Dalmatian. The Khaleesi Mormont Samurai development project achieved first oil in 2022 and completed the initial seven well program. 
 Onshore 
 The Company holds rights to approximately 133 thousand gross acres in South Texas in the Eagle Ford Shale unconventional oil and natural gas play. During 2022, approximately 30 of total U.S. hydrocarbon production was produced in the Eagle Ford Shale. Total 2022 production in the Eagle Ford Shale area was 29,556 barrels of oil and liquids per day and 28.8 MMCF per day of natural gas. At December 31, 2022, the Company s proved reserves for the U.S. onshore business totaled 138.9 million barrels of liquids and 210 billion cubic feet of natural gas. 
 Canada 
 In Canada, the Company holds working interests in Tupper Montney (100 owned), Kaybob Duvernay (operated), Placid Montney (non-operated) and two non-operated offshore assets the Hibernia and Terra Nova fields, located offshore Newfoundland in the Jeanne d Arc Basin. 
 Onshore 
 Murphy has approximately 142 thousand gross acres of Tupper Montney mineral rights located in northeast British Columbia. In addition, the Company holds a 70 operated working interest in Kaybob Duvernay lands and a 30 non-operated working interest in liquids rich Placid Montney lands, both in Alberta. The Company has approximately 289 thousand gross acres of Kaybob Duvernay and Placid Montney mineral rights. Daily production in 2022 in onshore Canada averaged 4,908 barrels of liquids and 310 MMCF of natural gas. Total onshore Canada proved liquids and natural gas reserves at December 31, 2022, were approximately 21.4 million barrels and 1.9 trillion cubic feet, respectively. 
 The Company currently has a commitment for 483 million cubic feet per day (MMCFD) of natural gas processing capacity to support production in the Tupper Montney through April 2036, with the commitment reducing to 198 MMCFD for the remainder of the period until November 2040.

 Murphy Oil s 2022 total proved reserves and proved undeveloped reserves are reconciled from 2021 as presented in the table below: 
 Millions of oil equivalent barrels 1 
 Total Proved Reserves Total Proved Undeveloped Reserves Beginning of year 716.9 297.7 Revisions of previous estimates (23.6) (8.1) Extensions and discoveries 80.1 79.4 Improved recovery 5.3 5.3 Conversions to proved developed reserves (96.9) Purchases of properties 5.0 2.0 Sale of properties (4.4) Production (63.9) End of year 2 
 715.4 279.4 
 1 For purposes of these computations, natural gas sales volumes are converted to equivalent barrels of oil using a ratio of six MCF of natural gas to one barrel of oil. 
 2 Includes 18.2 MMBOE and 3.2 MMBOE for total proved and proved undeveloped reserves, respectively, attributable to the noncontrolling interest in MP GOM. 
 
 During 2022, Murphy s total proved reserves decreased by 1.5 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE). The decrease in reserves principally relates to production of 63.9 MMBOE in 2022 and negative price revisions in Tupper Montney from higher commodity prices resulting in increased royalty rates and accelerated royalty incentive payouts. These revisions were offset by extensions of 58.5 MMBOE in onshore Canada, 15.8 MMBOE in offshore U.S. Gulf of Mexico and offshore Canada, and 5.8 MMBOE in the Eagle Ford Shale; improved recovery in the Gulf of Mexico; as well as acquisitions of increased working interest in two producing fields in the Gulf of Mexico and offsetting dispositions in the Gulf of Mexico and the Eagle Ford Shale. 
 Murphy s total proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2022 decreased 18.3 MMBOE from a year earlier. The proved undeveloped reserves reported in the table as extensions and discoveries during 2022 were predominantly attributable to four areas: the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas, onshore Canada areas of Tupper Montney and Kaybob Duvernay, and offshore Canada. Each of these areas had active development work ongoing during the year. The majority of proved undeveloped reserves associated with revisions of previous estimates was the result of negative price revisions in Tupper Montney from higher commodity prices resulting in increased royalty rates and accelerated royalty incentive payouts. The majority of the proved undeveloped reserves migration to the proved developed category are attributable to drilling in the Tupper Montney and Kaybob Duvernay, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Eagle Ford Shale. Other proved undeveloped increases resulted from improved recovery as well as an acquisition of increased working interest in two producing fields in the Gulf of Mexico. 
 The Company spent approximately 770 million in 2022 to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves. In the next three years, the Company expects to spend a range of approximately 350 million to 650 million per year to move current undeveloped proved reserves to the developed category. The anticipated level of spending in 2023 primarily includes drilling and development in the Gulf of Mexico, Eagle Ford Shale and Tupper Montney areas. 
 At December 31, 2022, proved reserves are included for several development projects, including oil developments at the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas, deepwater Gulf of Mexico; and Kaybob Duvernay in onshore Canada; as well as natural gas developments at Tupper Montney in onshore Canada. Total proved undeveloped reserves associated with various development projects at December 31, 2022 were approximately 279.4 MMBOE, which represent 39 of the Company s total proved reserves. 
 Certain development projects have proved undeveloped reserves that will take more than five years to bring to production. The Company currently operates deepwater fields in the Gulf of Mexico that have four undeveloped locations that exceed this five-year window. Total reserves associated with the four locations amount to approximately 1 of the Company s total proved reserves at year-end 2022. The development of certain 
 5

 reserves extends beyond five years due to limited well slot availability, thus making it necessary to wait for depletion of other wells prior to initiating further development of these locations or behind-pipe completions with significant capital costs that categorize them as undeveloped. 
 Murphy Oil s Reserves Processes and Policies 
 As per the SEC, proved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward. The SEC has defined reasonable certainty for proved reserves, as a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered. Proved reserves estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as economic conditions change. Moreover, estimates of proved reserves may be revised as a result of future operations, effects of regulation by governmental agencies or geopolitical or economic risks. Therefore, the proved reserves included in this report are estimates only and should not be construed as being exact quantities, and if recovered, could be more or less than the estimated amounts. 
 Murphy has established both internal and external controls for estimating proved reserves that follow the guidelines set forth by the SEC for oil and natural gas reporting. Certain qualified technical personnel of Murphy from the various exploration and production business units are responsible for the preparation of proved reserve estimates and these technical representatives provide the necessary information and maintain the data as well as the documentation for all properties. 
 Proved reserves are then consolidated and reported through the Corporate Reserves group. Murphy s General Manager Corporate Reserves (Reserves General Manager) leads the Corporate Reserves group that also includes Corporate reserve engineers and support staff, all of which are independent of the Company s oil and natural gas operational management and technical personnel. The Reserves General Manager joined Murphy in 2020 and has more than 31 years of industry experience. He has a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering and is a also a licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Texas. The Reserves General Manager reports to the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and makes annual presentations to the Board of Directors about the Company s reserves. The Reserves Manager and the Corporate reserve engineers review and discuss reserves estimates directly with the Company s technical staff in order to make every effort to ensure compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. The Reserves General Manager coordinates and oversees the third-party audits which are performed annually and under Company policy generally target coverage of at least one-third of the barrel oil-equivalent volume of the Company s proved reserves. 
 The estimated proved reserves reported in this Form 10-K are prepared by Murphy s employees. Internal audits may also be performed by the Reserves General Manager and qualified engineering staff from areas of the Company other than the area being audited by third parties. In 2022, 98.0 of the Proved reserves were audited by third-party auditors and they were found to be within the acceptable 10.0 tolerance by each of the third-party firms. Murphy engaged both Ryder Scott Company, L.P. and McDaniel Associates Consultants Ltd. to perform a reserves audit of 49.9 and 48.1 of the Company s total proved reserves, respectively. 
 Each significant exploration and production business unit also maintains one or more Qualified Reserve Estimators (QRE) on staff. The QRE is responsible for estimating and evaluating reserves and other reserves information for his or her assigned area. The QRE may personally make the estimates and evaluations of reserves or may supervise and approve the estimation and evaluation thereof by others. A QRE is professionally qualified to perform these reserves estimates as a result of having sufficient educational background, professional training and professional experience to enable him or her to exercise prudent professional judgment. Larger business units of the Company also employ a Regional Reserves Coordinator (RRC) who supervises the local QREs. The RRC is usually a senior QRE who has the primary responsibility for coordinating and submitting reserves information to senior management. 
 QRE qualification requires a minimum of five years of practical experience in petroleum engineering or petroleum production geology, with at least three years of such experience being in the estimation and evaluation of reserves, and either a bachelors or advanced degree in petroleum engineering, geology or other discipline of engineering or physical science from a college or university of recognized stature, or the equivalent thereof from an appropriate government authority or professional organization. Murphy provides annual training to all Company reserves estimators to ensure SEC requirements associated with reserves estimation and Form 10-K reporting are fulfilled. The training includes materials provided to each participant that outlines the latest

 guidance from the SEC as well as best practices for many engineering and geologic matters related to reserves estimation. 
 The Company s QREs maintain files containing pertinent data regarding each significant reservoir. Each file includes sufficient data to support the calculations or analogies used to develop the values. Examples of data included in the file, as appropriate, include: production histories; pertinent drilling and workover histories; bottom hole pressure data; volumetric, material balance, analogy, or other pertinent reserve estimation data; production performance curves; narrative descriptions of the methods and logic used to determine reserves values; maps and logs; and a signed copy of the documentation stating that, in their opinion, the reserves have been calculated, reviewed, documented and reported in compliance with SEC regulations. Reserves calculations are completed by technical personnel with the support of the QREs and appropriately reviewed by RRCs, the Corporate reserves engineers and the Reserves General Manager. Summaries are reviewed and approved with the heads of the Company s exploration and production business units and other senior management on an annual basis. The Company s Controller s department is responsible for preparing and filing reserves schedules within the Form 10-K report. 
 To ensure accuracy and security of reported reserves, the proved reserves estimates are coordinated in industry-standard software with access controls for approved users. In addition, Murphy complies with internal controls concerning the various business processes related to reserves. 
 More information regarding Murphy s estimated quantities of proved reserves of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas for the last three years are presented by geographic area on pages 112 through 119 of this Form 10-K report. Murphy currently has no oil and natural gas reserves from non-traditional sources. Murphy has not filed and is not required to file any estimates of its total proved oil or natural gas reserves on a recurring basis with any federal or foreign governmental regulatory authority or agency other than the SEC. Annually, Murphy reports gross reserves of properties operated in the United States to the U.S. Department of Energy; such reserves are derived from the same data from which estimated proved reserves of such properties are determined. 
 Crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids production and sales, and natural gas sales by geographic area with weighted average sales prices for each of the three years ended December 31, 2022 are shown on pages 41 through 43 of this Form 10-K report. 
 Production expenses for the last three years in U.S. dollars per equivalent barrel are discussed beginning on page 38 of this Form 10-K report. 
 Supplemental disclosures relating to oil and natural gas producing activities are reported on pages 110 through 125 of this Form 10-K report.

 As used in the three tables that follow, gross wells are the total wells in which all or part of the working interest is owned by Murphy, and net wells are the total of the Company s fractional working interests in gross wells expressed as the equivalent number of wholly-owned wells. An exploratory well is drilled to find and produce crude oil or natural gas in an unproved area and includes delineation wells which target a new reservoir in a field known to be productive or to extend a known reservoir beyond the proved area. A development well is drilled within the proved area of an oil or natural gas reservoir that is known to be productive. 
 The following table shows the number of oil and natural gas wells producing or capable of producing at December 31, 2022.

 Sustainability 
 Environment and Climate Change 
 We understand that our industry, and the use of our products, create emissions which raise climate change concerns. At the same time, access to affordable, reliable energy is essential to improving the world s quality of life and the functioning of the global economy. We believe that as the energy economy transitions, oil and natural gas will continue to play a vital role in the long-term energy mix. 
 We are committed to reducing our GHG emissions and are focused on understanding and mitigating our climate change risks. To guide our climate change strategy, Murphy has adopted a climate change position, and we are setting meaningful emissions reduction goals. In 2021, we endorsed the goal of eliminating routine flaring by 2030, under the current World Bank definition of routine flaring. This adds to the Company s previously established GHG emissions intensity reduction target of 15 to 20 by 2030 from our 2019 level, excluding our discontinued and divested Malaysia operations. 
 Murphy recognizes that emissions are only one element of our total environmental footprint. Protecting natural resources is also an important factor in our overall sustainability efforts. See our discussion of Climate Change and Emissions on page 48. 
 Further, we are subject to various international, foreign, national, state, provincial and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including related to the generation, storage, handling, use, disposal and remediation of petroleum products, wastewater and hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of such materials to the environment, including GHG emissions; wildlife, habitat and water protection; the placement, operation and decommissioning of production equipment; and the health and safety of our employees, contractors and communities where our operations are located. 
 U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). CERCLA and similar state statutes impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of the conduct, on current and past owners or operators of a site where a release occurred and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. Although CERCLA generally exempts petroleum from regulation, in the course of our operations, we may and could generate wastes that may fall within CERCLA s definition of hazardous substances and may have disposed of these wastes at disposal sites owned and operated by others. 
 Water discharges. The U.S. Clean Water Act and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of produced water and other oil and gas wastes, into regulated waters. The U.S. Oil Pollution Act (OPA) imposes certain duties and liabilities on the owner or operator of a facility, vessel or pipeline that is a source of or that poses the substantial threat of an oil discharge, or the lessee or permittee of the area in which a discharging offshore facility is located. OPA assigns joint and several liability, without regard to fault, to each liable party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages. OPA also requires owners and operators of offshore oil production facilities to establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility to cover costs that could be incurred in responding to an oil spill. 
 U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) requirements. BOEM and BSEE have regulations applicable to lessees in federal waters that impose various safety, permitting and certification requirements applicable to exploration, development and production activities in the Gulf of Mexico and also require lessees to have substantial U.S. assets and net worth or post bonds or other acceptable financial assurance that the regulatory obligations will be met. 
 These include, in the Gulf of Mexico, well design, well control, casing, cementing, real-time monitoring and subsea containment, among other items. Under applicable requirements, BOEM evaluates the financial strength and reliability of lessees and operators active on the Outer Continental Shelf, including the Gulf of Mexico. If the BOEM determines that a company does not have the financial ability to meet its decommissioning and other obligations, that company will be required to post additional financial security as assurance. 
 Air emissions and climate change. The U.S. Clean Air Act and comparable state laws and regulations govern emissions of various air pollutants through the issuance of permits and other authorization requirements. Since 2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been monitoring and regulating GHG emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane, from certain sources in the oil and gas sector due to their association

 with climate change. In addition, international climate efforts, including the 2015 Paris Agreement and the 2021 and 2022 Conferences of the Parties of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP26 and COP27, respectively), have resulted in commitments from many countries to reduce GHG emissions and have called for parties to eliminate certain fossil fuel subsidies and pursue further action on non-carbon dioxide GHGs. 
 Murphy is currently required to report GHG emissions from its U.S. operations in the Gulf of Mexico and onshore in south Texas and in its Canadian onshore business in British Columbia and Alberta. In British Columbia and Alberta, Murphy is subject to a carbon tax on the purchase or use of many carbon-based fuels. Additionally, starting in 2017, a carbon tax began to be applied to certain operations in Alberta. Any limitations or further regulation of GHG, such as a cap and trade system, technology mandate, emissions tax, or expanded reporting requirements, could cause the Company to restrict operations, curtail demand for hydrocarbons generally, and/or cause costs to increase. Examples of cost increases include costs to operate and maintain facilities, install pollution emission controls and administer and manage emissions trading programs. 
 Endangered and threatened species. The U.S. Endangered Species Act was established to protect endangered and threatened species. If a species is listed as threatened or endangered, restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species habitat. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds, under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and marine mammals under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. 
 As noted above, Murphy is subject to various laws and regulatory regimes governing similar matters in other jurisdictions in which it operates. More specifically, Murphy s operations in Canada are subject to and conducted under Canadian laws and regulations that address many of the same environmental, health and safety issues as those in the U.S., including, without limitation, pollution and contamination, air quality and emissions, water discharges and other health and safety concerns. 
 Health and Safety 
 Murphy s commitment to safety is strong, and so are our actions to protect our workforce and communities. Our employees are our most valuable asset. Murphy strives to achieve incident-free operations through continuous improvement processes managed by the Company s Health, Safety, Environment (HSE) Management System (HSE-MS), which engages all personnel, contractors and partners associated with Murphy operations and facilities, and provides a consistent method for integrating HSE concepts into our procedures and programs. We work hard to build a culture of safety across our organization, with regular training, exercise drills and key targeted safety initiatives. 
 Response to COVID-19 . During the COVID-19 pandemic, a proactive approach was taken by Murphy and we adopted strict protocols to protect our employees and their families, contractors and the communities in which we work from the virus. Our response program was led by our Incident Management Team (IMT), under the guidance of our Crisis Management Team (CMT), leveraging the advice and recommendations of infectious disease experts and establishing safety protocols for all workers. 
 Safety. The Company is subject to the requirements of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and comparable foreign and state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that certain information regarding hazardous materials used or produced in Murphy s operations be maintained and provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. In Canada, the Company is subject to Federal Occupational Health and Safety (OH S) Legislation, the provincially-administered Occupational Health and Safety Act (Alberta), the Workers Compensation Act (British Columbia) and the Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS).

 Employee Performance and Feedback 
 We are committed to efforts to enhance our employees professional growth and development through feedback that utilizes our internal performance management system (Murphy Performance Management - MPM). The purpose of the MPM process is to show our commitment to the development of all employees and to better align rewards with Company and individual performance. The goals of the MPM process are the following: 
 Drive behavior to align with the Company s mission, vision, values and behaviors 
 Develop employee capabilities through effective feedback and coaching 
 Maintain a process that is consistent throughout the organization to measure employee performance and is tied to Company and stockholder interests 
 All employees performance is evaluated at least annually through self-assessments that are reviewed in discussions with supervisors. Employees performance is evaluated on various key performance indicators set annually, including behaviors that support our mission, vision, values and contributions toward executing our company s goals/business strategy. 
 Talent Development and Training 
 Employees are able to participate in continuous training and development, with the goal of equipping them for success and providing increased opportunities for growth at Murphy. Through our digital platform, My Murphy Learning, employees can access self-directed courses, external articles and videos that cover topics such as business, technology and productivity. We also administer mandatory compliance training for our employees through My Murphy Learning, with a 100 utilization. Further, we strive to empower our leadership, so we sponsor several programs to address career advancement for emerging leaders. Plus, we provide a tuition reimbursement program for those who choose to acquire additional knowledge to increase their effectiveness in their present position or to prepare for career advancement. Murphy holds internal technical ideas forums each year designed to share best practice and technical advances across the Company, including safety and environmental topics.

 We encourage employee engagement and solicit feedback through internal surveys and our employee driven Ambassador program to gain insights into workplace experiences. Employees are provided opportunities to raise suggestions and collaborate with leadership to improve programs and increase their alignment with Murphy s mission, vision, values and behaviors. 
 To monitor the effectiveness of our human capital investment and development programs, we track voluntary turnover. This data is shared on a regular basis with our Executive Leadership Team, who use it in addition to other pertinent data to develop our human capital strategy. In 2022, our voluntary employee turnover rate was 10.5 . 
 Health and Welfare Benefits 
 
 We believe that doing our part to aid in maintaining the health and welfare of our employees is a critical element in Murphy achieving success. As such, we provide our employees and their families with a comprehensive set of subsidized benefits that are competitive and aligned to Murphy s mission, vision, values and behaviors. We also believe that the well-being of our employees is enhanced when they can give back to their local communities or charities either through the Company Impact Murphy Makes a Difference program or on their own and receive a Company match for donations. 
 In addition, we offer an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) that provides confidential assistance to employees and their immediate family members for mental and physical well-being, as well as legal and financial issues. We also maintain an Ethics Hotline that is available to all our employees to report, anonymously if desired, any matter of concern. Communications to the hotline, which is facilitated by an independent third party, are routed to appropriate functions, Human Resources, Law or Compliance, for investigation and resolution. 
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
 We are committed to fostering work environments that value diversity, equity and inclusion (DE I). This commitment includes providing equal access to and participation in programs and services without regard to race, creed, religion, color, national origin, disability, sex (including pregnancy), sexual orientation, gender identity, veteran status, age or stereotypes or assumptions based thereon. We also support interest-based groups such as sports, hobbies and charity volunteering. We welcome our employees differences, experiences and beliefs and we are investing in a more productive, engaged, diverse and inclusive workforce. The Board of Directors receives DE I updates on Demographic Data, Strategic Partnerships, Recruiting Strategies and Programs from management on a regular cadence. 
 We seek input and program recommendations from our DE I Committee with the support of the Executive Leadership team and through the sponsorship of our Vice President, Human Resources and Administration. Our DE I Committee consists of diverse employees at various levels from across the organization that share a passion for DE I.

 Item 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 The Company faces risks in the normal course of business and through global, regional and local events that could have an adverse impact on its reputation, operations, and financial performance. The Board of Directors exercises oversight of the Company s enterprise risk management program, which includes strategic, operational and financial matters, as well as compliance and legal risks. The Board of Directors receives updates annually on the risk management processes. 
 The following are some important factors that could cause the Company s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. If any of the events or circumstances described in any of the following risk factors occurs, our business, results of operations and/or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected, and our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated in any forward-looking statements we make in any public disclosures. 
 Price Risk Factors 
 Volatility in the global prices of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas can significantly affect the Company s operating results, cash flows and financial condition. 
 Among the most significant variable factors impacting the Company s results of operations are the sales prices for crude oil and natural gas that it produces. Many of the factors influencing prices of crude oil and natural gas are beyond our control. These factors include: 
 the occurrence or threat of epidemics or pandemics, such as the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), or any government response to such occurrence or threat which may lower the demand for hydrocarbon fuels; 
 worldwide and domestic supplies of, and demand for, crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas; 
 the ability of the members of OPEC and certain non-OPEC members, for example, Russia, to agree to maintain or adjust production levels; 
 the production levels of non-OPEC countries, including, amongst others, production levels in the shale plays in the United States; 
 political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict; 
 the level of drilling, completion and production activities by other exploration and production companies, and variability therein, in response to market conditions; 
 changes in weather patterns and climate, including those that may result from climate change; 
 natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes, including those that may result from climate change; 
 the price, availability and the demand for and of alternative and competing forms of energy, such as nuclear, hydroelectric, wind or solar; 
 the effect of conservation efforts and focus on climate-change; 
 technological advances affecting energy consumption and energy supply; 
 increased activism against, or change in public sentiment for, oil and gas exploration, development, and production activities and considerations including climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy; 
 domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes, including further legislation requiring, subsidizing or providing tax benefits for the use or generation of alternative energy sources and fuels; and 
 general economic conditions worldwide, including inflationary conditions and related governmental policies and interventions. 
 West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices averaged 94 per barrel in 2022, compared to 68 in 2021, 39 in 2020 and 57 in 2019. Certain U.S. and Canadian crude oils are priced from oil indices other than WTI, and these indices are influenced by different supply and demand forces than those that affect WTI prices. The most 
 15

 Item 1A. Risk Factors - Continued 

 common crude oil indices used to price the Company s crude include Mars, WTI Houston (MEH), Heavy Louisiana Sweet (HLS) and Brent. 
 The average New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas sales price was 6.38 per million British Thermal Units (MMBTU) in 2022, compared to 3.84 in 2021 and 1.99 in 2020. The Company also has exposure to the Canadian benchmark natural gas price, AECO, which averaged US 4.09 per MMBTU in 2022, compared to US 2.89 in 2021 and US 1.66 in 2020. The Company has entered into certain forward fixed price contracts as detailed in the Outlook section on page 54 a nd spot contracts providing exposure to other market prices at specific sales points such as Malin (Oregon, U.S.) and Dawn (Ontario, Canada). 
 Lower prices, should they occur, will materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Lower oil and natural gas prices could reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that the Company can economically produce, resulting in a reduction in the proved oil and natural gas reserves we could recognize, which could impact the recoverability and carrying value of our assets. The Company cannot predict how changes in the sales prices of oil and natural gas will affect the results of operations in future periods. The Company may hedge a portion of its exposure to the effects of changing prices of crude oil and natural gas by selling forwards, swaps and other forms of derivative contracts. 
 Lower oil and natural gas prices adversely affect the Company in several ways: 
 Lower sales value for the Company s oil and natural gas production reduces cash flows and net income. 
 Lower cash flows may cause the Company to reduce its capital expenditure program, thereby potentially restricting its ability to grow production and add proved reserves. 
 Lower oil and natural gas prices could lead to impairment charges in future periods, therefore reducing net income. 
 Reductions in oil and natural gas prices could lead to reductions in the Company s proved reserves in future years. Low prices could make a portion of the Company s proved reserves uneconomic, which in turn could lead to the removal of certain of the Company s year-end reported proved oil reserves in future periods. These reserve reductions could be significant. 
 In order to manage the potential volatility of cash flows and credit requirements, we maintain appropriate bank credit facilities. Inability, as a result of low oil and natural gas prices, to access, renew or replace such credit facilities or access other sources of funding as they mature would negatively impact our liquidity. 
 Lower prices for oil and natural gas could cause the Company to lower its dividend because of lower cash flows. 
 See Note L for additional information on the derivative instruments used to manage certain risks related to commodity prices. 
 Murphy s commodity price risk management may limit the Company s ability to fully benefit from potential future price increases for oil and natural gas. 
 The Company, from time to time, enters into various contracts to protect its cash flows against lower oil and natural gas prices. To the extent that the Company enters into these contracts and in the event that prices for oil and natural gas increase in future periods, the Company will not fully benefit from the price improvement on all production. See Note L for additional information on the derivative instruments used to manage certain risks related to commodity prices.

 Operational Risk Factors 
 Murphy operates in highly competitive environments which could adversely affect it in many ways, including its profitability, cash flows and its ability to grow. 
 Murphy operates in the oil and natural gas industry and experiences competition from other oil and natural gas companies, which include major integrated oil companies, independent producers of oil and natural gas, and state-owned foreign oil companies. Many of the major integrated and state-owned oil companies and some of the independent producers that compete with the Company have substantially greater resources than Murphy. 
 In addition, the oil industry as a whole competes with other industries in supplying energy requirements around the world. Within the industry, Murphy competes for, among other things, valuable acreage positions, exploration licenses, drilling equipment and talent. 
 Exploration drilling results can significantly affect the Company s operating results. 
 The Company drills exploratory wells which subjects its exploration and production operating results to exposure to dry hole expense, which has in the past and may in the future, adversely affect our results of operations. The Company s strategy is to participate in three to five exploration wells per year. In 2022, the Company participated in two exploration wells, the Cutthroat well located in Brazil and the Tulum-1EXP well located in Mexico, that failed to encounter commercial hydrocarbons. In addition, in December of 2022, the Company commenced drilling of the Oso-1 well in the Gulf of Mexico, with drilling to continue through the first quarter of 2023. The Company has budgeted 100 million for its 2023 exploration program, which includes finishing the Oso-1 well and drilling two additional Gulf of Mexico operated exploration wells. 
 If Murphy cannot replace its oil and natural gas reserves, it may not be able to sustain or grow its business. 
 Murphy continually depletes its oil and natural gas reserves as production occurs. To sustain and grow its business, the Company must successfully replace the oil and natural gas it produces with additional reserves. Therefore, it must create and maintain a portfolio of good prospects for future reserves additions and production. The Company must find, acquire or develop, and produce reserves at a competitive cost to be successful in the long-term. Murphy s ability to operate profitably in the exploration and production business, therefore, is dependent on its ability to find (and/or acquire), develop and produce oil and natural gas reserves at costs that are less than the realized sales price for these products. 
 Murphy s proved reserves are based on the professional judgment of its engineers and may be subject to revision. 
 Proved reserves of crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGL) and natural gas included in this report on pages 110 through 119 have been prepared according to the SEC guidelines by qualified Company personnel or qualified independent engineers based on an unweighted average of crude oil, NGL and natural gas prices in effect at the beginning of each month of the respective year as well as other conditions and information available at the time the estimates were prepared. Estimation of reserves is a subjective process that involves professional judgment by engineers about volumes to be recovered in future periods from underground oil and natural gas reservoirs. Estimates of economically recoverable crude oil, NGL and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, and consequently, different engineers could arrive at different estimates of reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data and using industry accepted engineering practices and scientific methods. In 2022, 98.0 of the Proved reserves were audited by third-party auditors. 
 Murphy s actual future oil and natural gas production may vary substantially from its reported quantity of proved reserves due to a number of factors, including: 
 Oil and natural gas prices which are materially different from prices used to compute proved reserves; 
 Operating and/or capital costs which are materially different from those assumed to compute proved reserves; 
 Future reservoir performance which is materially different from models used to compute proved reserves; and 
 Governmental regulations or actions which materially impact operations of a field.

 The Company s proved undeveloped reserves represent significant portions of total proved reserves. As of December 31, 2022, and including noncontrolling interests, approximately 31 of the Company s crude oil and condensate proved reserves, 29 of natural gas liquids proved reserves and 47 of natural gas proved reserves are undeveloped. The ability of the Company to reclassify these undeveloped proved reserves to the proved developed classification is generally dependent on the successful completion of one or more operations, which might include further development drilling, construction of facilities or pipelines and well workovers. 
 The discounted future net revenues from our proved reserves as reported on pages 123 and 124 should not be considered as the market value of the reserves attributable to our properties. As required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the estimated discounted future net revenues from our proved reserves are based on an unweighted average of the oil and natural gas prices in effect at the beginning of each month during the year. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than those used in the reserves computations. 
 In addition, the 10 discount factor that is required to be used to calculate discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes under GAAP is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on our cost of capital, the risks associated with our business and the risk associated with the industry in general. 
 Murphy is sometimes reliant on joint venture partners for operating assets, and/or funding development projects and operations. 
 Certain of the Company s major oil and natural gas producing properties are operated by others. Therefore, Murphy does not fully control all activities at certain of its revenue generating properties. During 2022, approximately 21 of the Company s total production was at fields operated by others, while at December 31, 2022, approximately 15 of the Company s total proved reserves were at fields operated by others. 
 Additionally, the Company relies on the availability of transportation and processing facilities that are often owned and operated by others. These third-party systems and facilities may not always be available to the Company and, if available, may not be available at a price that is acceptable to the Company. 
 Some of Murphy s development projects entail significant capital expenditures and have long development cycle times. As a result, the Company s partners must be able to fund their share of investment costs through the development cycle, through cash flow from operations, external credit facilities, or other sources, including financing arrangements. Murphy s partners are also susceptible to certain of the risk factors noted herein, including, but not limited to, commodity price, fiscal regime changes, government project approval delays, regulatory changes, credit downgrades and regional conflict. If one or more of these factors negatively impacts a project partners cash flows or ability to obtain adequate financing, it could result in a delay or cancellation of a project, resulting in a reduction of the Company s reserves and production, which negatively impacts the timing and receipt of planned cash flows and expected profitability. 
 Murphy s business is subject to operational hazards, severe weather events, physical security risks and risks normally associated with the exploration and production of oil and natural gas, which could become more significant as a result of climate change. 
 The Company operates in urban and remote, and sometimes inhospitable, areas around the world. The occurrence of an event, including but not limited to acts of nature such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes (and other forms of severe weather), mechanical equipment failures, industrial accidents, fires, explosions, acts of war, civil unrest, piracy and acts of terrorism could result in the loss of hydrocarbons and associated revenues, environmental pollution or contamination, personal injury, (including death), and property damages for which the Company could be deemed to be liable and which could subject the Company to substantial fines and/or claims for punitive damages. This risk extends to actions and operational hazards of other operators in the industry, which may also impact the Company. 
 The location of many of Murphy s key assets causes the Company to be vulnerable to severe weather, including hurricanes and tropical storms. Many of the Company s offshore fields are in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where hurricanes and tropical storms can lead to shutdowns and damages. The U.S. hurricane season runs from June through November. Moreover, it should be noted that scientists have predicted that increasing concentrations of GHG in the earth s atmosphere may produce climate changes that increase significant weather events, such as 
 18 

Table of Contents 
 PART I 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors - Continued 

 increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events. If such effects were to occur, our operations could be adversely affected. Although the Company maintains insurance for such risks as described elsewhere in this Form 10-K report, due to policy deductibles and possible coverage limits, weather-related risks to our operations are not fully insured. 
 In addition, certain customer and supplier assets, such as storage terminals, processing facilities, refineries and pipelines, are located in areas that may be prone to severe weather events, including hurricanes, winter storms, floods and major tropical storms. Severe weather events that significantly affect facilities belonging to such customers or suppliers may reduce demand for our products and interrupt our ability to bring products to market and may therefore materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, even if our own facilities escape significant damage. 
 Murphy is subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and such existing and any potential future laws and regulations may result in material liabilities and costs. 
 The Company s operations are subject to various international, foreign, national, state, provincial and local environmental, health and safety laws, regulations, governmental actions and permit requirements, including related to the generation, storage, handling, use, disposal and remediation of petroleum products, wastewater and hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of such materials to the environment, including GHG emissions; wildlife, habitat and water protection; the placement, operation and decommissioning of production equipment; the health and safety of our employees, contractors and communities where our operations are located, including indigenous communities; and the causes and impacts of climate change. The laws, regulations, governmental actions and permit requirements are subject to frequent change and have tended to become stricter over time and at times may be motivated by political considerations. They can impose permitting and financial assurance obligations, as well as operational controls and/or siting constraints on our business, and can result in additional capital and operating expenditures. It is possible in the future, certain regulatory bodies such as the Railroad Commission of Texas may enact regulation that bans or reduces flaring for U.S. Onshore operations and certain regulatory bodies in Canada may decide to revoke permits or pause the issuance of permits as a result of non-compliance with, or litigation related to, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Compliance with such regulations could result in capital investment which would reduce the Company s net cash flows and profitability. 
 Murphy also could be subject to strict liability for environmental contamination in various jurisdictions where it operates, including with respect to its current or former properties, operations and waste disposal sites, or those of its predecessors. Contamination has been identified at some locations, and the Company has been required, and in the future may be required, to investigate, remove or remediate previously disposed wastes; or otherwise clean up contaminated soil, surface water or groundwater, address spills and leaks from pipelines and production equipment, and perform remedial plugging operations. In addition to significant investigation and remediation costs, such matters can result in fines and also give rise to third-party claims for personal injury and property or other environmental damage. 
 The Company s onshore North America oil and natural gas production is dependent on a technique known as hydraulic fracturing whereby water, sand and certain chemicals are injected into deep oil and natural gas bearing reservoirs in North America. This process occurs thousands of feet below the surface and creates fractures in the rock formation within the reservoir which enhances migration of oil and natural gas to the wellbore. The Company primarily uses this technique in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas and in Kaybob Duvernay and Tupper Montney in Western Canada. Texas law imposes permitting, disclosure, disposal and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations, as well as public disclosure of certain information regarding the components used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Regulations in the provinces of British Columbia and Alberta also govern various aspects of hydraulic fracturing activities under their jurisdictions. It is possible that Texas, other states in which we may conduct fracturing in the future, the U.S., Canadian provinces and certain municipalities may adopt further laws or regulations which could render the process unlawful, less effective or drive up its costs. If any such action is taken in the future, the Company s production levels could be adversely affected, or its costs of drilling and completion could be increased. Once new laws and/or regulations have been enacted and adopted, the costs of compliance are appraised. 
 Hydraulic fracturing operations subject the Company to operational risks inherent in the drilling and production of oil and natural gas. These risks include underground migration or surface spillage due to releases of oil, 
 19 

Table of Contents 
 PART I 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors - Continued 

 natural gas, formation water or well fluids, as well as any related surface or groundwater contamination, including from petroleum constituents or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives. Ineffective containment of surface spillage and surface or groundwater contamination resulting from hydraulic fracturing operations, including from petroleum constituents or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives, could result in environmental pollution, remediation expenses and third-party claims alleging damages, which could adversely affect the Company s financial condition and results of operations. In addition, hydraulic fracturing requires significant quantities of water; the wastewater from oil and natural gas operations is often disposed of through underground injection. Certain increased seismic activities have been linked to underground water injection. Any diminished access to water for use in the hydraulic fracturing process, any inability to properly dispose of wastewater, or any further restrictions placed on wastewater, could curtail the Company s operations or otherwise result in operational delays or increased costs. 
 In addition, BOEM and BSEE have regulations applicable to lessees in federal waters that impose various safety, permitting and certification requirements applicable to exploration, development and production activities in the Gulf of Mexico, and also require lessees to have substantial U.S. assets and net worth or post bonds or other acceptable financial assurance that the regulatory obligations will be met. These include, in the Gulf of Mexico, well design, well control, casing, cementing, real-time monitoring, and subsea containment, among other items. Under applicable requirements, BOEM evaluates the financial strength and reliability of lessees and operators active on the OCS. If the BOEM determines that a company does not have the financial ability to meet its decommissioning and other obligations, that company will be required to post additional financial security as assurance. 
 In addition, various executive orders by the current presidential administration and the Department of Interior over the course of 2021 regarding a temporary suspension of normal-course issuance of permits for fossil fuel development on federal lands and a pause on new oil and gas leases on public lands and offshore waters, and the Secretary of Interior s related review of permitting and leasing practices, could adversely impact Murphy s operations. Despite the pauses on oil and gas leases in 2021, in August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was passed by the U.S. Congress and included provisions which required the Department of Interior to hold previously announced offshore lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska within two years. These developments demonstrate the uncertainty regarding the current presidential administration s approach to oil and gas leasing and permitting. For further details, see Risk Factors General Risk Factors Murphy s operations and earnings have been and will continue to be affected by domestic and worldwide political developments.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors - Continued 

 We face various risks associated with increased activism against, or change in public sentiment for, oil and gas exploration, development, and production activities and sustainability considerations, including climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy. 
 Opposition toward oil and gas drilling, development, and production activity has been growing globally. Companies in the oil and gas industry are often the target of activist efforts from both individuals and nongovernmental organizations and other stakeholders regarding safety, human rights, climate change, environmental matters, sustainability, and business practices. Anti development activists are working to, among other things, delay or cancel certain operations such as offshore drilling and development. 
 Activism may continue to increase regardless of whether the current presidential administration in the U.S. is perceived to be following, or actually follows, through on the current president s campaign commitments to promote decreased fossil fuel exploration and production in the U.S, including as a result of the administration s environmental and climate change executive orders described earlier in this 10-K. Our need to incur costs associated with responding to these initiatives or complying with any resulting new legal or regulatory requirements resulting from these activities that are substantial and not adequately provided for, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, a change in public sentiment regarding the oil and gas industry could result in a reduction in the demand for our products or otherwise affect our results of operations or financial condition. 
 While the Company has been named a co-defendant with other oil and gas companies in lawsuits related to climate change, these lawsuits have not resulted in, and are not currently expected to result in, material liability for the Company. Depending on the evolution of laws, regulations and litigation outcomes relating to climate change, there can be no guarantee that climate change litigation will not in the future materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For further details on risks related to legal proceedings more generally, see Risk Factors - General Risk Factors - Lawsuits against Murphy and its subsidiaries could adversely affect its operating results. 
 Financial Risk Factors 
 Capital financing may not always be available to fund Murphy s activities; and interest rates could impact cash flows. 
 Murphy usually must spend and risk a significant amount of capital to find and develop reserves before revenue is generated from production. Although most capital needs are funded from operating cash flow, the timing of cash flows from operations and capital funding requirements may not always coincide, and the levels of cash flow generated by operations may not fully cover capital funding requirements, especially in periods of low commodity prices. Therefore, the Company maintains financing arrangements with lending institutions to meet certain funding needs. The Company periodically renews these financing arrangements based on foreseeable financing needs or as they expire. In November 2022, the Company entered into an 800 million revolving credit facility (RCF). The RCF is a senior unsecured guaranteed facility and will expire in November 2027. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the RCF. See Note G for further details on the RCF. 
 The Company s ability to obtain additional financing is affected by a number of factors, including the market environment, our operating and financial performance, investor sentiment, our ability to incur additional debt in compliance with agreements governing our outstanding debt, and the Company s credit ratings. A ratings downgrade could materially and adversely impact the Company s ability to access debt markets, increase the borrowing cost under the Company s credit facility and the cost of any additional indebtedness we incur, and potentially require the Company to post additional letters of credit or other forms of collateral for certain obligations. Murphy partially manages this risk through borrowing at fixed rates wherever possible; however, rates when refinancing or raising new capital are determined by factors outside of the Company s control. 
 21

 PART I 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors - Continued 

 Further, changes in investors sentiment or view of risk of the exploration and production industry, including as a result of concerns over climate change, could adversely impact the availability of future financing. Specifically, certain financial institutions (including certain investment advisors and sovereign wealth, pension and endowment funds), in response to concerns related to climate change and the requests and other influence of environmental groups and similar stakeholders, have elected to shift some or all of their investments away from fossil fuel-related sectors, and additional financial institutions and other investors may elect to do likewise in the future. As a result, fewer financial institutions and other investors may be willing to invest in, and provide capital to, companies in the oil and gas sector, which, in turn, could adversely impact our cost of capital. 
 In 2022, the Company undertook several actions to reduce overall debt. Murphy plans to continue with the Company s deleveraging initiatives, but there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful and, if not, the Company s financial conditions and prospects could be adversely affected. See Note G for information regarding the Company s outstanding debt as of December 31, 2022. 
 Murphy s operations could be adversely affected by changes in foreign exchange rates. 
 The Company s worldwide operational scope exposes it to risks associated with foreign currencies. Most of the Company s business is transacted in U.S. dollars, and therefore the Company and most of its subsidiaries are U.S. dollar functional entities for accounting purposes. However, the Canadian dollar is the functional currency for all Canadian operations. This exposure to currencies other than the U.S. dollar functional currency can lead to impacts on consolidated financial results from foreign currency translation. On occasions, the Canadian business may hold assets or incur liabilities denominated in a currency which is not Canadian dollars which could lead to exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. See also Note L for additional information on derivative contracts. 
 The costs and funding requirements related to the Company s retirement plans are affected by several factors. 
 A number of actuarial assumptions impact funding requirements for the Company s retirement plans. The most significant of these assumptions include return on assets, long-term interest rates and mortality. If the actual results for the plans vary significantly from the actuarial assumptions used, or if laws regulating such retirement plans are changed, Murphy could be required to make more significant funding payments to one or more of its retirement plans in the future and/or it could be required to record a larger liability for future obligations in its Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 Murphy has limited control over supply chain costs. 
 The Company often experiences pressure on its operating and capital expenditures in periods of strong crude oil and natural gas prices because an increase in exploration and production activities due to high oil and natural gas sales prices generally leads to higher demand for, and consequently higher costs for, goods and services in the oil and gas industry. In addition, periods of inflationary pressure in the wider economy, as seen during 2022, can also lead to a similar increase in the cost of goods and services for the Company. Murphy has a dedicated procurement department focused on managing supply chain and input costs. Murphy also has certain transportation, processing and production handling services costs fixed through long-term contracts and commitments and therefore is partly protected from increasing price of services. However, from time to time, Murphy will seek to enter new commitments, exercise options to extend contracts and retender contracts for rigs and other industry services which could expose Murphy to the impact of higher prices.

 The Company is exposed to credit risks associated with (i) sales of certain of its products to customers, (ii) joint venture partners and (iii) other counterparties. 
 Murphy is exposed to credit risk in three principle areas: 
 Accounts receivable credit risk from selling its produced commodity to customers; 
 Joint venture partners related to certain oil and natural gas properties operated by the Company. These joint venture partners may not be able to meet their financial obligation to pay for their share of capital and operating costs as they become due; and 
 Counterparty credit risk related to forward price commodity hedge contracts to protect the Company s cash flows against lower oil and natural gas prices. 
 To mitigate these risks the Company: 
 Actively monitors the credit worthiness of all its customers, joint venture partners and forward commodity hedge counterparties; and 
 Given the inherent credit risks in a cyclical commodity price business, the Company has increased the focus on its review of joint venture partners, the magnitude of potential exposure and planning suitable actions should a joint venture partner fail to pay its share of capital and operating expenditures. 
 The inability of a purchaser of the Company s produced commodity, a joint venture partner of the Company, or counterparty in a forward price commodity hedge to meet their respective payment obligations to the Company could have an adverse effect on Murphy s future earnings and cash flows. 
 General Risk Factors 
 We face various risks related to health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks, which may have material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. 
 As the COVID-19 pandemic has evolved from its emergence in early 2020, so has its global impact. In 2020 the spread of COVID-19 led to disruption in the global economy and weakness in demand in crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas, which applied downward pressure on global commodity prices. The combination of vaccine availability and the relaxation of government-imposed lockdowns in 2021 led to a rebound in global economic activity in 2021, which continued throughout 2022. 
 However, the future impact of COVID-19, or that of any other pandemic, cannot be predicted and any resurgence of disease may cause additional volatility in commodity prices. See Risk Factors, Price Risk Factors Volatility in the global prices of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas can significantly affect the Company s operating results. 
 If significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions, facility closures or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 or other pandemic, our operations will likely be impacted and decrease our ability to produce oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas. We may be unable to perform fully on our commitments and our costs may increase as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. These cost increases may not be fully recoverable or adequately covered by insurance. 
 The COVID-19 or other pandemic could also cause disruption in our supply chain; cause delay, or limit the ability of vendors and customers to perform, including in making timely payments to us; and cause other unpredictable events. 
 We continue to work with our stakeholders (including customers, employees, suppliers, financial and lending institutions and local communities) to address the COVID-19 pandemic responsibly. We continue to monitor the situation, to assess further possible implications to our business, supply chain and customers, and to take actions in an effort to mitigate adverse consequences. The Company continues to exercise financial discipline in managing costs and capital expenditures. 
 We cannot predict the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 or other pandemic. The extent to which the COVID-19 or other health pandemics or epidemics may impact our results will depend on future developments, including, among other factors, the duration and spread of the virus and its variants, availability, acceptance and effectiveness of vaccines along with related travel advisories, quarantines and restrictions, the recovery time of

 the disrupted supply chains and industries, the impact of labor market interruptions, and the impact of government interventions. 
 Changes in U.S. and international tax rules and regulations, or interpretations thereof, may materially and adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. 
 We are subject to income- and non-income-based taxes in the United States under federal, state and local jurisdictions and in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws, regulations and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without advance notice, due to economic, political and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. Our tax liabilities could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles and interpretations, the mix and level or earnings in a given taxing jurisdiction or our ownership or capital structure. For example, on August 16, 2022, the United States enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which is highly complex, subject to interpretation and contains significant changes to U.S. tax law, including, but not limited to, a 15 corporate book minimum tax for taxpayers with adjusted financial statement income in excess of 1 billion and a 1 excise tax on certain stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. The U.S. Department of the Treasury and the IRS are expected to release further regulations and interpretive guidance implementing the legislation contained in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, but the details and timing of such regulations are subject to uncertainty at this time. The tax provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 that may apply to us are generally effective in 2023 or later and therefore tax impacts to us in 2022 were immaterial. We continue to analyze the potential impact of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 on our consolidated financial statements and to monitor guidance to be issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. However, it is possible that the enactment of changes in the U.S. corporate tax system, including in connection with the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, could have a material effect on our consolidated cash taxes in the future. 
 Murphy s Information Technology environment may be exposed to cyber threats. 
 The oil and gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct exploration, development, and production activities. We are no exception to this trend. As a company, we depend on these technologies to estimate quantities of oil and natural gas reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information, communicate internally and externally, and conduct many other business activities. 
 Maintaining the security of our technology and preventing breaches is critical to our business operation. We rely on our information systems, and our cybersecurity training and policies, to protect and secure intellectual property, strategic plans, customer information, and personally identifiable information, such as employee information. 
 A failure of our cyber infrastructure or a successful or undetected cyberattack has the potential to halt business operations, impair our reputation, weaken our competitive advantage, and/or adversely impact our financial condition. Given the increasing global threats from cybercrime, the Company s approach to mitigate cybersecurity risk focuses on three key elements: 
 People - Security awareness education and readiness-testing throughout the year for employees and contractors; 
 Process - Incorporating cyber awareness in our day to day processes and maturing key controls such as recurring internal and external cyber risk assessments, physical and digital asset protection, and security vulnerability remediation via preventative and detective measures; and 
 Technology - Investing in industry aligned security technology and threat intelligence capabilities. 
 As the sophistication of cyber threats continues to evolve, we may be required to dedicate additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our security measures, or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks.

 Murphy s operations and earnings have been and will continue to be affected by domestic and worldwide political developments. 
 From time to time, some governments intervene in the market for crude oil and natural gas produced in their countries through such actions as setting prices, determining rates of production, and controlling who may buy and sell the production. 
 Murphy is exposed to regulation, legislation and policies enacted by the federal government. As an example, following the election and inauguration of the current U.S. president in January 2021, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior issued Order No. 3395 on January 20, 2021. This order served to potentially impact the timing of issuance of oil and gas leases, lease amendments and extension, and drilling permits on federal lands and offshore waters. However, following this notice, the Department of Interior has continued to approve permits and Murphy has not experienced a delay in project approvals. An extension or permanency of this regime could impact the options available to Murphy for future development, reserves available for production and hence future cash flows and profitability. In the event leasing delays or cancellations alter Murphy s plans in the Gulf of Mexico, the Company believes it will be able to re-focus activities and allocate capital to other areas. The Company does not hold any onshore federal lands in the U.S. 
 In addition, the current presidential administration has pursued other initiatives related to environmental, health and safety standards applicable to the oil and gas industry. These include an executive order in January 2021 that directed the Secretary of the Interior to halt indefinitely new oil and gas leases on federal lands and offshore waters pending a since-completed review by the Secretary of the Interior of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices; however, a June 2021 preliminary injunction in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana barred the current presidential administration from implementing the pause in new federal oil and gas leases. This executive order also set forth other initiatives and goals, including procurement of carbon pollution-free electricity, elimination of fossil fuel subsidies, a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035 and a net-zero emissions U.S. economy by 2050. Another executive order from January 2021 called for a climate change-focused review of regulations and other executive actions promulgated, issued or adopted during the prior presidential administration. In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was passed by the U.S. Congress and included provisions which required the Department of Interior to hold previously announced offshore lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska within two years. These developments demonstrate the uncertainty regarding the current presidential administration s approach to oil and gas leasing and permitting. 
 In March 2022, the SEC proposed rules requiring disclosure of a range of climate change-related information, including, among other things, companies climate change risk management; short- medium- and long-term climate-related financial risks; and disclosure of Scope 1, Scope 2 and (for certain companies) Scope 3 emissions. The SEC s proposed climate disclosure rules have not yet been finalized, but implementation of the rules as proposed could be costly and time consuming. 
 These actions and any future changes to applicable environmental, health and safety, regulatory and legal requirements promulgated by the current presidential administration and Congress may restrict our access to additional acreage and new leases in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico or lead to limitations or delays on our ability to secure additional permits to drill and develop our acreage and leases or otherwise lead to limitations on the scope of our operations, or may lead to increases to our compliance costs. The potential impacts of these changes on our future consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows cannot be predicted. 
 Prices and availability of crude oil, natural gas and refined products could be influenced by political factors and by various governmental policies to restrict or increase petroleum usage and supply. Other governmental actions that could affect Murphy s operations and earnings include expropriation, tax law changes, royalty increases, redefinition of international boundaries, preferential and discriminatory awarding of oil and natural gas leases, restrictions on drilling and/or production, restraints and controls on imports and exports, safety, and relationships between employers and employees. Governments could also initiate regulations concerning matters such as currency fluctuations, currency conversion, protection and remediation of the environment, and concerns over the possibility of global warming caused by the production and use of hydrocarbon energy. As of December 31, 2022, 0.1 of the Company s proved reserves, as defined by the SEC, were located in countries other than the U.S. and Canada. 
 A number of non-governmental entities routinely attempt to influence industry members and government energy policy in an effort to limit industry activities, such as hydrocarbon production, drilling and hydraulic 
 25

 Item 1A. Risk Factors - Continued 

 fracturing with the desire to minimize the emission of GHG such as carbon dioxide, which may harm air quality, and to restrict hydrocarbon spills, which may harm land and/or groundwater. 
 Additionally, because of the numerous countries in which the Company operates, certain other risks exist, including the application of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other similar anti-corruption compliance statutes in the jurisdictions in which we operate. 
 It is not possible to predict the actions of governments and hence the impact on Murphy s future operations and earnings. 
 Murphy s insurance may not be adequate to offset costs associated with certain events, and there can be no assurance that insurance coverage will continue to be available in the future on terms that justify its purchase. 
 Murphy maintains insurance against certain, but not all, hazards that could arise from its operations. The Company maintains liability insurance sufficient to cover its share of gross insured claim costs up to approximately 500 million per occurrence and in the annual aggregate. Generally, this insurance covers various types of third-party claims related to personal injury, death and property damage, including claims arising from sudden and accidental pollution events. The Company also maintains insurance coverage for property damage and well control with an additional limit of 450 million per occurrence 850 million for U.S. Gulf of Mexico claims), all or part of which could apply to certain sudden and accidental pollution events. These policies have deductibles ranging from 10 million to 25 million. The occurrence of an event that is not insured or not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition and results of operations in the future. 
 Murphy could face long-term challenges to the fossil fuels business model reducing demand and price for hydrocarbon fuels. 
 Murphy s business model may come under more pressure from changing environmental and social trends and the related global demands for non-fossil fuel energy sources. This demand in alternative forms of energy may cause the price of our products to become more volatile and decline. Further, a reduction in demand for fossil fuels could adversely impact the availability of future financing. As part of Murphy s strategy review process, the Company reviews hydrocarbon demand forecasts and assesses the impact on its business model and, plans and future estimates of reserves. In addition, the Company evaluates other lower-carbon technologies that could complement our existing assets, strategy and competencies as part of its long-term capital allocation strategy. The Company also has significant natural gas reserves which emit lower carbon compared to oil and liquids. 
 The issue of climate change has caused considerable attention to be directed towards initiatives to reduce global GHG emissions. The Paris Agreement and subsequently yearly conferences of the parties to the Paris Agreement have resulted in commitments from many countries to reduce GHG emissions and have called for parties to eliminate certain fossil fuel subsidies and pursue further action on non-carbon dioxide GHGs. Most recently, in November 2022, the international community gathered in Egypt at the 27th Conference of the Parties on the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP27), during which multiple announcements were made, including the EPA s announcement of more stringent revisions to previously proposed methane emissions rules for the oil and gas sector. The previously proposed rules and EPA s November 2022 revisions, establish requirements for methane emissions from existing and modified oil and gas sources and impose additional requirements for new sources. In addition, the federal government could issue various executive orders that may result in additional laws, rules and regulations in the area of climate change. It is possible that the Paris Agreement, COP27, government executive orders and other such initiatives, including foreign, federal and state laws, rules or regulations related to GHG emissions and climate change, may reduce the demand for crude oil and natural gas globally. In addition to regulatory risk, other market and social initiatives such as public and private initiatives that aim to subsidize the development of non-fossil fuel energy sources, may reduce the competitiveness of carbon-based fuels, such as oil and gas. While the magnitude of any reduction in hydrocarbon demand is difficult to predict, such a development could adversely impact the Company and other companies engaged in the exploration and production business. With or without renewable-energy subsidies, the unknown pace and strength of technological advancement of non-fossil-fuel energy sources creates uncertainty about the timing and pace of effects on our business model. The Company continually monitors the global climate change agenda initiatives and plans accordingly based on its assessment of such initiatives on its business.

 Lawsuits against Murphy and its subsidiaries could adversely affect its operating results. 
 The Company or certain of its consolidated subsidiaries are involved in numerous legal proceedings, including lawsuits for alleged personal injuries, environmental and/or property damages, climate change and other business-related matters.

Item 6. RESERVED 

Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Murphy Oil Corporation is a worldwide oil and natural gas exploration and production company. A more detailed description of the Company s significant assets can be found in Item 1 of this Form 10-K report. 
 In 2022, a combination of demand recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical uncertainty and market disruption from the Russia/Ukraine conflict and lack of investment in the exploration and production sector contributed to increased crude oil and natural gas benchmark prices compared to 2021. Prices declined in the second half of 2022, due to increased supply related to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve oil release and ongoing concerns related to a possible economic slowdown and demand from China. 
 Similar to the overall inflation in the wider economy, the oil and gas industry, and hence the Company, is observing higher costs for goods and services used in exploration and production operations. Murphy continues to manage input costs through its dedicated procurement department focused on managing supply chain and other costs. 
 Significant Company operating and financial highlights during and at the end of 2022 were as follows: 
 Generated net income of 965 million and 2,180.2 million of net cash provided by operating activities and 1,070.8 million of adjusted cash flow 1 ; 
 Produced 175 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day (167 thousand excluding noncontrolling interest, NCI) and completed the Khaleesi, Mormont, Samurai field development project in the Gulf of Mexico with seven wells brought online; 
 Acquired additional working interest in non-operated Lucius and Kodiak fields in the Gulf of Mexico for 128.5 million; 
 Announced capital allocation framework 2 and reduced total debt by approximately 650 million, a 26 debt reduction in the year; 
 Doubled the cash dividend since the fourth quarter of 2021 to 1.00 per share annualized; and 
 Achieved 98 total proved reserve replacement with year-end proved reserves of 715.4 million barrels of oil equivalent (697.2 million excluding NCI). 
 
 1 Adjusted cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures 1,109.4 million). Management believes adjusted cash flow is important to provide as it is used by management to evaluate the Company s ability to generate additional cash from business operations after providing for capital investments. Adjusted cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered a substitute for other financial measures as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Additionally, our definition of adjusted cash flow is limited and does not represent residual cash flows available for other discretionary expenditures as the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other obligations. Therefore, we believe it is important to view adjusted cash flow as supplemental to our entire statement of cash flows. 
 2 Details of the capital allocation framework can be found as part of the Company s Form 8-K filed on August 4, 2022. 
 Throughout this section, the term, excluding noncontrolling interest or excluding NCI refers to amounts attributable to Murphy. Unless noted, amounts include noncontrolling interest. 
 Murphy s continuing operations generate revenue by producing crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGL) and natural gas in the United States and Canada and then selling these products to customers. The Company s revenue is affected by the prices of crude oil, natural gas and NGL. In order to make a profit and generate cash in its exploration and production business, revenue generated from the sales of oil and natural gas produced must exceed the combined costs of producing these products and expenses related to exploration, administration and for capital borrowed from lending institutions and note holders.

 Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Continued 

 Changes in the price of crude oil and natural gas have a significant impact on the profitability of the Company. In 2022, liquids from continuing operations represented approximately 62 of total hydrocarbons produced on an energy equivalent basis. In 2023, the Company s ratio of hydrocarbon production represented by liquids is expected to be 63 . If the prices for crude oil and natural gas are lower in 2023 or beyond, this will have an unfavorable impact on the Company s operating profits; likewise, if prices are higher, this will have a favorable impact. The Company, from time to time, may choose to use a variety of commodity hedge instruments to reduce commodity price risk, including forward sale fixed financial swaps and long-term fixed-price physical commodity sales. 
 Oil prices were higher in 2022 compared to the 2021 and 2020 periods. The sales price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil averaged 94.23 in 2022, 67.91 in 2021 and 39.40 in 2020. In 2023, the WTI price has thus far been below the comparable period in 2022, however, higher than the comparable period 2021. 
 WTI average price for 2022 increased 39 over the prior year principally as a result of demand recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical uncertainty and market disruption following the Russia/Ukraine conflict and market concerns over supply shortfalls as discussed above. 
 The most common crude oil indices used to price the Company s crude include Mars, WTI Houston (MEH), Heavy Louisiana Sweet (HLS) and Brent. 
 The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas price per million British Thermal Units (MMBTU) averaged 6.38 in 2022, 3.84 in 2021 and 1.99 in 2020. The 2022 NYMEX natural gas price was higher compared to 2021 and NYMEX prices in 2023 have thus far been below the comparable period in 2022.

 Other Key Performance Metrics 
 The Company uses other operational performance and income metrics to review operational performance. The table below presents Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and adjusted EBITDA. Management uses EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA internally to evaluate the Company s operational performance and trends between periods and relative to its industry competitors. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered a substitute for Net income (loss) or Cash provided by operating activities as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also presented below is adjusted EBITDA per barrel of oil equivalent sold. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA per barrel of oil equivalent sold to evaluate the Company s profitability of one barrel of oil equivalent sold in the period. Adjusted EBITDA per barrel of oil equivalent sold is a non-GAAP financial metric.

 2022 vs 2021 
 The results of operations in this section include amounts attributable to a noncontrolling interest in MP GOM (a subsidiary of Murphy Expro USA, operating and developing properties in the Gulf of Mexico) and exclude discontinued operations, unless otherwise noted. 
 Exploration and production (E P) from continuing operations recorded earnings of 1,579.1 million in 2022 compared to earnings of 716.7 million million in 2021. Results were favorable 862.4 million in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher oil, natural gas liquid and natural gas prices and volumes, lower impairment charges and lower depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD A) expense, partially offset by higher lease operating expenses (LOE), other operating expense, exploration expenses, transportation, gathering and processing, severance and ad valorem taxes and income tax charges. See below for further details. 
 E P crude oil price realizations averaged 94.89 per barrel in 2022 compared to 66.80 per barrel in 2021, an increase of 42 year over year. U.S. natural gas realized price per thousand cubic feet (MCF) averaged 6.68 in the current year compared to 3.71 per MCF in 2021, an increase of 80 year over year. Canada natural gas realized price per MCF averaged U.S. 2.76 in 2022compared to U.S. 2.43 per MCF in 2021, an increase of 14 year over year. E P oil and natural gas LOE and severance and ad valorem taxes (production costs), on a per-unit basis, were 11.55 in 2022 (2021: 9.53). The increase in per-unit production costs in 2022 was primarily attributable to cost increases from inflationary pressures related to the onshore business and higher production from the Khaleesi and Mormont assets.

United States E P operations reported earnings of 1,521.9 million in 2022 compared to earnings of 766.3 million in 2021. Results were favorable 755.6 million in 2022 compared to the 2021 period driven by higher total revenues 1,123.7 million), partially offset by higher LOE 116.3 million), income tax expense 186.9 million), other operating expense 26.9 million), severance and ad valorem taxes 16.1 million) and transportation, gathering and processing costs 15.7 million). 
 Higher revenues are primarily attributable to higher realized prices in 2022 compared to 2021 and higher sales volumes (4,026 barrels of oil equivalent per day higher) which includes additional sales volumes from the Khaleesi, Mormont, Samurai field development project in the Gulf of Mexico. Higher LOE relates to higher production volumes, cost increases from inflationary pressures related to the onshore business and higher production handling fees at the Khaleesi and Mormont assets. Higher income tax expense is a result of higher pre-tax income. Increases in other operating expenses is primarily due to a higher asset retirement adjustments related to non-producing fields, 37.2 million) and higher unfavorable mark to market revaluation on contingent consideration 15.1 million) from prior Gulf of Mexico acquisitions. Higher severance and ad valorem taxes are due to higher revenues at Eagle Ford Shale and higher transportation, gathering and processing costs are due to higher sales volumes at the Gulf of Mexico. 
 Canadian E P operations reported earnings of 134.2 million in 2022 compared to a loss of 16.1 million in 2021. Results were favorable 150.3 million compared to 2021 primarily due to higher revenue from production 105.1 million), no impairment charges in 2022 (2021: 171.3 million) and lower DD A 22.3 million), partially offset by higher other operating expense 78.6 million), higher income tax charges 45.3 million), higher LOE 18.8 million) and higher transportation, gathering and processing 10.0 million). 
 Higher revenue is primarily attributable to higher realized prices and higher gas volumes (new wells added in 2022). Lower impairment and higher other operating expense in 2022 was the result of the 2021 impairment charge for Terra Nova. The impairment charge was recorded in the first quarter of 2021 following notice from the operator of asset abandonment at Terra Nova at the time of the assessment, which was later partially offset with a credit of 71.8 million in the third quarter of 2021 which was reported in other operating expense as a result of the deferral of an asset retirement obligation at Terra Nova following the sanction of an asset life extension project and reversal of the asset abandonment decision. Higher income tax expense is a result of higher pre-tax income. Higher LOE is due to higher gas volumes and higher processing rates at Tupper Montney. Increased transportation, gathering and processing expense is due to higher sales volumes and an increase in transportation rates at Tupper Montney. 
 Other international E P operations reported a loss from continuing operations of 77.0 million in 2022 compared to a loss of 33.5 million in 2021. Results were unfavorable 43.5 million in 2022 compared to 2021 and were largely driven by higher exploration expenses 57.7 million) and higher income tax charges 12.4 million), partially offset by lower impairment charges 18.0 million) and higher revenues 17.9 million). Exploration expenses in 2022 primarily relate to the Cutthroat-1 exploration well in block SEAL-M-428 in the Sergipe-Alagoas Basin offshore Brazil and the Tulum-1EXP exploration well in Block 5 in the Salina Basin offshore Mexico that failed to encounter commercial hydrocarbons. 
 
 2021 vs 2020 
 The results of operations in this section include amounts attributable to a noncontrolling interest in MP GOM (a subsidiary of Murphy Expro USA, operating and developing properties in the Gulf of Mexico) and exclude discontinued operations, unless otherwise noted. 
 E P from continuing operations recorded a earnings of 716.7 million in 2021 compared to a loss of 1,134.9 million in 2020. Results were favorable 1,851.6 million in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to higher oil, natural gas liquid and natural gas prices, significantly lower impairment charges, lower DD A, lower LOE, lower exploration expenses and lower general and administrative (G A) expenses, partially offset by higher transportation, gathering and processing and income tax charges. See below for further details. 
 Crude oil price realizations averaged 66.80 per barrel in 2021 compared to 38.02 per barrel in 2020, a price increase of 76 year over year. U.S. natural gas realized price per MCF averaged 3.71 in 2021 compared to 2.02 per MCF in 2020, an increase of 84 year over year. Canada natural gas realized price per MCF averaged U.S. 2.43 in 2021 compared to U.S. 1.79 per MCF in 2020, an increase of 36 year over year. Oil and natural gas production costs, on a per-unit basis, were 9.53 in 2021 (2020: 9.81). The decrease in per-unit production

costs in 2021 was primarily attributable to reduced costs associated with well workovers and concerted efficiency efforts. 
 United States E P operations reported earnings of 766.3 million in 2021 compared to a loss of 1,014.3 million in 2020. Results were favorable 1,780.6 million in 2021 compared to the 2020 period primarily due to no impairment charges in 2021 (2020 : 1,152.5 million), higher total revenues 925.7 million), lower DD A 132.9 million) and lower LOE 70.5 million), partially offset by higher income tax expense 428.1 million) and higher other operating expense 77.9 million). The impairment charge in 2020 was primarily the result of lower forecast future prices as of March 31, 2020, as a result of lower oil demand (COVID-19 impact) and abundant oil supply at the time of the assessment. 
 Higher revenues were primarily due to higher realized prices (oil and condensate, natural gas and NGLs) year over year, partially offset by lower sales volume (7,514 barrels of oil equivalent per day lower) as a result of lower capital expenditures in 2020. Lower DD A primarily resulted from the prior year impairment charge reducing the depreciable asset base. Lower LOE was primarily due to higher Gulf of Mexico workover costs in the prior year at Cascade 51.3 million) and Dalmatian 20.5 million). Higher income tax expense was a result of higher pre-tax income principally due to higher oil price and lower DD A and LOE. Higher other operating expense was primarily due to an unfavorable mark-to-market revaluation on contingent consideration 63.2 million; as a result of higher commodity prices) from prior Gulf of Mexico acquisitions. 
 Canadian E P operations reported a loss of 16.1 million in 2021 compared to a loss of 35.0 million in 2020. Results were favorable 18.9 million compared to 2020 primarily due to higher revenue 130.5 million) and lower DD A 49.4 million), partially offset by an impairment charge 171.3 million), higher LOE 14.7 million), transportation, gathering and processing 15.8 million) and income tax charges 19.7 million). 2021 results included an impairment charge 171.3 million) recorded in the first quarter following notice from the operator of asset abandonment at Terra Nova at the time of the assessment and a partially offsetting credit of 71.8 million as of September 30, 2021 reported in other operating expense as a result of the deferral of an asset retirement obligation at Terra Nova following the sanction of an asset life extension project and reversal of the asset abandonment decision. 
 Higher revenue was primarily attributable to higher natural gas prices and volumes at Tupper Montney and higher oil prices at Hibernia and Kaybob Duvernay. Lower DD A was primarily due to lower production volumes at Kaybob Duvernay following reduced capital expenditures throughout 2020. Higher LOE and transportation, gathering and processing costs were due to the cost of higher gas processing and downstream transportation capacity, which are expected to be utilized by growth at Tupper Montney in the future. 
 Other international E P operations reported a loss from continuing operations of 33.5 million in 2021 compared to a loss of 85.6 million in 2020. Results were favorable 52.1 million in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to lower impairment charges 21.7 million), lower income tax charges 11.6 million), lower exploration expenses 5.9 million) primarily in Brazil and Mexico and lower LOE 4.8 million).

 Corporate 
 2022 vs 2021 
 Corporate activities, which include interest expense and income, foreign exchange effects, realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments (forward swaps and collars to hedge the price of oil sold) and corporate overhead not allocated to Exploration and Production, reported a loss of 438.3 million in 2022 compared to a loss of 668.0 million in 2021. The 229.7 million favorable variance is principally due to lower net losses on derivative instruments in 2022 compared to 2021 (2022: 320.4 million loss; 2021: 525.9 million loss), lower interest expense 71.0 million) and higher foreign exchange gains 26.0 million), partially offset by a lower tax benefit 70.8 million). Realized and unrealized losses on derivative instruments are due to an increase in market pricing in future periods whereby the swap contracts provide the Company with a fixed price and the collar contracts provide for a minimum (floor) and a maximum (ceiling) price, with variability in between the floor and ceiling. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had no fixed price derivative swaps or collars contracts outstanding. Interest charges are lower in 2022 primarily due to lower overall debt and lower debt redemption costs 8.3 million in 2022; 39.3 million in 2021) incurred by the Company. The Company reduced debt by 649.7 million in 2022. Lower income tax benefit is a result of lower pre-tax losses. 
 2021 vs 2020 
 Corporate activities, which include interest expense and income, foreign exchange effects, realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments (forward swaps and collars to hedge the price of oil sold) and corporate overhead not allocated to Exploration and Production, reported a loss of 668.0 million in 2021 compared to a loss of 120.3 million in 2020. The 547.7 million unfavorable variance was principally due to higher net losses on derivative instruments in 2021 compared to the 2020 period (2021: 525.9 million loss; 2020: 202.7 million gain) and higher interest expense 53.0 million), partially offset by a higher tax benefit 148.3 million), lower restructuring charges 48.8 million), lower G A expenses 12.9 million) and lower impairment charges 7.1 million). Realized and unrealized losses on derivative instruments were due to an increase in market pricing in future periods whereby the swap contracts provided the Company with a fixed price and the collar contracts provided for a minimum (floor) and a maximum (ceiling) price, with variability in between the floor and ceiling. Higher interest costs were principally due to debt redemption costs on the 2022 notes and 550.0 million issuance of new notes in March 2021 that bear interest at a rate of 6.375 and mature on July 15, 2028. Higher income tax benefit was the result of higher pre-tax loss driven by the higher realized and unrealized losses on derivative instruments. Lower restructuring charges and G A were due to the 2020 cost reduction efforts which included closing the Company s previous headquarters office in El Dorado, Arkansas, its office in Calgary, Alberta and consolidating all worldwide staff activities to its existing office location in Houston, Texas.

 Production Volumes and Prices 
 2022 vs 2021 
 Total hydrocarbon production from all E P continuing operations averaged 175,156 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2022, and represents a 5 increase from the 167,356 barrels per day produced in 2021. The increase is principally due to the Khaleesi, Mormont, Samurai field development project that started production in the second quarter of 2022, new wells at Tupper Montney and lower weather related downtime in 2022. 
 Average crude oil and condensate production from continuing operations was 97,365 barrels per day in 2022 compared to 95,705 barrels per day in 2021. The increase of 1,660 barrels per day is principally due to increased production in the Gulf of Mexico (4,694 barrels per day) with new production from Khaleesi, Mormont, Samurai field development project, partially offset by normal declines at other fields in the Gulf of Mexico. Eagle Ford Shale production is lower (1,202 barrels per day) due to lower capital expenditures in 2020 and 2021, partially offset by new wells in 2022. Canada production is lower (2,260 barrels per day) due to normal field decline at Kaybob Duvernay and Hibernia, as well as a turnaround at Hibernia. On a worldwide basis, the Company s crude oil and condensate prices average 94.89 per barrel in 2022 compared to 66.80 per barrel in the 2021 period, an increase of 42 year over year. 
 Total production of natural gas liquids (NGL) from continuing operations was 10,681 barrels per day in 2022 compared to 10,385 barrels per day in 2021. The average sales price for U.S. NGL was 34.87 per barrel in 2022 compared to 27.97 per barrel in 2021. The average sales price for NGL in Canada was 55.65 per barrel in 2022 compared to 40.18 per barrel in 2021. NGL prices are higher in Canada due to the higher value of product produced at the Kaybob Duvernay and Placid Montney assets. 
 Natural gas sales volumes from continuing operations averaged 403 MMCFD in 2022 compared to 368 MMCFD in 2021. The increase of 35 MMCFD was primarily the result of higher volumes in Canada (32.4 MMCFD) and higher volumes in the Gulf of Mexico (2.1 MMCFD). The higher natural gas volumes in Canada was the result of new wells on production in 2022. Natural gas prices for the total Company averaged 3.66 per MCF in 2022, versus 2.74 per MCF average in the same period of 2021. Average realized natural gas prices in the U.S. and Canada in 2022 were 6.68 and 2.76 per MCF, respectively. Average realized natural gas prices in Canada are lower as a result of certain fixed price sales volume contracts. 
 2021 vs 2020 
 Total hydrocarbon production from all E P continuing operations averaged 167,356 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2021, which represented a 4 decrease from the 174,636 barrels per day produced in 2020. 
 Average crude oil and condensate production from continuing operations was 95,705 barrels per day in 2021 compared to 103,966 barrels per day in 2020. The decrease of 8,261 barrels per day was principally due to lower volumes in the Gulf of Mexico (2,703 barrels per day primarily due to reservoir decline), lower volumes at Kaybob Duvernay (2,272 barrels per day due to well decline) and lower Eagle Ford Shale production (765 barrels per day). On a worldwide basis, the Company s crude oil and condensate prices averaged 66.80 per barrel in 2021 compared to 38.02 per barrel in 2020, an increase of 76 year over year. 
 Total production of natural gas liquids (NGL) from continuing operations was 10,385 barrels per day in 2021 compared to 11,541 barrels per day in 2020. The average sales price for U.S. NGL was 27.97 per barrel in 2021 compared to 11.29 per barrel in 2020. The average sales price of NGL in Canada was 40.18 per barrel in 2021 compared to 18.54 per barrel in 2020. NGL prices were higher in Canada due to the higher value of product produced at the Kaybob Duvernay and Placid Montney assets. 
 Natural gas sales volumes from continuing operations averaged 368 MMCFD in 2021 compared to 355 MMCFD in 2020. The increase of 13 MMCFD was a primarily the result of higher volumes in Canada due to bringing online 14 new wells at Tupper Montney in 2021. Higher volumes at Tupper Montney were partially offset by lower natural gas volumes in the Gulf of Mexico. 
 Natural gas prices for the total Company averaged 2.74 per MCF in 2021, versus 1.85 per MCF average in 2020. Average realized natural gas prices in the U.S. and Canada in 2021 were 3.71 and 2.43 per MCF, respectively.

 Financial Condition 
 The Company s primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, net cash provided by continuing operations activities and available borrowing capacity under its senior unsecured revolving credit facility. The Company s liquidity requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures, debt maturity, retirement and interest payments, working capital requirements, dividend payments and, as applicable, share repurchases. See below for additional discussion and analysis of the Company s cash flows. 
 Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by continuing operating activities was 2,180.2 million in 2022 compared to 1,422.2 million in 2021. The increased cash provided by continuing operating activities of 758.0 million is primarily attributable to higher revenue from sales from production 1,237.2 million), partially offset by higher LOE 139.8 million), higher realized losses on derivative instruments 121.5 million) and the change in receivable and payable working capital balances 65.7 million). Higher revenues were primarily due to higher commodity prices driven by demand recovery from COVID-19 and geopolitical uncertainty and market disruption resulting from the Russia/Ukraine conflict. 
 Net cash provided by continuing operating activities was 619.5 million higher in 2021 than in 2020 due to higher revenue from sales from production 1,049.5 million), the positive effect of movements on payable and receivable working capital balances 118.5 million), lower lease operating expenses 60.5 million) and lower general and administrative and cash restructuring expenses 50.7 million), partially offset by higher cash payments made on forward swap commodity contracts (2021: realized loss of 413.7 million; 2020: realized gain of 272.0 million). Higher revenues were primarily due to higher commodity prices driven by OPEC+ supply constraints and the increase in demand. 
 The total reductions of operating cash flows for interest paid (which excludes debt redemption costs reported in Financing activities) during the three years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were 150.0 million, 165.7 million and 191.6 million, respectively. Lower cash interest paid in 2022 was primarily due to the early redemption of 649.7 million of the 2024 notes, 2025 notes, 2028 notes and the 2042 notes. Lower cash interest paid in 2021 was due to the repayment of the 200 million outstanding on the revolving credit facility, the early redemption of the 2022 notes and the early redemption of 300 million of the 2024 notes, partially offset by interest paid on the issuance of 2028 notes in the first quarter of 2021. 
 Cash Used for Investing Activities 
 Net cash required by investing activities were 1,109.5 million and 417.7 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. In 2022, the Company acquired additional working interest in Kodiak (11.0 and Lucius (3.4 for 50.0 million and 78.5 million, respectively (also see Note D ). Property additions and dry hole costs (excluding King s Quay FPS), which include amounts expensed, were 985.5 million and 650.2 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. In 2021, the Company received sales proceeds for the King s Quay FPS of 267.7 million and also acquired additional interests in the proved property Lucius for 19.9 million. In 2020, cash used by investing activities included 113 million used to fund the development of the King s Quay FPS. 
 The accrual (value of work done) basis capital expenditures were as follows: 
 Year Ended December 31, (Millions of dollars) 2022 2021 2020 Capital Expenditures Exploration and production 1,161.5 690.1 813.3 Corporate 21.7 21.1 13.3 Total capital expenditures 1,183.2 711.2 826.6 Total capital expenditures excluding proved property acquisitions 1,054.7 711.2 826.6 Total capital expenditures excluding proved property acquisitions and NCI 1,028.8 688.2 804.9 
 A reconciliation of property additions and dry hole costs in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows to total capital expenditures for continuing operations follows.

 1 Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. 
 Capital expenditures in the exploration and production business in 2022 compared to 2021 have increased and is primarily attributable to expenditures related to the Kodiak and Lucius acquisitions in the Gulf of Mexico 128.5 million), Cutthroat-1 exploration well in Brazil 38.4 million),Tulum-1EXP exploration well in Mexico 21.6 million), higher capital invested at the Khaleesi, Mormont, Samurai field development project in the Gulf of Mexico, higher development drilling activities in Eagle Ford Shale and Tupper Montney assets and higher expenditures related to the asset life extension at Terra Nova. 
 Capital expenditures in the exploration and production business in 2021 compared to 2020 have decreased as result of capital expenditure reductions to support generating free cash flow. 
 Cash Used by and Provided by Financing Activities 
 Net cash required by financing activities was 1,081.6 million in 2022 compared to 794.5 million in 2021. In 2022, the cash required by financing activities was principally due to the early redemption of 647.7 million (excluding non cash gain of 2.0 million) of the 2024 notes, 2025 notes, 2028 notes and the 2042 notes, costs associated with early redemption 8.3 million), distributions to noncontrolling interest 183.0 million), dividends paid 128.2 million) and payment of contingent consideration related to prior Gulf of Mexico acquisitions 81.7 million). The Company anticipates the final payments for the contingent consideration liability, related to the Gulf of Mexico acquisitions, to be paid in the first half of 2023. See Note P for further details. 
 The primary sources of the Company s liquidity are internally generated funds, access to outside financing and working capital. The Company generally uses its internally generated funds to finance its capital and operating expenditures, but it also maintains lines of credit with banks and will borrow as necessary to meet spending requirements. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has a 800 million senior unsecured guaranteed credit facility (RCF) with a major banking consortium, which expires in November 2027. At December 31, 2022, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the RCF and 57.6 million of outstanding letters of credit, which reduce the borrowing capacity of the RCF. If required, this provides the Company approximately 742 million availability on its RCF to fund investing activities from borrowings. 
 In 2021, the cash required by financing activities was principally due to the repayment of the balance outstanding on the revolving credit facility 200.0 million), the early redemption of the remainder of the 2022 notes 576.4 million), the early redemption of a portion of the 2024 notes 300.0 million), costs associated with early redemption 39.3 million), dividends paid 77.2 million) and distributions to noncontrolling interest 137.5 million), partially offset by issuance of 2028 notes 541.9 million) 
 In 2020, net cash provided by financing activities of 39.7 million was principally from borrowings on the Company s RCF 200.0 million), partially offset by dividends paid 96.0 million) and distributions to noncontrolling interest 43.7 million). 
 Working Capital 
 At the end of 2022, working capital (total current assets less total current liabilities, excluding assets and liabilities held for sale) amounted to a net working capital liability of 285.5 million (2021: net working capital liability of 298.9 million). The total working capital liability decrease of 13.4 million in 2022 is primarily attributable to higher accounts receivable, net 133.0 million) and lower accounts payable 79.3 million), partially offset by higher other accrued liabilities 82.7 million), higher operating lease liabilities 81.0 million) and lower cash and cash equivalents 29.2 million). Higher accounts receivable are principally due to higher

crude oil and natural gas pricing. Lower accounts payable is primarily due to the decrease in unrealized losses on derivative instruments (commodity price swaps and collars) which matured at the end of 2022, partially offset by higher revenue payables principally due to higher crude oil and natural gas pricing and higher trades payable related to timing of Gulf of Mexico activities. Higher other accrued liabilities are associated with higher short-term contingent consideration obligations (from prior Gulf of Mexico acquisitions) due to a reclassification from long-term liabilities. Higher operating lease liabilities are associated with a rig contract to support the Khaleesi, Mormont, Samurai field development project. 
 Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 totaled 492.0 million (2021: 521.2 million). There were no borrowings from the RCF outstanding at the end of the 2022 or 2021. 
 Cash and invested cash are maintained in several operating locations outside the U.S. As of December 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents held outside the U.S. included U.S dollar equivalents of approximately 147.7 million (2021: 242.9 million), the majority of which was held in Canada 83.3 million) and Mexico 27.7 million). In addition, approximately 12.3 million and 6.1 million of cash was held in the U.K. and Brazil, respectively. In certain cases, the Company could incur cash taxes or other costs should these cash balances be repatriated to the U.S. in future periods. Canada currently collects a 5 withholding tax on any earnings repatriated to the U.S. See Note I for further information regarding potential tax expense that could be incurred upon distribution of foreign earnings back to the United States. 
 Capital Employed 
 As of December 31, 2022, long-term debt of 1,822.4 million had decreased by 643.0 million compared to December 31, 2021, as a result the early redemption, in whole or in part, of the 2024 notes, 2025 notes, 2028 notes and the 2042 notes. The fixed-rate notes had a weighted average maturity of 7.7 years and a weighted average coupon of 6.2 . 
 A summary of capital employed as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 follows. 
 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (Millions of dollars) Amount Amount Capital employed Long-term debt 1,822.4 26.7 2,465.4 37.2 Murphy shareholders' equity 4,994.8 73.3 4,157.3 62.8 Total capital employed 6,817.2 100.0 6,622.7 100.0 
 Murphy shareholders equity was 4.99 billion at the end of 2022 (2021: 4.16 billion). Shareholders equity increased in 2022 primarily due to 2022 net income 965.0 million) and a favorable revaluation of pension assets and liabilities 99.4 million), partially offset by dividends paid 128.2 million) and foreign currency translation losses, net of income taxes 106.3 million). A summary of transactions in stockholders equity accounts is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity on page 71 of this Form 10-K report. 
 Other Balance Sheet Activity - Long-Term Assets and Liabilities 
 Other significant changes in Murphy s balance sheet at the end of 2022, compared to 2021 are discussed below. 
 Property, plant and equipment, net of depreciation increased 100.2 million principally due to capital expenditures in the year, partially offset by DD A expense 776.8 million) and foreign exchange rates applicable for our Canadian assets. Capital expenditures are discussed above in the Cash Used for Investing Activities section. 
 Murphy had commitments for capital expenditures of approximately 282.4 million at December 31, 2022 (2021: 520.1 million). This amount includes 103.5 million for approved expenditure for capital projects relating to non-operated interests in deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico, principally at St. Malo 98.9 million), non-operated Canada interests, mainly offshore 33.3 million), non-operated Eagle Ford Shale 13.3 million) and Brunei 1.0 million).

Operating lease assets increased 65.0 million principally due to additions for drilling rig lease extensions, partially offset by depreciation and a decrease related to changes in foreign exchange rates applicable for our Canadian assets. 
 Deferred Income tax assets decreased by 267.6 million as a result of the decrease in the U.S. net operating loss carryforward of 2.10 billion at year-end 2022, down from 2.75 billion at year-end 2021. 
 Deferred credits and other liabilities decreased 265.6 million primarily as a result reclassification of amounts to current, a favorable pension fair value remeasurement and cash pension contributions to the plan in 2022. 
 At December 31, 2022, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the RCF and 57.6 million of outstanding letters of credit, which reduce the borrowing capacity of the RCF. Borrowings under the RCF are subject to certain interest rates, please refer to Note G for further details. At December 31, 2022, the interest rate in effect on borrowings under the facility would have been 6.96 . At December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all covenants related to the RCF.

 Environmental, Health and Safety Matters 
 Murphy faces various environmental, health and safety risks that are inherent in exploring for, developing and producing hydrocarbons. To help manage these risks, the Company has established a robust health, safety and environmental governance program comprised of a worldwide policy, guiding principles, annual goals and a management system incorporating oversight at each business unit, senior leadership and board levels. The Company strives to minimize these risks by continually improving its processes through design, operation and implementation of a comprehensive asset integrity plan, and through emergency and oil spill response planning to address any credible risks. These plans are presented to, reviewed and approved by a Health, Safety, Environmental and Corporate Responsibility Committee consisting of certain members of Murphy s Board of Directors. 
 The oil and gas industry is subject to numerous international, foreign, national, state, provincial and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Murphy allocates a portion of both its capital expenditures and its general and administrative budget toward compliance with existing and anticipated environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These requirements affect virtually all operations of the Company and increase Murphy s overall cost of business, including its capital costs to construct, maintain and upgrade equipment and facilities as well as operating costs for ongoing compliance. 
 The principal environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which Murphy is subject address such matters as the generation, storage, handling, use, disposal and remediation of petroleum products, wastewater and hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of such materials to the environment, including GHG emissions; wildlife, habitat and water protection; the placement, operation and decommissioning of production equipment; and the health and safety of our employees, contractors and communities where our operations are located. These laws and regulations also generally require permits for existing operations, as well as the construction or development of new operations and the decommissioning facilities once production has ceased. Violations can give rise to sanctions including significant civil and criminal penalties, injunctions, construction bans and delays. 
 Further information on environmental, health and safety laws and regulations applicable to Murphy are contained in the Business section beginning page 10. 
 Climate Change and Emissions 
 The world s population and standard of living is growing steadily along with the demand for energy. Murphy recognizes that this may generate increasing amounts of GHG, which could raise important climate change concerns. Murphy works to assess the Company s governance, strategy, risk identification, and management and measurement of climate risks and opportunities in order to remain in alignment with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) core elements. The TCFD was created by the Financial Stability Board to focus on climate-related financial disclosures to improve and increase reporting of climate-related financial information. Murphy s disclosures related to its alignment with the TCFD are included in the Company s 2022 Sustainability Report issued on August 4, 2022, which is not incorporated by reference hereto. 
 
 Other Matters 
 Impact of inflation In 2022, many countries worldwide continued to experience a rise in inflation, including countries where the Company operates (this follows a sustained period of relatively low inflation prior to 2021). In the U.S., inflation continued as a result of ongoing supply constraints and increasing demand of goods and services as countries continue their recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company s revenues, capital and operating costs are influenced to a larger extent by specific price changes in the oil and gas industry and allied industries rather than by changes in general inflation. Crude oil prices generally reflect the balance between supply and demand, with crude oil prices being particularly sensitive to OPEC+ production levels and/or attitudes of traders concerning supply and demand in the future. Costs for oil field goods and services are usually affected by the worldwide prices for crude oil. 
 As a result of increasing commodity prices for oil and natural gas, since the start of 2022, higher costs for goods and services in the oil and gas industry are being observed. Murphy has a dedicated procurement department focused on managing supply chain and input costs. Murphy also has certain transportation, processing and production handling services costs fixed through long-term contracts and commitments and therefore is partly

protected from the increasing price of services. However, from time to time, Murphy will seek to enter new commitments, exercise options to extend contracts and retender contracts for rigs and other industry services which could expose Murphy to the impact of higher costs. Murphy continues to strive toward safely executing our work in an ever-increasing efficient manner to mitigate possible inflationary pressures in our business. 
 Natural gas prices are also affected by supply and demand, which are often affected by the weather and by the fact that delivery of natural gas can be restricted to specific geographic areas. Natural gas demand is also impacted by demand driven by lower carbon emission and a view that natural gas is one option to transition from higher carbon emitting fuels. 
 As a result of the overall volatility of oil and natural gas prices, it is not possible to predict the Company s future cost of oil field goods and services.

 Critical Accounting Estimates In preparing the Company s consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management must make a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Application of certain of the Company s accounting policies requires significant estimates. The most significant of these accounting policies and estimates are described below. 
 Oil and natural gas proved reserves Oil and natural gas proved reserves are defined by the SEC as those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations before the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire (unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain). Proved developed reserves of oil and natural gas can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared with the cost of a new well, or through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well. 
 Although the Company s engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves as established by the SEC, the estimation of reserves requires the engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment. SEC rules require the Company to use an unweighted average of the oil and natural gas prices in effect at the beginning of each month of the year for determining quantities of proved reserves. These historical prices often do not approximate the average price that the Company expects to receive for its oil and natural gas production in the future. The Company often uses significantly different oil and natural gas price and reserve assumptions when making its own internal economic property evaluations. Changes in oil and natural gas prices can lead to a decision to start-up or shut-in production, which can lead to revisions to reserves quantities. 
 Estimated reserves are subject to future revision, certain of which could be substantial, based on the availability of additional information, including reservoir performance, new geological and geophysical data, additional drilling, technological advancements, price changes and other economic factors. Reserves revisions inherently lead to adjustments of the Company s depreciation rates and the timing of settlement of asset retirement obligations. Downward reserves revisions can also lead to significant impairment expense. The Company cannot predict the type of oil and natural gas reserves revisions that will be required in future periods. 
 The Company s proved reserves of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas are presented on pages 110 to 119 of this Form 10-K report. Murphy s estimations for proved reserves were generated through the integration of available geoscience, engineering, and economic data (including hydrocarbon prices, operating costs, and development costs), and commercially available technologies, to establish reasonable certainty of economic producibility. As defined by the SEC, reasonable certainty of proved reserves describes a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered. In estimating proved reserves, Murphy uses familiar industry-accepted methods for subsurface evaluations, including performance, volumetric, and analog-based studies. 
 Where appropriate, Murphy includes reliable geologic and engineering technology to estimate proved reserves. Reliable geologic and engineering technology is a method or combination of methods that are field-tested and have demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. This integrated approach increases the quality of and confidence in Murphy s proved reserves estimates. It was utilized in certain undrilled acreage at distances greater than the directly offsetting development spacing areas, and in certain reservoirs developed with the application of improved recovery techniques. Murphy utilized a combination of 3D seismic interpretation, core analysis, wellbore log measurements, well test data, historic production and pressure data, and commercially available seismic processing and numerical reservoir simulation programs. Reservoir parameters from analogous reservoirs were used to strengthen the reserves estimates when available. 
 See further discussion of proved reserves and changes in proved reserves during the three years ended December 31, 2022 beginning on pages 4 and 110 of this Form 10-K report.

Property, Plant and Equipment - impairment of long-lived assets The Company continually monitors its long-lived assets recorded in Property, plant and equipment in the Consolidated Balance Sheet to make sure that they are fairly presented. The Company must evaluate its property, plant and equipment for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from future cash flows. 
 A significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events. Such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices, an estimate of the amount of oil and natural gas that will be produced from a field, the timing of this future production, future costs to produce the oil and natural gas, future capital, operating and abandonment costs and future inflation levels. 
 The need to test a long-lived asset for impairment can be based on several factors, including, but not limited to, a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and/or natural gas, unfavorable revisions of oil or natural gas reserves, or other changes to contracts, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, tax laws or other regulatory changes. All of these factors must be considered when evaluating a property s carrying value for possible impairment. 
 Due to the volatility of world oil and natural gas markets, the actual sales prices for oil and natural gas have often been different from the Company s projections. 
 Estimates of future oil and natural gas production and sales volumes are based on a combination of proved and risked probable and possible reserves. Although the estimation of reserves and future production is uncertain, the Company believes that its estimates are reasonable; however, there have been cases where actual production volumes were higher or lower than projected and the timing was different than the original projection. The Company adjusts reserves and production estimates as new information becomes available. 
 The Company generally projects future costs by using historical costs adjusted for both assumed long-term inflation rates and known or expected changes in future operations. Although the projected future costs are considered to be reasonable, at times, costs have been higher or lower than originally estimated. 
 There were no impairments recognized in 2022. In 2021, the Company recognized pretax noncash impairment charges of 196.3 million to reduce the carrying values at select properties. In 2021, the Company recorded an impairment charge of 171.3 million for Terra Nova due to the status, including agreements with the partners, of operating and production plans and 25.0 million for assets reported as Assets held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 See also Note D for further discussion of impairment charges. 
 Income taxes The Company is subject to income and other similar taxes in all areas in which it operates. When recording income tax expense, certain estimates are required because: (a) income tax returns are generally filed months after the close of its annual accounting period; (b) tax returns are subject to audit by taxing authorities and audits can often take years to complete and settle; (c) future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized by the Company; and (d) changes to regulations may be subject to different interpretations and require future clarification from issuing authorities or others. 
 The Company has deferred tax assets mostly relating to U.S net operating losses, liabilities for dismantlement, retirement benefit plan obligations and net deferred tax liabilities relating to tax and accounting basis differences for property, plant and equipment. 
 The Company routinely evaluates all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of their realization and reduce such assets to the expected realizable amount by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In assessing the need for valuation allowances, we consider all available positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence includes projected future taxable income and assessment of future business assumptions, a history of utilizing tax assets before expiration, significant proven and probable reserves and reversals of taxable temporary differences. Negative evidence includes losses in recent years. 
 As of December 31, 2022 the Company had a U.S. deferred tax asset associated with net operating losses of 442.7 million. In reviewing the likeliness of realizing this asset the Company considered the reversal of taxable temporary differences, carryforward periods and future taxable income estimates based on projected financial

information which, based on currently available evidence, we believe to be reasonably likely to occur. Certain estimates and assumptions are used in the estimation of future taxable income, including (but not limited to) (a) future commodity prices for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, (b) estimated reserves for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, (c) expected timing of production, (d) estimated lease operating costs and (e) future capital requirements. In the future, the underlying actual assumptions utilized in estimating future taxable income could be different and result in different conclusions about the likelihood of the future utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards. 
 Accounting for retirement and postretirement benefit plans Murphy and certain of its subsidiaries maintain defined benefit retirement plans covering certain full-time employees. The Company also sponsors health care and life insurance benefit plans covering most retired U.S. employees. The expense associated with these plans is estimated by management based on a number of assumptions and with consultation assistance from qualified third-party actuaries. The most important of these assumptions for the retirement plans involve the discount rate used to measure future plan obligations and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. For the retiree medical and insurance plans, the most important assumptions are the discount rate for future plan obligations and the health care cost trend rate. Discount rates are based on the universe of high-quality corporate bonds that are available within each country. Cash flow analyses are performed in which a spot yield curve is used to discount projected benefit payment streams for the most significant plans. The discounted cash flows are used to determine an equivalent single rate which is the basis for selecting the discount rate within each country. Expected plan asset returns are based on long-term expectations for asset portfolios with similar investment mix characteristics. Anticipated health care cost trend rates are determined based on prior experience of the Company and an assessment of near-term and long-term trends for medical and drug costs. 
 Based on bond yields as of December 31, 2022, the Company has used a weighted average discount rate of 5.42 at year-end 2022 for the primary U.S. plans. This weighted average discount rate is 2.6 higher than prior year, which decreased the Company s recorded liabilities for retirement plans compared to a year ago. The Company assumed a return on plan assets of 6.60 for the primary U.S. plan, it periodically reconsiders the appropriateness of this and other key assumptions. The Company s retirement and postretirement plan (health care and life insurance benefit plans) expenses in 2023 are expected to be 6.4 million higher than 2022 primarily due to the increase in the discount rate assumption for U.S. pension plan, which increases the amount of interest cost recognized in net periodic benefit expense. Cash contributions to all plans are anticipated to be 6.2 million lower in 2023. 
 In 2022, the Company paid 41.1 million into various retirement plans and 2.1 million into postretirement plans. In 2023, the Company is expecting to fund payments of approximately 32.2 million into various retirement plans and 4.8 million for postretirement plans. The Company could be required to make additional and more significant funding payments to retirement plans in future years. Future required payments and the amount of liabilities recorded on the balance sheet associated with the plans could be unfavorably affected if the discount rate declines, the actual return on plan assets falls below the assumed return, or the health care cost trend rate increase is higher than expected.

Outlook 
 Prices for the Company s primary products are often volatile. The price of crude oil is primarily affected by the levels of supply and demand for energy. Anticipated future variances between the predicted demand for crude oil and the projected available supply can lead to significant movement in the price of crude oil. As of close on February 23, 2023, the NYMEX WTI forward curve price for the remainder of 2023 and 2024 were 75.05 and 71.85 per barrel, respectively; however we cannot predict what impact economic factors (including inflation, the Russia/Ukraine conflict and the COVID-19 pandemic) may have on future commodity pricing. Lower prices, should they occur, will result in lower profits and operating cash-flows. 
 The Company s capital expenditure spend for 2023 is expected to be between 875 million and 1025 million, excluding the amount attributable to noncontrolling interest. Capital and other expenditures are routinely reviewed and planned capital expenditures may be adjusted to reflect differences between budgeted and forecast cash flow during the year. Capital expenditures may also be affected by asset purchases or sales, which often are not anticipated at the time a budget is prepared. The Company will primarily fund its capital program in 2023 using operating cash flow and available cash. If oil and/or natural gas prices weaken, actual cash flow generated from operations could be reduced such that capital spending reductions are required and/or borrowings under available credit facilities might be required during the year to maintain funding of the Company s ongoing development projects. 
 The Company currently expects average daily production in 2023 to be between 182,700 and 190,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day (including noncontrolling interest of 7,200 BOEPD). If significant price declines occur, the Company will review the option of production curtailments to avoid incurring losses on certain produced barrels. 
 The Company plans to utilize surplus cash (not planned to be used by operations, investing activities, dividends or payment to noncontrolling interests) in accordance with the Company s capital allocation framework. Details of the framework can be found in the Capital Allocation Framework section of the Company s Form 8-K filed on August 4, 2022. 
 The Company continues to monitor the impact of commodity prices on its financial position and is currently in compliance with the covenants related to the revolving credit facility (see Note G ). 
 The Company has entered into derivative or forward fixed-price delivery contracts to manage risk associated with certain future oil and natural gas sales prices as follows:

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 The management of Murphy Oil Corporation is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and other financial data. The financial statements were prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) appropriate in the circumstances and include some amounts based on informed estimates and judgments, with consideration given to materiality. 
 An independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has audited the Company s consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and provides an objective, independent opinion about the Company s consolidated financial statements. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors appoints the independent registered public accounting firm; ratification of the appointment is solicited annually from the shareholders. KPMG LLP s opinion covering the Company s consolidated financial statements can be found on page 64. 
 The Board of Directors appoints an Audit Committee annually to implement and to support the Board s oversight function of the Company s financial reporting, accounting policies, internal controls and independent registered public accounting firm. This Committee is composed solely of directors who are not employees of the Company. The Committee meets routinely with representatives of management, the Company s audit staff and the independent registered public accounting firm to review and discuss the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company s internal controls, the quality and clarity of its financial reporting, the scope and results of independent and internal audits, and to fulfill other responsibilities included in the Committee s Charter. The independent registered public accounting firm and the Company s audit staff have unrestricted access to the Committee, without management presence, to discuss audit findings and other financial matters. 
 
 REPORT OF MANAGEMENT INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). The Company s internal controls have been designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. All internal control systems have inherent limitations, and therefore, can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of consolidated financial statements. 
 Management has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Based on the results of this evaluation, management concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 KPMG LLP has performed an audit of the Company s internal control over financial reporting, and their opinion thereon can be found on page 66.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 
 Murphy Oil Corporation: 
 
 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Murphy Oil Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), cash flows, and stockholders equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule II (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 27, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Estimated oil and gas reserves used in the depletion of producing oil and gas properties 
 As discussed in Note A to the consolidated financial statements, the Company calculates depletion expense related to producing oil and gas properties using the units-of-production method. Under this method, costs to acquire interests in oil and gas properties and costs for the drilling and completion efforts for exploratory wells that find proved reserves and for development wells are capitalized. Capitalized costs of producing oil and gas properties, along with equipment and facilities that support production, are amortized to expense by the units-of-production method. The Company s internal petroleum reserve engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves and the Company engages third-party petroleum reserve specialists to perform an independent assessment. For the year ended 
 64 

Table of Contents 

December 31, 2022, the Company recorded depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense of 776.8 million. 
 We identified the assessment of the estimated oil and gas reserves used in the depletion of producing oil and gas properties as a critical audit matter. Complex auditor judgment was required in evaluating the Company s estimate of total proved oil and gas reserves, which is an input to the depletion expense calculation. Estimating proved oil and gas reserves requires the expertise of professional petroleum reserve engineers based on their estimates of forecasted production, forecasted operating costs, future development costs, and oil and gas prices. 
 The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company s depletion calculation process, including controls related to the estimation of proved oil and gas reserves. We evaluated (1) the professional qualifications of the internal petroleum reserve engineers, third-party petroleum reserve specialists, and external engineering firm, (2) the knowledge, skills, ability of the Company s internal petroleum reserve engineers and third-party petroleum reserve specialists, and (3) the relationship of the third-party petroleum reserve specialists and external engineering firm to the Company. We analyzed and assessed the calculation of depletion expense for compliance with industry and regulatory standards. We compared the forecasted production assumptions used by the Company to historical production rates. We compared the forecasted operating costs to historical results. We also evaluated the forecasted nature and timing of future development costs by obtaining an understanding of the development projects and comparing the development projects with the available development plans. We assessed the oil and gas prices utilized by the internal petroleum reserve engineers by comparing them to publicly available prices and recalculated the relevant market differentials. In addition, we read and considered the report of the Company s third-party petroleum reserve specialists in connection with our evaluation of the Company s proved oil and gas reserve estimates.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors 
 Murphy Oil Corporation: 
 
 Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited Murphy Oil Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), cash flows, and stockholders equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule II (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 27, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management - Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 key geographic segments: the U.S. and Canada. Additionally, revenue from sales to customers is generated from primary revenue streams: crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas. 
 For operated oil and natural gas production where the non-operated working interest owner does not take-in-kind its proportionate interest in the produced commodity, the Company acts as an agent for the working interest owner and recognizes revenue only for its own share of the commingled production. The exception to this is the reporting of the noncontrolling interest in MP GOM as prescribed by U.S. GAAP. 
 U.S. - In the United States, the Company primarily produces oil and natural gas from fields in the Eagle Ford Shale area of South Texas and in the Gulf of Mexico. Revenue is generally recognized when oil and natural gas is transferred to the customer at the delivery point. Revenue recognized is largely index based with price adjustments for floating market differentials. 
 Canada - In Canada, contracts include long-term floating commodity index priced and natural gas physical forward sales fixed-price contracts. For the Offshore business in Canada, contracts are based on index prices and revenue is recognized at the time of vessel load based on the volumes on the bill of lading and point of custody transfer. 
 Disaggregation of Revenue 
 The Company reviews performance based on key geographical segments and between onshore and offshore sources of revenue within these geographies.

 In 2022, the Company included additional line items on the face of the Consolidated Statements of Operations to report sales of purchased natural gas and costs of purchased natural gas. Purchases of natural gas are reported on a gross basis when Murphy takes control of the product and has risks and rewards of ownership. Sales of natural gas are reported when the contractual performance obligations are satisfied. This occurs at the time the product is delivered to a third party purchaser at the contractually determinable price.

million and million, respectively. Payment terms for the Company s sales vary across contracts and geographical regions, with the majority of the cash receipts required within 30 days of billing. Based on a forward-looking expected loss model in accordance with ASU 2016-13, the Company did not recognize any impairment losses on receivables or contract assets arising from customer contracts during the reporting periods. 
 The Company has not entered into any revenue contracts that have financing components as of December 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020. 
 The Company does not employ sales incentive strategies such as commissions or bonuses for obtaining sales contracts. For the periods presented, the Company did not identify any assets to be recognized associated with the costs to obtain a contract with a customer. 
 Performance Obligations 
 The Company recognizes oil and natural gas revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a commodity to a customer. Judgment is required to determine whether some customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefit of commodities. As a result of this assessment for the Company, each unit of measure of the specified commodity is considered to represent a distinct performance obligation that is satisfied at a point in time upon the transfer of control of the commodity. 
 For contracts with market or index-based pricing, which represent the majority of sales contracts, the Company has elected the allocation exception and allocates the variable consideration to each single performance obligation in the contract. As a result, there is no price allocation to unsatisfied remaining performance obligations for delivery of commodity product in subsequent periods. 
 The Company has entered into several long-term, fixed-price contracts in Canada. The underlying reason for entering a fixed price contract is generally unrelated to anticipated future prices or other observable data and serves a particular purpose in the Company s long-term strategy.

 In management s judgment, the net deferred tax assets in the preceding table are more likely than not to be realized based on the consideration of deferred tax liability reversals and future taxable income. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets relates primarily to tax assets arising in foreign tax jurisdictions that in the judgment of management at the present time are more likely than not to be unrealized. The valuation allowance increased million in 2022, related all to non-U.S. items. Subsequent reductions of the valuation allowance are expected to be reported as reductions of tax expense assuming no offsetting change in the deferred tax asset. 
 The Company has an U.S. net operating loss of billion at year-end 2022 with a corresponding deferred tax asset of million. The Company believes the U.S. net operating loss being carried forward will more likely than not be utilized in future periods prior to expirations in 2036 and 2037. 
 Other Information 
 Currently the Company considers million of Canada s past foreign earnings not permanently reinvested, with an accompanying million liability. At December 31, 2021, billion of past foreign earnings are considered permanently reinvested. The Company closely and routinely monitors these reinvestment positions considering underlying facts and circumstances pertinent to our business and the future operation of the Company. 
 Uncertain Income Tax Positions 
 The financial statement recognition of the benefit for a tax position is dependent upon the benefit being more likely than not to be sustainable upon ultimate settlement. If this threshold is met, the tax benefit is then measured and recognized at the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Liabilities associated with uncertain income tax positions are included in Deferred credits and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 All additions or settlements to the above liability affect the Company s effective income tax rate in the respective period of change. The Company accounts for any applicable interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. The Company also had other recorded liabilities of million as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, for interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions. Income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 included net benefits for interest and penalties of , and million, respectively, associated with uncertain tax positions. 
 In 2023, the Company currently expects to add between million and million to the provision for uncertain tax positions. Although existing liabilities could be reduced by settlement with taxing authorities or lapse due to statute of limitations, the Company believes that the changes in its unrecognized tax benefits due to these events will not have a material impact on the Consolidated Statement of Operations during 2023. 
 The Company s tax returns in multiple jurisdictions are subject to audit by taxing authorities. These audits often take years to complete and settle. Although the Company believes that recorded liabilities for unsettled issues are adequate, additional gains or losses could occur in future years from resolution of outstanding unsettled matters. Additionally, the Company could be required to pay amounts into an escrow account as any matters are identified and appealed with the relevant taxing authorities. As of December 31, 2022, the earliest years remaining open for audit and/or settlement in the Company s major taxing jurisdictions are as follows: United States 2016; Canada 2016; and Malaysia 2016. The Company has retained certain possible liabilities and rights to income tax receivables relating to Malaysia for the years prior to 2019.

Each grant will vest if the Company achieves specific performance objectives at the end of the designated performance period. Additional shares may be awarded if performance objectives are exceeded. If performance goals are not met, PSUs will not vest, but the recognized compensation cost associated with the stock award would not be reversed. For PSUs, the performance conditions are based on the Company s total shareholder return weighting), compared to an industry peer group of companies, and the EBITDA divided by Average Capital Employed (ACE) metric weighting) for PSU awards, over the performance period. During the performance period, PSUs are subject to transfer restrictions and are subject to forfeiture if a grantee terminates for reasons other than retirement, disability or death. Termination for these three reasons will lead to a pro rata award of amounts earned. No dividends are paid nor do voting rights exist on awards of PSUs prior to their settlement.

 The fair value of the equity-settled performance-based awards granted in each year was estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Expected volatility was based on daily historical volatility of the Company s stock price compared to a peer group average over a three-year period. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield curve of three-year U.S. Treasury bonds and the stock beta was calculated using three years of historical averages of daily stock data for Murphy and the peer group.

 The fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model based on the assumptions noted in the following table. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company s stock and implied volatility on publicly traded at-the-money options on the Company s stock. The Company estimates the expected term of the options granted based on historical option exercise patterns and considers certain groups of employees exhibiting different behavior. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

 The total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2022 was million. Intrinsic value is the excess of the market price of stock at date of exercise over the exercise price received by the Company upon exercise. Aggregate intrinsic value is nil when the exercise price of the stock option exceeds the market price of the Company s common stock. 
 Cash-Settled Awards 
 The Company has granted phantom stock-based incentive awards to be settled in cash to certain employees in the form of SARs, Performance-based restricted stock units (CPSUs), CRSUs and Phantom units. 
 SAR awards have terms similar to stock options. CPSU terms are similar to other performance-based restricted stock awards. CRSUs generally settle on the third anniversary of the date of grant. Phantom units generally settle three to from date of grant. Each award granted is settled, net of applicable income tax withholdings, in cash rather than with common shares. Total pre-tax expense recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all cash-settled stock-based awards was million in 2022, million in 2021 and million in 2020. 
 The Committee also administers the Company s incentive compensation plans, which provide for annual or periodic cash awards to officers, directors and certain other employees. These cash awards are generally determinable based on the Company achieving specific financial and/or operational objectives. Compensation expense of million, million and million was recorded in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, for these plans.

 Rate of compensation increase Cash balance interest credit rate Expected return on plan assets 
 The discount rates used for determining the plan obligations and expense are based on high-quality corporate bonds that are available within each country. Cash flow analyses are performed in which a spot yield curve is used to discount projected benefit payment streams for the most significant plans. The discounted cash flows are used to determine an equivalent single rate which is the basis for selecting the discount rate within each country. Expected plan asset returns are based on long-term expectations for asset portfolios with similar investment mix characteristics. Expected compensation increases are based on anticipated future averages for the Company. The plan s cash balance interest accumulation rate is the greater of the annual yield on 10-year treasury constant maturities or .

 Commodity Price Risks 
 During 2022, the Company had crude oil swaps and collar contracts. Under the swaps contracts, which matured monthly, the Company paid the average monthly price in effect and received the fixed contract price on a notional amount of sales volume, thereby fixing the price for the commodity sold. Under the collar contracts, which also matured monthly, the Company purchased a put option and sold a call option with no net premiums paid to or received from counterparties. Upon maturity, collar contracts required payments by the Company if the NYMEX average closing price is above the ceiling price or payments to the Company if the NYMEX average closing price is below the floor price. 
 At December 31, 2022, the Company does t have any outstanding crude oil derivative contracts. At December 31, 2021, the Company had barrels per day in NYMEX West Texas Intermediate (WTI) swap contracts at a price per barrel of and barrels per day in NYMEX WTI collar contracts with an average ceiling price per barrel of and an average floor price per barrel of , both maturing ratably during 2022.

 Credit Risks 
 The Company s primary credit risks are associated with trade accounts receivable, cash equivalents and derivative instruments. Trade receivables arise mainly from sales of oil and natural gas in the U.S. and Canada, and cost sharing amounts of operating and capital costs billed to partners for properties operated by Murphy. The credit history and financial condition of potential customers are reviewed before credit is extended, security is obtained when deemed appropriate based on a potential customer s financial condition, and routine follow-up evaluations are made. The combination of these evaluations and the large number of customers tends to limit the risk to any one customer. Cash balances and cash equivalents are held with several major financial institutions, which limit the Company s exposure to credit risk for its cash assets. The Company controls credit risk on derivatives through credit approvals and monitoring procedures and believes that such risks are minimal because counterparties to the majority of transactions are major financial institutions. 

Dilutive stock options and restricted stock units Diluted method

Liabilities: Nonqualified employee savings plan Commodity collars Contingent consideration Commodity swaps 
 The nonqualified employee savings plan is an unfunded savings plan through which participants seek a return via phantom investments in equity securities and/or mutual funds. The fair value of this liability was based on quoted prices for these equity securities and mutual funds. The income effect of changes in the fair value of the nonqualified employee savings plan is recorded in Selling and general expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 As of December 31, 2022, there were no outstanding commodity (WTI crude oil) swaps and collars contracts subject to fair value measurement. The liabilities associated with these contracts have been finalized as of December 31, 2022 and were based on realized WTI pricing. The commodity swaps and collars liability as of December 31, 2022 was million and million, respectively, and recorded as Accounts payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of the commodity (WTI crude oil) swaps in 2021 was based on active market quotes for WTI crude oil. The fair value of commodity (WTI crude oil) collars in 2021 was determined using an option pricing model based on inputs that include (i) the contracted notional volumes, (ii) independent active market price quotes, (iii) the applicable estimated risk-free rate yield curve and (iv) the implied rate of volatility inherent in the collar contract. The before tax income effect of changes in fair value of crude oil derivative contracts is recorded in (Loss) Gain on derivative instruments in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 In 2019, the Company acquired strategic deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets from LLOG Exploration Offshore L.L.C. and LLOG Bluewater Holdings, L.L.C., (LLOG). Under the terms of the transaction, in addition to the consideration paid, Murphy has an obligation to pay additional contingent consideration of up to million in the event that certain revenue thresholds are exceeded between 2019 and 2022; and million following first oil from certain development projects. The revenue threshold was not exceeded for 2019 or 2020; however, the threshold was met in 2021 and 2022. 
 In 2018, the Company, through a subsidiary, acquired Gulf of Mexico producing assets from Petrobras America Inc. (PAI), a subsidiary of Petr leo Brasileiro S.A. Under the terms of the transaction, in addition to the consideration paid, Murphy has an obligation to pay additional contingent consideration of up to million if certain price and production thresholds are exceeded beginning in 2019 through 2025; and million carry for PAI development costs in the St. Malo Field if certain enhanced oil recovery projects are undertaken. The price and production thresholds were not exceeded for 2019 and 2020; however, the thresholds were met in 2021 and 2022. As of December 31, 2021, Murphy had completely funded the carried interest. 
 As at December 31, 2022, the Company s liabilities with PAI and LLOG were based on realized inputs of volumes and pricing as a result of contractual thresholds and time durations being achieved. As a result, the related liability as at December 31, 2022, of million, is no longer subject to fair value measurement. The liability is included in Other accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the changes in fair value of the contingent consideration during 2022 were recorded in Other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For 2021 the Company s contingent consideration liabilities with PAI and LLOG were measured at fair value on a recurring basis and were categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as at

 There continues to be an increase in regulatory oversight of the oil and gas industry at the federal level, with a focus on climate change and GHG emissions (including methane emissions). For example, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 contains provisions that impose fees for excess methane emissions from petroleum and natural gas facilities. In addition, there have been a number of executive orders issued that address climate change, including creation of climate-related task forces, directives to federal agencies to procure carbon-free electricity, and a goal of a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035 and a net-zero emissions U.S. economy by 2050. Executive orders have also been issued related to oil and gas activities on federal lands, infrastructure and environmental justice. In addition, an international climate agreement (the Paris Agreement) was agreed to at the 2015 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The Paris Agreement entered into force in November 2016. Although the U.S. officially withdrew from the Paris Agreement on November 4, 2020, the U.S. has since rejoined the Paris Agreement, which became effective for the U.S. on February 19, 2021.

 per barrel for NYMEX crude oil (WTI) and per MCF for natural gas (Henry Hub). The average prices used for 2021 were per barrel for NYMEX crude oil (WTI) and per MCF for natural gas (Henry Hub). The average prices used for 2020 were per barrel for NYMEX crude oil (WTI) and per MCF for natural gas (Henry Hub). Reported quantities are subject to future revisions, some of which may be substantial, as additional information becomes available from reservoir performance, new geological and geophysical data, additional drilling, technological advancements, price changes and other economic factors. 
 Murphy s estimations for proved reserves were generated through the integration of available geoscience, engineering, and economic data (including hydrocarbon prices, operating costs, and development costs) and commercially available technologies to establish reasonable certainty of economic producibility. Estimates are presented in millions of barrels of oil equivalents and dollars and billions of cubic feet with one decimal; totals within the tables may not add as a result of rounding. As defined by the SEC, reasonable certainty of proved reserves describes a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered. In estimating proved reserves, Murphy uses common industry-accepted methods for subsurface evaluations, including performance, volumetric and analog-based studies. Where appropriate, Murphy includes reliable geologic and engineering technology to estimate proved reserves. Reliable geologic and engineering technology is a method or combination of methods that are field tested and have been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. This integrated approach increases the quality of and confidence in Murphy s proved reserves estimates. The approach was utilized in certain undrilled acreage at distances greater than the directly offsetting development spacing areas and in certain reservoirs developed with the application of improved recovery techniques. Murphy utilized a combination of 3D seismic interpretation, core analysis, wellbore log measurements, well test data, historic production and pressure data and commercially available seismic processing and numerical reservoir simulation programs. Reservoir parameters from analogous reservoirs were used to strengthen the reserves estimates when available. 
 Production quantities shown are net volumes withdrawn from reservoirs. These may differ from sales quantities due to inventory changes, volumes consumed for fuel and/or shrinkage from the extraction of natural gas liquids. 
 All crude oil, natural gas liquid reserves and natural gas reserves are from consolidated subsidiaries (including noncontrolling interest) and proportionately consolidated joint ventures. The Company has proved reserves attributable to investees accounted for by the equity method. 
 SCHEDULE 7 STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS RELATING TO PROVED OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES 
 GAAP requires calculation of future net cash flows using a annual discount factor, an unweighted average of oil and natural gas prices in effect at the beginning of each month of the year, and year-end costs and statutory tax rates, except for known future changes such as contracted prices and legislated tax rates. 
 The reported value of proved reserves is not necessarily indicative of either fair market value or present value of future cash flows because prices, costs and governmental policies do not remain static; appropriate discount rates may vary; and extensive judgment is required to estimate the timing of production. Other logical assumptions would likely have resulted in significantly different amounts.

 (d) Participations . By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (other than a Mexico Letter of Credit), and by an amendment to a Letter of Credit (other than a Mexico Letter of Credit) increasing the amount or extending the term thereof, and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank that issues such Letter of Credit or the Lenders, such Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Revolving Lender, and each Revolving Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Revolving Lender s Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of each Issuing Bank that issues a Letter of Credit hereunder (other than the Mexico Issuing Bank), such Revolving Lender s Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the applicable Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section 2.05, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Company for any reason. Each Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit (other than Mexico Letters of Credit) is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit in accordance with this Agreement or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.

 C REDIT A GREEMENT 

of Credit is denominated (except as specified below), an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 12 00 noon, New York City time, on the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if the Company shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 10 00 a.m., New York City time, on such date, or, if such notice has not been received by the Company prior to such time on such date, then not later than 12 00 noon, New York City time, on the Business Day immediately following the day that the Company receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt provided that, in the case of an LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit (other than a Mexico Letter of Credit), the Company may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 that such payment be financed with an ABR Revolving Borrowing in an equivalent amount (with respect to Letters of Credit denominated in dollars) or in the Dollar Equivalent on such date (as determined by the applicable Issuing Bank) of the amount of the LC Disbursement (with respect to Letters of Credit denominated in any Designated Currency), as applicable, and to the extent so financed, the applicable Borrower s obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Issuing Bank may, at its option, specify in the applicable notice of LC Disbursement that such Issuing Bank will require reimbursements in dollars, in which case the applicable Borrower agrees to reimburse such Issuing Bank in dollars provided that the applicable Issuing Bank shall notify the Company of the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of the drawing promptly following the determination thereof. If the applicable Borrower fails to make such payment when due (for the avoidance of doubt, other than a payment to reimburse an LC Disbursement in respect of a Mexico Letter of Credit issued by the Mexico Issuing Bank), the Administrative Agent shall notify each Revolving Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement (and the Dollar Equivalent thereof), the payment then due from the applicable Borrower (and the Dollar Equivalent thereof) in respect thereof and such Revolving Lender s Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Revolving Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent in dollars its Applicable Percentage of the Dollar Equivalent of the payment then due from the applicable Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Revolving Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank that issued such Letter of Credit the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the applicable Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing Bank that issued such Letter of Credit or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and such Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse an Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the applicable Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement. 
 (f) Obligations Absolute . The applicable Borrower s obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section 2.05 shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii)

Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor any Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of any Issuing Bank provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse any Issuing Bank from liability to the applicable Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrowers to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by a Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Bank s failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of an Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit. 
 (g) Disbursement Procedures . An Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank. Such Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Company by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the applicable Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement. 
 (h) Interim Interest . If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the applicable Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the reimbursement is due and payable at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Loans (or in the case such LC Disbursement is denominated in any Designated Currency, a rate per annum determined by such Issuing Bank (which determination will be conclusive absent manifest error) to represent its cost of funds plus the Applicable Rate at such time used to determine interest applicable to Term 

54 
 C REDIT A GREEMENT 

Benchmark Loans) and such interest shall be due and payable on the date when such reimbursement is payable provided that, if the applicable Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section 2.05, then Section 2.12(c) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant paragraph (e) of this Section 2.05 to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment. 
 (i) Replacement and Resignation of an Issuing Bank . 
 (i) Any Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Company, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of an Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Company shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.11(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (A) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (B) references herein to the term Issuing Bank shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit or extend or otherwise amend any existing Letter of Credit. 
 (ii) Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Issuing Bank, any Issuing Bank may resign as an Issuing Bank at any time upon 30 days prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, the Company and the Lenders, in which case, such resigning Issuing Bank shall be replaced in accordance with Section 2.05(i)(i). 
 (j) Cash Collateralization . If (i) any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Company receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposure and Mexico LC Exposure representing greater than 50 of the Global LC Exposure) demanding that the Borrowers cash collateralize the outstanding Global LC Exposure pursuant to this paragraph, (ii) any Borrower is required to cash collateralize the excess attributable to an LC Exposure or the Mexico LC Exposure in connection with any prepayment pursuant to Section 2.10(c) or cash collateralize outstanding Letters of Credit pursuant to Section 2.10(d), or (iii) any Borrower is required to cash collateralize a Defaulting Lender s LC Exposure pursuant to Section 2.19, then the applicable Borrower shall deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash (in the applicable currency) equal to such LC Exposure or the Mexico Exposure or the excess attributable to such LC Exposure, as the case may be, as of such date, in each case, plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon provided that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to any Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of Section 7.01. Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative 

55 
 C REDIT A GREEMENT 

Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the applicable Borrower s risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse each Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the applicable Borrower for the Global LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders with LC Exposure and Mexico LC Exposure representing greater than 50 of the Global LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other obligations of the applicable Borrower under this Agreement. If the applicable Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default or pursuant to Section 2.19 as the result of a Defaulting Lender, and the Borrowers are not otherwise required to pay to the Administrative Agent the excess attributable to an LC Exposure or the Mexico LC Exposure in connection with any prepayment pursuant to Section 2.10(c), then such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the applicable Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived or the events giving rise to such cash collateralization pursuant to Section 2.19 have been satisfied or resolved. 
 (k) Letters of Credit Issued for Account of Subsidiaries . Notwithstanding that a Letter of Credit issued or outstanding hereunder supports any obligations of, or is for the account of, a Subsidiary, or states that a Subsidiary is the account party, applicant, customer, instructing party, or the like of or for such Letter of Credit, and without derogating from any rights of the applicable Issuing Bank (whether arising by contract, at law, in equity or otherwise) against such Subsidiary in respect of such Letter of Credit, the applicable Borrower (i) shall reimburse, indemnify and compensate the applicable Issuing Bank hereunder for such Letter of Credit (including to reimburse any and all drawings thereunder) as if such Letter of Credit had been issued solely for the account of the applicable Borrower and (ii) irrevocably waives any and all defenses that might otherwise be available to it as a guarantor or surety of any or all of the obligations of such Subsidiary in respect of such Letter of Credit. Each Borrower hereby acknowledges that the issuance of such Letters of Credit for its Subsidiaries inures to the benefit of such Borrower, and that such Borrower s business derives substantial benefits from the businesses of such Subsidiaries. 
 (l) Existing Letters of Credit . On the Effective Date, each of the letters of credit listed on Schedule 2.05 shall be deemed to have been issued as Letters of Credit under this Agreement by the Issuing Bank specified for such Letter of Credit on Schedule 2.05, without payment of any fees otherwise due upon the issuance of a Letter of Credit, and such Issuing Bank shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have sold to each Revolving Lender, and each Revolving Lender shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have purchased from such Issuing Bank, a participation, to the extent of such Revolving Lender s Applicable Percentage, in such Letter of Credit.

56 
 C REDIT A GREEMENT 

by 12 00 noon, New York City time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the applicable Borrower by promptly crediting the funds so received, in like funds, to an account of the applicable Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent in New York City and designated by the Company in the applicable Borrowing Request provided that ABR Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Issuing Bank.

 (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Sections 2.05(d) or (e) , 2.06(b) , 2.17(d) or 10.03(c) then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender s obligations to it under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and or (ii) hold such amounts in a segregated account over which the Administrative Agent shall have exclusive control as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under any such Section, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.

Each party hereto agrees that (A) an assignment required pursuant to this paragraph may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the assignee (or, to the extent applicable, an agreement incorporating an Assignment and Assumption by reference pursuant to an Approved Electronic Platform as to which the Administrative Agent and such parties are participants), and (B) the Lender required to make such assignment need not be a party thereto in order for such assignment to be effective and shall be deemed to have consented to and be bound by the terms thereof provided that, following the effectiveness of any such assignment, the other parties to such assignment agree to execute and deliver such documents necessary to evidence such assignment as reasonably requested by the applicable Lender provided that any such documents shall be without recourse to or warranty by the parties thereto.

Dear Mr. Wilson 
 
 At the request of Murphy Oil Corporation (Murphy), Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (Ryder Scott) has conducted a reserves audit of the estimates of the proved reserves as of December 31, 2022 prepared by Murphy s engineering and geological staff based on the definitions and disclosure guidelines of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) contained in Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting, Final Rule released January 14, 2009 in the Federal Register (SEC regulations). Our reserves audit, completed on January 7, 2022 and presented herein, was prepared for public disclosure by Murphy in filings made with the SEC in accordance with the disclosure requirements set forth in the SEC regulations. For the U.S. Onshore properties, the estimated reserves shown herein represent Murphy s estimated net reserves attributable to the leasehold interests in certain properties owned by Murphy and the portion of those reserves reviewed by Ryder Scott, as of December 31, 2022. For the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) properties, the estimated reserves shown herein exclude the net reserves attributable to Murphy s leasehold interests in the Murphy and Petrobras GOM JV (MPGOM). The net reserves attributable to the MPGOM assets are included in a separate Ryder Scott report dated January 27, 2023. The properties reviewed by Ryder Scott incorporate Murphy s reserves determinations and are located onshore in the state of Texas and Louisiana and in the federal waters offshore Louisiana. 
 
 The combined U.S. Onshore and GOM properties reviewed by Ryder Scott account for a portion of Murphy s total net proved reserves as of December 31, 2022. Based on the estimates of total net proved reserves prepared by Murphy, the reserves audit conducted by Ryder Scott in this report addresses 36.8 percent of the total proved net reserves of Murphy on a barrel of oil equivalent, BOE basis as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 As prescribed by the Society of Petroleum Engineers in Paragraph 2.2(f) of the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information (SPE auditing standards), a reserves audit is defined as the process of reviewing certain of the pertinent facts interpreted and assumptions made that have resulted in an estimate of reserves and or Reserves Information prepared by others and the rendering of an opinion about (1) the appropriateness of the methodologies employed (2) the adequacy and quality of the data relied upon (3) the depth and thoroughness of the reserves estimation process (4) the classification of reserves appropriate to the relevant definitions used and (5) the reasonableness of the estimated reserves quantities and or Reserves Information. Reserves Information may consist of various estimates pertaining to the extent and value of petroleum properties.

Based on our review, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Murphy, it is our opinion that the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by Murphy in preparing their estimates of the proved reserves as of December 31, 2022 comply with the current SEC regulations and that the overall proved reserves for the reviewed properties as estimated by Murphy are, in the aggregate and within each geographic area, reasonable within the established audit tolerance guidelines of 10 percent as set forth in the SPE auditing standards. 
 
 The estimated reserves presented in this report are related to hydrocarbon prices. Murphy has informed us that in the preparation of their reserves and income projections, as of December 31, 2022, they used average prices during the 12-month period prior to the as of date of this report, determined as the unweighted arithmetic averages of the prices in effect on the first-day-of-the-month for each month within such period, unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements, as required by the SEC regulations. Actual future prices may vary considerably from the prices required by SEC regulations. The reserves volumes and the income attributable thereto have a direct relationship to the hydrocarbon prices actually received therefore, volumes of reserves actually recovered and amounts of income actually received may differ significantly from the estimated quantities presented in this report. The net reserves as estimated by Murphy attributable to Murphy's interest and entitlement in properties that we reviewed are summarized by geographic area as follows.

Reserves Included in This Report 
 
 In our opinion, the proved reserves presented in this report conform to the definition as set forth in the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulations Part 210.4-10(a). An abridged version of the SEC reserves definitions from 210.4-10(a) entitled PETROLEUM RESERVES DEFINITIONS is included as an attachment to this report. 
 
 The various proved reserves status categories are defined in the attachment entitled PETROLEUM RESERVES STATUS DEFINITIONS AND GUIDELINES in this report. The proved developed non-producing reserves included herein consist of the shut-in and behind pipe status categories. 
 
 Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations. All reserves estimates involve an assessment of the uncertainty relating the likelihood that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the estimated quantities determined as of the date the estimate is made. The uncertainty depends primarily on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of these data. The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two principal categories, either proved or unproved. Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves and may be further sub-categorized as probable and possible reserves to denote progressively increasing uncertainty in their recoverability. At Murphy s request, this report addresses only the proved reserves attributable to the properties reviewed herein. 
 
 Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward. The proved reserves included herein were estimated using deterministic methods. The SEC has defined reasonable certainty for proved reserves, when based on deterministic methods, as a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered. 
 
 Proved reserves estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as economic conditions change. For proved reserves, the SEC states that as changes due to increased availability of geoscience (geological, geophysical, and geochemical), engineering, and economic data are made to the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) with time, reasonably certain EUR is much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease. Moreover, estimates of proved reserves may be revised as a result of future operations, effects of regulation by governmental agencies or geopolitical or economic risks. Therefore, the proved reserves included in this report are estimates only and should not be construed as being exact quantities. They may or may not be actually recovered.

Audit Data, Methodology, Procedure and Assumptions 
 
 The estimation of reserves involves two distinct determinations. The first determination results in the estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas and the second determination results in the estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulations Part 210.4-10(a). The process of estimating the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves relies on the use of certain generally accepted analytical procedures. These analytical procedures fall into three broad categories or methods (1) performance-based methods (2) volumetric-based methods and (3) analogy. These methods may be used individually or in combination by the reserves evaluator in the process of estimating the quantities of reserves. Reserves evaluators must select the method or combination of methods which in their professional judgment is most appropriate given the nature and amount of reliable geoscience and engineering data available at the time of the estimate, the established or anticipated performance characteristics of the reservoir being evaluated and the stage of development or producing maturity of the property. 
 
 In many cases, the analysis of the available geoscience and engineering data and the subsequent interpretation of this data may indicate a range of possible outcomes in an estimate, irrespective of the method selected by the evaluator. When a range in the quantity of reserves is identified, the evaluator must determine the uncertainty associated with the incremental quantities of the reserves. If the reserves quantities are estimated using the deterministic incremental approach, the uncertainty for each discrete incremental quantity of the reserves is addressed by the reserves category assigned by the evaluator. Therefore, it is the categorization of reserves quantities as proved, probable and or possible that addresses the inherent uncertainty in the estimated quantities reported. For proved reserves, uncertainty is defined by the SEC as reasonable certainty wherein the quantities actually recovered are much more likely to be achieved than not. The SEC states that probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. The SEC states that possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves and the total quantities ultimately recovered from a project have a low probability of exceeding proved plus probable plus possible reserves. All quantities of reserves within the same reserves category must meet the SEC definitions as noted above. 
 
 Estimates of reserves quantities and their associated reserves categories may be revised in the future as additional geoscience or engineering data become available. Furthermore, estimates of reserves quantities and their associated reserves categories may also be revised due to other factors such as changes in economic conditions, results of future operations, effects of regulation by governmental agencies or geopolitical or economic risks as previously noted herein. 
 
 The reserves prepared by Murphy for the properties that we reviewed were estimated by performance methods, the volumetric method, analogy, or a combination of methods. The proved producing reserves attributable to producing wells and or reservoirs that we reviewed were primarily estimated by performance methods or a combination of methods. These performance methods include, but may not be limited to, decline curve analysis, material balance and or reservoir simulation which utilized extrapolations of historical production and pressure data available through November 2022, in those cases where such data were considered to be definitive. The data utilized in this analysis were furnished to Ryder Scott by Murphy or obtained from public data sources and were considered sufficient for the purpose thereof. Certain proved producing reserves that we reviewed were estimated by the volumetric method, analogy, or a combination of methods. These methods were used where there were inadequate historical performance data to establish a definitive trend and where the use of production performance data as a basis for the reserves estimates was considered to be inappropriate.

Most of the proved developed non-producing and undeveloped reserves that we reviewed were estimated by performance methods, analogy, or a combination of methods. Certain proved non-developed and undeveloped reserves that we reviewed were estimated by the volumetric method or a combination of methods. The volumetric analysis utilized pertinent well and seismic data furnished to Ryder Scott by Murphy for our review or which we have obtained from public data sources that were available through November 2022. The data utilized from the analogues in conjunction with well and seismic data incorporated into the volumetric analysis were considered sufficient for the purpose thereof. 
 
 To estimate economically producible proved oil and gas reserves, many factors and assumptions are considered including, but not limited to, the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological, geophysical and engineering data which cannot be measured directly, economic criteria based on current costs and SEC pricing requirements, and forecasts of future production rates. Under the SEC regulations 210.4-10(a)(22)(v) and (26), proved reserves must be anticipated to be economically producible from a given date forward based on existing economic conditions including the prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. While it may reasonably be anticipated that the future prices received for the sale of production and the operating costs and other costs relating to such production may increase or decrease from those under existing economic conditions, such changes were, in accordance with rules adopted by the SEC, omitted from consideration in conducting this review. 
 
 As stated previously, proved reserves must be anticipated to be economically producible from a given date forward based on existing economic conditions including the prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. To confirm that the proved reserves reviewed by us meet the SEC requirements to be economically producible, we have reviewed certain primary economic data utilized by Murphy relating to hydrocarbon prices and costs as noted herein. 
 
 The hydrocarbon prices furnished by Murphy for the properties reviewed by us are based on SEC price parameters using the average prices during the 12-month period prior to the as of date of this report, determined as the unweighted arithmetic averages of the prices in effect on the first-day-of-the-month for each month within such period, unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements. For hydrocarbon products sold under contract, the contract prices, including fixed and determinable escalations exclusive of inflation adjustments, were used until expiration of the contract. Upon contract expiration, the prices were adjusted to the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average as previously described. 
 
 The initial SEC hydrocarbon benchmark prices in effect on December 31, 2022 for the properties reviewed by us were determined using the 12-month average first-day-of-the-month benchmark prices appropriate to the geographic area where the hydrocarbons are sold. These benchmark prices are prior to the adjustments for differentials as described herein. The table below summarizes the benchmark prices and price reference used by Murphy for the geographic areas reviewed by us. In certain geographic areas, the price reference and benchmark prices may be defined by contractual arrangements. 
 
 The product prices that were actually used by Murphy to determine the future gross revenue for each property reviewed by us reflect adjustments to the benchmark prices for gravity, quality, local conditions, gathering and transportation fees and or distance from market, referred to herein as differentials. The differentials used by Murphy were reviewed by us for their reasonableness using information furnished by Murphy for this purpose. 
 
 The table below summarizes Murphy s net volume weighted benchmark prices adjusted for differentials for the properties reviewed by us and referred to herein as Murphy s average realized prices. The average realized prices shown in the table below were determined from Murphy s estimate

of the total future gross revenue before production taxes for the properties reviewed by us and Murphy s estimate of the total net reserves for the properties reviewed by us for the geographic areas. At Murphy s request, also provided is the average realized gas price excluding fuel gas. The data shown in the table below is presented in accordance with SEC disclosure requirements for each of the geographic areas reviewed by us.

 Realized prices excluding fuel gas volumes, as previously noted. 

The effects of derivative instruments designated as price hedges of oil and gas quantities are not reflected in Murphy s individual property evaluations. 
 
 Accumulated gas production imbalances, if any, were not taken into account in the proved gas reserves estimates reviewed. 
 
 Operating costs furnished by Murphy are based on the operating expense reports of Murphy and include only those costs directly applicable to the leases or wells for the properties reviewed by us. The operating costs include a portion of general and administrative costs allocated directly to the leases and wells. For operated properties, the operating costs include an appropriate level of corporate general administrative and overhead costs. The operating costs for non-operated properties include the COPAS overhead costs that are allocated directly to the leases and wells under terms of operating agreements. The operating costs furnished by Murphy were reviewed by us for their reasonableness using information furnished by Murphy for this purpose information provided included historic operating expenses, pay out balances, and royalty relief information. No deduction was made for loan repayments, interest expenses, or exploration and development prepayments that were not charged directly to the leases or wells. 
 
 Development costs furnished by Murphy are based on authorizations for expenditure for the proposed work or actual costs for similar projects. The development costs furnished by Murphy were reviewed by us for their reasonableness using information furnished by Murphy for this purpose. The estimated net cost of abandonment after salvage was included by Murphy for properties where abandonment costs net of salvage were material. The abandonment costs furnished by Murphy were reviewed by us for their reasonableness using information furnished by Murphy for this purpose. 
 
 The proved developed non-producing and undeveloped reserves for the properties reviewed by us have been incorporated herein in accordance with Murphy s plans to develop these reserves as of December 31, 2022. The implementation of Murphy s development plans as presented to us is subject to the approval process adopted by Murphy s management. As the result of our inquiries during the course of our review, Murphy has informed us that the development activities for the properties 
 RYDER SCOTT COMPANY PETROLEUM CONSULTANTS 

Murphy Oil Corporation U.S. Onshore GOM 
 January 27, 2023 
 Page 7 

reviewed by us have been subjected to and received the internal approvals required by Murphy s management at the appropriate local, regional and or corporate level. In addition to the internal approvals as noted, certain development activities may still be subject to specific partner AFE processes, Joint Operating Agreement (JOA) requirements or other administrative approvals external to Murphy. Murphy has provided written documentation supporting their commitment to proceed with the development activities as presented to us . Additionally, Murphy has informed us that they are not aware of any legal, regulatory, or political obstacles that would significantly alter their plans. While these plans could change from those under existing economic conditions as of December 31, 2022, such changes were, in accordance with rules adopted by the SEC, omitted from consideration in making this evaluation. 
 
 Current costs used by Murphy were held constant throughout the life of the properties. 
 
 Murphy s forecasts of future production rates are based on historical performance from wells currently on production. If no production decline trend has been established, future production rates were held constant, or adjusted for the effects of curtailment where appropriate, until a decline in ability to produce was anticipated. An estimated rate of decline was then applied until depletion of the reserves. If a decline trend has been established, this trend was used as the basis for estimating future production rates. 
 
 Test data and other related information were used by Murphy to estimate the anticipated initial production rates for those wells or locations that are not currently producing. For reserves not yet on production, sales were estimated to commence at an anticipated date furnished by Murphy. Wells or locations that are not currently producing may start producing earlier or later than anticipated in Murphy s estimates due to unforeseen factors causing a change in the timing to initiate production. Such factors may include delays due to weather, the availability of rigs, the sequence of drilling, completing and or recompleting wells and or constraints set by regulatory bodies. 
 
 The future production rates from wells currently on production or wells or locations that are not currently producing may be more or less than estimated because of changes including, but not limited to, reservoir performance, operating conditions related to surface facilities, compression and artificial lift, pipeline capacity and or operating conditions, producing market demand and or allowables or other constraints set by regulatory bodies. 
 
 Murphy s operations may be subject to various levels of governmental controls and regulations. These controls and regulations may include, but may not be limited to, matters relating to land tenure and leasing, the legal rights to produce hydrocarbons including the granting, drilling and production practices, environmental protection, marketing and pricing policies, royalties, various taxes and levies including income tax, and foreign trade and investment and are subject to change from time to time. Such changes in governmental regulations and policies may cause volumes of proved reserves actually recovered and amounts of proved income actually received to differ significantly from the estimated quantities. 
 
 The estimates of proved reserves presented herein were based upon a review of the properties in which Murphy owns an interest however, we have not made any field examination of the properties. No consideration was given in this report to potential environmental liabilities that may exist nor were any costs included by Murphy for potential liabilities to restore and clean up damages, if any, caused by past operating practices. 
 
 Certain technical personnel of Murphy are responsible for the preparation of reserves estimates on new properties and for the preparation of revised estimates, when necessary, on old properties. These personnel assembled the necessary data and maintained the data and workpapers in an orderly 
 RYDER SCOTT COMPANY PETROLEUM CONSULTANTS 

Murphy Oil Corporation U.S. Onshore GOM 
 January 27, 2023 
 Page 8 

manner. We consulted with these technical personnel and had access to their workpapers and supporting data in the course of our audit. 
 
 Murphy has informed us that they have furnished us all of the material accounts, records, geological and engineering data, and reports and other data required for this investigation. In performing our audit of Murphy s forecast of future proved production, we have relied upon data furnished by Murphy with respect to property interests owned, production and well tests from examined wells, normal direct costs of operating the wells or leases, other costs such as transportation and or processing fees, ad valorem and production taxes, recompletion and development costs, development plans, abandonment costs after salvage, product prices based on the SEC regulations, adjustments or differentials to product prices, geological structural and isochore maps, well logs, core analyses, and pressure measurements. The data furnished by Murphy were reviewed by us for their reasonableness using information furnished by Murphy for this purpose. We consider the factual data furnished to us by Murphy to be appropriate and sufficient for the purpose of our review of Murphy s estimates of reserves. In summary, we consider the assumptions, data, methods and analytical procedures used by Murphy and as reviewed by us appropriate for the purpose hereof, and we have used all such methods and procedures that we consider necessary and appropriate under the circumstances to render the conclusions set forth herein. 

Audit Opinion 
 
 Based on our review, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Murphy, it is our opinion that the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by Murphy in preparing their estimates of the proved reserves as of December 31, 2022 comply with the current SEC regulations and that the overall proved reserves for the reviewed properties as estimated by Murphy are, in the aggregate, reasonable within the established audit tolerance guidelines of 10 percent as set forth in the SPE auditing standards. Ryder Scott found the processes and controls used by Murphy in their estimation of proved reserves to be effective and, in the aggregate, we found no bias in the utilization and analysis of data in estimates for these properties. 
 
 We were in reasonable agreement with Murphy's estimates of proved reserves for the properties which we reviewed although in certain cases there was more than an acceptable variance between Murphy's estimates and our estimates due to a difference in interpretation of data or due to our having access to data which were not available to Murphy when its reserves estimates were prepared. However notwithstanding, it is our opinion that on an aggregate basis the data presented herein for the properties that we reviewed fairly reflects the estimated net reserves owned by Murphy.

PETROLEUM RESERVES DEFINITIONS 
 
 As Adapted From 
 RULE 4-10(a) of REGULATION S-X PART 210 
 UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) 

PREAMBLE 
 
 On January 14, 2009, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published the Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting Final Rule in the Federal Register of National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). The Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting Final Rule includes revisions and additions to the definition section in Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X, revisions and additions to the oil and gas reporting requirements in Regulation S-K, and amends and codifies Industry Guide 2 in Regulation S-K. The Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting Final Rule , including all references to Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K, shall be referred to herein collectively as the SEC regulations . The SEC regulations take effect for all filings made with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission as of December 31, 2009, or after January 1, 2010. Reference should be made to the full text under Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Regulation S-X Part 210, Rule 4-10(a) for the complete definitions (direct passages excerpted in part or wholly from the aforementioned SEC document are denoted in italics herein). 
 
 Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations. All reserve estimates involve an assessment of the uncertainty relating the likelihood that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the estimated quantities determined as of the date the estimate is made. The uncertainty depends chiefly on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of these data. The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two principal classifications, either proved or unproved. Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves and may be further sub-classified as probable and possible reserves to denote progressively increasing uncertainty in their recoverability. Under the SEC regulations as of December 31, 2009, or after January 1, 2010, a company may optionally disclose estimated quantities of probable or possible oil and gas reserves in documents publicly filed with the SEC. The SEC regulations continue to prohibit disclosure of estimates of oil and gas resources other than reserves and any estimated values of such resources in any document publicly filed with the SEC unless such information is required to be disclosed in the document by foreign or state law as noted in 229.1202 Instruction to Item 1202. 
 
 Reserves estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as economic conditions change. 
 
 Reserves may be attributed to either natural energy or improved recovery methods. Improved recovery methods include all methods for supplementing natural energy or altering natural forces in the reservoir to increase ultimate recovery. Examples of such methods are pressure maintenance, natural gas cycling, waterflooding, thermal methods, chemical flooding, and the use of miscible and immiscible displacement fluids. Other improved recovery methods may be developed in the future as petroleum technology continues to evolve. 
 
 Reserves may be attributed to either conventional or unconventional petroleum accumulations. Petroleum accumulations are considered as either conventional or unconventional based on the nature of their in-place characteristics, extraction method applied, or degree of processing prior to sale. 
 RYDER SCOTT COMPANY PETROLEUM CONSULTANTS 

PETROLEUM RESERVES DEFINITIONS 
 Page 2 

Examples of unconventional petroleum accumulations include coalbed or coalseam methane (CBM CSM), basin-centered gas, shale gas, gas hydrates, natural bitumen and oil shale deposits. These unconventional accumulations may require specialized extraction technology and or significant processing prior to sale. 
 
 Reserves do not include quantities of petroleum being held in inventory. 
 
 Because of the differences in uncertainty, caution should be exercised when aggregating quantities of petroleum from different reserves categories. 

RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS) 
 
 Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(26) defines reserves as follows 
 
 Reserves. Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations. In addition, there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist, the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering oil and gas or related substances to market, and all permits and financing required to implement the project. 
 
 Note to paragraph (a)(26) Reserves should not be assigned to adjacent reservoirs isolated by major, potentially sealing, faults until those reservoirs are penetrated and evaluated as economically producible. Reserves should not be assigned to areas that are clearly separated from a known accumulation by a non-productive reservoir i.e. , absence of reservoir, structurally low reservoir, or negative test results). Such areas may contain prospective resources i.e. , potentially recoverable resources from undiscovered accumulations). 
 
 PROVED RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS) 
 
 Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(22) defines proved oil and gas reserves as follows 
 
 Proved oil and gas reserves. Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time. 
 
 (i) The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes 
 
 (A) The area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and 
 
 (B) Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data. 
 RYDER SCOTT COMPANY PETROLEUM CONSULTANTS 

PETROLEUM RESERVES DEFINITIONS 
 Page 3 

(ii) In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty. 
 
 (iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty. 
 
 (iv) Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when 
 
 (A) Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation of an installed program in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based and 
 
 (B) The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities. 
 
 (v) Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.

Reserves status categories define the development and producing status of wells and reservoirs. Reference should be made to Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Regulation S-X Part 210, Rule 4-10(a) and the SPE-PRMS as the following reserves status definitions are based on excerpts from the original documents (direct passages excerpted from the aforementioned SEC and SPE-PRMS documents are denoted in italics herein). 

DEVELOPED RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS) 
 
 Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(6) defines developed oil and gas reserves as follows 
 
 Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered 
 
 (i) Through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well and 
 
 (ii) Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well. 
 
 Developed Producing (SPE-PRMS Definitions) 
 
 While not a requirement for disclosure under the SEC regulations, developed oil and gas reserves may be further sub-classified according to the guidance contained in the SPE-PRMS as Producing or Non-Producing. 
 
 Developed Producing Reserves 
 Developed Producing Reserves are expected quantities to be recovered from completion intervals that are open and producing at the effective date of the estimate. 
 
 RYDER SCOTT COMPANY PETROLEUM CONSULTANTS 

PETROLEUM RESERVES STATUS DEFINITIONS AND GUIDELINES 
 Page 2 

Improved recovery reserves are considered producing only after the improved recovery project is in operation. 
 
 Developed Non-Producing 
 Developed Non-Producing Reserves include shut-in and behind-pipe Reserves. 
 
 Shut-In 
 Shut-in Reserves are expected to be recovered from 
 (1) completion intervals that are open at the time of the estimate but which have not yet started producing 
 (2) wells which were shut-in for market conditions or pipeline connections or 
 (3) wells not capable of production for mechanical reasons. 
 
 Behind-Pipe 
 Behind-pipe Reserves are expected to be recovered from zones in existing wells that will require additional completion work or future re-completion before start of production with minor cost to access these reserves. 
 
 In all cases, production can be initiated or restored with relatively low expenditure compared to the cost of drilling a new well. 

UNDEVELOPED RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS) 
 
 Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(31) defines undeveloped oil and gas reserves as follows 
 
 Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. 
 
 (i) Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances. 
 
 (ii) Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances, justify a longer time. 
 
 (iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.

Dear Mr. Wilson 
 
 At the request of Murphy Oil Corporation (Murphy), Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (Ryder Scott) has conducted a reserves audit of the estimates of the proved reserves as of December 31, 2022 prepared by Murphy s engineering and geological staff based on the definitions and disclosure guidelines of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) contained in Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting, Final Rule released January 14, 2009 in the Federal Register (SEC regulations). Our reserves audit, completed on January 13, 2023 and presented herein, was prepared for public disclosure by Murphy in filings made with the SEC in accordance with the disclosure requirements set forth in the SEC regulations. For the Gulf of Mexico properties, the estimated reserves shown herein represent the Murphy and Petrobras GOM JV (MPGOM) estimated net reserves attributable to Murphy s leasehold interests in certain properties owned by MPGOM. Murphy s net reserves attributable to Murphy s interests in non-MPGOM Gulf of Mexico and onshore U.S. properties are included in a separate report dated January 27, 2023. The properties reviewed by Ryder Scott incorporate Murphy s reserves determinations and are located in federal waters offshore Louisiana and Alabama . 
 
 The properties reviewed by Ryder Scott account for a portion of Murphy s total net proved reserves as of December 31, 2022. Based on the estimates of total net proved reserves prepared by Murphy, the reserves audit conducted by Ryder Scott in this report addresses 13.1 percent of the total proved net reserves of Murphy on a barrel of oil equivalent, BOE basis as of December 31, 2022. At your request, this report also presents the net reserves attributable to the 100 interests of the MPGOM, which includes the non-controlling interest of Petrobras. 
 
 As prescribed by the Society of Petroleum Engineers in Paragraph 2.2(f) of the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information (SPE auditing standards), a reserves audit is defined as the process of reviewing certain of the pertinent facts interpreted and assumptions made that have resulted in an estimate of reserves and or Reserves Information prepared by others and the rendering of an opinion about (1) the appropriateness of the methodologies employed (2) the adequacy and quality of the data relied upon (3) the depth and thoroughness of the reserves estimation process (4) the classification of reserves appropriate to the relevant definitions used and (5) the reasonableness of the estimated reserves quantities and or Reserves Information. Reserves Information may consist of various estimates pertaining to the extent and value of petroleum properties. 
 
 Based on our review, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Murphy, it is our opinion that the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by Murphy in preparing their estimates of the proved reserves as of December 31, 2022 comply with the current SEC regulations

and that the overall proved reserves for the reviewed properties as estimated by Murphy are reasonable within the established audit tolerance guidelines of 10 percent as set forth in the SPE auditing standards. 
 
 The estimated reserves presented in this report are related to hydrocarbon prices. Murphy has informed us that in the preparation of their reserves and income projections, as of December 31, 2022, they used average prices during the 12-month period prior to the as of date of this report, determined as the unweighted arithmetic averages of the prices in effect on the first-day-of-the-month for each month within such period, unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements, as required by the SEC regulations. Actual future prices may vary considerably from the prices required by SEC regulations. The reserves volumes and the income attributable thereto have a direct relationship to the hydrocarbon prices actually received therefore, volumes of reserves actually recovered and amounts of income actually received may differ significantly from the estimated quantities presented in this report. The net reserves as estimated by Murphy attributable to Murphy's interest and entitlement in properties that we reviewed are summarized as follows. The net reserves below represent 100 percent of the Murphy and Petrobras GOM JV (MPGOM) and include the non-controlling interest (NCI) of Petrobras

Reserves Included in This Report 
 
 In our opinion, the proved reserves presented in this report conform to the definition as set forth in the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulations Part 210.4-10(a). An abridged version of the SEC reserves definitions from 210.4-10(a) entitled PETROLEUM RESERVES DEFINITIONS is included as an attachment to this report. 
 
 The various proved reserves status categories are defined in the attachment entitled PETROLEUM RESERVES STATUS DEFINITIONS AND GUIDELINES in this report. The proved developed non-producing reserves included herein consist of the behind pipe status category. 
 
 Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations. All reserves estimates involve an assessment of the uncertainty relating the likelihood that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the estimated quantities determined as of the date the estimate is made. The uncertainty depends primarily on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of these data. The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two principal categories, either proved or unproved. Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves and may be further sub-categorized as probable and possible reserves to denote progressively increasing uncertainty in their recoverability. At Murphy s request, this report addresses only the proved reserves attributable to the properties reviewed herein. 
 
 Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward. The proved reserves included herein were estimated using deterministic methods. The SEC has defined reasonable certainty for proved reserves, when based on deterministic methods, as a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered. 
 
 Proved reserves estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as economic conditions change. For proved reserves, the SEC states that as changes due to increased availability of geoscience (geological, geophysical, and geochemical), engineering, and economic data are made to the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) with time, reasonably certain EUR is much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease. Moreover, estimates of proved reserves may be revised as a result of future operations, effects of regulation by governmental agencies or geopolitical or economic risks. Therefore, the proved reserves included in this report are estimates only and should not be construed as being exact quantities. They may or may not be actually recovered. 

Audit Data, Methodology, Procedure and Assumptions 
 
 The estimation of reserves involves two distinct determinations. The first determination results in the estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas and the second determination results in the 
 RYDER SCOTT COMPANY PETROLEUM CONSULTANTS 

Murphy Oil Corporation (Petrobras GOM JV) 
 January 27, 2023 
 Page 4 

estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulations Part 210.4-10(a). The process of estimating the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves relies on the use of certain generally accepted analytical procedures. These analytical procedures fall into three broad categories or methods (1) performance-based methods (2) volumetric-based methods and (3) analogy. These methods may be used individually or in combination by the reserves evaluator in the process of estimating the quantities of reserves. Reserves evaluators must select the method or combination of methods which in their professional judgment is most appropriate given the nature and amount of reliable geoscience and engineering data available at the time of the estimate, the established or anticipated performance characteristics of the reservoir being evaluated and the stage of development or producing maturity of the property. 
 
 In many cases, the analysis of the available geoscience and engineering data and the subsequent interpretation of this data may indicate a range of possible outcomes in an estimate, irrespective of the method selected by the evaluator. When a range in the quantity of reserves is identified, the evaluator must determine the uncertainty associated with the incremental quantities of the reserves. If the reserves quantities are estimated using the deterministic incremental approach, the uncertainty for each discrete incremental quantity of the reserves is addressed by the reserves category assigned by the evaluator. Therefore, it is the categorization of reserves quantities as proved, probable and or possible that addresses the inherent uncertainty in the estimated quantities reported. For proved reserves, uncertainty is defined by the SEC as reasonable certainty wherein the quantities actually recovered are much more likely to be achieved than not. The SEC states that probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. The SEC states that possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves and the total quantities ultimately recovered from a project have a low probability of exceeding proved plus probable plus possible reserves. All quantities of reserves within the same reserves category must meet the SEC definitions as noted above. 
 
 Estimates of reserves quantities and their associated reserves categories may be revised in the future as additional geoscience or engineering data become available. Furthermore, estimates of reserves quantities and their associated reserves categories may also be revised due to other factors such as changes in economic conditions, results of future operations, effects of regulation by governmental agencies or geopolitical or economic risks as previously noted herein. 
 
 The reserves, prepared by Murphy, for the properties that we reviewed were estimated by performance methods or the volumetric method. The proved producing reserves attributable to producing wells and or reservoirs that we reviewed were primarily estimated by performance methods. These performance methods include, but may not be limited to, decline curve analysis, material balance and or reservoir simulation which utilized extrapolations of historical production and pressure data available through November 2022, in those cases where such data were considered to be definitive. The data utilized in this analysis were furnished to Ryder Scott by Murphy or obtained from public data sources and were considered sufficient for the purpose thereof. Certain proved producing reserves that we reviewed were estimated by the volumetric method. This method was used where there were inadequate historical performance data to establish a definitive trend and where the use of production performance data as a basis for the reserves estimates was considered to be inappropriate. 
 
 Most of the proved developed non-producing and undeveloped reserves that we reviewed were estimated by the volumetric method. The volumetric analysis utilized pertinent well and seismic data furnished to Ryder Scott by Murphy for our review or which we have obtained from public data sources that were available through November 2022. Certain proved non-developed and undeveloped reserves that we reviewed were estimated by performance methods.

To estimate economically producible proved oil and gas reserves, many factors and assumptions are considered including, but not limited to, the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological, geophysical and engineering data which cannot be measured directly, economic criteria based on current costs and SEC pricing requirements, and forecasts of future production rates. Under the SEC regulations 210.4-10(a)(22)(v) and (26), proved reserves must be anticipated to be economically producible from a given date forward based on existing economic conditions including the prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. While it may reasonably be anticipated that the future prices received for the sale of production and the operating costs and other costs relating to such production may increase or decrease from those under existing economic conditions, such changes were, in accordance with rules adopted by the SEC, omitted from consideration in conducting this review. 
 
 As stated previously, proved reserves must be anticipated to be economically producible from a given date forward based on existing economic conditions including the prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. To confirm that the proved reserves reviewed by us meet the SEC requirements to be economically producible, we have reviewed certain primary economic data utilized by Murphy relating to hydrocarbon prices and costs as noted herein. 
 
 The hydrocarbon prices furnished by Murphy for the properties reviewed by us are based on SEC price parameters using the average prices during the 12-month period prior to the as of date of this report, determined as the unweighted arithmetic averages of the prices in effect on the first-day-of-the-month for each month within such period, unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements. For hydrocarbon products sold under contract, the contract prices, including fixed and determinable escalations exclusive of inflation adjustments, were used until expiration of the contract. Upon contract expiration, the prices were adjusted to the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average as previously described. 
 
 The initial SEC hydrocarbon benchmark prices in effect on December 31, 2022 for the properties reviewed by us were determined using the 12-month average first-day-of-the-month benchmark prices appropriate to the geographic area where the hydrocarbons are sold. These benchmark prices are prior to the adjustments for differentials as described herein. The table below summarizes the benchmark prices and price reference used by Murphy for the geographic area reviewed by us. For certain properties, the price reference and benchmark prices may be defined by contractual arrangements. 
 
 The product prices that were actually used by Murphy to determine the future gross revenue for each property reviewed by us reflect adjustments to the benchmark prices for gravity, quality, local conditions, gathering and transportation fees and or distance from market, referred to herein as differentials. The differentials used by Murphy were reviewed by us for their reasonableness using information furnished by Murphy for this purpose. 
 
 The table below summarizes Murphy s net volume weighted benchmark prices adjusted for differentials for the properties reviewed by us and referred to herein as Murphy s average realized prices. The average realized prices shown in the table below were determined from Murphy s estimate of the total future gross revenue before production taxes for the properties reviewed by us and Murphy s estimate of the total net reserves for the properties reviewed by us for the geographic area. At Murphy s request, also provided is the average realized gas price excluding fuel gas. The data shown in the table below is presented in accordance with SEC disclosure requirements for the geographic area reviewed by us.

The effects of derivative instruments designated as price hedges of oil and gas quantities are not reflected in Murphy s individual property evaluations. 
 
 Accumulated gas production imbalances, if any, were not taken into account in the proved gas reserves estimates reviewed. 
 
 Operating costs furnished by Murphy are based on the operating expense reports of Murphy and include only those costs directly applicable to the leases or wells for the properties reviewed by us. The operating costs include a portion of general and administrative costs allocated directly to the leases and wells. For operated properties, the operating costs include an appropriate level of corporate general administrative and overhead costs. The operating costs for non-operated properties include the COPAS overhead costs that are allocated directly to the leases and wells under terms of operating agreements . The operating costs furnished by Murphy were reviewed by us for their reasonableness using information furnished by Murphy for this purpose information provided included historic operating expenses, pay out balances, and royalty relief information. No deduction was made for loan repayments, interest expenses, or exploration and development prepayments that were not charged directly to the leases or wells. 
 
 Development costs furnished by Murphy are based on authorizations for expenditure for the proposed work or actual costs for similar projects. The development costs furnished by Murphy were reviewed by us for their reasonableness using information furnished by Murphy for this purpose. The estimated net cost of abandonment after salvage was included by Murphy for properties where abandonment costs net of salvage were material. The abandonment costs furnished by Murphy were reviewed by us for their reasonableness using information furnished by Murphy for this purpose. 
 
 The proved developed non-producing and undeveloped reserves for the properties reviewed by us have been incorporated herein in accordance with Murphy s plans to develop these reserves as of December 31, 2022. The implementation of Murphy s development plans as presented to us is subject to the approval process adopted by Murphy s management. As the result of our inquiries during the course of our review, Murphy has informed us that the development activities for the properties reviewed by us have been subjected to and received the internal approvals required by Murphy s management at the appropriate local, regional and or corporate level. In addition to the internal approvals as noted, certain development activities may still be subject to specific partner AFE processes, Joint Operating Agreement (JOA) requirements or other administrative approvals external to Murphy. Murphy has provided written documentation supporting their commitment to proceed with the development activities as presented to us . Additionally, Murphy has informed us that they are not aware of any legal, regulatory, or political obstacles that would significantly alter their plans. While these plans could change from those under existing economic conditions as of December 31, 2022, such changes were, in accordance with rules adopted by the SEC, omitted from consideration in making this evaluation.

Current costs used by Murphy were held constant throughout the life of the properties. 
 
 Murphy s forecasts of future production rates are based on historical performance from wells currently on production. If no production decline trend has been established, future production rates were held constant, or adjusted for the effects of curtailment where appropriate, until a decline in ability to produce was anticipated. An estimated rate of decline was then applied until depletion of the reserves. If a decline trend has been established, this trend was used as the basis for estimating future production rates. 
 
 Test data and other related information were used by Murphy to estimate the anticipated initial production rates for those wells or locations that are not currently producing. For reserves not yet on production, sales were estimated to commence at an anticipated date furnished by Murphy. Wells or locations that are not currently producing may start producing earlier or later than anticipated in Murphy s estimates due to unforeseen factors causing a change in the timing to initiate production. Such factors may include delays due to weather, the availability of rigs, the sequence of drilling, completing and or recompleting wells and or constraints set by regulatory bodies. 
 
 The future production rates from wells currently on production or wells or locations that are not currently producing may be more or less than estimated because of changes including, but not limited to, reservoir performance, operating conditions related to surface facilities, compression and artificial lift, pipeline capacity and or operating conditions, producing market demand and or allowables or other constraints set by regulatory bodies. 
 
 Murphy s operations may be subject to various levels of governmental controls and regulations. These controls and regulations may include, but may not be limited to, matters relating to land tenure and leasing, the legal rights to produce hydrocarbons, drilling and production practices, environmental protection, marketing and pricing policies, royalties, various taxes and levies including income tax and are subject to change from time to time. Such changes in governmental regulations and policies may cause volumes of proved reserves actually recovered and amounts of proved income actually received to differ significantly from the estimated quantities. 
 
 The estimates of proved reserves presented herein were based upon a review of the properties in which Murphy owns an interest however, we have not made any field examination of the properties. No consideration was given in this report to potential environmental liabilities that may exist nor were any costs included by Murphy for potential liabilities to restore and clean up damages, if any, caused by past operating practices. 
 
 Certain technical personnel of Murphy are responsible for the preparation of reserves estimates on new properties and for the preparation of revised estimates, when necessary, on old properties. These personnel assembled the necessary data and maintained the data and workpapers in an orderly manner. We consulted with these technical personnel and had access to their workpapers and supporting data in the course of our audit. 
 
 Murphy has informed us that they have furnished us all of the material accounts, records, geological and engineering data, and reports and other data required for this investigation. In performing our audit of Murphy s forecast of future proved production, we have relied upon data furnished by Murphy with respect to property interests owned, production and well tests from examined wells, normal direct costs of operating the wells or leases, other costs such as transportation and or processing fees, recompletion and development costs, development plans, abandonment costs after salvage, product prices based on the SEC regulations, adjustments or differentials to product prices, geological structural and isochore maps, well logs, core analyses, and pressure measurements. The data furnished by

Murphy were reviewed by us for their reasonableness using information furnished by Murphy for this purpose. We consider the factual data furnished to us by Murphy to be appropriate and sufficient for the purpose of our review of Murphy s estimates of reserves. In summary, we consider the assumptions, data, methods and analytical procedures used by Murphy and as reviewed by us appropriate for the purpose hereof, and we have used all such methods and procedures that we consider necessary and appropriate under the circumstances to render the conclusions set forth herein. 

Audit Opinion 
 
 Based on our review, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Murphy, it is our opinion that the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by Murphy in preparing their estimates of the proved reserves as of December 31, 2022 comply with the current SEC regulations and that the overall proved reserves for the reviewed properties as estimated by Murphy are, in the aggregate, reasonable within the established audit tolerance guidelines of 10 percent as set forth in the SPE auditing standards. Ryder Scott found the processes and controls used by Murphy in their estimation of proved reserves to be effective and, in the aggregate, we found no bias in the utilization and analysis of data in estimates for these properties. 
 
 We were in reasonable agreement with Murphy's estimates of proved reserves for the properties which we reviewed although in certain cases there was more than an acceptable variance between Murphy's estimates and our estimates due to a difference in interpretation of data or due to our having access to data which were not available to Murphy when its reserves estimates were prepared. However notwithstanding, it is our opinion that on an aggregate basis the data presented herein for the properties that we reviewed fairly reflects the estimated net reserves owned by Murphy in the Murphy and Petrobras GOM JV (MPGOM).

PETROLEUM RESERVES DEFINITIONS 
 
 As Adapted From 
 RULE 4-10(a) of REGULATION S-X PART 210 
 UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) 

PREAMBLE 
 
 On January 14, 2009, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published the Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting Final Rule in the Federal Register of National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). The Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting Final Rule includes revisions and additions to the definition section in Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X, revisions and additions to the oil and gas reporting requirements in Regulation S-K, and amends and codifies Industry Guide 2 in Regulation S-K. The Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting Final Rule , including all references to Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K, shall be referred to herein collectively as the SEC regulations . The SEC regulations take effect for all filings made with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission as of December 31, 2009, or after January 1, 2010. Reference should be made to the full text under Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Regulation S-X Part 210, Rule 4-10(a) for the complete definitions (direct passages excerpted in part or wholly from the aforementioned SEC document are denoted in italics herein). 
 
 Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations. All reserve estimates involve an assessment of the uncertainty relating the likelihood that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the estimated quantities determined as of the date the estimate is made. The uncertainty depends chiefly on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of these data. The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two principal classifications, either proved or unproved. Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves and may be further sub-classified as probable and possible reserves to denote progressively increasing uncertainty in their recoverability. Under the SEC regulations as of December 31, 2009, or after January 1, 2010, a company may optionally disclose estimated quantities of probable or possible oil and gas reserves in documents publicly filed with the SEC. The SEC regulations continue to prohibit disclosure of estimates of oil and gas resources other than reserves and any estimated values of such resources in any document publicly filed with the SEC unless such information is required to be disclosed in the document by foreign or state law as noted in 229.1202 Instruction to Item 1202. 
 
 Reserves estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as economic conditions change. 
 
 Reserves may be attributed to either natural energy or improved recovery methods. Improved recovery methods include all methods for supplementing natural energy or altering natural forces in the reservoir to increase ultimate recovery. Examples of such methods are pressure maintenance, natural gas cycling, waterflooding, thermal methods, chemical flooding, and the use of miscible and immiscible displacement fluids. Other improved recovery methods may be developed in the future as petroleum technology continues to evolve. 
 
 Reserves may be attributed to either conventional or unconventional petroleum accumulations. Petroleum accumulations are considered as either conventional or unconventional based on the nature of their in-place characteristics, extraction method applied, or degree of processing prior to sale. 
 RYDER SCOTT COMPANY PETROLEUM CONSULTANTS 

PETROLEUM RESERVES DEFINITIONS 
 Page 2 

Examples of unconventional petroleum accumulations include coalbed or coalseam methane (CBM CSM), basin-centered gas, shale gas, gas hydrates, natural bitumen and oil shale deposits. These unconventional accumulations may require specialized extraction technology and or significant processing prior to sale. 
 
 Reserves do not include quantities of petroleum being held in inventory. 
 
 Because of the differences in uncertainty, caution should be exercised when aggregating quantities of petroleum from different reserves categories. 

RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS) 
 
 Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(26) defines reserves as follows 
 
 Reserves. Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations. In addition, there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist, the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering oil and gas or related substances to market, and all permits and financing required to implement the project. 
 
 Note to paragraph (a)(26) Reserves should not be assigned to adjacent reservoirs isolated by major, potentially sealing, faults until those reservoirs are penetrated and evaluated as economically producible. Reserves should not be assigned to areas that are clearly separated from a known accumulation by a non-productive reservoir i.e. , absence of reservoir, structurally low reservoir, or negative test results). Such areas may contain prospective resources i.e. , potentially recoverable resources from undiscovered accumulations). 

PROVED RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS) 
 
 Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(22) defines proved oil and gas reserves as follows 
 
 Proved oil and gas reserves. Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time. 
 
 (i) The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes 
 
 (A) The area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and 
 
 (B) Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data.

 Page 3 

(ii) In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty. 
 
 (iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty. 
 
 (iv) Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when 
 
 (A) Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation of an installed program in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based and 
 
 (B) The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities. 
 
 (v) Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.

Reserves status categories define the development and producing status of wells and reservoirs. Reference should be made to Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Regulation S-X Part 210, Rule 4-10(a) and the SPE-PRMS as the following reserves status definitions are based on excerpts from the original documents (direct passages excerpted from the aforementioned SEC and SPE-PRMS documents are denoted in italics herein). 

DEVELOPED RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS) 
 
 Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(6) defines developed oil and gas reserves as follows 
 
 Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered 
 
 (i) Through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well and 
 
 (ii) Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well. 
 
 Developed Producing (SPE-PRMS Definitions) 
 
 While not a requirement for disclosure under the SEC regulations, developed oil and gas reserves may be further sub-classified according to the guidance contained in the SPE-PRMS as Producing or Non-Producing. 
 
 Developed Producing Reserves 
 Developed Producing Reserves are expected quantities to be recovered from completion intervals that are open and producing at the effective date of the estimate.

PETROLEUM RESERVES STATUS DEFINITIONS AND GUIDELINES 
 Page 2 

Improved recovery reserves are considered producing only after the improved recovery project is in operation. 
 
 Developed Non-Producing 
 Developed Non-Producing Reserves include shut-in and behind-pipe Reserves. 
 
 Shut-In 
 Shut-in Reserves are expected to be recovered from 
 (1) completion intervals that are open at the time of the estimate but which have not yet started producing 
 (2) wells which were shut-in for market conditions or pipeline connections or 
 (3) wells not capable of production for mechanical reasons. 
 
 Behind-Pipe 
 Behind-pipe Reserves are expected to be recovered from zones in existing wells that will require additional completion work or future re-completion before start of production with minor cost to access these reserves. 
 
 In all cases, production can be initiated or restored with relatively low expenditure compared to the cost of drilling a new well. 

UNDEVELOPED RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS) 
 
 Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(31) defines undeveloped oil and gas reserves as follows 
 
 Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. 
 
 (i) Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances. 
 
 (ii) Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances, justify a longer time. 
 
 (iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.

 Evaluation of the Canadian Oil and Gas Properties as of December 31, 2022 
 
 Dear Sir 
 Pursuant to your request, McDaniel & Associates Consultants Ltd. McDaniel has conducted an independent audit of Murphy Oil Corporation s Murphy proved crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves for Murphy s interests in the Kaybob Duvernay, Placid Montney and Greater Tupper Montney Projects located within the Province of British Columbia and Alberta, Canada and the Hibernia Main and Hibernia Southern Extension projects Hibernia located offshore within the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. Murphy holds a 99.75 percent working interest in the Greater Tupper Montney Project, a 70.07 percent working interest in the Kaybob Duvernay Project, a 26.93 percent working interest in the Placid Montney Project, a 6.5 percent working interest in the Hibernia Main Project, and a 4.3322 percent working interest in the Hibernia Southern Extension Project. Murphy has represented that these properties account for approximately 48.1 percent of its total company proved reserves on an equivalent barrel basis as of December 31, 2022, and that its reserves estimates have been prepared in accordance with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) definitions. We have reviewed information provided to us by Murphy that it represents to be its estimates of the reserves, as of December 31, 2022, for the same properties as those which we audited. The completion date of our report is January 31, 2023. This report was prepared in accordance with guidelines specified in Item 1202(a)(8) of Regulation S-K and is to be used for inclusion in certain filings of the SEC. 
 Reserves included herein are expressed as reserves as represented by Murphy. Gross reserves are defined as the total estimated petroleum to be produced from these properties after December 31, 2022. Working interest reserves are defined as that portion of the gross reserves attributable to the interests owned by Murphy after deducting all working interests owned by others. Net reserves are defined as working

interest reserves after the deduction of royalties. Estimates of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves should be regarded only as estimates that may change as further production history and additional information become available. Not only are such reserves estimates based on that information, which is currently available, but such estimates are also subject to the uncertainties inherent in the application of judgmental factors in interpreting such information. 
 
 Data used in this audit were obtained from reviews with Murphy personnel, Murphy files, from records on file with the appropriate regulatory agencies, and from public sources. In the preparation of this report we have relied upon such information furnished by Murphy with respect to property interests, production from such properties, current costs of operation and development, prices for production, agreements relating to current and future operations and sale of production, and various other information and data that were accepted as represented. Furthermore, if in the course of our examination something came to our attention, which brought into question the validity or sufficiency of any of such information or data, we did not rely on such information or data until we had satisfactorily resolved our questions relating thereto or had independently verified such information or data. A field examination of the properties was not considered necessary for the purposes of this report. 
 Methodology and Procedures 
 The process of estimating reserves requires complex judgments and decision-making based on available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. To estimate the economically recoverable oil, synthetic crude oil and natural gas reserves, and related future net cash flows, we consider many factors and make assumptions including 
 expected reservoir characteristics based on geological, geophysical and engineering assessments 
 future production rates based on historical performance and expected future operating and investment activities 
 future oil and gas prices and quality differentials 
 assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies and 
 future development and operating costs

Estimates of reserves were prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally accepted by the petroleum industry as presented in the publication of the Society of Petroleum Engineers entitled Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information (Revision as of June 2019). Generally accepted methods for estimating reserves include volumetric calculations, material balance techniques, production decline curves, pressure transient analysis, analogy with similar reservoirs, and reservoir simulation. The method or combination of methods used is based on professional judgment and experience. 
 Discovered oil and natural gas reserves are generally only produced when they are economically recoverable. As such, oil and gas prices, and capital and operating costs have an impact on whether reserves will ultimately be produced. As required by SEC rules, reserves represent the quantities that are expected to be economically recoverable using existing prices and costs. Estimates may change substantially as additional data from ongoing development activities and production performance becomes available and as economic conditions impacting oil and gas prices and costs change. 
 The proved reserves estimates in this report were based upon 2022 first-of-the month fiscal average pricing using benchmark pricing. Oil prices were based upon West Texas Intermediate at Cushing crude oil benchmark of USD 93.67 per barrel and a Brent crude oil benchmark of USD 101.24 per barrel. Specific pricing for each field was adjusted for historical quality and transportation cost differentials, and for currency exchange rates. For total proved reserves in the Kaybob Duvernay, Placid Montney and Greater Tupper Montney Project, the estimated realized prices were CAD 5.52 per Mcf of natural gas, CAD 115.28 per barrel of oil, and CAD 76.37 per barrel of natural gas liquids. For total proved reserves in the Hibernia Main and Hibernia South East Extension projects, the estimated realized price was CAD 133.66 per barrel of crude oil. 
 Generally, operations are subject to various levels of government controls and regulations. These laws and regulations may include matters relating to land tenure, drilling, production practices, environmental protection, marketing and pricing policies, royalties, various taxes and levies including income tax, and foreign trade and investment, that are subject to change from time to time. Current legislation is generally a matter of public record, and additional legislation or amendments that will affect reserves or when any such proposals, if enacted, might become effective generally cannot be predicted. Changes in government regulations could affect reserves or related economics. In the regions that are currently being evaluated we believe we have applied existing regulations appropriately. 
 
 Murphy Estimates 
 
 Murphy has represented that estimated proved reserves attributable to the audited properties are based on SEC definitions. These reserves are as follows, expressed in thousands of barrels (Mbbl) and thousands of barrels of oil equivalent (Mboe)

Note Gas is converted to oil equivalent using a factor of 6,000 cubic feet of gas per 1 barrel of oil equivalent based on an energy equivalent basis. Of the Total Proved Natural Gas reserves estimated by Murphy above, 4,732Mboe are attributed to fuel gas reserves in the Kaybob Duvernay, Placid Montney, Greater Tupper Montney Project, and 773 Mboe are attributed to fuel gas reserves in the Hibernia Business Unit. 
 
 Reserves Audit Opinion 
 
 McDaniel has used all data, assumptions, procedures and methods that it considers necessary to prepare this report. 
 In our opinion, the information relating to estimated proved reserves of bitumen and synthetic crude oil contained in this opinion has been prepared in accordance with Paragraphs 932-235-50-4, 932-235-50-6, 932-235-50-7, 932-235-50-9, 932-235-50-30 and 932-235-50-31 of the Accounting Standards Update 932-235-50, Extractive Industries Oil and Gas (Topic 932) Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures (January 2010) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board and Rules 4 10(a) (1) (32) of Regulation S X and Rules 302(b), 1201, and 1202(a) (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (8) of Regulation S-K of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 We have examined the assumptions, data, methods procedures and proved reserves estimates prepared by Murphy. In our opinion, the proved reserves for the reviewed properties as estimated by Murphy are, in aggregate on the basis of equivalent barrels, reasonable because when compared to our estimates, or if we were to perform our own detailed estimates, reflect a difference of not more than plus or minus 10 percent. 
 The analyses of these properties, as reported herein, was conducted within the context of an audit of a distinct group of properties in aggregate as part of the total corporate level reserves. Extraction and use of these analyses outside of this context may not be appropriate without supplementary due diligence.
