 The following table presents the changes in our portfolio for the last three years: 
 As of December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Properties Rooms Properties Rooms Properties Rooms Beginning balance 8,950 810,100 8,941 795,900 9,280 831,000 Additions

 ______________________ 
 (a) 2020 includes the deletion of 214 properties and approximately 18,500 rooms from the termination of non-compliant and brand detracting rooms, 20 properties and approximately 2,900 unprofitable rooms in connection with a guaranteed management contract and three properties and approximately 5,300 low-royalty rooms in connection with hotel sales by a strategic partner. 
 In addition to our current hotel portfolio, we have over 1,700 properties and approximately 219,000 rooms in our development pipeline throughout 60 countries including 13 where we do not currently have a presence. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 40 of our pipeline was located in the U.S. and 60 was located internationally; 80 of our pipeline was for new construction properties, of which 36 have broken ground and 20 represented conversion opportunities. 
 Our pipeline is typically only a subset of our development activity in any given period as some of our hotel additions are executed and opened in less than 90 days and therefore may never appear in our pipeline. However, we use the pipeline to gauge interest in our brands and our continued ability to drive our net room growth projections. 
 Our franchise sales team consists of nearly 150 professionals throughout the world. Our sales team is focused on growing our franchise business through conversions of existing branded and independent hotels and partnering with developers to brand newly constructed hotels. In addition to a regional presence in the United States, we currently have sales teams located in England, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, China, Singapore, Canada, India, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Columbia and Australia. Our international presence in key countries allows us to quickly adapt to changes in the increasingly dynamic global marketplace and to capitalize on new opportunities as they emerge. 
 In 2022, our sales team executed 882 contracts representing over 113,000 rooms. A key component of driving our net room growth is our ability to retain properties within our system. Our 2022 global retention rate was over 95 , which was a 20 basis point improvement from 2021. Our 2022 U.S. retention rate was also over 95 . 
 Our Guest Loyalty Program 
 Wyndham Rewards is our award-winning guest loyalty program that supports our portfolio of brands. The program generates significant repeat business by rewarding guests with points for each qualified stay at all of our active properties, which are then redeemable for free nights and other goods and services. Members can use points for stays at over 50,000 properties, including stays at thousands of hotels, vacation clubs and vacation rentals globally as well as merchandise, gift cards, airlines, charities, and tours and activities. Affiliation with our loyalty programs encourages members to allocate more of their travel spending to our hotels. 
 Wyndham Rewards has been recognized as one of the simplest, most rewarding loyalty programs in the hotel industry, providing more value to members than any other program. It has won more than 100 awards and accolades in recent years and was recently ranked #1 Best Hotel Loyalty Program in USA TODAY 10 Best Readers Choice Awards for the fifth time and as one of the best hotel rewards programs by US News World Report and WalletHub. 
 Wyndham Rewards has approximately 99 million enrolled members. Our members accounted for over 37 of check-ins at our affiliated hotels globally and over 48 in the United States. Total membership grew 6 in 2020 and 7 in both 2021 and 2022, with approximately 7 million new enrolled members added in 2022. Our franchisees benefit from the program through repeat stays and members benefit through free night stays, as well as other redemption options for their points, such as gift cards, merchandise and experiences. The program is funded by contributions from eligible revenues generated by Wyndham Rewards members and collected by us from hotels in our system. These funds are applied to reimburse hotels and partners for Wyndham Rewards points redemptions by loyalty members and to pay for administrative expenses and marketing initiatives that support the program.

 OUR FRANCHISING BUSINESS 
 Hotel Franchising Segment Adjusted EBITDA (a) in millions) 
 
 ______________________ 
 (a) See Part II Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for our definition of adjusted EBITDA and the reconciliation of net income/(loss) to adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA has been recasted to conform with the current year presentation for 2018 through 2020. 2020 adjusted EBITDA was impacted by COVID-19. 
 We license our brands and associated trademarks to over 6,000 franchisees globally, which provides for a highly diversified owner base with limited concentration. Our franchisees range from sole proprietors to institutional investors such as public real estate investment trusts. Our franchise agreements are typically 10 to 20 years in length, providing significant visibility into future cash flows. Under these agreements, our direct franchisees generally pay us a royalty fee of 4 to 5 of gross room revenue and a marketing and reservation fee of 3 to 5 of gross room revenue. We occasionally provide financial support in the form of loans or development advances to help generate new business.

 (a) See Part II Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for our definition of adjusted EBITDA and the reconciliation of net income/(loss) to adjusted EBITDA. 2020 adjusted EBITDA was impacted by COVID-19. 
 During 2022, we completed the sale of our two owned hotels and exited our select-service management business. As a result of these transactions, we decreased the number of our managed hotels by 158 during the year. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 72 full-service hotels under management contracts, located primarily in international markets such as Argentina, China and the Middle East. We manage full-service properties under our brands, primarily under the Wyndham, Wyndham Grand, Wyndham Garden, Dolce, Ramada, Dazzler and Esplendor brands in major markets and resort destinations globally. The duration of our management agreements is typically 10 to 20 years. We earn a base management fee, which is based on a percentage of the hotel s total revenue, and in some cases we earn an incentive fee, which is based on achieving performance metrics agreed upon with hotel owners. Under our management arrangements, we provide all the benefits of a franchising agreement and also conduct the day-to-day-operations of the hotel on behalf of the owner.

 Wellness: Our Be Well Program 
 We are committed to offering programs that focus on the total well-being of all our team members.

 We partnered with the American Hotel Lodging Association AHLA to support the 5-Star Promise, a voluntary commitment to enhance policies, trainings, and resources for hotel employees and guests. We are dedicated to our team members safety and security and we are proud to unite with our industry in support of a shared commitment to the incredible people who help make our guests travels memorable.

 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT 
 We are committed to operating sustainably in a way that provides outstanding experiences for those we serve through places to stay that are environmentally responsible. We engage team members, owners and operators around the world to uphold and leverage our core values to think globally and execute locally. 
 We developed the Wyndham Green Program, which was designed to show how hotels can reduce operating costs through efficiency, help drive revenue from environmentally conscious travelers, remain competitive in the market and increase brand loyalty. The Wyndham Green Program consists of two integral components: 1) the Wyndham Green Certification, our internal certification with best practices to address energy and water conservation, waste diversion, operational efficiency, as well as guest, team member and franchisee education and engagement, and 2) the Wyndham Green Toolbox, a proprietary environmental management tool that tracks, measures and reports environmental performance data to help hotels improve energy efficiency, reduce emissions, conserve water, and reduce waste thus minimizing environmental impact. 
 The UN Sustainable Development Goals serve as a strategic guide for our sustainability program, which helps advance our company s mission of making hotel travel possible for all. Our focus includes: 
 Embarking on a multi-decade journey to help our franchisees reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in alignment with efforts to limit the rise in global temperatures in part by providing tools and best practices through our Wyndham Green Program. 
 Promoting best practices around water conservation at these hotels through our Wyndham Green Program; supporting the access to clean water to all through our community partnerships; and reducing single-use plastics to keep our waterways and oceans pollution-free and safe for wildlife. 
 Sharing best practices around waste diversion through our Wyndham Green Program in order to reduce waste sent to landfills. 
 Promoting and expanding best practices for biodiversity protection across hotels in our system; partnering with suppliers to make a meaningful impact to protect forests and biodiversity. 
 We remain committed to helping our franchisees reduce the energy, water and carbon footprint of their hotels as we work towards achieving our 2025 environmental targets. We continuously evaluate opportunities to increase efficiencies and the usage of renewable energy where feasible as we update our decarbonization plans with longer term targets in alignment with climate science. 
 We continually monitor and prioritize climate-related risks based on the financial and strategic impacts on our business. Enterprise risks, including those related to sustainability, climate and energy, are identified and assessed on an ongoing basis. 
 We review climate-related risks using the Task Force for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures TFCD on an annual basis, which include both transition and physical risks. Some risks that we consider include: 
 Current and emerging regulations, like those pertaining to energy efficiency, energy consumption reporting and green building codes and standards at the local, state, and national levels, are considered as risks for our business. 
 Acute physical risks (extreme weather events), including hurricanes and wildfires, are increasing in frequency can impact travel demand in specific markets, supply chains and cause physical damage to our assets. 
 Chronic physical risks, such as include rising sea levels, rising mean temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns (including droughts) and extreme variability in weather patterns, can influence demand for travel and tourism in key markets adversely by decreasing revenue and/or causing property damage. 
 Our business model is asset-light, which dramatically limits our capital needs and exposure to the effects of climate change while providing us the ability to mitigate and transfer some of the risks associated with physical risks to third parties. Many factors influence our reputation and the value of our hotel brands including the perception held by our guests, our franchisees, our other key stakeholders and the communities in which we do business. The environmental information that we provide is used to inform their purchasing decisions and can directly impact our revenue associated with both franchisee and management fees. 
 During the fourth quarter of 2022, Wyndham was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index, which consists of the top 10 of the largest 2,500 stocks in the S P Global Broad Market Index based on their sustainability and environmental practices. As more travelers are looking for environmentally friendly lodging options, it is critical to position

 our hotels optimally and provide new environmentally responsible options for our guests. Our 2022 ESG Report, which is available on our corporate website and not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report, contains additional information regarding our commitment to social responsibility. 
 OUR HISTORY 
 Our business was initially incorporated as Hospitality Franchise Systems, Inc. in 1990 to acquire the Howard Johnson brand and the franchise rights to the Ramada brand in the United States. It was an integral part of Wyndham Worldwide Corporation and its predecessor from 1997 to 2018. Wyndham Hotels became an independent, public company in May 2018 when it was spun-off from Wyndham Worldwide, now known as Travel + Leisure Co. Travel + Leisure ). 

COMPETITION 
 We encounter competition among hotel franchisors and lodging operators. We believe franchisees make decisions based principally upon the perceived value and quality of the brand and the services offered. We further believe that the perceived value of a brand name is partially a function of the success of the existing hotels franchised under the brand. 
 The ability of an individual franchisee to compete may be affected by the location and quality of its property, the number of competitors in the vicinity, community reputation and other factors. A franchisee s success may also be affected by general, regional and local economic conditions. The potential effect of these conditions on our performance is substantially reduced by virtue of the diverse locations of our affiliated hotels and by the scale of our base. Our system is dispersed among over 6,000 franchisees, which reduces our exposure to any one franchisee. One master franchisor in China for the Super 8 brand accounts for 12 of our hotels. Apart from this relationship, no one franchisee accounts for more than 2 of our hotels.

 SEASONALITY 
 While the hotel industry is seasonal in nature, periods of higher revenues vary property-by-property and performance is dependent on location and guest base. Based on historical performance, revenues from franchise and management contracts are generally higher in the second and third quarters than in the first or fourth quarters due to increased leisure travel during the spring and summer months. Our cash from operating activities may not necessarily follow the same seasonality as our revenues and may vary due to timing of working capital requirements and other investment activities. The seasonality of our business may cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results, earnings, profit margins and cash flows. As we expand into new markets and geographical locations, we may experience increased or different seasonality dynamics that create fluctuations in operating results different from the fluctuations we have experienced in the past. 
 
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
 Wyndham Hotels owns the trademarks and other intellectual property rights related to our hotel brands, including the Wyndham trademark. We actively use, directly or through our licensees, these trademarks and other intellectual property rights. We operate in a highly competitive industry in which the trademarks and other intellectual property rights related to our hotel brands are very important to the marketing and sales of our services. We believe that our hotel brand names have come to represent high standards of quality, caring, service and value to our franchisees and guests. We register the trademarks that we own in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, as well as with other relevant authorities, where we deem appropriate, and otherwise seek to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights from unauthorized use as permitted by law. 
 
 GOVERNMENT REGULATION 
 Our business is subject to various foreign and U.S. federal and state laws and regulations. In particular, our franchisees are subject to the local laws and regulations in each country in which such hotels are operated, including employment laws and practices, privacy laws and tax laws, which may provide for tax rates that vary from those of the United States and which may provide that our foreign earnings are subject to withholding requirements or other restrictions, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements or monetary policy and other potentially adverse tax consequences. Our franchisees and other aspects of our business are also subject to various foreign and U.S. federal and state laws and regulations, including the Americans with Disabilities Act and similar legislation in certain jurisdictions outside of the United States. 
 The Federal Trade Commission, various states and other foreign jurisdictions regulate the offer and sale of franchises. The Federal Trade Commission requires us to furnish to prospective franchisees a franchise disclosure document containing prescribed information prior to execution of a binding franchise agreement or payment of money by the prospective franchisee. State regulations also require franchisors to make extensive disclosure to prospective franchisees, and a number of states also require registration of the franchise disclosure document prior to sale of any franchise within the state. Non-compliance with disclosure and registration laws can affect the timing of our ability to sell franchises in these jurisdictions. Additionally, laws in many states and foreign jurisdictions also govern the franchise relationship, such as imposing limits on a franchisor s ability to terminate franchise agreements or to withhold consent to the renewal or transfer of these agreements. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations has the potential to result in fines, injunctive relief, and/or payment of damages or restitution to individual franchisees or regulatory bodies, or negative publicity impairing our ability to sell franchises.

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 RISK FACTORS 
 You should carefully consider each of the following risk factors and all of the other information set forth in this report. Based on the information currently known to us, we believe that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting our Company. However, the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to not presently create significant risk to us may also adversely affect our business. In addition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. 
 If any of the following risks and/or uncertainties develop into actual events, these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline. 
 Risks Relating to Our Industry 
 The lodging industry is highly competitive, and we are subject to risks related to competition that may adversely affect our performance and growth. 
 
 Our continued success depends upon our ability to compete effectively in markets that contain numerous competitors, some of whom may have significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have. We compete with other hotel franchisors for franchisees and we may not be able to grow our franchise system. New hotels may be constructed and 
 13 

Table of Contents 

 these additions to supply create new competitors, in some cases without corresponding increases in demand for lodging. Competition may reduce fee structures, potentially causing us to lower our fees and/or offer other incentives, and may require us to offer terms to prospective franchisees less favorable to us than current franchise agreements, which may adversely impact our profits. Our franchisees also compete with alternative lodging channels, including third-party providers of short-term rental properties and serviced apartments. Increasing use of these alternative lodging channels could adversely affect the occupancy and/or average rates at franchised hotels and our revenues. The use of business models by competitors that are different from ours may require us to change our model so that we can remain competitive. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our operations and the operations of our franchisees, and this pandemic or other potential future pandemics could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Since first being identified in December 2019, COVID-19 had an unp recedented impact on the global economy and the hospitality industry due to the implementation of a wide variety of control measures including, but not limited to, states of emergency and restrictions on travel and large gatherings. These measures resulted in cancelled and reduced travel, complete and partial suspensions of hotel operations and hotel closures. While many of these measures and similar restrictions were subsequently relaxed, a resurgence of future COVID-19 variants or ot her potential future pandemics may cause similar disruptions to our industry that existed in 2020 and 2021. Similarly, while our operations and the operations of our franchisees have largely stabilized since the onset of COVID-19, the potential effects that COVID-19 may continue to have on us or on our franchisees are unclear. Such impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Declines in or disruptions to the travel and hotel industries may adversely affect us. 
 
 We face risks affecting the travel and hotel industries that include, but are not limited to: economic slowdown and potential recessionary pressures; economic factors such as inflation, rising interest rates, employment layoffs, increased costs of living and reduced discretionary income, which may adversely impact decisions by consumers and businesses to use travel accommodations; domestic unrest, terrorist incidents and threats and associated heightened travel security measures; political instability or political and regional strife, including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine; acts of God such as earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods, volcanoes and other natural disasters; war; concerns with or threats of contagious diseases or health epidemics or pandemics, such as COVID-19; environmental disasters; lengthy power outages; cyber threats, increased pricing, financial instability and capacity constraints of air carriers; airline job actions and strikes. Increases in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and other consequences of climate change (including any related regulation) could impact travel demand generally, lead to supply chain interruptions, cause damage to physical assets or adversely impact the accessibility or desirability of travel to certain locations. For example, certain of our franchisees properties are located in coastal areas that could be threatened should sea levels dramatically rise. Because a significant portion of our revenues is derived from fees based on room revenues, disruptions at our franchised properties due to climate change may adversely impact the fees we collect from these properties. Any decline in or disruptions to the travel or hotel industries may adversely affect travel demand and the results of our operations, and those of our current franchised hotels and potential franchisees and developers. Any of these factors could increase our costs, reduce our revenues and otherwise adversely impact our profitability and/or opportunities for growth. 
 
 The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has and may continue to negatively impact macro-economic conditions, which may adversely affect discretionary consumer spending and, as a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 Russia s invasion of Ukraine has negatively affected the global economy. Financial and economic sanctions imposed on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia by the U.S., United Kingdom and European Union, as well as potential retaliatory actions by Russia, could also have a negative impact on the global economy. The current conflict between Russia and Ukraine has not materially affected our overall operations and our operations in both countries are immaterial. However, the conflict has negatively impacted global macro-economic conditions and a prolonged conflict, the potential expansion of the conflict into other European countries, or the direct involvement of the U.S. or other countries where we source our guests could have more significant impacts on macro-economic conditions, which could adversely affect discretionary consumer spending and, consequently, our operations. 
 
 Additional risks to our business relating to the Russia and Ukraine conflict include potential interruptions in global supply chains and the availability of items essential to our operations, the heightened possibility of cyberattacks and terrorist activity, volatility or disruption in financial markets and the potential for travel restrictions affecting our guests ability to access our franchisees hotel locations.

Table of Contents 

 Third-party internet travel intermediaries and peer-to-peer online networks may adversely affect us. 
 
 Consumers use third-party internet travel intermediaries, including search engines, and peer-to-peer online networks to search for and book their lodging accommodations. As the percentage of internet reservations increases, travel intermediaries may be able to obtain higher commissions and reduced room rates to the detriment of our business. Additionally, such travel intermediaries may divert reservations away from our direct online channels or increase the overall cost of internet reservations for our affiliated hotels through their fees and a variety of online marketing methods, including the purchase by certain travel intermediaries of keywords consisting of or containing our hotel brands from Internet search engines to influence search results and direct guests to their websites. If we fail to reach satisfactory agreements with travel intermediaries, our affiliated hotels may not appear on their websites and we could lose business as a result. Further, travel intermediaries may seek to offer distribution services under their own brands directly to lodging accommodations in competition with our core franchise business. 
 
 Risks Relating to Our Operations and Acquisitions 
 
 We are subject to business, financial, operating and other risks common to the hotel and hotel franchising industries which also affect our franchisees, any of which could reduce our revenues, limit our growth or otherwise impact our business. 
 
 A significant portion of our revenue is derived from fees based on room revenues at hotels franchised under our brands. As such, our business is subject, directly or through our franchisees, to risks common in the hotel and hotel franchising industries, including risks related to: 
 
 our ability to meet our objectives for growth in the number of our franchised hotels and hotel rooms in our franchise system and to retain and renew franchisee contracts, all on favorable terms; 
 the number, occupancy and room rates of hotels operating under our franchise agreements; 
 the delay of hotel openings in our pipeline; 
 changes in the supply and demand for hotel rooms; 
 increased pricing or supply chain disruptions for raw materials which could cause delays in the completion and development of new hotels; 
 our ability to develop and maintain positive relations and contractual arrangements with current and potential franchisees under our franchise agreements and other third parties, including marketing alliances and affiliations with e-commerce channels; 
 our franchisees pricing decisions; 
 the quality of the services provided by franchisees and their investments in the maintenance and improvement of properties; 
 the bankruptcy or insolvency of a significant number of our franchised hotels; 
 the financial condition of franchisees, owners or other developers and the availability of financing to them; 
 adverse events occurring at franchised hotel locations, including personal injuries, food tampering, contamination or the spread of illness, including COVID-19; 
 negative publicity, which could damage our hotel brands; 
 our ability to successfully market our current or any future hotel brands and programs, including our rewards program, and to service or pilot new initiatives; 
 our relationship with certain multi-unit franchisees; 
 changes in the laws, regulations and legislation affecting our business, internationally and domestically; 
 our failure to adequately protect and maintain our trademarks and other intellectual property rights; 
 the relative mix of branded hotels in the various hotel industry price categories; 
 corporate budgets and spending and cancellations, deferrals or renegotiations of group business; 
 seasonal or cyclical volatility in our business; 
 operating costs, including as a result of inflation, energy costs and labor costs, such as minimum wage increases and unionization, workers compensation and health-care related costs and insurance; and 
 disputes, claims and litigation and other legal proceedings concerning our franchised hotels operations, including with consumers, government regulators, other businesses, franchisees, organized labor activities and class actions. 
 
 Any of these factors could reduce our revenues, increase our costs or otherwise limit our opportunities for growth. 
 
 Our international operations are subject to additional risks not generally applicable to our domestic operations. 
 
 Our international operations are subject to numerous risks including: exposure to local economic conditions; potential adverse changes in the diplomatic relations of foreign countries with the U.S.; hostility from local populations; political instability, including as a result of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine; trade disputes with trade partners, including China, potential military conflict resulting from escalating political tensions with Russia and China and other geopolitical risks; threats or acts of terrorism; the effect of disruptions caused by severe weather, natural disasters, outbreak

 of disease, such as COVID-19 or other events that make travel to a particular region less attractive or more difficult; the presence and acceptance of varying levels of business corruption in international markets; restrictions and taxes on the withdrawal of foreign investment and earnings; government policies against businesses or properties owned by foreigners; investment restrictions or requirements; diminished ability to legally enforce our contractual rights in foreign countries; forced nationalization of hotel properties by local, state or national governments; foreign exchange restrictions; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the negative impact of the weakening of foreign currencies in geographic regions in which we operate relative to the U.S. dollar; our ability to, or our decision whether or not in particular instances to, hedge against foreign currency effects, and whether we are successful in any such hedging transactions; the ability to comply with or the effect of complying with new and developing laws, regulations and policies of foreign governments, including with respect to climate change; conflicts between local laws and U.S. laws, including laws that impact our rights to protect our intellectual property; withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries; and changes in and application of foreign taxation structures including value added taxes. Any adverse outcome resulting from the financial instability or performance of foreign economies, the instability of other currencies and the related volatility on foreign exchange and interest rates could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 
 
 We are dependent on our senior management and the loss of any member of our senior management could harm our business. 
 
 We believe that our future growth depends in part on the continued services of our senior management team. Losing the services of any member of our senior management team could adversely affect our strategic relationships and impede our ability to execute our business strategies. The market for qualified individuals may be highly competitive and finding and recruiting suitable replacements for senior management may be difficult, time-consuming and costly. While we have updated our policies and practices to provide more flexibility for remote work, we may experience increased attrition of employees to other opportunities as a result of the tightening and increasingly competitive labor market and, particularly as certain employees may seek more flexible work alternatives than we offer, may seek positions with companies outside of the geographic area in which they live that offer remote work opportunities, or may decide to scale back their work life for personal reasons. If we are unable to retain our personnel, particularly our executive officers and senior management team, our business could be harmed. 
 
 Acquisitions and other strategic transactions may not prove successful and could result in operating difficulties and failure to realize anticipated benefits. 
 
 We regularly consider a wide array of acquisitions and other potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions of hotel brands, businesses and real property, joint ventures, business combinations, strategic investments and dispositions. Any of these transactions could be material to our business. We often compete for these opportunities with third parties, which may cause us to lose potential opportunities or to pay more than we may otherwise have paid absent such competition. We may not be able to identify and consummate strategic transactions and opportunities on favorable terms and any such strategic transactions or opportunities, if consummated, may not be successful. 
 
 Risks Relating to Our Relationships with Third Parties 
 
 Our license and other fees could be impacted by any softness in Travel + Leisure s sales of vacation ownership interests. 
 
 In connection with our 2018 spin-off (the Spin-Off from Wyndham Worldwide, now known as Travel + Leisure Co. Travel + Leisure ), we entered into a number of agreements with Travel + Leisure that govern our ongoing relationship with Travel + Leisure. Our success depends, in part, on the maintenance of our ongoing relationship with Travel + Leisure, Travel + Leisure s performance of its obligations under these agreements and continued strategic focus on sales of vacation ownership interests, including Travel + Leisure s maintenance of the quality of products and services it sells under the Wyndham trademark and certain other trademarks and intellectual property that we license to Travel + Leisure. Under the License, Development and Noncompetition Agreement, Travel + Leisure pays us significant royalties and other fees based on the volume of Travel + Leisure s sales of vacation ownership interests and other vacation products and services. If Travel + Leisure is unable to compete effectively for sales of vacation ownership interests, our royalty fees under such agreement could be adversely impacted. If we are unable to maintain a good relationship with Travel + Leisure, or if Travel + Leisure does not perform its obligations under these agreements, fails to maintain the quality of the products and services it sells under the Wyndham trademark and certain other trademarks or fails to pay such royalties, our earnings could decrease.

 Risks Relating to Regulation and Technology 
 
 Our operations are subject to extensive regulation and the cost of compliance or failure to comply with regulations may adversely affect us. 
 
 Our operations are regulated by federal, state and local governments in the countries in which we operate. In addition, U.S. and international federal, state and local regulators may enact new laws and regulations that may reduce our profits or require us to modify our business practices substantially. If we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including, among others, those governing franchising, hotel operations, lending, information security, data protection and privacy (such as the General Data Protection Regulation, U.S. State privacy laws, the Personal Information Protection Law of the People s Republic of China or similar laws or regulations), credit card security standards, marketing, including sales, consumer protection and advertising, unfair and deceptive trade practices, fraud, bribery and corruption, licensing, labor, employment, anti-discrimination, health care, health and safety, accessibility, immigration, gaming, environmental, intellectual property, securities, stock exchange listing, accounting, tax and regulations applicable under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Sherman Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local equivalents in international jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom Bribery Act, we may be subject to regulatory investigations or actions, fines, civil and/or criminal penalties, injunctions and potential criminal prosecution. Changes to such laws and regulations and the cost of compliance or failure to comply with such regulations may adversely affect us. 
 
 Additionally, some jurisdictions are considering or have undertaken actions to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, energy efficiency, energy consumption reporting and green building codes. Such actions could affect the operation of our franchisees properties and result in increased capital expenditures, such as those used to improve the energy efficiency of properties. The cost of such governmental actions would depend upon the specific requirements and may impact our financial condition, results of operations or ability to compete. 
 
 Failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable and proprietary information, non-compliance with our contractual obligations regarding such information or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such information could adversely affect us. 
 
 In connection with our business, we and our service providers collect, use and store large volumes of certain types of personal and proprietary information pertaining to guests, franchisees, stockholders and employees. Such information includes, but is not limited to, large volumes of guest credit and payment card information. We are at risk of attack by cybercriminals operating on a global basis attempting to gain access to such information. In connection with data security incidents involving a group of Wyndham brand hotels that occurred between 2008 and 2010, one of our subsidiaries is subject to a stipulated order with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the FTC ), pursuant to which, among other things, it must meet certain requirements for reasonable data security as outlined in the stipulated order. 
 
 While we maintain what we believe are reasonable security controls over personal and proprietary information, a breach of or breakdown in our systems that results in the unauthorized release of personal or proprietary information could nevertheless occur and have a material adverse effect on our hotel brands, reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as subject us to significant fines, litigation, losses, third-party damages and other liabilities, or our subsidiary could fail to comply with the stipulated order with the FTC. We may face increased cybersecurity risks due to our increasing reliance on internet technology and the number of our employees who are working remotely, which may create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities. Cybercriminal hacker activity has increased in sophistication, duration and frequency since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and poses additional risks. 
 
 Data breaches, viruses, ransomware, worms, malicious software, and other serious cyber incidents have increased globally, along with the methods, techniques and complexity of attacks, including efforts to discover and exploit any design flows, bugs or other security vulnerabilities. Additionally, continued geopolitical turmoil, including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, has heightened the risk of cyber-attacks. We have been, and likely will continue to be, subject to such cyber-attacks. Also, the same cyber security issues exist for the third parties with whom we interact and share information, and cyber-attacks on third parties which possess or use our customer, personnel and other information could adversely impact us in the same way as would a direct cyber-attack on us. Although we do not believe we have incurred any material adverse impact on our operations or financial results as a result of any present or recent cyber-attack, there is no guarantee that cyber-attacks have not gone generally undetected or without general recognition of magnitude or will not occur in the future, any of which could materially adversely affect our brands, reputation, consumer confidence in us, costs and profitability. In addition, the security measures we deploy are not perfect or impenetrable, and we may be unable to anticipate or prevent all unauthorized access attempts made on our systems or those of our third-party service providers. 
 
 Additionally, the legal and regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy in the U.S. and international jurisdictions is constantly evolving, including recent developments and complexities with regard to requirements for the cross-border transfer of personal information due to emerging laws, regulations and judicial decisions (such as cross- 
 17 

Table of Contents 

 border data transfer regulations issued by the People s Republic of China authorities). Other jurisdictions may impose additional restrictions or requirements on cross-border transfers including limitations on transferring data beyond the originating country. Violation or non-compliance with any of these laws or regulations, contractual requirements relating to data security and privacy, or with our own privacy and security policies, either intentionally or unintentionally, or through the acts of intermediaries could have a material adverse effect on our hotel brands, reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as subject us to significant fines, litigation, losses, third-party damages and other liabilities. While we maintain cyber risk insurance, in the event of a significant security or data breach, this insurance may not cover all of the losses that we may suffer and may result in increased cost or impact the future availability of coverage. 
 
 We rely on information technologies and systems to operate our business, which involves reliance on third-party service providers and on uninterrupted operation of service facilities. 
 
 We rely on information technologies and systems to operate our business, which involves reliance on third-party service providers (including cloud-based service providers) such as Sabre Corporation and its SynXis Platform and uninterrupted operations of our and third-party service facilities, including those used for reservation systems, hotel/property management, communications, procurement, call centers, operation of our loyalty program and administrative systems. We and our vendors also maintain physical facilities to support these systems and related services. As a result, in addition to failures that occur from time to time in the ordinary course of business, we and our vendors may be vulnerable to system failures, computer hacking, cyber-terrorism, computer viruses and other intentional or unintentional interference, negligence, fraud, misuse and other unauthorized attempts to access or interfere with these systems and our personal and proprietary information. The increased scope and complexity of our information technology infrastructure and systems could contribute to the potential risk of security breaches or breakdown. Any natural disaster, disruption or other impairment in our technology capabilities and service facilities or those of our vendors could adversely affect our business. In addition, failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations or competitive position. 
 
 Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and Tax Treatment 
 
 Changes in U.S. federal, state and local or foreign tax law, interpretations of existing tax law or adverse determinations by tax authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 We are subject to taxation at the federal, state and local levels in the U.S. and various other countries and jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rate and cash flows could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates, changes in statutory rates and other legislative changes, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax and our ability to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, U.S. federal, state and local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application, which could result in materially higher corporate taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. We are subject to ongoing and periodic tax audits and disputes in U.S. federal and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. An unfavorable outcome from any tax audit could result in higher tax costs, penalties and interest, thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 In addition, we are directly and indirectly affected by new tax legislation and regulation and the interpretation of tax laws and regulations worldwide. Changes in such legislation, regulation or interpretation could increase our taxes and have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. This includes potential changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws arising out of the Base Erosion Profit Shifting project initiated by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD ). In July and October of 2021, the OECD/G-20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS released statements outlining a political agreement on the general rules to be adopted for taxing the digital economy, specifically with respect to nexus and profit allocation (Pillar One) and rules for a global minimum tax (Pillar Two). Preliminary agreement has been reached between OECD member jurisdictions on the global minimum tax (Pillar Two) directive. Further details regarding implementation of these rules are expected to be finalized in the near future. These rules, should they be implemented via domestic legislation of countries or via international treaties, could have a material impact on our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities. There can be no assurance that our tax payments, tax credits or incentives will not be adversely affected by these or other initiatives. 
 
 We are subject to risks related to our debt, hedging transactions, our extension of credit and the cost and availability of capital. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had aggregate outstanding debt of 2,077 million. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future, which may magnify the potential impacts of the risks related to our debt. Our debt instruments contain restrictions, covenants and events of default that, among other things, could limit our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions; take advantage of business opportunities; incur or guarantee additional debt; pay dividends or make distributions or repurchases; make investments or acquisitions; sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of certain assets; create 
 18 

Table of Contents 

 liens; consolidate or merge; enter into transactions with affiliates; and prepay and repurchase or redeem certain indebtedness. Failure to meet our payment obligations or comply with other financial covenants could result in a default and acceleration of the underlying debt and under other debt instruments that contain cross-default provisions. 
 
 In order to reduce or hedge our financial exposure to the effects of currency and interest rate fluctuations, we may use financial instruments, such as hedging transactions. Changes in interest rates may adversely affect our financing costs and/or change the market value of our hedging transactions. Any failure or non-performance of counterparties under our hedging transactions could result in losses. Changes in interest rates may also adversely change the market value of our hedging transactions and may adversely affect financing costs. While a significant portion of our debt is effectively at a fixed rate of interest and our nearest maturity is not until 2025, an increase in financing cost due to increased interest rates may hinder our efforts to expand our franchisee footprint, which could adversely affect our cash flows and business. 
 
 The London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR is expected to no longer be available after June 30, 2023 for the primary U.S. dollar LIBOR settings used by the Company. Our credit facility gives us the option to use LIBOR as a funding benchmark, but also allows us and the administrative agent to replace LIBOR with an alternative benchmark rate, subject to the right of the majority of the lenders to object thereto, as set forth in the credit facility. In April 2022, we amended our credit facility to change the applicable rate benchmark from LIBOR to Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR for our revolver and term loan A. Our term loan B is still based on LIBOR and will need to be modified by June 30, 2023. Our interest rate swaps are also based on the one-month U.S. dollar LIBOR. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association has issued terms that can be applied to determine the alternative reference rates under swap transactions and the timing of the switch to such alternatives. 
 
 There have been significant efforts by market participants and government and regulatory bodies in the U.S. and abroad to identify suitable replacement rates and develop processes for migration to the use of the alternatives. In the U.S., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee AARC ), a committee of private sector entities convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has recommended SOFR plus a recommended spread adjustment as LIBOR s replacement. There are significant differences between LIBOR and SOFR, such as LIBOR being an unsecured lending rate while SOFR is a secured lending rate, and SOFR is an overnight rate while LIBOR reflects term rates at different maturities. If our LIBOR-based borrowings are converted to SOFR, as occurred in April 2022, the differences between LIBOR and SOFR, plus the recommended spread adjustment, could result in interest costs that are higher than if LIBOR remained available, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Although SOFR is the ARRC s recommended replacement rate, it is also possible that lenders may instead choose alternative replacement rates that may differ from LIBOR in ways similar to SOFR or in other ways that would result in higher interest costs for us. 
 
 In addition, we extend credit to assist franchisees in converting to, or building a new hotel under, one of our hotel brands through development advance notes and mezzanine or other forms of subordinated financing. The inability of franchisees to pay back such loans could materially and adversely affect our cash flows and business. 
 
 We may need to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flows to the payment of principal and interest. Our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or general corporate or other purposes may be limited, and we may be unable to renew or refinance our debt on terms as favorable as our existing debt or at all. Additionally, certain market liquidity factors, including uncertainty or volatility in the equity and credit markets, outside of our control could affect our access to credit and capital in the future and adversely impact our business plans and operating model. Our credit rating and the market value of our common stock could also be affected. While we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital, debt service and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future, if we are unable to refinance or repay our outstanding debt when due, our results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 Changes to estimates or projections used to assess the fair value of our assets or operating results that are lower than our current estimates may cause us to incur additional impairment losses and require us to write-off all or a portion of the remaining value of our goodwill or other intangibles of companies we have acquired. 
 
 Our total assets include goodwill and other intangible assets. We evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value is below the carrying value. We may be required to record significant non-cash impairment charges in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill, other intangible assets or other assets is determined, which would negatively impact our results of operations and stockholders equity.

 Risks Relating to Litigation, Reputation and Insurance 
 
 We are subject to risks related to litigation. 
 
 We are subject to a number of disputes, claims, litigation and other legal proceedings as described in this report, and any unfavorable rulings or outcomes in current or future litigation and other legal proceedings may materially harm our business. For additional information, see our Commitments and Contingencies note (Note 15) in the notes to our financial statements. 
 
 We are subject to risks related to human trafficking allegations. 
 
 Our business, along with the hospitality industry generally, faces risk that could cause damage to our reputation and the value of our hotel brands due to claims related to purported incidents of human trafficking. Along with many of our competitors, we and/or certain of our subsidiaries have been named as defendants in litigation matters filed in state and federal courts (and incurred litigation-related fees and costs), alleging statutory and common law claims arising from purported incidents of human trafficking perpetrated by third parties at certain franchised facilities and hotels once managed by certain of our subsidiaries. For additional information, see our Commitments and Contingencies note (Note 15) in the notes to our financial statements. 
 
 The insurance we carry may not always pay, or be sufficient to pay or reimburse us, for our liabilities, losses or replacement costs. 
 
 We carry insurance for general liability, property, business interruption and other insurable risks with respect to our business and franchised hotels. We also self-insure for certain risks up to certain monetary limits. The insurance coverage we carry, subject to our deductible, may not be sufficient to pay or reimburse us for the amount of our liabilities, losses or replacement costs, and there may also be risks for which we do not obtain insurance in the full amount, or some amount, or at all concerning a potential loss or liability, due to the cost or availability of such insurance. As a result, we may incur liabilities or losses in the operation of our business that are not sufficiently covered by the insurance we maintain, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Risks Relating to Our Common Stock and Corporate Governance 
 
 The market price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate. 
 
 The market price for our common stock, and the market price of stock of other companies operating in the hospitality industry, has been highly volatile. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2022, the trading price of our common stock ranged between a low sales price of 58.81 and a high sales price of 93.86. The market price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate depending upon many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, our ability to achieve growth and performance objectives, the success or failure of our business strategy, general economic conditions, our quarterly or annual earnings and those of other companies in our industry, changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts, changes in laws and regulations, political instability, increased competition and changes affecting the travel industry and other events impacting our business. The stock market in general has experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. 
 
 Certain of our Directors and executive officers may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their ownership of Travel + Leisure equity or their current or former positions at Travel + Leisure. 
 
 Two of our Directors also serve on the Travel + Leisure Board and certain of our executive officers and non-employee Directors own shares of Travel + Leisure common stock because of their current or former positions with Travel + Leisure. This could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our or Travel + Leisure s management, officers and directors face decisions that could have different implications for us and Travel + Leisure. 
 We are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility. 
 
 Our business, along with the hospitality industry generally, faces scrutiny related to environmental, social and governance activities and the risk of damage to our reputation and the value of our hotel brands if we fail to act responsibly or comply with regulatory requirements in a number of areas, such as safety and security, responsible tourism, environmental stewardship, supply chain management, climate change, diversity, equity and inclusion, philanthropy and support for local communities. In particular, our stakeholders (notably our customers, stockholders and team members) are increasingly interested in our approach to managing climate-related risks and opportunities (including, but not limited to, targets that keep global average temperature rise to no more than 1.5 C, measure Scope 3 franchisee emissions and expand participation in the Wyndham Green Certification program) and may directly impact our revenue.

 Provisions in our corporate governance documents and Delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of our business, which could decrease the market price of our common stock. 
 
 Our corporate governance documents and Delaware law contain provisions that are intended to deter or delay coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids, including requiring advance notice for stockholder proposals, placing limitations on convening stockholder meetings and authorizing our Board to issue one or more series of preferred stock. Additionally, Delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock. These provisions may prevent or delay an acquisition that some stockholders may consider beneficial, which could decrease the market price of our common stock. 
 
 Our third amended and restated by-laws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders and the federal district courts of the United States as the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action under the Securities Act, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our Directors or employees. 
 
 Our third amended and restated by-laws provide that, subject to limited exceptions, (1) the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for derivative actions; claims related to a breach of a fiduciary duty, corporate law, our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended or our third amended and restated bylaws, as amended; or under the internal affairs doctrine; and (2) the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause or causes of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including all causes of action asserted against any defendant to such complaint. We believe these provisions may benefit us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law and federal securities laws by chancellors and judges, as applicable, particularly experienced in resolving corporate disputes, efficient administration of cases on a more expedited schedule relative to other forums and protection against the burdens of multi-forum litigation. However, these choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our current or former Directors, officers or employees, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our third amended and restated by-laws inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our management and Board. 
 
 We may not continue to pay dividends on, or effect repurchases of, our common stock, and the terms of our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. 
 
 The declaration and payment of dividends and share repurchases are at the sole discretion of our Board and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions under our indebtedness and other factors that our Board may deem relevant. Though we expect to make regular dividends, there can be no assurance that a payment of a dividend will occur in the future. 
 
 Risks Relating to the Spin-Off and Related Transactions 
 
 In connection with the Spin-Off and Travel + Leisure s sale of its European vacation rentals business, we agreed to indemnify Travel + Leisure and Travel + Leisure agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, including taxes, and if we are required to perform under these indemnities or if Travel + Leisure is unable to satisfy its obligations under these indemnities, our financial results could be negatively affected. 
 
 In connection with the Spin-Off and Travel + Leisure s sale of its European vacation rentals business, we agreed to indemnify Travel + Leisure and Travel + Leisure agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, including taxes, and if we are required to perform under these indemnities or if Travel + Leisure is unable to satisfy its obligations under these indemnities, our financial results could be negatively affected. Additionally, the contingent liabilities we assumed in connection with the Spin-Off and Travel + Leisure s sale of its European vacation rentals business could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition as a result of our indemnification obligations. Should our indemnification obligations exceed applicable insurance coverage, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Additionally, the indemnities from Travel + Leisure may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of these and other liabilities. Third parties also could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that Travel + Leisure has agreed to assume. Even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Travel + Leisure any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear those losses ourselves. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Table of Contents 

 If the Spin-Off, together with certain related transactions, were to fail to qualify as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code, then our stockholders, we and Travel + Leisure might be required to pay substantial U.S. federal income taxes. 
 
 The Spin-Off was conditioned upon Travel + Leisure s receipt of opinions of its Spin-Off tax advisors to the effect that, subject to the assumptions and limitations described in the opinions, the Spin-Off, together with certain related transactions, would qualify as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), in which no gain or loss would be recognized by Travel + Leisure or its stockholders, except, in the case of Travel + Leisure stockholders, for cash received in lieu of fractional shares, which opinions were delivered on the closing date of the Spin-Off. The opinions of the Spin-Off tax advisors are not binding on the Internal Revenue Service IRS or a court, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the validity of the Spin-Off and such related transactions as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code eligible for tax-free treatment, or that any such challenge ultimately will not prevail. 
 
 In addition, Travel + Leisure received certain rulings from the IRS regarding certain U.S. federal income tax aspects of transactions related to the Spin-Off. Although the IRS Ruling generally is binding on the IRS, the continued validity of the IRS Ruling is based upon and subject to the continuing accuracy of factual statements and representations made to the IRS by Travel + Leisure. 
 
 If the Spin-Off does not qualify as a tax-free transaction for any reason, including as a result of a breach of a representation or covenant with respect to such tax opinions or the IRS Ruling, Travel + Leisure would recognize a substantial gain attributable to our hotel business for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such case, under U.S. Treasury regulations, each member of the Travel + Leisure consolidated group at the time of the Spin-Off, including us and certain of our subsidiaries, would be jointly and severally liable for the entire resulting amount of any U.S. federal income tax liability. 

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. 
 None. 

Item 2. Properties. 
 Our corporate headquarters is located in a leased office at 22 Sylvan Way, Parsippany, New Jersey, with the lease expiring in 2029. We also lease space for our reservation center and data warehouse in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada pursuant to a lease that expires in 2029. In addition, we have an additional 11 leases for office space in 10 countries outside the United States and one additional lease within the United States. We will evaluate the need to renew each lease on a case-by-case basis prior to its expiration. 
 We believe our current leased properties are adequate to support our existing operations. 
 
 Item 3. Legal Proceedings. 
 We are involved in various claims, legal and regulatory proceedings and governmental inquiries arising in the ordinary course of business, none of which, in the opinion of management, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Discussed below are our key operating statistics, consolidated results of operations and the results of operations for each of our reportable segments. The reportable segments presented below represent our operating segments for which discrete financial information is available and used on a regular basis by our chief operating decision maker to assess performance and to allocate resources. In identifying our reportable segments, we also consider the nature of services provided by our operating segments. Management evaluates the operating results of each of our reportable segments based upon net revenues and adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income/(loss) excluding net interest expense, depreciation and amortization, early extinguishment of debt charges, impairment charges, restructuring and related charges, contract termination costs, transaction-related items (acquisition-, disposition- or separation-related), (gain)/loss on asset sales, foreign currency impacts of highly inflationary countries, stock-based compensation expense, income taxes and development advance notes amortization. We believe that adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure of performance for our segments and, when considered with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP measures, gives a more complete understanding of our operating performance. We use this measure internally to assess operating performance, both absolutely and in comparison to other companies, and to make day to day operating decisions, including in the evaluation of selected compensation decisions. Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized term under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or other measures of financial performance or liquidity derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our presentation of adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies. 
 We generate royalties and franchise fees, management fees and other revenues from hotel franchising and hotel management activities, as well as fees from licensing our Wyndham trademark, certain other trademarks and intellectual property. In addition, pursuant to our franchise and management contracts with third-party hotel owners, we generate marketing, reservation and loyalty fee revenues and cost reimbursement revenues that over time are offset, respectively, by the marketing, reservation and loyalty costs and property operating costs that we incur.

 OPERATING STATISTICS - 2022 VS. 2021 
 The table below presents our operating statistics for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Rooms represent the number of hotel rooms at the end of the period which are either under franchise and/or management agreements, or are Company-owned (as of December 31, 2021), and properties under affiliation agreements for which we receive a fee for reservation and/or other services provided. RevPAR represents revenue per available room and is calculated by multiplying average occupancy rate by average daily rate. Average royalty rate represents the average royalty rate earned on our franchised properties and is calculated by dividing total royalties, excluding the impact of amortization of development advance notes, by total room revenues. These operating statistics are drivers of our revenues and therefore provide an enhanced understanding of our business. Refer to the section below for a discussion as to how these operating statistics affected our business for the periods presented.

 Rooms as of December 31, 2022 increased 4 compared to the prior year, reflecting 1 growth in the U.S. and 9 growth internationall y. As expected, these increases included strong growth in both the higher RevPAR midscale and above segments in the U.S. and the direct franchising business in China, which grew 4 and 10 , respectively, as well as 80 basis points of growth globally and 200 basis points internationally from the acquisition of the Vienna House brand in September 2022. 
 Excluding currency effects, global RevPAR for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased 20 , compared to the prior year, including U.S. growth of 12 and international growth of 49 . The increases were primarily driven by stronger pricing power and COVID-19 recovery internationally. 
 Global average royalty rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased by 20 basis points to 3.9 , compared to the prior year due to mix as both international RevPAR and net room growth outpaced the U.S., with the RevPAR growth primarily the result of COVID-19 recovering more slowly internationally than it did in the U.S.

 Net revenues during 2022 decreased by 67 million, or 4 , compared to the prior year, primarily driven by: 
 261 million of lower revenues associated with our select-service management and owned hotel businesses which were exited in the first half of 2022 (which 186 million represented cost-reimbursement revenues that have no impact on net income); partially offset by 
 76 million of higher marketing, reservation and loyalty fees reflecting a 16 increase in global RevPAR; 
 65 million of higher royalty and franchise fees due to the RevPAR increase; 
 21 million of higher license and other fees resulting from higher travel demand associated with the COVID-19 recovery; 
 20 million of higher other revenues primarily due to favorable co-branded credit card activity; and 
 10 million of higher cost-reimbursement revenues related to the COVID-19 recovery in our full-service managed properties that have no impact on net income. 
 Total expenses during 2022, decreased 179 million, or 16 , compared to the prior year, primarily driven by: 
 267 million of lower expenses associated with our select-service management and owned hotel businesses, which were exited in the first half of 2022 (which 186 million represented cost-reimbursement expenses as discussed above); and 
 a 35 million gain related to the sale our owned hotel Wyndham Grand Bonnet Creek Resort in March 2022; partially offset by 
 81 million of higher marketing, reservation and loyalty expenses primarily as a result of the increase in marketing revenue; 
 14 million of higher variable expenses primarily associated with the improvement in travel demand due to the COVID-19 recovery; 
 13 million of higher costs primarily due to inflation, as expected; and 
 10 million of higher cost-reimbursement expenses related to COVID-19 recovery in our full-service managed properties. 
 Interest expense, net during 2022 decreased 13 million, or 14 , compared to the prior year as a result of the redemption of our 500 million senior notes in April 2021 and an increase in interest income. 
 Early extinguishment of debt of 2 million in 2022 relates to the amendment of our credit agreement and 400 million partial pay down of our term loan B, while the 18 million in 2021 relates to the redemption of our 500 million senior notes.

 Our effective tax rate decreased to 25.4 in 2022 from 27.2 in 2021. The change was primarily related to the release of valuation allowances for net operating loss carryforwards, which was partially offset by an additional valuation allowance for certain foreign tax credits generated during the year. 
 As a result of these items, net income during 2022, increased 111 million compared to the prior year.

 Excluding currency effects, global RevPAR increased 22 from the prior year period due to a 14 increase in the U.S. and a 49 increase internationally, both driven by stronger pricing power. 
 Net revenues during 2022 increased 178 million, or 16 compared to the prior year, primarily driven by: 
 60 million of higher royalty and franchise fees reflecting the RevPAR increase; 
 76 million of higher marketing, reservation and loyalty revenues also reflecting the RevPAR increase; 
 21 million of higher other revenues primarily due to favorable co-branded credit card activity; and 
 21 million of higher license and other fees due to strong travel demand associated with the COVID-19 recovery. 
 Adjusted EBITDA during 2022 increased 87 million, or 15 , compared to the prior year, driven by the revenue increases discussed above, partially offset by; 
 81 million of higher marketing, reservation and loyalty expenses primarily as a result of the increase in marketing revenues; 
 8 million of higher costs primarily reflecting variable expenses associated with the improvement in travel demand due to the COVID-19 recovery; and

 4 million of higher royalty, management and other fees. 
 Adjusted EBITDA during 2022 decreased 20 million, or 35 , compared to the prior year primarily driven by the revenue decreases discussed above (excluding cost reimbursements), partially offset by 56 million of lower expenses associated with the exit from our select-service hotel management business and owned hotel businesses. 
 Corporate and Other 
 Adjusted EBITDA during 2022 was unfavorable by 7 million compared to the prior year primarily due to inflationary cost pressures, as expected.

 OPERATING STATISTICS - 2021 VS. 2020 
 The table below presents our operating statistics for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Rooms represent the number of hotel rooms at the end of the period which are either under franchise and/or management agreements, or are Company-owned, and properties under affiliation agreements for which we receive a fee for reservation and/or other services provided. RevPAR represents revenue per available room and is calculated by multiplying average occupancy rate by average daily rate. Average royalty rate represents the average royalty rate earned on our franchised properties and is calculated by dividing total royalties, excluding the impact of amortization of development advance notes, by total room revenues. These operating statistics are drivers of our revenues and therefore provide an enhanced understanding of our business. Refer to the section below for a discussion as to how these operating statistics affected our business for the periods presented.

 Global RevPAR for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased 47 to 35.95, compared to the prior year due to the ongoing recovery in travel demand. Global RevPAR recovered to 88 of 2019 levels on an annual and constant currency basis, including domestic and international RevPAR at 97 and 67 , respectively, of 2019 levels.

 Net revenues during 2021 increased 265 million, or 20 , compared to the prior year, primarily driven by: 
 133 million of higher royalty and franchise fees reflecting a 47 increase in global RevPAR due to the ongoing recovery in travel demand and a 2 increase in system size; 
 98 million of higher marketing, reservation and loyalty fee primarily due to the RevPAR increase; 
 53 million of higher management and other fees due to the ongoing recovery in travel demand; partially offset by 
 30 million of lower cost-reimbursement revenues in our hotel management business as a result of CorePoint Lodging asset sales. 
 Total expenses during 2021, decreased 227 million, or 17 , compared to the prior year, primarily driven by: 
 200 million of lower impairment charges, driven by the absence of 206 million of impairment charges during 2020, partially offset by a 6 million impairment charge in 2021 resulting from our Board s approval of a plan to sell our two owned hotels; 
 34 million of lower restructuring charges due to the absence of cost saving initiatives implemented in 2020 in response to COVID-19; 
 30 million of lower cost-reimbursement expenses consistent with the revenue decline discussed above; 
 12 million of lower transaction-related expenses; partially offset by 
 31 million of higher marketing, reservation and loyalty expenses primarily due to the ongoing recovery in travel demand; and 
 23 million of higher operating expenses primarily associated with the recovery in travel demand at our owned hotels. 
 Interest expense, net during 2021 decreased 19 million, or 17 , compared to the prior year and early extinguishment of debt was 18 million in 2021 as a result of the redemption of our 500 million 5.375 senior notes in April 2021. 
 Our effective tax rate increased to 27.2 on pre-tax income from 16.5 on pre-tax loss during 2021 and 2020, respectively. The change was primarily related to valuation allowances for certain tax attributes and impact of foreign taxes, including withholding taxes on international operations. In 2020, we had goodwill impairment charges that were nondeductible for tax purposes which decreased the effective tax rate. 
 As a result of these items, net income during 2021, increased 376 million compared to the prior year.

 (c) Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income/(loss) excluding net interest expense, depreciation and amortization, early extinguishment of debt charges, impairment charges, restructuring and related charges, contract termination costs, transaction-related items (acquisition-, disposition- or separation-related), (gain)/loss on asset sales, foreign currency impacts of highly inflationary countries, stock-based compensation expense, income taxes and development advance notes amortization. We believe that adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure of performance for our segments which, when considered with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP measures, allows a more complete understanding of our operating performance. We use this measure internally to assess operating performance, both absolutely and in comparison to other companies, and to make day to day operating decisions, including in the evaluation of selected compensation decisions. Our presentation of adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies. During the first quarter of 2021, the Company modified the definition of adjusted EBITDA to exclude the amortization of development advance notes to reflect how the Company s chief operating decision maker reviews operating performance beginning in 2021. The Company has applied the modified definition of adjusted EBITDA to all periods presented. 
 (d) Corporate and Other reflects unallocated corporate costs that are not attributable to an operating segment.

See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Critical Accounting Policies, for a detailed discussion of the accounting policies that we believe require subjective and complex judgments that could potentially affect reported results. 

DEVELOPMENT 
 We awarded 882 new contracts this year, a 35 increase compared to the 655 contracts we awarded during 2021. As of December 31, 2022, our global development pipeline consisted of over 1,700 hotels and approximately 219,000 rooms, of which approximately 73 is in the midscale and above segments (56 in the U.S.). Our pipeline grew 12 compared to 2021, including 34 growth in the U.S. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 60 of our development pipeline was international and over 80 was new construction, of which approximately 36 had broken ground. The pipeline includes 170 new contracts awarded for the Company's ECHO Suites Extended Stay by Wyndham brand since its launch in March 2022. 
 
 RESTRUCTURING 
 During 2020, we incurred 34 million of charges related to restructuring initiatives implemented in response to COVID-19. These initiatives resulted in a reduction of 846 employees and were comprised primarily of employee separation and facility closure costs. In addition, during 2019, we implemented restructuring initiatives, primarily focused on enhancing

 our organizational efficiency and rationalizing our operations. During 2020, we paid 30 million in restructuring payments relating to our 2019 and 2020 plans. As of December 31, 2020, we had a 10 million liability related to our 2020 restructuring plans which was paid in 2021. 
 For a comparative review of the consolidated results of operations of our Company and reportable segments for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, refer to Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 16, 2022. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Financial Condition 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Change 
 Total assets 
 4,123 4,269 (146) Total liabilities 
 3,161 3,180 (19) Total stockholders equity 
 962 1,089 (127) 
 
 Total assets decreased 146 million from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022 primarily due to a 154 million reduction in assets held for sale due to the completion of the sales of our two owned hotels and an 84 million reduction in intangible assets related to the exit of our select-service management business, both of which occurred in the first half of 2022. Such reductions were partially offset by a 53 million increase in the value of our interest rate swaps and a 44 million increase to intangible assets related to the Vienna House acquisition. Total liabilities decreased 19 million year-over-year primarily due to a reduction in liabilities held for sale as a result of the owned hotel sales. Total equity decreased 127 million year-over-year primarily due to 445 million of stock repurchases and 116 million of dividend payments, partially offset by the net income we generated in the year and a 53 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income primarily associated with the increase in the value of our interest rate swaps. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Historically, our business generates sufficient cash flow to not only support our current operations as well as our future growth needs and dividend payments to our stockholders, but also to create additional value for our stockholders in the form of share repurchases and business investment. 
 As of December 31, 2022, our liquidity approximated 900 million. Given the minimal capital needs and flexible cost structure of our business, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, cash generated through operations and our expected access to financing facilities, together with funding through our revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, anticipated capital expenditures and growth needs. 
 In April 2022, we amended our 750 million revolving credit facility, extending the maturity from May 2023 to April 2027 on similar terms as the previous facility, and issued a new 400 million senior secured term loan A facility, which matures in April 2027. The proceeds from the term loan A were used to repay a portion of our 1.6 billion term loan B facility, which is scheduled to mature in May 2025. There was no increase in rates from the 1.6 billion term loan B facility to the new term loan A. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the financial covenants of our credit agreement and expect to remain in such compliance. As of December 31, 2022, we had a term loan B with a principal outstanding balance of 1.1 billion maturing in 2025, a term loan A with a principal outstanding balance of 400 million maturing in 2027 and a five-year revolving credit facility maturing in 2027 with a maximum aggregate principal amount of 750 million, of which none was outstanding and 9 million was allocated to outstanding letters of credit. 
 The interest rate per annum applicable to our term loan B is equal to, at our option, either a base rate plus a margin of 0.75 or LIBOR plus a margin of 1.75 . Our revolving credit facility and term loan A are subject to an interest rate per annum equal to, at our option, either a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.50 to 1.00 or the Secured Overnight Funding Rate SOFR plus a 0.10 SOFR adjustment, plus a margin ranging from 1.50 to 2.00 , in either case based upon the total leverage ratio of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries. 
 36 

Table of Contents 

 As of December 31, 2022, 1.1 billion of our term loan B is hedged with pay-fixed/receive-variable interest rate swaps hedging our term loan interest rate exposure. The aggregate fair value of these interest rate swaps was a 53 million asset as of December 31, 2022. 
 The Federal Reserve has established the Alternative Reference Rates Committee to identify alternative reference rates for when the U.S. dollar LIBOR ceases to exist after June 2023. Our credit facility, as amended in April 2022, includes our revolving credit facility and term loans A and B. The revolver and term loan A are both based on SOFR. For the pre-existing term loan B, the credit facility gives us the option to use LIBOR as a base rate and our interest rate swaps are based on the one-month U.S. dollar LIBOR rate. In the event that LIBOR is no longer published, the credit facility allows us and the administrative agent of the facility to replace LIBOR with an alternative benchmark rate, subject to the right of the majority of the lenders to object thereto. In addition, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association issued protocols to allow swap parties to amend their existing contracts, though our existing swaps will continue to reference LIBOR for the foreseeable future. 
 As of December 31, 2022, our credit rating was Ba1 from Moody s Investors Service and BB+ from Standard and Poor s Rating Agency. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal by the assigning rating organization. Reference in this report to any such credit rating is intended for the limited purpose of discussing or referring to aspects of our liquidity and of our costs of funds. Any reference to a credit rating is not intended to be any guarantee or assurance of, nor should there be any undue reliance upon, any credit rating or change in credit rating, nor is any such reference intended as any inference concerning future performance, future liquidity or any future credit rating. 
 Our liquidity and access to capital may be impacted by our credit ratings, financial performance and global credit market conditions. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, cash generated through operations and our expected access to financing facilities, together with funding through our revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, anticipated capital expenditures and growth needs. 

CASH FLOW 
 The following table summarizes the changes in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020: 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Cash provided by/(used in) 
 Operating activities 
 399 426 67 Investing activities 
 179 (34) (31) Financing activities 
 (584) (713) 363 Effects of changes in exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 
 (4) (1) Net change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 
 (10) (322) 399 
 
 During 2022, net cash provided by operating activities decreased 27 million compared to the prior year primarily due to higher development advances provided to franchisees in support of system growth, as well as the impact from the sale of our two owned hotels and the exit of our select-service management business and lower cash collected from 2020 COVID-19 related fee deferrals. Net cash provided by investing activities increased 213 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to the proceeds from the sales of our two owned hotels and the termination fee received from CorePoint Lodging associated with the exit of our select-service management business, partially offset by 44 million of cash used for the acquisition of the Vienna House brand. Net cash used in financing activities decreased 129 million compared to the prior year primarily due to the absence of cash used for the redemption of our 500 million 5.375 senior unsecured notes in 2021, partially offset by a 341 million increase in stock repurchases and a 34 million increase in dividend payments. 
 
 During 2021, net cash provided by operating activities increased 359 million compared to the prior year primarily due to higher net income (excluding non-cash impairments and depreciation expense) in 2021 as well as favorable collections experience, including collection of fee deferrals related to COVID-19 and working capital management, partially offset by 14 million of higher net payments for development advance notes. Net cash used in investing activities increased 3 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher property and equipment additions. Net cash used in financing activities increased 1.1 billion compared to the prior year. This change reflects borrowing activities in 2020 out of an abundance of caution in connection with the pandemic and repayment activities in 2021 as our business began to experience recovery.

Table of Contents 

 Specifically, in 2020, we issued 500 million of 4.375 senior unsecured notes; while in 2021, we redeemed 500 million of higher-cost, nearer maturity debt effectively replacing it with the August 2020 issuance of lower-cost, longer maturity debt. 
 Capital Deployment 
 Our first priority is to invest in the business. This includes deploying capital to attract high quality assets into our system, investing in select technology improvements across our business that further our strategic objectives and competitive position, brand refresh programs to improve quality and protect brand equity, business acquisitions that are accretive and strategically enhancing to our business, and/or other strategic initiatives. We also expect to maintain a regular dividend payment. Excess cash generated beyond these needs is expected to be available for enhanced stockholder return in the form of stock repurchases or potential acquisitions from time to time. 
 During 2022, we spent 39 million on capital expenditures, primarily related to information technology, including digital innovation. During 2023, we anticipate spending approximately 35 million on capital expenditures. 
 In addition, during 2022, we spent 48 million, net of repayments, on development advance notes. During 2023, we anticipate spending approximately 60 million on development advance notes. We may also provide other forms of financial support such as enhanced credit support to further assist in the growth of our business. 
 We expect all our cash needs to be funded from cash on hand and cash generated through operations, and/or availability under our revolving credit facility and, if needed and available, new debt incurrence. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 Material contractual obligations arising in the normal course of business primarily consist of long-term debt and related interest payments, purchase commitments and lease payments. See Note 13 - Long-Term Debt and Borrowing Arrangements and Note 20 - Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part IV of this report for more information. As of December 31, 2022, we had future long-term interest payment obligations of approximately 337 million of which 94 million is payable within twelve months. We have purchase commitments primarily consisting of non-cancelable obligations for marketing and technology related services. As of December 31, 2022, we had purchase commitments of 140 million of which 57 million is payable within twelve months. 
 Stock Repurchase Program 
 In May 2018, our Board approved a share repurchase plan pursuant to which we were authorized to purchase up to 300 million of our common stock. In August 2019, the Board increased the capacity of the program by 300 million. Our Board increased the capacity of the program by 400 million in February 2022 and an additional 400 million in October 2022. Under the plan, we may, from time to time, purchase our common stock through various means, including, without limitation, open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions or tender offers, subject to the terms of the tax matters agreement entered into in connection with our spin-off. 
 Under our current stock repurchase program, we repurchased approximately 6.2 million shares at an average price of 71.70 per share for a cost of 445 million during 2022. Since inception, we repurchased 15.2 million shares at an average price of 63.32 per share for a cost of 964 million. As of December 31, 2022, we had 436 million of remaining availability under our program. 
 Dividend Policy 
 We declared cash dividends of 0.32 per share in each of the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2022 116 million in aggregate), which is consistent with our pre-pandemic quarterly dividend per share. In February 2023, the Board approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend to 0.35 per share. 
 
 The declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock is at the discretion of our Board and depends upon many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of our business, covenants associated with certain debt obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other factors that our Board deems relevant. 
 Foreign Earnings 
 Although the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax during 2017 and the territorial tax system created as a result of U.S. tax reform generally eliminate U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries, we continue to assert 
 38 

Table of Contents 

 that all of our undistributed foreign earnings of 48 million will be reinvested indefinitely as of December 31, 2022. In the event the Company determines not to continue to assert that all or part of its undistributed foreign earnings are permanently reinvested, such a determination in the future could result in the accrual and payment of additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. taxes on currency transaction gains and losses, the determination of which is not practicable due to the complexities associated with the hypothetical calculation. 

LONG-TERM DEBT COVENANTS 
 Our credit facilities contain customary covenants that, among other things, impose limitations on indebtedness; liens; mergers, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions; dispositions, restricted debt payments, restricted payments and transactions with affiliates. Events of default in these credit facilities include, among others, failure to pay interest, principal and fees when due; breach of a covenant or warranty; acceleration of or failure to pay other debt in excess of a threshold amount; unpaid judgments in excess of a threshold amount, insolvency matters; and a change of control. The credit facilities require us to comply with a financial covenant to be tested quarterly, consisting of a maximum first-lien leverage ratio of 5.0 times. The ratio is calculated by dividing consolidated first lien indebtedness (as defined in the credit agreement) net of consolidated unrestricted cash as of the measurement date by consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement), as measured on a trailing four-fiscal-quarter basis preceding the measurement date. As of December 31, 2022, our first-lien leverage ratio was 2.2 times. 
 The indenture, as supplemented, under which the senior notes due 2028 were issued, contains covenants that limit, among other things, our ability and that of certain of our subsidiaries to (i) create liens on certain assets; (ii) enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and (iii) merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets. These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the financial covenants described above. 

SEASONALITY 
 While the hotel industry is seasonal in nature, periods of higher revenues vary property-by-property and performance is dependent on location and guest base. Based on historical performance, revenues from franchise and management contracts are generally higher in the second and third quarters than in the first or fourth quarters due to increased leisure travel during the spring and summer months. Our cash from operating activities may not necessarily follow the same seasonality as our revenues and may vary due to timing of working capital requirements and other investment activities. The seasonality of our business may cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results, earnings, profit margins and cash flows. As we expand into new markets and geographical locations, we may experience increased or different seasonality dynamics that create fluctuations in operating results different from the fluctuations we have experienced in the past. 

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
 We are involved in claims, legal and regulatory proceedings and governmental inquiries related to our business. Litigation is inherently unpredictable and, although we believe that our accruals are adequate and/or that we have valid defenses in these matters, unfavorable results could occur. As such, an adverse outcome from such proceedings for which claims are awarded in excess of the amounts accrued, if any, could be material to us with respect to earnings and/or cash flows in any given reporting period. As of December 31, 2022, the potential exposure resulting from adverse outcomes of such legal proceedings could, in the aggregate, range up to approximately 3 million in excess of recorded accruals. However, we do not believe that the impact of such litigation should result in a material liability to us in relation to our financial position or liquidity. For a more detailed description of our commitments and contingencies see Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part IV of this report. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES 
 In presenting our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported therein. Several of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events. However, events that are outside of our control cannot be predicted and, as such, they cannot be contemplated in evaluating such estimates and assumptions. If there is a significant unfavorable change to current conditions, it could result in a material impact to our consolidated results of operations, financial position and liquidity. We believe that the estimates and assumptions we used when preparing our financial statements were the most appropriate at that time. Presented below are those accounting policies that we believe require subjective and complex judgments that could potentially affect reported results. However, the majority of our business activities are in environments where we are paid a fee for a service performed, and therefore the results of the majority of our 
 39 

Table of Contents 

 recurring operations are recorded in our financial statements using accounting policies that are not particularly subjective, nor complex. 
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
 Goodwill is reviewed annually (during the fourth quarter of each year subsequent to completing our annual forecasting process), or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired, to the reporting units carrying values as required by the guidance. This is done either by performing a qualitative assessment or utilizing the one-step impairment test, with an impairment being recognized only where the fair value is less than carrying value. In any given year, we can elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is in excess of its carrying value. If it is not more likely than not that the fair value is in excess of the carrying value, or we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment, we would use the one-step impairment test. The qualitative factors evaluated include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, our historical share price as well as other industry-specific considerations. 
 We also determine whether the carrying values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. Application of the other indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test requires judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine fair value. The fair value of each other indefinite-lived intangible asset is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which are dependent on internal forecasts, discount rates and to a lesser extent, estimation of long-term rates of growth. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of other indefinite-lived intangible assets change from year to year based on operating results and market conditions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and the other indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment. 
 We also evaluate the recoverability of each of our definite-lived intangible assets by performing a qualitative assessment to determine if circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. If such circumstances exist, we perform a quantitative assessment by comparing the respective carrying value of the assets to the expected future cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, to be generated from such assets. 
 We also evaluate the recoverability of our other long-lived assets, including property and equipment, if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred, pursuant to guidance for impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. This analysis is performed by comparing the respective carrying values of the assets to the current and expected future cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, to be generated from such assets. Property and equipment is evaluated separately within each segment. If such analysis indicates that the carrying value of these assets is not recoverable, the carrying value of such assets is reduced to fair value. 
 Loyalty Program 
 We operate the Wyndham Rewards loyalty program. Wyndham Rewards members primarily accumulate points by staying in hotels operated under one of our brands. Wyndham Rewards members may also accumulate points by purchasing everyday services and products with their Wyndham Rewards co-branded credit card. 
 We earn revenue from these programs (i) when a member stays at a participating hotel or club resort or vacation rental from a fee charged by us to the property owner or manager, which is based upon a percentage of room revenues generated from such stay which we recognize, net of redemptions, over time based upon loyalty point redemption patterns, including an estimate of loyalty points that will expire or will never be redeemed, and (ii) based upon a percentage of the member s spending on the Wyndham Rewards co-branded credit cards for which revenues are paid to us by a third-party issuing bank which we primarily recognize over time based upon the redemption patterns of the loyalty points earned under the program, including an estimate of loyalty points that will expire or will never be redeemed. 
 As members earn points through the Wyndham Rewards loyalty program, we record a liability for the estimated future redemption costs, which is calculated based on (i) an estimated cost per point and (ii) an estimated redemption rate of the overall points earned, which is determined with the assistance of a third-party actuarial firm through historical experience, current trends and the use of an actuarial analysis. 
 Income Taxes 
 We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates. We regularly review our deferred tax 
 40 

Table of Contents 

 assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets that we believe will not be ultimately realized. In performing this review, we make estimates and assumptions regarding projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies. A change in these assumptions may increase or decrease our valuation allowance resulting in an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate, which could materially impact our results of operations. 
 For tax positions we have taken or expect to take in our tax return, we apply a more likely than not threshold, under which we must conclude a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, assuming that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information, in order to recognize or continue to recognize the benefit. In determining our provision for income taxes, we use judgment, reflecting our estimates and assumptions, in applying the more likely than not threshold. 

RECENTLY ADOPTED AND NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
 For a detailed description of recently adopted and new accounting pronouncements see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part IV of this report. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
 There were no off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons in 2022, 2021 and 2020 that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We use various financial instruments, including interest swap contracts, to reduce the interest rate risk related to our debt. We also use foreign currency forwards to manage and reduce the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign currency denominated receivables and payables, forecasted royalties, forecasted earnings and cash flows of foreign subsidiaries and other transactions. 
 We are exclusively an end user of these instruments, which are commonly referred to as derivatives. We do not engage in trading, market making or other speculative activities in the derivatives markets. More detailed information about these financial instruments is provided in Note 14 - Fair Value to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part IV of this report. Our principal market exposures are interest and currency exchange rate risks. 
 We assess our exposures to changes in interest rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis measures the potential impact in earnings, fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical 10 change (increase and decrease) in interest rates. Our variable-rate borrowings, which include our term loan, a portion of which has been swapped to a fixed interest rate, and any borrowings we make under our revolving credit facility, expose us to risks caused by fluctuations in the applicable interest rates. The total outstanding balance of such variable-rate borrowings, net of swaps, was 444 million as of December 31, 2022. A hypothetical 10 change in our effective weighted average interest rate on our variable-rate borrowings would result in a 2 million increase or decrease to our annual long-term debt interest expense, and a one-point change in the underlying interest rates would result in approximately a 4 million increase or decrease in our annual interest expense. 
 The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their carrying values due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. 
 We have foreign currency rate exposure to exchange rate fluctuations worldwide, particularly with respect to the Canadian Dollar, the Chinese Yuan, the Euro, the Brazilian Real and the Argentine Peso. We anticipate that such foreign currency exchange rate risk will remain a market risk exposure for the foreseeable future. 
 We use a current market pricing model to assess the changes in the value of our foreign currency derivatives used by us to hedge underlying exposure that primarily consists of our non-functional-currency current assets and liabilities. The primary assumption used in these models is a hypothetical 10 weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar against all our currency exposures as of December 31, 2022. The gains and losses on the hedging instruments are largely offset by the gains and losses on the underlying assets, liabilities or expected cash flows. As of December 31, 2022, the absolute notional amount of our outstanding foreign exchange hedging instruments was 182 million. We have determined through such analyses, that a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates would have resulted in approximately an 11 million increase or 
 41 

Table of Contents 

 decrease to the fair value of our outstanding forward foreign currency exchange contracts, which would generally be offset by an opposite effect on the underlying exposure being economically hedged. 
 Argentina is considered to be a highly inflationary economy. As of December 31, 2022, we had total net assets of 2 million in Argentina. 
 Our total market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors including the volatility present within the markets and the liquidity of the markets. There are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented. While probably the most meaningful analysis, these shock tests are constrained by several factors, including the necessity to conduct the analysis based on a single point in time and the inability to include the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 
 Wyndham Hotels Resorts, Inc. 
 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Wyndham Hotels Resorts, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income (loss), comprehensive income (loss), equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 
 In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 
 
 Basis for Opinions 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

 Deferred Revenues and Liability Wyndham Rewards Loyalty Program Refer to Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 The Company operates the Wyndham Rewards loyalty program under which members earn points that can be redeemed for free nights or other rewards. Wyndham Rewards members primarily accumulate points by staying at a participating hotel, club resort, or vacation rental or by making purchases with their Wyndham Rewards co-branded credit card. Revenues related to the issuance of loyalty points are recognized net of redemptions over time based upon loyalty point redemption patterns, including an estimate of loyalty points that will expire or will never be redeemed. In addition, the Company records a liability for estimated future redemption costs of outstanding loyalty points. 
 
 The Company estimates the value of the deferred revenues and related liability (collectively referred to as the liability related to the loyalty program based on (i) an estimated cost per point and (ii) an estimated redemption rate of the overall points earned, which is determined with the assistance of a third-party actuarial firm through historical experience, current trends and the use of an actuarial analysis, and includes an estimate of the points that will expire or will never be redeemed. Changes in the estimated cost per point and/or the estimated redemption rate used in the determination of the liability could result in a material change to the amount of liability reported. 
 
 We identified the estimated cost per point and the estimated redemption rate used in the determination of the liability as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management to estimate the cost per point and the redemption rate. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the involvement of our actuarial specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management s estimates and assumptions related to the selection of the estimated cost per point and the estimated redemption rate. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 
 Our audit procedures related to the estimated cost per point and estimated redemption rate used in the determination of the liability included the following, among others: 
 
 We tested the effectiveness of the controls related to the liability, including those over the estimate of the cost per point and the estimate of the redemption rate. 
 
 We evaluated the assumptions used by management to estimate the cost per point by: 
 Testing the underlying data that served as the inputs for the historical cost per point, including historical redemptions. 
 Discussing with management the assumptions used in the Company s estimated future cost per point and evaluating the reasonableness by comparing the projections to (1) forecasted information included in industry reports, and (2) trends in Wyndham Rewards member behavior. 
 Comparing management s prior-year estimated cost per point to actual redemptions during the current year to identify potential bias in the determination of the liability. 
 Evaluating whether the assumptions used by management to estimate the cost per point were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. 
 
 We evaluated the assumptions used by management to estimate the redemption rate by: 
 Testing the underlying data that served as the inputs for the actuarial analysis of the estimated redemption rate, including earnings and redemptions. 
 Evaluating whether any approved changes to the Wyndham Rewards loyalty program have been appropriately considered in the actuarial analysis of the estimated redemption rate. 
 Comparing management s prior-year estimated redemption rate to actual redemptions during the current year to identify potential bias in the determination of the liability. 
 
 With the assistance of our actuarial specialists, we developed a range of independent estimates of the liability, utilizing the same underlying data tested above, and compared our estimates to management s estimates.

 The Company s franchise agreements also require the payment of marketing and reservation fees, which are intended to reimburse the Company for expenses associated with operating an international, centralized reservation system, e-commerce channels such as the Company s brand.com websites, as well as access to third-party distribution channels, such as online travel agents, advertising and marketing programs, global sales efforts, operations support, training and other related services. Marketing and reservation fees are recognized as revenue when the underlying sales occur. Although the Company is generally contractually obligated to spend the marketing and reservation fees it collects from franchisees, in accordance with the franchise agreements, marketing and reservations costs are expensed as incurred. 
 The Company earns revenues from its Wyndham Rewards loyalty program when a member stays at a participating hotel, club resort or vacation rental. These revenues are derived from a fee the Company charges a franchised or managed hotel based upon a percentage of room revenues generated from a Wyndham Rewards member s stay. These fees are to reimburse the Company for expenses associated with member redemptions and activities that are related to the administering and marketing of the program. Revenues related to the loyalty program represent variable consideration and are recognized net of redemptions over time based upon loyalty point redemption patterns, which include an estimate of loyalty points that will expire or will never be redeemed. 
 As a result of the negative impact that COVID-19 had on travel demand in 2020, the Company s assumptions related to redemptions, including estimated member redemption rate, member redemption pattern, and the estimated cost to satisfy such redemptions, changed. Accordingly, the Company recognized a million cumulative adjustment, which resulted in an increase to loyalty revenues during the second quarter of 2020. Such increase was included within marketing, reservation and loyalty and other revenues on the Consolidated Statement of Income/(Loss) for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
 The Company earns revenue from its Wyndham Rewards co-branded credit card program, which is primarily generated by cardholder spending and the enrollment of new cardholders. The advance payments received under the program are recognized as a contract liability. The program primarily contains two performance obligations: (i) brand performance

 to years. The Company s management fees are comprised of base fees, which are typically a specified percentage of gross revenues from hotel operations, and, in some cases, incentive fees, which are typically a specified percentage of a hotel s gross operating profit. The base fees are recognized when the underlying sales occur and the management services are performed. Incentive fees are recognized when determinable, which is when the Company has met hotel operating performance metrics and the Company has determined that a significant reversal of revenues recognized will not occur. 
 The Company also recognizes reimbursable payroll costs for operational employees and other reimbursable costs at certain of the Company s managed hotels as revenue. Although these costs are funded by hotel owners, accounting guidance requires the Company to report these fees on a gross basis as both revenues and expenses. Additionally, the Company recognizes occupancy taxes on a net basis. 
 The Company recognizes license and other revenues from Wyndham Worldwide former Parent ), now known as Travel + Leisure Co., for use of the Wyndham trademark and certain other trademarks. 
 In addition, the Company earned revenues from its previously owned hotels (sold in 2022), which consisted primarily of (i) gross room rentals, (ii) food and beverage services and (iii) on-site spa, casino, golf and shop revenues. These revenues were recognized upon the completion of services. 
 Deferred Revenues 
 Deferred revenues, or contract liabilities, generally represent payments or consideration received in advance for goods or services that the Company has not yet provided to the customer. 
 Deferred loyalty program revenues 
 Deferred other revenues 
 Total 

Deferred initial franchise fees represent payments received in advance from prospective franchisees upon the signing of a franchise agreement and are generally recognized to revenue within years.

million (net of a million income tax benefit) cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings at January 1, 2020. Since adoption, the Company measures the expected credit losses of its receivables on a collective (pool) basis which aggregates receivables with similar risk characteristics and uses historical collection attrition rates for periods ranging from seven to to estimate its expected credit losses. As such, the Company measures the expected credit losses of its receivables by segment and geographical area. Beginning January 1, 2020, the Company provides an estimate of expected credit losses for its receivables immediately upon origination or acquisition and may adjust this estimate in subsequent reporting periods as required. When the Company determines that an account is not collectible, the account is written-off to the allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company also considers whether the historical economic conditions are comparable to current economic conditions. If current or expected future conditions differ from the conditions in effect when the historical experience was generated, the Company would adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected effects of the current environment on the collectability of the Company s trade receivables which may be material.

In the event the Company determines not to continue to assert that all or part of its undistributed foreign earnings are permanently reinvested, such a determination in the future could result in the accrual and payment of additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. taxes on currency transaction gains and losses, the determination of which is not practicable due to the complexities associated with the hypothetical calculation.

 The gross amount of the unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the Company s effective tax rate was million, million and million as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company recorded both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of provision for/(benefit from) income taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss). The amount of potential penalties and interest related to these unrecognized tax benefits recorded in the provision for income taxes was during 2022 and 2021 and a benefit of million during 2020. The Company had a liability for potential penalties of million as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, and potential interest of million as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Such liabilities are reported as a component of accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company does not expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next 12 months. 
 The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal and state jurisdictions, as well as in foreign jurisdictions. With certain exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to federal income tax examinations for years prior to 2019. The 2017 through 2021 tax years generally remain subject to examination by many state tax authorities. In significant foreign jurisdictions, the 2015 through the 2021 tax years generally remain subject to examination by their respective tax authorities. The statute of limitations is scheduled to expire within 12 months of the reporting date in certain taxing jurisdictions, and the Company therefore believes that it is reasonably possible that the total amount of its unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by million to million. 
 The Company made cash income tax payments, net of refunds, of million during 2022 and million during 2021. The Company received income tax refunds, net of payments, of million during 2020. Additionally, the Company had million and million of income tax receivables as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which was reported within other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 DESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK

Document 

Exhibit 4.9 
 
 WYNDHAM HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. 
 
 The following summary describes the common stock, par value 0.01 per share, of Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc. Wyndham Hotels, our company, we, us, and our ), which are the only securities of Wyndham Hotels registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 
 
 The following description is a summary and does not purport to be complete. It is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, our certificate of incorporation (our certificate of incorporation and our by-laws (our by-laws ), each of which is incorporated by reference as an exhibit to our Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this Exhibit 4.9 is a part. In addition, you should refer to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the DGCL ), which may also affect the terms of our capital stock. 
 
 Authorized Capital Stock 
 
 We are authorized to issue a total of 606 million shares of capital stock consisting of (i) 600 million shares of common stock, par value 0.01 per share, and (ii) 6 million shares of preferred stock, par value 0.01 per share. 
 
 Common Stock 
 
 Dividends. Subject to prior dividend rights of the holders of any preferred shares, holders of shares of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors out of funds legally available for that purpose. We are incorporated in Delaware and are governed by Delaware law. Delaware law allows a corporation to pay dividends only out of surplus, as determined under Delaware law, or, if no such surplus exists, out of the corporation's net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and or the preceding fiscal year (provided that such payment will not reduce capital below the amount of capital represented by all classes of shares having a preference upon the distribution of assets). 
 
 Voting Rights. Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. Holders of shares of our common stock do not have cumulative voting rights. In other words, a holder of a single share of common stock cannot cast more than one vote for each position to be filled on our Board of Directors. A consequence of not having cumulative voting rights is that the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in the election of Directors can elect all Directors standing for election, which means that the holders of the remaining shares will not be able to elect any Directors. 
 
 Liquidation Rights. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our company, after the satisfaction in full of the liquidation preferences of holders of any preferred shares, holders of shares of our common stock are entitled to ratable distribution of the remaining assets available for distribution to stockholders. The shares of our common stock are not subject to redemption by operation of a sinking fund or otherwise. Holders of shares of our common stock are not currently entitled to pre-emptive rights. 
 
 Fully Paid. All of our outstanding shares of common stock are fully paid and nonassessable. The holders of our common stock have no preemptive rights and no rights to convert their common stock into any other securities, and our common stock is not subject to any redemption or sinking fund provisions. 
 
 Preferred Stock 
 
 We are authorized to issue up to 6 million shares of preferred stock, par value 0.01 per share. 
 
 Our Board of Directors, without further action by the holders of our common stock, may issue shares of our preferred stock. Our Board of Directors is vested with the authority to fix by resolution the designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and such qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, including, without limitation, redemption rights, dividend rights, liquidation preference and conversion or exchange rights of any class or series of preferred stock, and to fix the number of classes or series of preferred stock, the number of shares constituting any such class or series and the voting powers for each class or series. 
 
 The authority possessed by our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock could potentially be used to discourage attempts by third-parties to obtain control of our company through a merger, tender offer, proxy contest 

or otherwise by making such attempts more difficult or more costly. Our Board of Directors may issue preferred stock with voting rights or conversion rights that, if exercised, could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of common stock. There are no current agreements or understandings with respect to the issuance of preferred stock and our Board of Directors has no present intention to issue any shares of preferred stock. 
 
 Anti-Takeover Effects of Our Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws and Delaware Law 
 
 Our certificate of incorporation, our by-laws and Delaware statutory law contain provisions that may impact the prospect of an acquisition of our company by means of a tender offer or a proxy contest. These provisions may discourage coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids. We believe that the benefits of such increased protection would give us the potential ability to negotiate with the proponent of an unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure us and outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging those proposals because negotiation of the proposals could result in an improvement of their terms. 
 
 Election and Removal of Directors 
 
 Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions that establish specific procedures for appointing and removing members of our board of directors. As of the 2021 annual meeting of stockholders, our board of directors is no longer classified under Section 141(d) of the Delaware General Corporation Law and Directors are no longer divided into three classes and may be removed with or without cause. 
 
 Under our certificate of incorporation and a by-laws, each Director is elected to serve a term of one year, with each Director s term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders next following such Director s election. Newly created directorships resulting from any increase in our authorized number of Directors will be filled by a majority of our Board of Directors then in office, provided that a majority of our entire Board of Directors, or a quorum, is present, and any vacancies in our Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office or other cause will be filled generally by the majority vote of our remaining Directors in office, even if less than a quorum is present. In the case of an uncontested Director election at which a quorum is present, the election will be determined by a majority of the votes cast by the stockholders entitled to vote therein, with any Directors not receiving a majority of the votes cast required to tender their resignations following the certification of the stockholder vote. The Corporate Governance Committee will promptly consider the tendered resignation and will recommend to the Board of Directors whether to accept the tendered resignation or to take some other action, such as rejecting the tendered resignation and addressing the apparent underlying causes of the withheld votes. In making this recommendation, the Corporate Governance Committee will consider all factors deemed relevant by its members. In the case of a contested election, the election will be determined by a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders entitled to vote in the election. 
 
 Size of Board 
 
 Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws provide that our Board of Directors may consist of no less than three and no more than 15 Directors. The number of Directors on our Board of Directors will be fixed exclusively by our Board of Directors, subject to the minimum and maximum number permitted by our certificate of incorporation and by-laws. 
 
 Elimination of Stockholder Action by Written Consent 
 
 Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws expressly eliminate the right of our stockholders to act by written consent. Stockholder action must take place at the annual or a special meeting of our stockholders. 
 
 Stockholder Meetings 
 
 Under our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, only the chairman of our Board of Directors or our chief executive officer will be able to call special meetings of our stockholders. 
 
 Requirements for Advance Notification of Stockholder Nominations and Proposals 
 
 Our by-laws establish advance notice procedures with respect to stockholder proposals and nomination of candidates for election as Directors other than nominations made by or at the direction of our Board of Directors or a committee of our Board of Directors. 
 2 

Delaware Anti-takeover Law 
 
 We are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, an anti-takeover law. In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date such person becomes an interested stockholder, unless the business combination or the transaction in which such person becomes an interested stockholder is approved in a prescribed manner. Generally, a business combination includes a merger, asset or stock sale, or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Generally, an interested stockholder is a person that, together with affiliates and associates, owns, or within three years prior to the determination of interested stockholder status did own, 15 or more of a corporation's voting stock. The existence of this provision may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our Board of Directors and the anti-takeover effect includes discouraging attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of our common stock. 
 
 Access to Proxy 
 
 Our by-laws provide for proxy access that allows a stockholder, or a group of up to twenty stockholders, owning at least three percent of our outstanding stock continuously for at least three years, to nominate and include in our annual meeting proxy materials director nominees constituting up to the greater of two directors or twenty percent of the Board of Directors, provided that the stockholders and director nominees satisfy the disclosure and procedural requirements specified in the by-laws. 
 
 No Cumulative Voting 
 
 Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws do not provide for cumulative voting in the election of Directors. 
 
 Undesignated Preferred Stock 
 
 The authorization in our certificate of incorporation of undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our Board of Directors to issue our preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to change control of us. The provision in our certificate of incorporation authorizing such preferred stock may have the effect of deferring hostile takeovers or delaying changes of control of our management. 
 
 Amendments to Our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws 
 
 The DGCL provides generally that the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding stock entitled to vote on amendments to a corporation's certificate of incorporation or bylaws is required to approve such amendment, unless a corporation's certificate of incorporation or bylaws, as the case may be, requires a greater percentage. Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws provide that the by-laws may be amended, altered, changed or repealed by a majority vote of our Board of Directors, provided that, in addition to any other vote otherwise required by law, our by-laws may also be amended, altered, changed or repealed by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the voting power of our outstanding shares of capital stock. 
 
 Exclusive Jurisdiction of Certain Actions 
 
 Our by-laws require, to the fullest extent permitted by law that derivative actions brought in the name of Wyndham Hotels, actions against Directors, officers and employees for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar actions may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware. Although we believe this provision benefits Wyndham Hotels by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law in the types of lawsuits to which it applies, the provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our Directors and officers. Our by-laws also provide that the U.S. federal district courts shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of claims under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 
 
 Limitations on Liability of Directors and Indemnification of Directors and Officers 
 
 Section 145 of the DGCL provides that a corporation may indemnify directors and officers as well as other employees and individuals against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any threatened, pending or completed actions, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, in which such person is made a party by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation a derivative action ), if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably 
 3 

believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person's conduct was unlawful. A similar standard is applicable in the case of derivative actions, except that indemnification extends only to expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with the defense or settlement of such action, and the statute requires court approval before there can be any indemnification where the person seeking indemnification has been found liable to the corporation. The statute provides that it is not exclusive of other indemnification that may be granted by a corporation's by-laws, disinterested director vote, stockholder vote, agreement or otherwise. 
 
 Our certificate of incorporation provides that no Director shall be liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a Director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation on liability is not permitted under the DGCL, as now in effect or as amended. Currently, Section 102(b)(7) of the DGCL requires that liability be imposed for the following 
 
 any breach of the Director's duty of loyalty to our company or our stockholders 
 any act or omission not in good faith or which involved intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law 
 unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions as provided in Section 174 of the DGCL and 
 any transaction from which the Director derived an improper personal benefit. 
 
 Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws provide that, to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by the DGCL, as now in effect or as amended, we will indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding by reason of the fact that such person is or was our Director or officer, or by reason of the fact that our Director or officer is or was serving, at our request, as a Director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans maintained or sponsored by us. We will indemnify such persons against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to our best interests and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reason to believe such person's conduct was unlawful. A similar standard is applicable in the case of derivative actions, except that indemnification extends only to expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with the defense or settlement of such actions, and court approval is required before there can be any indemnification where the person seeking indemnification has been found liable to us. Any amendment of this provision will not reduce our indemnification obligations relating to actions taken before an amendment. 
 
 We insure our Directors and officers and those of our subsidiaries against certain liabilities they may incur in their capacities as Directors and officers. Under these policies, the insurer, on our behalf, may also pay amounts for which we have granted indemnification to the Directors or officers.

Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1833(b), Executive will not be held criminally or civilly liable under any Federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret of the Company or its affiliates that (i) is made (x) in confidence to a Federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to Executive s attorney and (y) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law or (ii) is made in a complaint or other document that is filed under seal in a lawsuit or other proceeding. If Executive files a lawsuit for retaliation by the Company for reporting a suspected violation of law, Executive may disclose the trade secret to Executive s attorney and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if Executive files any document containing the trade secret 

under seal, and does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order. Nothing in this Release or any other agreement between the Company and Executive or any other policies of the Company or its affiliates is intended to conflict with 18 U.S.C. 1833(b) or create liability for disclosures of trade secrets that are expressly allowed by such section. 
 
 7. No Admission of Wrongdoing . Neither this Release, nor the furnishing of the consideration for this Release, shall be deemed or construed at any time to be an admission by the parties or any of the Released Parties of any improper or unlawful conduct, all of which is denied. 
 
 8. Third-Party Beneficiaries . Executive acknowledges and agrees that all Released Parties are third-party beneficiaries of this Release and have the right to enforce this Release. 
 
 9. Amendments and Waivers . No amendment to or waiver of this Release or any of its terms will be binding unless consented to in writing by Executive and an authorized representative of the Company. No waiver by any Released Party of a breach of any provision of this Release, or of compliance with any condition or provision of this Release to be performed by Executive, will operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach with respect to any other Released Party or any similar or dissimilar provision or condition at the same or any subsequent time. The failure of any Released Party to take any action by reason of any breach will not deprive any other Released Party of the right to take action at any time. 
 
 10. Governing Law Jury Waiver . This Release shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New Jersey, without regard to the application of any choice-of-law rules that would result in the application of another state s laws. Subject to Section 13 below, Executive irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of, and exclusive venue in, the state and federal courts in New Jersey with respect to any matters pertaining to, or arising from, this Release. UNLESS OTHERWISE PROHIBITED BY LAW, EXECUTIVE EXPRESSLY, KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO OR ARISING IN ANY WAY FROM THIS RELEASE OR THE MATTERS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. 
 
 11. Savings Clause . If any term or provision of this Release is invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this Release or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision of this Release is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, this Release shall be enforceable as closely as possible to its intent of providing the Released Parties with a full release of all legally releasable claims through the date upon which Executive signs this Release. 
 
 12. Continuing Obligations . Executive s post-termination obligations set forth in the Agreement and Separation Agreement, as well as Executive s obligations set forth in the Agreement and Separation Agreement, are incorporated herein by reference (the Continuing Obligations ). If Executive breaches the Continuing Obligations, all amounts and benefits payable under this Release shall cease and, upon request, Executive shall immediately repay to 

the Company any and all amounts already paid pursuant to this Release. If any one or more of the Continuing Obligations shall be held by an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction to be excessively broad as to duration, geography, scope, activity or subject, such provisions shall be construed by limiting and reducing them so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent allowed by applicable law. 
 
 13. Arbitration . Appendix A of the Agreement is incorporated herein by reference and such terms and conditions shall apply to any disputes under the Agreement, the Separation Agreement and under this Release. 
 
 14. Continuing Cooperation . Executive agrees, in addition to obligations set forth in this Release, the Agreement and the Separation Agreement to which this Release is attached, to cooperate and make himself available to the Company or any of its successors (including any past or future subsidiary of the Company), any of the Released Parties, or its or their General Counsel, as the Company may reasonably request, to assist in any matter, including giving truthful testimony in any litigation or potential litigation, over which Executive may have knowledge, information or expertise. Executive shall be reimbursed, to the extent permitted by law, any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses associated with such cooperation, provided those expenses are pre-approved by the Company (or Released Party, as applicable) prior to the Executive incurring them. Executive acknowledges that his agreement to this provision is a material inducement to the Company to enter into the Separation Agreement and pay the consideration described therein. 
 
 15. Business Expenses . As of the date upon which Executive executes this Release, Executive confirms that any business-related expenses for which he seeks or will seek reimbursement have been, or will be, documented and submitted to the Company within 10 business days after the Termination Date. Furthermore, Executive represents that any amounts owed by him to the Company have been paid. In the event Executive has been reimbursed for business expenses, but has failed to pay any Company-issued charge card or credit card bill related to such reimbursed expenses, Executive shall promptly pay any such amounts within 7 days after any request by the Company and, in addition, the Company has the right and is hereby authorized to deduct the amount of any unpaid charge card or credit card bill from the severance payments or otherwise suspend payments or other benefits in an amount equal to the unpaid business expenses without being in breach of the Separation Agreement. 
 
 16. Entire Agreement . Except as expressly set forth herein, Executive acknowledges and agrees that this Release and the Separation Agreement to which this Release is attached constitutes the complete and entire agreement and understanding between the Company and Executive with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes in its entirety any and all prior understandings, commitments, obligations and or agreements, whether written or oral, with respect thereto it being understood and agreed that this Release, and the Separation Agreement to which this Release is attached, including the mutual covenants, agreements, acknowledgments and affirmations contained herein and therein, is intended to constitute a complete settlement and resolution of all matters set forth in Section 1 hereof. Executive 

represents that, in executing this Release, Executive has not relied upon any representation or statement made by any of the Released Parties, other than those set forth in this Release and the Separation Agreement to which this Release is attached, with regard to the subject matter, basis, or effect of this Release. 
 
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Executive has executed this Release as of the below-indicated date(s).
