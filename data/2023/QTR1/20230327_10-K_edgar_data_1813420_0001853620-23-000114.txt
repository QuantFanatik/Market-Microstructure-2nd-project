The
Indenture Trustee has provided the information contained in the following five paragraphs for purposes of compliance with Regulation
AB: 

U.S.
Bank National Association U.S. Bank and other large financial institutions have been sued in their capacity as
trustee or successor trustee for certain residential mortgage backed securities RMBS trusts. The complaints, primarily
filed by investors or investor groups against U.S. Bank and similar institutions, allege the trustees caused losses to investors
as a result of alleged failures by the sponsors, mortgage loan sellers and servicers to comply with the governing agreements for
these RMBS trusts. Plaintiffs generally assert causes of action based upon the trustees purported failures to enforce repurchase
obligations of mortgage loan sellers for alleged breaches of representations and warranties, notify securityholders of purported
events of default allegedly caused by breaches of servicing standards by mortgage loan servicers and abide by a heightened standard
of care following alleged events of default. 

U.S.
Bank denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions
were not the cause of losses to investors, that it has meritorious defenses, and it has contested and intends to continue contesting
the plaintiffs claims vigorously. However, U.S. Bank cannot assure you as to the outcome of any of the litigation, or the
possible impact of these litigations on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. 

On
March 9, 2018, a law firm purporting to represent fifteen Delaware statutory trusts (the DSTs that issued securities
backed by student loans (the Student Loans filed a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery against U.S. Bank
National Association U.S. Bank in its capacities as indenture trustee and successor special servicer, and three
other institutions in their respective transaction capacities, with respect to the DSTs and the Student Loans. This lawsuit is
captioned The National Collegiate Student Loan Master Trust I, et al. v. U.S. Bank National Association, et al., C.A. No. 2018-0167-JRS
(Del. Ch.) (the NCMSLT Action ). The complaint, as amended on June 15, 2018, alleged that the DSTs have been harmed
as a result of purported misconduct or omissions by the defendants concerning administration of the trusts and special servicing
of the Student Loans. Since the filing of the NCMSLT Action, certain Student Loan borrowers have made assertions against U.S.
Bank concerning special servicing that appear to be based on certain allegations made on behalf of the DSTs in the NCMSLT Action. 

U.S.
Bank has filed a motion seeking dismissal of the operative complaint in its entirety with prejudice pursuant to Chancery Court
Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) or, in the alternative, a stay of the case while other prior filed disputes involving the DSTs and
the Student Loans are litigated. On November 7, 2018, the Court ruled that the case should be stayed in its entirety pending resolution
of the first-filed cases. On January 21, 2020, the Court entered an order consolidating for pretrial purposes the NCMSLT Action
and three other lawsuits pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery concerning the DSTs and the Student Loans, which remains pending. 

U.S.
Bank denies liability in the NCMSLT Action and believes it has performed its obligations as indenture trustee and special servicer
in good faith and in compliance in all material respects with the terms of the agreements governing the DSTs and that it has meritorious
defenses. It has contested and intends to continue contesting the plaintiffs claims vigorously.

required by Item 1119 of Regulation AB has been omitted from this report on Form 10-K in reliance on the Instruction to Item 1119.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

Board of Directors 

Mercedes-Benz Financial Services USA LLC 

We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Assessment of Compliance with SEC Regulation AB Servicing Criteria Management s Report ), that Mercedes-Benz Financial Services USA LLC s MBFS USA LLC or the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the United States Consumer Automotive Retail Installment Sale Contracts (the Platform as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, excluding criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(v), 1122(d)(2)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii), 1122(d)(4)(xiii) and (1122(d)(4)(xv) , which management has determined are not applicable to the activities performed by the Company with respect to the Platform. The Platform consists of the asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management in Appendix A of Management s Report. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria for the Platform based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria for the Platform and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing selected asset-backed transactions and securities constituting the Platform and evaluating whether the Company performed servicing activities related to those transactions and securities in compliance with the applicable servicing criteria for the period covered by this report. Accordingly, our testing may not have included servicing activities related to each asset-backed transaction or security constituting the Platform. Further, our examination was not designed to detect material noncompliance that may have occurred prior to the period covered by this report and that may have affected the Company s servicing activities during the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. 

We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to the engagement.

As described in Management s Report, the Company engaged various vendors to perform servicing activities with respect to criteria 1122(d)(2)(i),1122(d)(4)(i), 1122 (d)(4)(ii), and 1122(d)(4)(viii). The Company determined that each vendor is not considered a servicer, as that term is defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and therefore, the Company is assuming responsibility for compliance with such servicing criteria applicable to each vendor s servicing activities. In accordance with Regulation AB and its related interpretations, the requirement for management to assess compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to a vendor s activities is satisfied if the Company has instituted policies and procedures to monitor whether such vendor s activities comply in all material respects with such criteria. Compliance with the applicable servicing criteria is achieved if those policies and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that such vendor s activities comply with such criteria and those policies and procedures are operating effectively for the period covered by Management s Report. Our examination does not provide a legal determination of whether a vendor is or is not considered a servicer, and therefore, on whether the Company, in its Management Report, is eligible to elect to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor s servicing activities. 

In our opinion, management s assertion that Mercedes-Benz Financial Services USA LLC complied with the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 for the United States Consumer Automotive Retail Installment Sale Contracts Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

The
Board of Directors 

 U.S.
Bank National Association 

We
have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Report on Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing
Criteria, that U.S. Bank National Association and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association (collectively, the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB
for the U.S. Bank Corporate Trust Asset-Backed Securities Platform (the Platform ), for which the Company provides
trustee, securities administration, registrar and paying agent services, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, except
for servicing criteria Items 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(4)(i)-(ii), and 1122(d)(4)(iv)-(xiv), which the Company has determined are
not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the servicing platform covered by this report. Management is responsible
for the Company s compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s
assertion about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence
about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than all of the individual asset-backed transactions
and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining
whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing
criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company
during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either
prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during
the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. Although the Company is responsible
for assessing compliance with Items 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(v), and 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB, there were no servicing
activities performed by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2022 that required these servicing criteria to be complied
with. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

We
are required to be independent of the Company and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant
ethical requirements related to our examination engagement. 

Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 

In
our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2022, for the U.S. Bank Corporate Trust Asset-Backed Securities Platform is fairly stated, in all material
respects.
