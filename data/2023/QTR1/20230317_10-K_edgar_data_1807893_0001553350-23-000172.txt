Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 for the Quarterly Report on

PART I 

ITEM 1. 
 BUSINESS 

Overview 

We were incorporated in the State
of Florida in 1991 under the name Standard Premium Finance Management Corporation. In 2016 we established a holding company structure
under the name Standard Premium Finance Holdings, Inc., a Florida corporation, with Standard Premium Finance Management Corporation as
our wholly-owned subsidiary. Unless the context requires otherwise or unless stated otherwise, references in this registration statement
to the Company, Standard Premium, we, our and us refer to Standard
Premium Finance Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Standard Premium Finance Management Corporation, on a consolidated basis. 

We are a specialized finance company
that makes collateralized loans to businesses and individuals to finance the insurance premiums they pay on their commercial property
and casualty insurance policies. We began our business in 1991 and currently operate in seventeen states. We have developed relationships
with insurance agents and brokers located in our market area who offer insurance premium loans as a service to their customers which we
underwrite. We evaluate each insurance premium loan application according to our loan underwriting criteria. Upon our approval of an insurance
premium loan, the borrower makes a down payment, generally 20 to 25 of the annual premium on the financed insurance policy, and we provide
the balance of the annual premium required to purchase the policy. The borrower pays us a fixed monthly amount over the next nine (9)
to ten (10) months. In the event the borrower defaults in its loan payment obligation, we are contractually authorized to terminate the
insurance policy and receive the amount of the unearned premium paid on the insurance policy. The unearned premium on the insurance policy
represents the portion of the insurance premium subject to return if the policy is cancelled before the full term of the policy is completed.
The unearned premium serves as the collateral for our insurance premium loans and are designed to fully pay off the balance of the insurance
premium loan in the event of a default. We have the contractual right to cancel the insurance policy and receive the amount of the unearned
premium if the borrower defaults on repayment of any loan payment to us. Because of this collateral security feature of our insurance
premium loans, we consider our loans to be of high quality and low risk. Standard Premium commenced operations in 1991 for the specific
purpose of providing financing for property and casualty insurance premiums. Standard Premium: 

maintains current state licenses to operate a premium
finance company, 

meets or exceeds all statutory net worth requirements,

maintains professional liability insurance with an
A rated major insurance carrier with limits of 500,000, in compliance with all state requirements, 

has secured and maintained computer hardware and
licensed software to conduct its business in a timely fashion, 

has a revolving senior credit line and long-term
debt in the form of subordinated corporate notes to help finance its loan production, 

has secured a long-term lease on office space which
it currently occupies, and which is sufficient to meet future needs, 

has developed a set of working procedures by which
it operates, 

generates daily management control reports, 

has cultivated and maintained relationships with
various independent insurance agents providing the source of all new and renewal business, and 

currently finances approximately 80 million dollars
in insurance premiums annually. 

The Property and Casualty
Insurance Premium Finance Market 

Commercial insurance performs a
critical role in the world economy. Without it, the economy could not function. Insurers essentially protect the economic system from
failure by assuming the risks inherent in the production of goods and services. All businesses share a need for insurance: Without the
right insurance coverage, each could be wiped out by a disaster or a lawsuit. The Insurance Information Institute
reported that 359.6 billion of commercial lines insurance premiums were generated in the U.S. in 2021. 

The insurance premium finance industry
began in Pennsylvania in 1933 and has grown along with the U.S. economy. It is estimated that approximately 15 of the 360 billion U.S.
commercial property and casualty premiums were financed in 2021, generating 54 billion of insurance premium finance loans. 

There are several reasons that an
insurance policy buyer would choose to finance its insurance premiums. Financing an insurance premium is much like any other commercial
or consumer purchase. It is financed based on the insured s decision resulting from current economic trends and other considerations.
For some customers, insurance premium financing is a convenient way to buy insurance without tying up working capital or accessing other
credit sources. Other customers, who do not have the means to pay the premium in full at the time of purchase, consider premium financing
a necessity. When customers finance insurance policies, they enter into a contract with the insurance premium finance company to obtain
a loan. The contract assigns the borrower s rights to all unearned premiums and dividends on the policy to the insurance premium
finance company and appoints the insurance premium finance company as its attorney in fact. The power of attorney signed
by the borrower gives the insurance premium finance company the right to cancel the insurance policy in the event of non-payment of a
loan installment and to receive all unearned premiums and credits from the insurance company. The customer, upon executing the premium
financing loan contract, makes the initial down payment and agrees to pay back the principal with interest in monthly payments. The unearned
premium of the insurance policy provides the collateral for each loan.

Our Loan Referral Base 

The bulk of our insurance premium
loans are originated through insurance agents and brokers who recommend our insurance premium loan program to their clients who would
like to finance their insurance premiums. We currently market our loans through more than 850 independent insurance brokers and agents
located in seventeen states. For risk management purposes, we have a policy of limiting the amount of loans
to the customers of any one insurance broker or agent to 5 of our outstanding loan portfolio. We may change this policy at any time based
on then-existing market conditions or otherwise, at the discretion of our CEO. 

Our website includes a portal for
our brokers and agents, which allows them to quote premiums and print drafts and finance agreements online. The drafts and agreements
are forwarded to us for loan underwriting, risk management and approval. Our brokers and agents do not have the authority to bind us to
making a loan. 

We compensate the insurance brokers
and agents for their loan origination service through commissions which are authorized and regulated by the states in which we do business.
The commission paid is generally tied to the gross revenue that the loan generates. For example, rates are determined by the size of the
loan, and, to a certain degree, the rating of the insurance company as well as the creditworthiness of the borrower. Further, the higher
the interest rate the loan generates, the higher the commission to the broker. In addition, the Company offers a rewards program (where
permitted by State Law) for our insurance brokers and agents. Under the rewards program, points are earned based on amount of financed
premiums. These points are then redeemable for travel and merchandise. The rewards program is equivalent to 1/10 th of one percent
(.001) of the amount financed and is in addition to payment of commissions. 

We do not have any exclusive or
long-term arrangements with the insurance agents and brokers that make up our referral base and they have other sources of premium financing
at their disposal. We have no contractual relationship with the insurance agents and brokers requiring them to recommend us to their clients.
However, in connection with each premium loan we make, the borrower s agent or broker: 

Certifies that the policies
being financed have been issued and delivered and that the required down payment has been paid by or on behalf of the insured; 

Warrants that the premium finance
agreement evidences a bona fide and legal transaction and that the insured is of legal age and has capacity to contract; 

Warrants that the insured s
signature is genuine and that the agent or broker has delivered a copy of the premium finance agreement to the insured; 

States that the financed policies
do not contain an audit or reporting form; 

Acknowledges that it is not
affiliated in any capacity or manner with us; and 

Agrees that in the event of
cancellation the financed policy to remit the gross unearned commissions or unearned premiums to us upon request. 

In the property and casualty insurance
industry, some insurance policies contain provisions for audits or other additional reporting. These provisions may allow the insurance
company to evaluate (audit) the insurance premium after cancellation. Such provisions may delay or reduce the amount of unearned premium.
Since the unearned premium represents the collateral in our loan, this would have a detrimental effect on us. It is Company policy to
avoid financing these types of policies. 

Employees 

As
of December 31, 2022, we had 23 employees, 21 of whom were full-time employees. Our full-time employees are covered by a corporate benefit
plan for major medical and hospitalization. None of our employees are members of a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
All of our employees are at will with no guaranteed period of employment, with the exception of our Vice President of Technology,
who has a fixed contract of employment until February 28, 2023. We believe our employee relations are satisfactory. 

Our Insurance Premium Loans

Our insurance premium finance loans
are typically provided to small- and medium-sized businesses to finance the purchase of commercial property and casualty insurance policies
with a one-year term. Insurance premium loans are generally in the range of 2,000 to 50,000 per loan. The customer typically pays 25 
of the annual policy premium at the initiation of coverage and we provide the balance of the premium at that time. Our loans have a nine
(9) to ten (10) month term. The purpose of this is two-fold; first, by making the financing term shorter than the policy term, a small
 surplus of collected funds is developed that helps ensure that the balance due is paid off by refund of the unearned premium
in case of cancellation, and second, it gives the insured a two to three-month break in payments before the policy term expires and the
process repeats for the renewal of the policy. 

2 

Insurance premiums are earned by
the insurance company over the term of the policy. If the policy is terminated prior to completion of the term, a refund of the unearned
portion of the policy premium is made. If the policy was financed, the refund of unearned premiums goes to the insurance premium finance
lender with any amount received by the lender in excess of the amount owed by the borrower being refunded to the borrower. 

The following table illustrates
the surplus between the unearned premium and the loan balance based on a typical annual premium of 10,000 with a 2,500
(25 deposit paid by the borrower at the inception of the loan. In this scenario, the insurance premium finance company advances 7,500
and the borrower repays the loan in 10 monthly payments of 750. Note that interest is excluded in this example to highlight the collateral
on the principal balance.

Although this is a typical representation
of a loan in our portfolio, we may be undercollateralized depending on certain factors, including, but not limited to, lower down payments,
minimum earned premiums, fully-earned fees and taxes, governmental filings, audit provisions, longer payment terms, and other competitive
factors. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for more information about our loan risks.

Credit Quality Information 

The following table presents credit-related
information at the class level in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards
Codification Topic ASC 310-10-50, Disclosures about the Credit Quality of Finance Receivables and the Allowance
for Credit Losses . A class is generally a disaggregation of a portfolio segment. In determining the classes, the Company considered
the finance receivable characteristics and methods it applies in monitoring and assessing credit risk and performance. 

The following table summarizes finance receivables
by the risk ratings that regulatory agencies utilize to classify credit exposure, and which are consistent with indicators the Company
monitors. Risk ratings are reviewed on a regular basis and are adjusted as necessary for updated information affecting the borrowers 
ability to fulfill their obligations. 

We analyze and rate our receivables based on the amount
of unearned premium (i.e. collateral) on a loan based on a worst case cancellation date. Loans that would be undercollateralized
as of this hypothetical cancellation are deemed to be Special Mention loans. The Company monitors the amount at which Special Mention
receivables are undercollateralized. The Company strategically balances its exposure to undercollateralized loans, while staying competitive
in the markets it serves. 

The definitions of these ratings
are as follows: 

Pass finance receivables in this category do not meet the criteria for classification in one of
the categories below. 

Special mention a special mention asset exhibits potential weaknesses that deserve management s
close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may, at some future date, result in the deterioration of the repayment
prospects. 

Classified a classified asset ranges from: 1) assets that are inadequately protected by the current
sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower, and are characterized by the distinct possibility that some loss will be sustained if
the deficiencies are not corrected to 2) assets with weaknesses that make collection or liquidation in full unlikely on the basis of current
facts, conditions, and values. Assets in this classification can be accruing or on non-accrual depending on the evaluation of these factors. 

Pass loan collateral in excess of receivable value the total amount of excess collateral over
the receivable on loans classified as pass loans. All pass loans are fully collateralized based on the value
of the unearned premium (i.e. collateral) compared to the unpaid balance of the loan. If a pass receivable were to undergo
an assumed cancellation as of the respective balance sheet date, the Company would not experience a loss. 

Special mention receivable in excess of collateral value the total amount of excess receivable
over collateral on loans classified as special mention loans. All special mention loans are undercollateralized
based on the value of the unearned premium (i.e. collateral) compared to the unpaid balance of the loan. If a special mention 
receivable were to undergo an assumed cancellation as of the respective balance sheet date, the Company would experience a loss. The assumed
cancellation of all special mention loans would result in a loss in the amount of the Special mention 
receivable in excess of collateral value.

As of December 31, 2022 and December
31, 2021, the Company considered 231,943 and 85,908, respectively, of lacking collateral as adequate for the level of risk associated
with these loans while staying competitive within the industry. Management does not believe any of its receivables would be considered

The Company regularly monitors each
contract for payment status, sending late notices and cancelling contracts at the earliest permissible date allowed by the statutory cancellation
regulations. In maintaining a proper allowance for doubtful accounts, the Company monitors past due accounts and ensures an allowance
for older receivables, generally over 120 days. However, in this industry, even though accounts are highly aged and appear stale, they
are still collectible. Unearned premiums on cancelled accounts may be held at insurance companies for varying periods, though they are
still highly collectible. The Company regularly contacts the insurance companies to ensure collectability. Historically, the Company has
managed its allowance conservatively ensuring an allowance balance that encompasses uncollectible accounts. In the following table, the
Company defines Non-performing loans without a specific reserve as defaulted loans over 120 days. All other loans are considered
 Performing loans evaluated collectively. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, there were no loans with deteriorated
credit quality.

Revenue Recognition 

Finance charges on insurance premium
installment contracts are initially recorded as unearned interest and are credited to income monthly over the term of the finance agreement.
For Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Texas contracts, an initial service fee of 20 per contract and the first month s interest,
on a pro rata basis, are recognized as income at the inception of a contract. The same treatment is applied to the 15 initial service
fee and first month s interest in South Carolina. The initial 20 per contract fee can only be charged once to an insured in a twelve-month
period. In accordance with industry practice, finance charges are recognized as income using the Rule of 78s method of amortizing
finance charge income, which does not materially differ from the interest method of amortizing finance charge income on short term receivables.
Late charges are recognized as income when charged. Maximum late fee charges are mandated by state regulations.
The Company charges late fees at the earliest permissible date based on the late fee regulations of the state in which the loan originated.
Furthermore, the Company charges the maximum permissible late fee based on the state in which the loan originated. Unearned interest is
netted against Premium Finance Contracts and Related Receivables on the balance sheet for reporting purposes.

Line of Credit 

On October 5, 2018, the Company
entered into an exclusive twenty-four month loan agreement with Woodforest National Bank WNB for a revolving line of credit
in the amount of 25,000,000. The Company recorded 164,396 of loan origination costs. On July 30, 2019, the Company s line of credit
was modified to 27,500,000, maturing October 5, 2020. On October 5, 2020, the Company s line of credit was extended to a maturity
date of January 5, 2021. Interest expense on this line of credit for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 totaled approximately
 0 and 86,000, respectively. This line of credit was fully paid off on February 3, 2021 (see below). 

On February 3, 2021, the Company
entered into an exclusive twenty-four month loan agreement with First Horizon Bank FHB ), our senior lender, for a revolving
line of credit in the amount of 35,000,000, which was immediately funded for 25,974,695 to pay off the prior line of credit with WNB.
On this date, the line of credit with WNB was fully repaid and terminated. The Company recorded 180,350 of loan origination costs. In
October 2021, the Company increased its line of credit with First Horizon Bank from 35,000,000 to 45,000,000. The Company recorded 25,771
of line of credit costs related to the credit increase. In November 2022, the Company extended the maturity on its line of credit agreement
with FHB until November 30, 2025. This extension also changed the Index Rate of the line of credit from 30-Day Libor to 30-Day Secured
Overnight Financing Rate SOFR in anticipation of the phase-out of Libor on June 30, 2023. The Company recorded 117,228
of line of credit costs related to this extension. 

At December 31, 2022 and December
31, 2021, the advance rate was 85 of the aggregate unpaid balance of the Company s eligible accounts receivable. The line of credit
is secured by all Company assets and is personally guaranteed by our CEO and two directors of the Company. The line of credit bears interest
at 30-Day SOFR plus 2.35-2.85 per annum (6.87 and 3.35 at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively). The terms of the Line of Credit
agreement provide for a minimum interest of 3.35 when the 30-day SOFR falls below 0.50 . For the year ended December 31, 2021, the minimum
rate of 3.35 was in effect. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the amount of principal outstanding on the line of credit was 32,821,347
and 30,537,067, respectively, and is reported on the consolidated balance sheet net of 107,722 and 60,692, respectively, of unamortized
loan origination fees. Interest expense on this line of credit for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 totaled approximately 1,554,000
and 854,000, respectively. The Company recorded amortized loan origination fee for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 of 70,198
and 142,980, respectively. 

The Company s agreement with
FHB contains certain financial covenants and restrictions. Under these restrictions, all the Company s assets are pledged to secure
the line of credit, the Company must maintain certain financial ratios such as an adjusted tangible net worth ratio, interest coverage
ratio and senior leverage ratio. The loan agreement also provides for certain covenants such as audited financial statements, notice of
change of control, budget, permission for any new debt, copy of filings with regulatory bodies, and minimum balances. Management believes
it was in compliance with the applicable debt covenants as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

Our Customers 

The
majority of our customers are small- to medium-sized businesses seeking property and casualty insurance through local independent insurance
agents. We currently operate in seventeen states where the premium finance laws are favorable to making insurance premium finance loans.
Premiums on these commercial insurance policies are written on a semi-annual or annual basis exclusively and insurance premium finance
loans are repaid over a maximum of 4 and 10 consecutive monthly payments, respectively. Substantially all of our loans are written for
a nine- to ten-month term with the balance written for a six-month term. Premiums on these financed policies typically range between 2,000
to 50,000. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we have 16,248 and 17,177 premium finance loans outstanding, respectively.
The types of policies we finance vary. They are most often motor truck cargo, physical damage and liability, commercial auto, commercial
general liability, commercial package policies, professional liability, and commercial property. Most of the policies we finance are written
through local independent insurance agents. The insurance companies they represent generally do not provide premium payment plans. 

Competition 

Our industry is highly competitive
with three types of competitors. Fifteen of our largest competitors are national premium finance firms primarily owned by commercial banks,
which write over 50 of all premium finance loans. A second type of competitor is comprised of regional premium finance companies owned
by entrepreneurs. Our remaining competitors are smaller, local companies many of which are affiliated with insurance agencies. There is
low barrier to entry into the business as regulations do not require passing any tests or having substantial capital. A prime requirement
for success in the industry is access to low-cost capital as profits are substantially related to the spread between the cost of capital
and interest earned on premium finance loans. Because of the secure nature of insurance premium finance loans, our industry is intensely
competitive: 

Large National Finance Companies
are owned or affiliated with financial institutions and make up approximately 50 of the financed premiums in the industry today. Since
access to capital is plentiful and cost of funds are historically low, these finance companies seek the security of the premium finance
industry to get valued returns with minimal risk. However, since these competitors oftentimes lack the agility or desire to develop personal
relationships, they generally seek out the largest premiums solely by offering the lowest rates. 

Regional finance companies compete
for business in smaller regional territories throughout the U.S. These companies are typically owned by entrepreneurs that raise debt
privately and leverage it with a bank or similar asset-based lender. While these regional competitors manage to maintain some of the benefits
of the smaller companies on a relationship level, they lack access to capital enjoyed by large institutionally owned competitors. Thus,
they are limited to modest organic growth with limited exit strategy. 

Smaller locally operated finance
companies generally conduct business in the state in which they are domiciled and typically limit their business to that state, county,
or municipality. These companies are often family-owned and operated and can even be affiliated with an insurance agency or agencies or
even a small insurance company. While these smaller competitors are able to develop personal relationships, owners often lack the experience,
business acumen and access to capital enjoyed by their larger competitors.

Marketing 

The
servicing of loans for policy premiums of 2,000 to 50,000 can be time consuming and require responsive customer service, but competition
in this segment is less intense. Our customers generally do not have an insurance expert on staff, and they rely of their brokers or agents
to recommend insurance premium finance companies. Our referral base has access to multiple alternate insurance premium finance sources
operating in the national, regional and local level. We believe we compete against our competitors primarily on the quality of our technology,
which allows our agents and brokers to receive a quick response to a loan application and the quality of the personalized servicing of
our loans which we provide. We believe that we are successful because our technology and customer service helps our referral sources achieve
their own customer satisfaction and retention. We have a website for our customers and agents at www.standardpremium.com. We have
four employees who act as our marketing representatives in the field. They call on our broker and agent base and seek new brokers and
agents to represent us to their clients. Our main marketing activities are the establishment and maintenance of relationships with our
loan referral sources. We do not market or advertise our loan services directly to the parties receiving our loans but rather depend upon
insurance agents and brokers to advise their clients who wish to finance their premiums about our insurance premium loan program. 

 Regulation 

 In
most states, insurance premium finance companies are regulated by the Insurance Departments or Offices of Insurance Regulation in which
they operate. Each state has specific laws regulating items such as interest rates, late charges, loan terms, forms, audit provisions,
cancellation requirements among others. In addition, each state has the ability to audit each finance company and requires annual reports
to be submitted. The following chart illustrates the relevant rules and regulations for states in which we operate as of December 31,
2021.

ITEM 1A. 
 RISK FACTORS 

An investment
in our common stock involves a high degree of risk and is subject to many uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties may adversely affect
our business, operating results and financial condition. In order to attain an appreciation for these risks and uncertainties, you should
read this Annual Report in its entirety and consider all of the information and advisements contained herein, including the following
risk factors and uncertainties. If any of the following risks occur, our business, operating results and financial condition could be
seriously harmed, and you could lose all or part of your investment. 

We depend on the availability
of significant amounts of credit to meet our liquidity needs and our failure to maintain our sources of credit could materially and adversely
affect our liquidity in the future. 

Our business
model is dependent upon our ability to borrow to maintain and grow our ability to lend money to our customers. On February 3, 2021 we
entered into a new two-year line of credit in the maximum amount of 35 million which was immediately funded for 25,974,695 to pay off
the prior line of credit lender. In October 2021, the line of credit facility was increased by 10 million to a total of 45 million.
In November 2022, the term of the line of credit was extended until November 30, 2025. If we fail to renew or replace our line of credit
at the expiration of the current term, or we default on our line of credit, then our ability to continue our lending business at current
levels and meet our other obligations, would be materially adversely affected. Since the amount of money we can borrow on our revolving
credit line is based on a percentage of our entire loan portfolio less certain ineligible items, our other corporate debt (i.e., subordinated
and un-subordinated debt) plus our retained earnings and stockholder equity alone may limit our ability to increase the size of our loan
portfolio. 

If our growth requires
us to raise additional capital, that capital may not be available when it is needed, or the cost of that capital may be very high. 

As we grow,
organically and through possible acquisitions, the amount of capital required to support our operations grows as well. We may need to
raise additional capital to support continued growth both organically and through possible acquisitions. Any equity capital we obtain
may result in the dilution of the interests of existing holders of our common stock. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed,
will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time which are outside our control and on our financial condition and performance.
If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, or on terms acceptable to us, our ability to expand our operations through organic
growth and possible acquisitions could be materially impaired and our financial condition and liquidity could be materially and negatively
affected. 

Our reliance on third
party insurance agents and brokers to originate our premium finance loans may result in increased exposure to credit risk and fraud. 

Our premium
finance loans are issued primarily through relationships with a large number of unaffiliated insurance agents and brokers. As a result,
risk management and general supervisory oversight may be difficult since we have little direct contact with the borrowers and such loans
may also be more susceptible to third party fraud. In certain cases, insurance agents and brokers may be funded directly on behalf of
the insurance company and/or its affiliates. If the agent or broker fails to remit these funds accordingly, or fails to provide an underlying
insurance policy, there may be little or no collateral. Acts of fraud are difficult to detect and deter, and we cannot assure investors
that our risk management procedures and controls will prevent losses from fraudulent activity. 

If our allowance for credit losses is not sufficient to absorb losses
that may occur in our loan portfolio, our financial condition and liquidity could suffer. 

We maintain
an allowance for loan losses that is intended to absorb credit losses that we expect to incur in our loan portfolio. At each balance sheet
date, our management determines the amount of the allowance for loan losses based on our estimate of probable and reasonably estimable
losses in our loan portfolio, taking into account probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships,
as well as probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and credit undertakings that are not specifically identified. Because our allowance
for loan losses represents an estimate of inherent losses, there is no certainty that it will be adequate over time to cover credit losses
in the loan portfolio, particularly if there is deterioration in general economic or market conditions or events that adversely affect
specific customers. Although we believe our loan loss allowance is adequate to absorb reasonably estimable losses in our loan portfolio,
if our estimates are inaccurate and our actual loan losses exceed the amount that is anticipated, or if the loss assumptions we used in
calculating our reserves are significantly different from those we actually experience, our financial condition and liquidity could be
materially adversely affected. 

9 

Failures
of our information technology systems may adversely affect our operations. 

We are
increasingly dependent upon computer and other information technology systems to manage our business. We rely upon information technology
systems to process, record, monitor and disseminate information about our operations. In some cases, we depend on third parties to provide
or maintain these systems. While we perform a review of controls instituted by our critical vendors in accordance with industry standards,
we must rely on the continued maintenance of these controls by the outside party, including safeguards over the security of customer data.
Additionally, we must rely on our employees to safeguard access to our information technology systems and avoid inadvertent complicity
with external security threats. Although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, the security
of our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious
code and cyberattacks that could have a security impact. If one or more of these events occur, or if any of our financial, accounting
or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, this could jeopardize our or our customers confidential
and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks or otherwise cause interruptions
or malfunctions in our operations or the operations of our customers or counterparties. We may be required to expend significant additional
resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject
to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us. Security
breaches in our online systems could also have an adverse effect on our reputation. Our systems may also be affected by events that are
beyond our control, which may include, for example, electrical or telecommunications outages or other damage to our property or assets.
Although we take precautions against malfunctions and security breaches, we cannot assure that such efforts will be adequate to prevent
problems that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

If we are unable to
attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel, our ability to provide high quality service will be diminished, we may lose key
customer relationships, and our results of operations may suffer. 

We believe
that our success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced personnel, including our senior management and other
key personnel. The departure of senior manager or other key personnel may damage relationships with certain customers, or certain customers
may choose to follow such personnel to a competitor. The loss of any of our senior managers or other key personnel, or our inability to
identify, recruit and retain such personnel, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
All but one of our employees are at will with no fixed term of employment. 

Our lack of contractual
marketing relationships with our loan referral base could adversely affect our revenue, profits and financial condition. 

We do not
have contractual marketing arrangements with the insurance brokers and agents. Since we depend upon the insurance brokers and agents to
refer their customers to us for premium loans, our premium loan volume could decline if our referral base decided to refer their clients
to other sources of premium loans. 

Since our business
is concentrated in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, Tennessee, and Virginia, declines in the economy
of these states could adversely affect our business. 

Our success
depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the specific local markets in which we operate. We provide premium finance loans
to customers primarily in the states of Arizona, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, Tennessee, and Virginia. The
local economic conditions in these market states significantly impact the demand for our premium finance loans as well as the ability
of our customers to repay loans. Declines in economic conditions, including inflation, recession, unemployment, changes in securities
markets or other factors impacting these local markets could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
of operations. 

Competition in the
insurance premium finance industry is intense, and some of our competitors have greater financial, technological and other resources than
we currently possess. 

We face
intense competition from other insurance premium finance firms. Many competing companies have longer operating histories, greater access
to capital, lower cost of capital, more lending experience, greater name recognition, larger staffs and substantially greater financial,
technical and marketing resources than we currently possess. The superior resources that some of these competitors have available could
allow them to compete successfully against us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial
condition, liquidity and prospects. 

10 

If we fail to establish
and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, our operating results and our ability to operate our business
could be harmed. 

Ensuring
that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements
on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. Internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

In addition,
we are required to be compliant with public company internal control requirements mandated under Section 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act. We are implementing measures designed to improve our internal controls over financial reporting, including the hiring of accounting
personnel and establishing new accounting and financial reporting procedures to establish an appropriate level of internal controls over
financial reporting. However, we cannot provide assurances that we will be successful in doing so. If we are unable to successfully implement
internal controls over financial reporting, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting, and our stock price, may be adversely
affected and we may be unable to maintain compliance with the applicable stock exchange listing requirements. 

Implementing
any appropriate changes to our internal controls may distract our officers and employees, entail substantial costs to modify existing
processes and take significant time to complete. These changes may not, however, be effective in maintaining the adequacy of our internal
controls, and any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis,
could increase operating costs and harm the business. 

We do not anticipate
that we will pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. 

The current
expectation is that for the foreseeable future, we will retain our future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business.
As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be the sole source of gain, if any, for any stockholders for the foreseeable
future. 

Our common stock began trading on the OTCQX
on March 21, 2022 and there is no assurance that an active market will develop or be maintained. 

Our common stock commenced trading
on the OTCQX Best Market under the symbol SPFX on March 21, 2022. We cannot assure that an active trading market for our shares will develop
or be maintained. In the absence of an active trading market for our common stock, stockholders may not be able to sell their shares at
the time that they would like to sell and may have to hold their shares indefinitely. 

We may not realize the anticipated benefits
of any acquisitions that we are able to complete. 

Part of our business strategy is
to grow through potential acquisitions in order to achieve economies of scale. Acquisitions involve a number of risks, including: 

it may occur that the acquired company or assets
do not further Standard s business strategy, or that it overpaid for the company or assets, or that industry or economic conditions
change, all of which may require a future impairment charge; 

management may have difficulty integrating the operations
and personnel of the acquired business and may have difficulty retaining the key personnel of the acquired business; 

management may have difficulty incorporating the
acquired services with its existing services; 

there may be customer confusion where Standard s
services overlap with those of entities that are acquired; 

Standard s ongoing business and management's
attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically and culturally
diverse locations; 

There may be difficulty maintaining uniform standards,
controls, procedures and policies across locations; 

Standard may acquire companies that have material
liabilities, including, among other things, for the failure to comply with insurance laws and regulations; 

the acquisition may result in litigation from terminated
employees or third parties; 

management may experience significant problems or
liabilities associated with service quality, technology and legal contingencies; 

Standard may spend considerable amounts of money
(legal, accounting, diligence, etc.) in seeking an acquisition candidate and never complete the acquisition; and 

acquisition candidate letters of intent may have
large break-up fees if the acquisition is not completed. 

11 

We may not be able to make future acquisitions without obtaining
additional financing. 

To finance any acquisitions, Standard
may, from time to time, issue additional equity securities or incur additional debt. A greater amount of debt or additional equity financing
could be required to the extent that its common stock fails to achieve or to maintain a market value sufficient to warrant its use in
future acquisitions, or to the extent that acquisition targets are unwilling to accept common stock in exchange for their businesses.
Furthermore, the Company would require bank approval of any additional debt or equity financing. Even if Standard were permitted to incur
additional debt or determine to sell equity, management may not be able to obtain additional required capital on acceptable terms, if
at all, which would limit its plans for growth. In addition, any capital they may be able to raise could result in increased leverage
on its balance sheet, additional interest and financing expense, and decreased operating income. 

The insurance premium
finance industry is very competitive, and if we are not able to compete effectively, we may lose market share and our business could suffer. 

We face
competition in financing insurance premiums throughout our market area. Our competitors include national, regional and other community
banks, and a wide range of other financial institutions such as credit unions, insurance companies, factoring companies and other non-bank
financial companies. Many of these competitors have access to cheaper capital, substantially greater resources and market presence than
Standard and, as a result of their size, may be able to offer a broader range of products at better prices. 

Compliance with securities
laws. 

The Company s
common stock, preferred stock and promissory notes were sold to investors pursuant to exemptions under the Securities Act of 1933 with
respect to transactions involving limited offers and sales without registration. If the Company should fail to comply with each and every
one of the requirements of the available exemptions from registration, the investors may have the right to rescind their purchase of shares
if they so desire. Compliance is highly technical. There is always the possibility that if any investor or investors should obtain rescission
of their investments, the Company may be required to repurchase the securities. In addition, failure to comply with any of the requirements
for exemption under state securities laws could occasion the same results as a failure to comply with the above-mentioned federal rule
exemptions. 

We depend on the accuracy
and completeness of information we receive about our customers and counterparties to make credit decisions. Reliance on inaccurate or
misleading information may adversely affect our business, operations, and financial condition. 

We rely
on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions.
This information could include financial statements, credit reports, and other financial information. We also rely on representations
of those customers, counterparties, or other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that
information. Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements, credit reports, or other financial information could have a material
adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Certain protective provisions of our Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock may prevent us from entering into certain transactions, issuing certain securities or making changes in the rights, preferences,
privileges, qualifications, limitations or restrictions of, or applicable to, the Series A Preferred Stock which may be beneficial to
the holders of our common stock. 

Our Series
A Convertible Preferred Stock has certain protective provisions as set forth in Item 11 herein which may prevent us from engaging in transactions,
including mergers and acquisitions, or taking other actions which alter the provisions of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock or
issuing other equity securities which may have rights senior to or on parity with the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, or increasing
the amount of authorized Series A Convertible Preferred Stock even if such matters were beneficial to the holders of our common stock. 

We may cause the Series
A Convertible Preferred Stock to be converted into common stock which may reduce the price of our common stock. 

We may
increase the number of outstanding shares of our common stock by causing the conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock into
common stock. Issuance of additional shares of our common stock my cause a reduction in the market price of the shares of our common stock. 

12 

Particular Risks Associated with the
Specialized Insurance Premium Services Industry 

 Our premium finance
business may involve a higher risk of delinquency or collection than other lending operations and could expose us to losses. 

We provide
financing for the payment of commercial insurance premiums through our subsidiary Standard Premium Finance Management, Inc. Commercial
insurance premium finance loans involve a unique, and possibly higher, risk of delinquency or collection than other types of loans. These
are initiated primarily through relationships with unaffiliated independent insurance agents. As a result, risk management is critical
and may be difficult. Roughly one third of all new borrowers fail to make all of their payments. In such an event, we request cancellation
of the insurance policy and anticipate a refund from the insurance company and the agent. Under ideal conditions the down payment made
by the insured should create sufficient equity to pay off our loan in the event of a cancellation. However, as a consequence of competitive
market conditions, we may have accepted a down payment that did not fully cover our loan. If, after the unearned premium on a cancelled
policy is fully refunded, there is still an outstanding balance, the insured must be billed directly. The cost of pursuing these funds
often exceeds the amount collected and most often results in write-offs by the Company. Many commercial loans have underwriting provisions
that may affect our collateral. Such instances may include but are not limited to fully earned policy fees or inspection fees, audit provisions,
state reporting requirements, and cancellation limitations. Such circumstances could greatly reduce the unearned premium in the event
of cancellation. Since we depend on the unearned premium for collateral, we could experience greater write-offs and thus, increased risk. 

A Decline in the Economy
in General May Result in a Decrease in Loan Originations. 

Declines
in the economy generally could have an adverse impact on our operating results by reducing the number of businesses purchasing insurance.
Further, those who are currently financing their policies may have more difficulty making their payments, thus raising our default rates. 

Increases in the Prime
Interest Rate may reduce the profitability of our loans. 

The rate
at which we lend money is set by the state. However, our revolving line of credit, which comprises our senior debt, is based, in part,
on the prime interest rate. When the prime rate goes up, the interest we pay on our line of credit increases while our interest income
continues to be based on the same interest rate. Thus, with each increase, the spread between the interest we earn and the interest we
pay narrows, reducing our net interest income. 

Changes in Insurance
Law may adversely affect our business. 

Our industry
is subject to laws, rules, and regulations as established by the states in which we operate. Any changes in such laws, rules, and regulations
could be detrimental to the premium finance industry, thus having a negative effect on our operating income. 

Aggressive Marketing
by our Competitors may adversely affect our business. 

There
may be changes in the insurance market such as aggressive marketing by other premium finance companies or the emergence of new premium
finance companies. Many insurance companies offer payment plans in house or through affiliates. This practice could increase. Such an
event would reduce the market share of all independent premium finance companies and would have a negative effect on our company. 

Insurance Company Insolvency
may cause us losses. 

Insurance
companies, although closely regulated by the various states, can also fail. When an insurance company fails, we may have significant exposure.
Such an event would put us at considerable risk. Although most insurance companies are covered through a guarantee fund, there may be
a lengthy delay in recovering these funds, and all funds due us may not be recovered. Such an event would have a negative effect on cash
flow. In the event of insurance company failure of a carrier not covered under such guarantee fund, our exposure will be much greater.
There are rating services that evaluate the financial condition and stability of insurance companies. We use these to help us lower our
risks. However, conditions for any insurance company can change rapidly and the rating services we use may not give us sufficient warning
of any changes. In such an event, our risk factor could be increased. 

13 

We may experience cash
flow problems due to delays in receiving proceeds from our bank loan or premium finance loan documentation. 

We issue
drafts on our bank account to fund new premium finance loans. These Drafts clear our bank on a daily basis. To meet this funding need,
we draw funds on our revolving credit line with our senior lender on a regular basis. Should the senior lender be unable to fund us in
a timely fashion, we would have difficulty in funding these drafts. Failure on our part to cover all or part of these drafts could result
in cancellation or non-issuance of an insurance policy for which we may be liable. Further, if drafts fail to clear our bank it may jeopardize
our relationships with insurance agents and insurance companies, adversely affecting our ability to conduct business in the future. Insurance
agents that do business with our Company have the authority to issue drafts on our bank account to pay a portion of the insured s
premium. We review these drafts daily to make certain they are all paid to and cashed by proper parties. Improper items can be returned
to the bank and will not be honored. Under normal circumstances, we receive the finance agreement before the draft is presented to our
bank. Frequently however, the draft is presented to our bank before we receive the finance agreement. Since we cannot draw on our revolving
credit line without first presenting the loan agreement, this may cause a cash flow problem for us. Such an event temporarily causes us
to, in effect use funds for which no loans have been secured. Such an event can reduce our profitability and increase risk to the Company.
In the event that a draft has not been cashed for an undue period of time, we may have a liability for the draft, and the insured may
have no coverage. 

Business Interruption
from natural disasters, including hurricanes and pandemics. 

In the
event of a natural disaster or other occurrence beyond our control, we may be unable to conduct our normal course of business that could
cause temporary or permanent harm to the Company due to loss of customers, increased defaults on our premium finance loans or interruptions
to our operations. 

Insurance Company Concentration 

To reduce
our exposure, we try to limit the amount of financing we do for any one insurance company. In fact, the senior lender providing our revolving
credit line has placed certain limits on the percentage of our business that can be financed with any one insurance company. Although
we endeavor to keep our concentration within the limits authorized by our senior lender, this is not always possible. Market conditions
may cause fluctuations in our concentration, creating a disproportionate exposure with one or several insurance companies. Such an event
could increase our risks. 

Our dependance on Insurance
Agents may expose us to losses. 

We are
continually adding new insurance agents to our customer base. Each new agent is screened by us to verify that he or she is licensed and
is in good standing with state authorities. In addition, we attempt to gather as much information as possible to assist us in evaluating
prospective customers. The risk of doing business with a new agent is significantly greater than that of doing business with an agent
with whom we have established a business history. 

Liability Arising from
Wrongful Cancellation of an Insurance Policy 

Through
the normal course of business, we cancel many insurance policies for non-payment. If, in the event we cancel an insurance policy in error,
we could be deemed liable for claims that would normally be paid by the insurance carrier. Such claims, and resultant damages could be
significant. Although we carry professional liability insurance to cover such instances, certain provisions could prevent us from recovering
all or part of our claim.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Overview 

We are an insurance premium financing
company, specializing primarily in commercial policies. We make it efficient for companies to access financing for insurance premiums.
Enabled by our network of marketing representatives and relationships with insurance agents, we provide a value-driven, customer-focused
lending service. 

We have offered premium financing
since 1991 through our wholly owned subsidiary, Standard Premium Finance Management Corporation. We are generally targeting premium financing
loans from 2,000 to 50,000, with repayment terms ranging from 6 to 10 months, although we may offer larger loans in cases we deem appropriate.
Qualified customers may have multiple financings with us concurrently, which we believe provides opportunities for repeat business, as
well as increased value to our customers. 

We
originate loans primarily in Florida, although we operate in several states. Over the past three years, the Company has expanded
its operations, and currently is financing insurance premiums in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Texas, Tennessee and
Arizona. Throughout 2022, we have obtained licenses in eleven additional states: Virginia, Arkansas, Nebraska, Mississippi, Maryland,
Colorado, Ohio, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Alabama. We intend to continue to expand our market into new states as part of
our organic growth trend. Loans are originated primarily through a network of insurance agents solicited by our in-house sales team and
marketing representatives. 

We generate the majority of our
revenue through interest income and the associated fees earned from our loan products. We earn interest based on the rule of 78 
and earn other associated fees as applicable to each loan. These fees include, but are not limited to, a one-time finance charge, late
fees, and NSF fees. Our company charges interest to its customers solely by the Rule of 78. Charging interest per the Rule of 78 is the
industry standard among premium finance loans. The Rule of 78 is a method to calculate the amount of principal and interest paid by each
payment on a loan with equal monthly payments. The Rule of 78 is a permissible method of calculating interest in the states in which we
operate. The Rule of 78 recognizes greater amounts of interest income and lesser amounts of principal repayment during the first months
of the loan, while decreasing interest income and increasing principal repayment during the final months of the loan. Whenever a loan
is repaid prior to full maturity, the Rule of 78 methodology is applied and the borrower is refunded accordingly. 

We rely on a diversified set of
funding sources for the loans we make to our customers. Our primary source of financing has historically been a line of credit at a bank
collateralized by our loan receivables and our other assets. We receive additional funding from unsecured subordinate noteholders that
pays monthly interest to the investors. We have also used proceeds from operating cash flow to fund loans in the past and continue to
finance a portion of our outstanding loans with these funds. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information regarding
our financing strategy. 

15 

The Company s main source
of funding is its line of credit, which represented approximately 64 32,713,625) of its capital and total liabilities as of December
31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the Company s subordinated notes payable and PPP loan represented approximately 18 9,427,697)
of the Company s capital and total liabilities, operating liabilities provide approximately 7 3,395,043) of the Company s
capital and total liabilities, preferred equity provides approximately 3 1,660,000) of the Company s capital and total liabilities,
and equity in retained earnings and common paid-in capital represents the remaining 8 4,292,442) of the Company s capital and
total liabilities. 

Key Financial and Operating Metrics 

We regularly monitor a series of metrics in order to
measure our current performance and project our future performance. These metrics aid us in developing and refining our growth strategies
and making strategic decisions.

Gross Revenue 

Gross Revenue represents the sum of interest and finance
income, associated fees and other revenue. 

Originations 

Originations represent the total principal amount of
Loans made during the period. 

Interest Earned Rate 

The Interest Earned Rate is the average annual percentage
interest rate earned on new loans. 

Cost of Funds Rate, Gross 

Cost of Funds Rate, Gross is calculated as interest expense
divided by average debt outstanding for the period. 

Cost of Funds Rate, Net 

Cost of Funds Rate, Net is calculated as interest expense
divided by average debt outstanding for the period, net of the interest related tax benefit. 

Reserve Ratio 

Reserve Ratio is our allowance for credit losses at the
end of the period divided by the total amount of principal outstanding on Loans at the end of the period. It excludes net deferred origination
costs and associated fees. 

Provision Rate 

Provision Rate equals the provision for credit losses
for the period divided by originations for the period. Because we reserve for probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio upon origination,
this rate is significantly impacted by the expectation of credit losses for the period s originations volume. This rate is also
impacted by changes in loss expectations for contract receivables originated prior to the commencement of the period. 

16 

Return on Assets 

Return on Assets is calculated as annualized net income
(loss) attributable to common stockholders for the period divided by average total assets for the period. 

Return on Equity 

Return on Equity is calculated as annualized net income
(loss) attributable to common stockholders for the period divided by average stockholders equity attributable to common stockholders
for the period. 

RESULTS of OPERATIONS 

Results of Operations for the Year ended December 31, 2022 Compared
to the Year ended December 31. 2021 

Revenue 

Revenue increased by 6.4 overall
or 491,794 to 8,156,537 for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 7,664,743 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in revenue
was due to a 7.2 or 454,638 increase in finance charges, a 6.8 or 66,170 increase in revenue from late charges, partially offset by
a 7.5 or 29,014 decrease in origination charges. Revenue from finance charges comprised 82.9 of overall revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2022. 

During the year ended December
31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, the c ompany financed an additional
 6,011,217 in new loan originations. This increase was due largely to increased marketing efforts throughout our established states.
Although the Company increased amounts financed, the Company noted a 2,090 decrease in the quantity of loan originations to 23,284 new
loans for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 25,374 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The quantity of loan originations
is directly correlated to the decrease in origination charge revenue, as the Company immediately recognizes an origination fee on substantially
all new loans. 

Under the
terms of the line of credit agreement, the loan receivables and our other assets provide the collateral for the loan. As the receivables
increase, driven by new sales, the company has greater borrowing power, giving it the opportunity to generate additional sales. In February
2021, the Company executed a 35,000,000 line of credit with a new lender, terminating the previous line of credit. In October 2021, the
Company further increased its borrowing power on its line of credit to 45,000,000, an increase of 10,000,000. In November 2022, the
Company extended the maturity of this line of credit until November 30, 2025. The additional availability on our line of credit was an
essential driver to our increased financed amount of new loan originations during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the
year ended December 31, 2021. See Future Cash Requirements for the Company s strategy regarding its line of credit. 

Expenses 

Expenses increased by 10.3 or 665,803
to 7,144,216 for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 6,478,413 for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

The increase
in expenses was primarily due to increases in the following categories: 

602,259 increase in interest expense as a result of increases in the line
of credit interest rate. Due to benchmark interest rate increases adopted by the Federal Reserve Board throughout 2022, interest rates
throughout the marketplace have increased accordingly. Our line of credit features a variable interest rate based on one-month SOFR with
a minimum rate of 3.35 . As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our line of credit s interest rate was quoted at 6.87 and 3.35 , respectively.
Furthermore, as of December 31, 2022, our net borrowings on the line of credit have increased by 2,237,250 to 32,713,625 from 30,476,375
at December 31, 2021. This increase in borrowings is due to increased loan originations. 

85,676 increase in salaries and wages expense as a result of increased
base salaries and wages for our office staff and executives. Furthermore, in June 2022, the Company executed employment contracts with
its CEO and CFO, increasing their base salaries. 

72,316 increase in other operating expenses as a result of software programming
fees and marketing related expenses. The Company has begun development of the web-based portion of its proprietary software, which should
lead to cost savings as well as synergistic effects with any mergers or acquisitions. The Company also experienced costs related to participation
in four additional conventions, in line with our goals to expand into new states. Further, the Company experienced general price increases
due to macroeconomic inflationary conditions. 

17 

These increases
in expenses were partially offset by a decrease in the following category: 

107,979 decrease in bad debt expense as a result of maintaining the allowance
for doubtful accounts in line with the balance in premium finance contracts receivable from increased new loan originations. In 2021,
our allowance grew rapidly to keep up with the explosive growth in receivables due to the availability on our new line of credit. Thus,
the Company increased allowances to coincide with risks associated with the risks of a rapidly growing portfolio. We maintained consistent
allowance practices in 2022, which kept the reserves adequate. 

Income before Taxes 

Income before taxes decreased by 174,009 to 1,012,321
for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 1,186,330 for the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease was attributable to the net increases
and decreases as discussed above. 

Income Tax Provision 

Income tax provision decreased 103,817
to 206,190 for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 310,007 for the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease was primarily attributable
to the decrease in taxable income. 

Net Income 

Net income decreased by 70,192
to 806,131 for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 876,323 for the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease was attributable to
the 174,009 decrease in income before taxes, partially offset by the 103,817 decrease in the provision for income taxes. 

LIQUIDITY and CAPITAL RESOURCES as of December
31, 2022 

We had
 421,211 cash and a working capital surplus of 12,709,204 at December 31, 2022. A significant working capital surplus is generally expected
through the normal course of business due primarily to the difference between the balance in loan receivables and the related line of
credit liability. As discussed in the Revenues section, the Company s line of credit is currently the primary source of operating
funds. In February 2021, the Company entered into a contract with a new lender, First Horizon Bank, for a two-year 35,000,000 line of
credit. In October 2021, the Company further increased its borrowing power on its line of credit to 45,000,000, an increase of 10,000,000.
In November 2022, the Company extended the maturity of this line of credit until November 30, 2025 and replaced the benchmark rate of
the loan from 30-day LIBOR to 30-day SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate). LIBOR will cease to be published after June 30, 2023. The
terms of the amended line of include an interest rate based on the 30-day SOFR rate plus an applicable margin of 2.55 - 2.96 , with a
minimum rate of 3.35 . The applicable margin is based on the Company s ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth. As of December
31, 2022, the Company s applicable margin was 2.75 . We anticipate that the interest rate we pay on our revolving credit agreement
may rise due to the recently adopted benchmark interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve Board. We believe that we will be able to
pass along any interest rate increase on loans funded after the interest rate increase so that our net interest spread will not be materially
affected. Furthermore, because of the short-term nature of our loans, we are not bound to any particular loan and its fixed interest rate
for a long period of time. Based on our estimates and taking into account the risks and uncertainties of our plans, we believe that we
will have adequate liquidity to finance and operate our business and repay our obligations as they become due in the next 12 months. 

During
the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company raised an additional 35,000 in subordinated notes payable related parties and 575,511
in subordinated notes payable. The Company repaid 181,302 of notes payable related parties and 288,400 or notes payable. The
Company utilizes its inflows from subordinated debt as a financing source before drawing additionally from the line of credit. 

During
the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company sold 67,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock Preferred Stock for 400,000 in cash and exchanging 270,000 of its subordinated notes at a price of 10.00 per share. The additional Preferred Stock
bolsters shareholder s equity, which, in turn, increases leveraging ability on our line of credit.

Future Cash Requirements 

As the Company anticipates its growth
patterns to continue, the larger line of credit is paramount to fueling this growth. By securing its larger line of credit, the Company
can expect to satisfy the cash requirements anticipated by its future growth. Coinciding with these goals, in February 2021, the Company
entered into a contract with a new lender for a two-year 35,000,000 line of credit. Furthermore, in October 2021, the Company executed
a loan amendment with this lender to increase its line of credit to 45,000,000, an increase of 10,000,000. In November 2022, the Company
extended its maturity on its line of credit facility until November 30, 2025. The extended maturity provides stability for the Company s
future cash requirements. 

Uses of Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We require cash to fund our operating
expenses and working capital requirements, including costs associated with our premium finance loans, capital expenditures, debt repayments,
acquisitions (if any), pursuing market expansion, supporting sales and marketing activities, and other general corporate purposes. While
we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations and repay our debt, we may elect to pursue additional
financing activities such as refinancing or expanding existing debt or pursuing other debt or equity offerings to provide flexibility
with our cash management and provide capital for potential acquisitions.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

We consider the following to be
our most critical accounting policy because it involves critical accounting estimates and a significant degree of management judgment: 

Allowance for doubtful accounts 

We are subject to the risk of loss
associated with our borrowers inability to fulfill their payment obligations, the risk that we will not collect sufficient unearned
premium refunds on the cancelled policies on the defaulted loans to fully cover the unpaid loan principal and the risk that payments due
us from insurance agents and brokers will not be paid. 

The carrying amount of the Premium
Finance Contracts Contracts is reduced by an allowance for losses that are maintained at a level which, in management s
judgment, is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the Contracts. The amount of the allowance is based upon management s evaluation
of the collectability of the Contracts, including the nature of the accounts, credit concentration, trends, and historical data, specific
impaired Contracts, economic conditions, and other risks inherent in the Contracts. The allowance is increased by a provision for loan
losses, which is charged to expense, and reduced by charge-offs, net of recovery. 

19 

In addition, specific allowances
are established for accounts past due over 120 days. Individual contracts are written off against the allowance when collection of the
individual contracts appears doubtful. The collectability of outstanding and cancelled contracts is generally secured by collateral in
the form of the unearned premiums on the underlying policies and accordingly historical losses are approximately 1 to 1.5 of the principal
amount of loans made each year. The Company considers historical losses in determining the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.
The collectability of amounts due from agents is determined by the financial strength of the agency. 

Stock-Based Compensation 

We account for stock-based compensation
by measuring and recognizing as compensation expense the fair value of all share-based payment awards made to directors, executives, employees
and consultants, including employee stock options related to our 2019 Equity Incentive Plan and stock warrants based on estimated grant
date fair values. The determination of fair value involves a number of significant estimates. We use the Black Scholes option pricing
model to estimate the value of employee stock options and stock warrants which requires a number of assumptions to determine the model
inputs. These include the expected volatility of our stock and employee exercise behavior which are based expectations of future developments
over the term of the option.

 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

As required
by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2022. Our disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or
submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based upon the evaluation, our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at December 31, 2022 at the
reasonable assurance level. 

Management s Report
on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under
the Exchange Act. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.
In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
on Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting
was effective as of December 31, 2022 based on these criteria. This annual report does not include an attestation report of our independent
registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation
by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to section 404(c) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, that permits
the Company, as a smaller reporting company, to provide only management s report in this annual report. 

20 

Material Weakness and
Remedial Actions 

As we previously
disclosed, in connection with preparing our financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2022 the Company determined that
it had been incorrectly classifying the Increase/Decrease in Premium Finance Contracts Receivable as operating activities in its Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows rather than as investing activities. As a result of this error we determined that this incorrect classification
represented a material weakness in our financial control over financial reporting. 

To remediate the material
weakness in our financial control over financial reporting related to our improper classification of Increase/Decrease in Premium Finance
Contracts Receivable as operating activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows we instituted a remediation plan of review and
training of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the relevant GAAP standards for our CEO, CFO and financial reporting staff,
including the proper analysis and classification of matters included in our Statements of Cash Flows and other financial statements. 

A material
weakness will not be deemed to be remediated, however, until management has implemented the remedial policies and procedures and there
has been sufficient time to test the new controls to determine that the material weakness has been remediated. 

We believe
that such review and training has been successful in remediating such material weakness and no classification error has appeared in our
financial statements included in this Annual Report and in the Quarterly Report for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. We believe that
this represents sufficient time to test the new controls to determine that the material weakness has been fully remediated. 

Changes in Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting 

Other than
the plan we implemented to remediate the material weakness discussed above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting during the quarterly period ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.

Creation of Holding Company

into an agreement of share exchange with Standard Premium Finance Management Corporation Management and the shareholders
of Management to facilitate the formation of the Company, which acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Management in exchange
for newly issued shares of Company common stock. Each outstanding share of Management common stock was issued 28.4 shares of Company common

the Company. 

Agreement

In
July 2016, the Company entered into a Consulting Agreement with Bayshore Corporate Finance, LLC to

Review, Approval or Ratification

would potentially require disclosure. The Company has a Business Ethics and Conduct Policy which requires that any potential conflicts
of interest must be reported immediately to the Board of Directors, Chief Executive and the Company s legal counsel. 

Director Independence 

The Company has chosen to measure
the independence of its directors under the definition of independence used by The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. In determining independence,
the Board reviews and seeks to determine whether directors have any material relationship with the Company, direct or indirect, which
would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. The
Board reviews business, professional, charitable and familial relationships of the directors in determining independence. Under such definition,
the board of directors has determined that Carl Hoechner, Mark Kutner, MD, James Wall, Chris Perrucci, John Leavitt, and Scott Howell,
MD, are independent directors.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

 To the Board of Directors and 
Stockholders of Standard Premium Finance Holdings, Inc. 

 Opinion on the Financial Statements 

 We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet of Standard Premium Finance Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiary (the Company) as of December 31, 2022, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2022 and the related notes (collectively
referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for the year ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

 Basis for Opinion 

 These consolidated financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

 We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we
engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

 Our audits included performing procedures to
assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

 Critical Audit Matters 

 The critical audit matters to be communicated
below, are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated
to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved
our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our
opinion on the financial statements taken as a whole and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate
opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

F- 2 

Description of the Matter 

 During our audit procedures, we identified that there were significant
accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022 and therefore there was a question over the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. 

 How we addressed the matter in our audit 

 The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter
included examining the accounts receivable ledger, evaluating management s assessment of the collectability of accounts receivable,
and testing the collection of outstanding balances at year-end. Based on our procedures we deemed the Company s treatment of accounts
receivable and the corresponding allowance for doubtful accounts to be appropriate as of December 31, 2022. 

 Other Matter 

 The consolidated financial statements of the
Company for the year ended December 31, 2021, before the restatement described in Note 3, were audited by another auditor whose report
was dated March 25, 2022 expressed an unmodified opinion on those statements. 

 As part of our audit of the December 31, 2022
consolidated financial statements, we also audited the adjustments described in Note 3 that were applied to restate the 2021 consolidated
financial statements. In our opinion, such adjustments are appropriate and have been properly applied. We were not engaged to audit, review,
or apply any procedures to the 2021 consolidated financial statements of the Company other than with respect to the adjustments and, accordingly,
we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2021 consolidated financial statements as a whole.

 We have served as the Company s auditor since 2022.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of: 

 Standard Premium Finance Holdings, Inc. 

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Standard Premium Finance Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiary (the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020,
the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the
period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company
as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December
31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal controls over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures including examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Our audits also include evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below
are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to
the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our
especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion
on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions
on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Valuation of Stock Options and Warrants 

As described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company measures fair value of stock options and warrants at fair value using level three inputs. To determine fair value
of stock options and warrants, the Company determines the appropriate valuation methodology and assumptions, including unobservable inputs.
The Company used a valuation specialist to assist in estimating the fair value of the Company s common stock. Stock options and
warrants are measured at fair value using a Black-Scholes valuation model that uses significant assumptions, including the Company's fair
value of common stock, volatility, risk-free interest rate and probability of exercise occurrence through expiration date. 

F- 4 

Auditing management's estimate for the fair value
of stock options and warrants was highly judgmental as it involved our assessment of the significant assumptions used by the Company and
valuation specialist engaged by the Company because the fair value calculations were sensitive to changes in assumptions described above,
and certain inputs used in the determination of fair values were based on unobservable data, including, but not limited to, the volatility
and probability of exercise. 

To test the fair value of derivative liabilities,
we performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating the methodologies used in the valuation model and the significant
assumptions used by the Company and valuation specialist engaged by the Company. 

Allowance for doubtful accounts for premium
contract receivables and other related receivables 

As described in Notes 2 and 3 to the
consolidated financial statements, the carrying amount of the Premium Finance Contracts Contracts is reduced by an
allowance for losses that are maintained at a level which, in management s judgment, is adequate to absorb losses inherit in
the Contracts. The amount of the allowance is based upon management s evaluation of the collectability of the Contracts,
including the nature of the accounts, credit concentration, trends, historical data, specific impaired Contracts, economic
conditions, and other risks inherent in the Contracts. The allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses, which is charged
to expense, and reduced by charge-offs, net of recovery. 

Auditing management's estimate of the allowance
for doubtful accounts was highly judgmental as it involved our assessment of the historical data, collections and other inputs used by
the Company. 

To test the allowance for doubtful accounts, we
performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating the methodologies used in the determination of allowance for doubtful
account and the historical data, collections and other inputs used by the Company as well as the subsequent collections.

 Standard Premium Finance Management Corporation SPFMC or the Subsidiary was incorporated on April 23, 1991, pursuant to the laws of the State of Florida,
to engage principally in the insurance premium financing business. The Subsidiary is a licensed insurance premium finance company in seventeen
states. 

 On March 22, 2017, SPFH entered into an
agreement of share exchange with SPFMC and the shareholders of SPFMC common stock to facilitate the formation of SPFH that will own all
of the issued and outstanding shares of SPFMC. The shareholders of SPFMC agreed to exchange SPFMC common stock for newly issued shares
of SPFH common stock. For accounting purposes, this transaction is being accounted for as a merger of entities under common control and
has been treated as a recapitalization of SPFH with SPFMC as the accounting acquirer. The historical financial statements of the accounting
acquirer became the financial statements of the Company. We did not recognize goodwill or any intangible assets in connection with the
transaction. 

 The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of SPFH and its wholly-owned subsidiary SPFMC. SPFH and its Subsidiary are collectively referred to as the Company ). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

The Company experienced a cash overdraft of 
in its group of bank accounts at its primary lender as of December 31, 2021. As this group of bank accounts is funded by the Company s
line of credit (see Note 8), overdrafts are an expected part of the cash cycle. The Company is not charged any fees for overdrafts as
the line of credit funds the operating accounts daily. The Company actively manages its cash balances to minimize unnecessary interest
charges.

The Company controls its credit risk in accounts receivable

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial
Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which replaces the existing incurred
loss model for recognizing credit losses with an expected loss model referred to as the CECL model. Under the CECL model,
the Company is required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as insurance premium finance loans held for
investment, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on information about past events,
including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported
amount. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of the standard on the consolidated financial statements and plans
to adopt this standard in the first fiscal quarter of 2023.

becomes due and payable. 

(b) 
 Interest Rate Generally The Loan shall bear interest at a rate equal to the Contract Rate
for the Interest Rate Period in effect. Under no circumstances shall the interest be more than the Maximum Rate. The Index is not necessarily
the lowest rate charged by Bank on its loans. Bank will tell Borrower the current Index rate upon Borrower s request. The interest
rate change will not occur more often than each Interest Rate Change Date. Each change in the interest rate shall become effective, without
notice to the Borrower, on each Interest Rate Change Date following any change in the Index; provided, however, that if Index is not published

the Committed Amount, the Borrower will either execute a new note for the amount of such increase, or a new note for the aggregate increased
Committed Amount; and in either event, the term Note, as used herein, shall be deemed to mean and include such new note,
as the circumstances shall require. 

 7. Section
2.4 of the Loan Agreement is hereby modified and amended to adjust the annual facility fee from 0.35 of the Committed Amount to 0.25 
of the Committed Amount. The early termination fee set forth in Section 2.7 of the Loan Agreement is hereby reset such that the early
termination fee described under clause (i) of Section 2.7 shall be due and payable for prepayments made on or before the first anniversary
of the Amendment Date and the early termination fee described under clause (ii) of Section 2.7 shall be due and payable for prepayments
made after the first anniversary of the Amendment Date but prior to the Termination Date. Borrower acknowledges and agrees that it is
liable for all fees set forth in the Loan Agreement and ratifies and confirms its obligation to pay the same. 

 8. A
new Section 2.11 is hereby added to the Loan Agreement, to read as follows: 

 2.11 Index
Replacement . If Bank determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto absent manifest error)
that: 

 (i) 
 adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining Term SOFR including, without limitation,
because Term SOFR is not available or published on a current basis and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary; or 

(ii) 
 CME Group Benchmark Administration Ltd or any successor administrator of Term SOFR or a Governmental
Entity having or purporting to have jurisdiction over Bank or such administrator has made a public statement identifying a specific date
after which Term SOFR shall or will no longer be representative or made available, or used for determining the interest rate of loans,
or shall or will otherwise cease, or Term SOFR has failed to comply with the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO)
Principles for Financial Benchmarks; provided that, at the time of such statement, there is no successor administrator that is
satisfactory to Bank, that will continue to provide such applicable Term SOFR after such specific date; 

 then, Bank may amend this
Agreement solely for purpose of replacing Term SOFR with another alternate benchmark rate, which shall be the sum of an alternate benchmark
rate, and a benchmark rate spread adjustment (which may be a positive or negative value or zero), selected by Bank giving due consideration
to (i) any evolving or then-existing market convention for determining a rate of interest and spread adjustment, or method for calculating
such spread adjustment, for the replacement for the then-current benchmark rate for U.S. dollar-denominated syndicated or bilateral credit
facilities at such time, or (ii) as may be necessary or appropriate in the opinion of Bank to achieve a final all-in interest rate substantially
equivalent to that in effect prior to the cessation of Term SOFR (the Successor Rate ). Such
Successor Rate will become effective at 5:00 p.m. on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date notice of such Successor Rate is provided
to the Borrower without any amendment to this Agreement or further action or consent of the Borrower. 

 Notwithstanding anything
else herein, if at any time any Successor Rate as so determined would otherwise be less than one-half percent (0.5 ), the Successor Rate
will be deemed to be one-half percent (0.5 for the purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. 

 In connection with the implementation
of a Successor Rate, Bank will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action
or consent of any other party to this Agreement. Conforming Changes shall mean with respect to any Successor Rate, any technical,
administrative or operational changes, timing and frequency of determining rates and making payments of interest, timing of borrowing
requests or prepayment or other matters as may be appropriate, in the discretion of Bank, to reflect the adoption and implementation of
such Successor Rate. Any Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner consistent with market practice; provided that to the extent
such market practice is not administratively feasible for the Bank, such Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner as otherwise reasonably
determined by the Bank. 

 Bank does not warrant, nor
accept responsibility for, the continuation of, administration of, submission of, calculation of, or any other matter related to the rates
in the benchmark interest rates or indexes defined herein or with respect to any rate (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the selection
of such rate and any related spread or other adjustment) that is an alternative or replacement for or successor to any such rate or index
or the effect of any of the foregoing, or of any Conforming Changes. 

9. Section
6.10 of the Loan Agreement is hereby modified and amended to read as follows: 

 6.10 Minimum

items of expense or income and losses or gains from the sale of capital assets.
