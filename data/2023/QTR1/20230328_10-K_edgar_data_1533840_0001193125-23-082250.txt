 ATTESTATION REPORT ON ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH 
 SERVICING CRITERIA FOR ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES 
 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the Member of CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC 
 Houston, Texas We have examined management of CenterPoint
Energy Houston Electric, LLC s assertion, included in the accompanying Report on Assessment of Compliance with Servicing Criteria for Asset-Backed Securities for CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC, that CenterPoint Energy Houston
Electric, LLC (the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the 1,695 million original principal amount of CenterPoint Energy
Transition Bond Company IV, LLC s transition bonds (the 2012 Senior Secured Transition Bonds ), excluding criteria in Items 1122(d) (1)(ii) (outsourcing), (1)(iii) (back-up 
servicing), (1)(iv) (fidelity bond), (2)(ii) (wire transfer disbursements), (2)(vi) (unissued checks), (3)(ii) (allocation and remittance), (3)(iii) (disbursements to investors), (4)(iii) (additions, removals or
substitutions), (4)(v) (records regarding pool assets), (4)(ix) (adjustments to interest rates), (4)(xi) (payments on behalf of obligors), (4)(xii) (late payment penalties), (4)(xiii) (obligor disbursements), and
(4)(xv) (external credit enhancement) (the servicing criteria ), as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, which management has determined are not applicable to the activities performed by the Company with respect to the
2012 Senior Secured Transition Bonds. The Company s management is responsible for its assertion. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria based on
our examination. Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in
accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion is
fairly stated, in all material respects and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria, including tests on a sample basis of the servicing activities related to the
Platform, determining whether the Company performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria during the specified period, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our procedures
were limited to selected servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report and, accordingly, such samples may not have included servicing activities related to each asset-backed transaction included in the 2012
Senior Secured Transition Bonds. Further, an examination is not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to the period specified above that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by
the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 We are required to be independent of the Company and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to
the engagement. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 
 In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2022, for the 2012 Senior Secured Transition Bonds, is fairly stated, in all material respects. /s/ DELOITTE TOUCHE LLP

Exhibit 34.2 
 ATTESTATION REPORT ON ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH 
 SERVICING CRITERIA FOR ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES 
 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 Deutsche Bank National Trust Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas 
 We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management s Assertion of Compliance, that Trust Agency Services
department of Deutsche Bank National Trust Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (collectively the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s
Regulation AB for the publicly-issued (i.e., transaction-level reporting required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) and certain privately-issued (i.e., for which transaction-level reporting is required pursuant to contractual
obligation) residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities and other asset- backed securities issued on or after January 1, 2006, for which the Company provides trustee, certificate administrator, securities
administration, paying agent or custodian services, as defined in the transaction agreements, excluding publicly-issued securities sponsored or issued by any government sponsored entity (the Platform ), as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2022, except for criteria 1122(d)(4)(iv) 1122(d)(4)(xiv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the servicing platform covered by this report. Refer to Appendix A
of Management s Assertion of Compliance for the asset backed transactions covered by this platform. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than all of the individual asset backed transactions and securities that comprise the platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities related to the Platform and
determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities
performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or
reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. Although the Company is responsible for assessing compliance with criteria 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(iii) and
1122(d)(4)(iii) of Regulation AB, there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities during the year ended December 31, 2022. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. We are required to be independent of the Company and to meet our ethical responsibilities, in accordance with
the relevant ethical requirements related to our examination engagement. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s
compliance with the servicing criteria. In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 for the Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects. /s/ Ernst Young LLP
