 PART I Item 1. Business. Introduction Formed as a Delaware corporation in 1987, Full House Resorts, Inc. owns, leases, operates, develops, manages, and/or invests in casinos and related hospitality and entertainment facilities. References in this document to Full House, the Company, we, our, or us refer to Full House Resorts, Inc. and its subsidiaries, except where stated or the context otherwise indicates. The Company currently operates six casinos: five on real estate that we own or lease and one located within a hotel owned by a third party. Construction continues for a seventh property, Chamonix Casino Hotel Chamonix ), adjacent to our existing Bronco Billy s Casino and Hotel in Cripple Creek, Colorado. We are also designing our permanent American Place casino destination, which will be built adjacent to a temporary facility that we opened in February 2023 named The Temporary by American Place The Temporary ). We intend to operate The Temporary until the opening of American Place. Additionally, we benefit from seven permitted sports wagering skins three in Colorado, three in Indiana, and one in Illinois. Other companies currently operate or will operate these online sports wagering sites under their brands, paying us a percentage of revenues, as defined, subject to annual minimum amounts. Alternatively, we may also choose to operate any available skins ourselves in the future. The following table presents selected information concerning our casino resort properties as of December 31, 2022:

 Our mission is to maximize stockholder value, while also being good employers and community participants. We seek to increase revenues by providing our customers with their favorite games and amenities, high-quality customer service, and appropriate customer loyalty programs. Our customers include nearby residents who represent a high potential for repeat visits, along with drive-in tourist patrons. We continuously focus on improving the operating results of our existing properties through a combination of revenue growth and expense management efforts. The casino resort industry is capital-intensive, and we rely on the ability of our properties to generate operating cash flow to pay interest, repay debt, and fund maintenance and certain growth-related capital expenditures. We also continually assess the potential impact of growth and development opportunities, including capital investments at our existing properties, the development of new properties, and the acquisition of existing properties. Our casino properties generally operate 24 hours each day, 365 days per year. We also operate the hotel, food and beverage, and other on-site operations at Silver Slipper Casino and Hotel Silver Slipper ), Bronco Billy s Casino and Hotel Bronco Billy s ), Rising Star Casino Resort Rising Star and Stockman s Casino Stockman s ), as well as a golf course, recreational vehicle park RV park and ferry service at Rising Star and an RV park at Silver Slipper. At Grand Lodge Casino Grand Lodge ), the adjoining hotel and the food and beverage outlets are managed by Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe Resort, Spa and Casino Hyatt Lake Tahoe ). In February 2023, we opened The Temporary. The Temporary currently operates for 20 hours per day, which may be expanded as operations continue to ramp up and we hire more employees. Operating Properties Silver Slipper Casino and Hotel (Hancock County, Mississippi) The Silver Slipper is the western-most casino on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, midway between Biloxi, Mississippi and New Orleans, Louisiana. The property sits at the western end of an approximately eight-mile-long white sand beach, the closest such beach to the New Orleans and Baton Rouge metropolitan areas. Its customers are primarily from communities in southwestern Mississippi and southern Louisiana, including the North Shore of Lake Pontchartrain and the New Orleans and Baton Rouge metropolitan areas. In addition to its large, modern casino, the Silver Slipper offers 129 hotel rooms or suites, an on-site sportsbook, a fine-dining restaurant, a buffet, a quick-service restaurant, an oyster bar, a casino bar and a beachfront pool and bar. The Silver Slipper currently generates the most revenue and operating income of any of our properties. The primary lease for the Silver Slipper includes approximately 38 acres, consisting of the seven-acre parcel on which the casino and hotel is situated and approximately 31 acres of protected marshlands. The lease term ends in April 2058. Through October 1, 2027, we have the option to buy out the lease. We also manage a nearby 37-space, beachfront RV park under a management contract, which expires on March 31, 2025, unless canceled by either party with prior notice of 180 days. Bronco Billy s Casino and Hotel (Cripple Creek, Colorado) Bronco Billy s is located in Cripple Creek, Colorado, a historical gold mining town located approximately one hour from Colorado Springs and two hours from Denver. Its customers are primarily from the Colorado Springs/Pueblo/Ca on City metropolitan area, the second-largest metropolitan area in Colorado, with a population of approximately 982,000 residents. Its secondary market, the Denver metropolitan area, has a population of approximately four million people. Bronco Billy s occupies a significant portion of the key city block of Cripple Creek s casino strip. In addition to gaming space, it currently offers 14 hotel rooms, two casual dining outlets, and a steakhouse that was temporarily closed in May 2022 for renovation work. Bronco Billy s owns much of its real estate, but also leases certain parking lots and buildings, including a portion of the hotel and casino, under a long-term lease. The lease has six renewal options in three-year increments through January 2035, and we have the right to buy out the lease at any time during its term. We also commenced a three-year lease in August 2018 for a key corner on our block that was subsequently extended through August 2023, which also includes an option to buy out the lease.

 We are allowed to offer online sports wagering through three sports skins in Colorado. Rather than operate these sports skins ourselves, we contracted with three companies to operate such skins under their own brands in exchange for a percentage of revenues, as defined in each contract, subject to annual minimum amounts paid to us. For Colorado, the sum of the minimum annual amounts is expected to be 3 million, including a contract that we signed in December 2022. We could receive more than 3 million on an annualized basis if our percentage-share of sports revenue exceeds our contractual minimums. We incur minimal expenses related to these revenues. As of December 31, 2022, two of our skins were live, and our third skin began its contractual term in March 2023 (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ). Chamonix Casino Hotel (Cripple Creek, Colorado) In 2018, we began planning and design work on Chamonix, a new and distinct, luxury hotel and casino, to be located adjacent to Bronco Billy s in Cripple Creek. Following changes made to the state s gaming laws in November 2020, including the elimination of betting limits and the approval of new table games, we increased the size of Chamonix by 67 to approximately 300 luxury guest rooms and suites, from our previously-planned 180 guest rooms. Our construction budget for Chamonix is approximately 250 million. To fund such construction, on February 12, 2021 we issued 310 million aggregate principal amount of 8.25 Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the 2028 Notes and placed a portion of such proceeds into a restricted cash account dedicated to Chamonix s construction (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ). We expect to open Chamonix in phases, beginning in the third quarter of 2023. Rising Star Casino Resort (Rising Sun, Indiana) Rising Star is located on the banks of the Ohio River in Rising Sun, Indiana, approximately one hour from Cincinnati, Ohio, and within two hours of Indianapolis, Indiana, and Louisville and Lexington, Kentucky. In addition to its casino, Rising Star offers a land-based pavilion with approximately 31,500 square feet of meeting and convention space; a contiguous 190-guest-room hotel; an adjacent, leased 104-guest-room hotel set on three acres; a 56-space RV park; four dining outlets; surface parking; and an 18-hole golf course on over 230 acres. The 104-guest-room hotel is leased pursuant to an agreement that expires in October 2027 and contains a bargain purchase option, whereby we have the right to purchase the hotel and the landlord has the right to put the hotel to us, in both cases for 1 upon maturity of the lease. We also own 1.3 acres located in Burlington, Kentucky that is used as part of our ferry boat operations, which connects the more populous Boone County, Kentucky to our Rising Star property in Indiana. We are allowed to offer online sports wagering through three sports skins in Indiana. As in Colorado, we contracted with three companies to operate such skins under their own brands in exchange for a percentage of revenues, as defined in each contract, subject to annual minimum amounts. The sum of the minimum annual amounts in Indiana is currently 2 million with minimal expected expenses. If our percentage-share of sports revenue exceeds our contractual minimums in one or more contracts, then we should receive in excess of 2 million from our Indiana sports agreements on an annualized basis. As of December 31, 2022, two of our skins were live; the third skin operator ceased operations on May 15, 2022. We are currently evaluating whether to operate the idle skin ourselves or find a replacement operator. There is no certainty that we will be able to enter into an agreement with a replacement operator or successfully operate it ourselves. Stockman s Casino (Fallon, Nevada) Stockman s is located in Churchill County, Nevada, approximately one hour from Reno, Nevada. Stockman s primarily serves the local market of Fallon and surrounding areas, including the nearby Fallon Naval Air Station, which is the Navy s premier air training facility, informally referred to as the Top Gun school. In addition to its casino, Stockman s offers a bar, fine-dining restaurant and coffee shop. Grand Lodge Casino (Incline Village, Nevada) We operate Grand Lodge at the Hyatt Lake Tahoe under a lease with Incline Hotel, LLC. Grand Lodge is located within the Hyatt Lake Tahoe in Incline Village, Nevada on the north shore of Lake Tahoe and includes approximately 20,990 square feet of leased space. The Hyatt Lake Tahoe is one of three AAA Four Diamond hotels in the Lake Tahoe area. Our casino s customers consist of both locals and tourists visiting the Lake Tahoe area.

 Subsequent to year-end, we and our landlord extended our lease through December 31, 2024. The lease is secured by our interests under such lease, consisting of certain collateral (as defined and described in a security agreement), and is subordinate to both our 8.25 Senior Secured Notes due 2028 and Revolving Credit Facility due 2026. We own the personal property, including slot machines. The landlord currently has an option to purchase our leasehold interest and operating assets of the Grand Lodge Casino at a defined price based partially on earnings. American Place / The Temporary (Waukegan, Illinois) In December 2021, we were chosen by the Illinois Gaming Board IGB to develop American Place, a new gaming and entertainment destination located in Waukegan, Illinois, a northern suburb of Chicago, subject to final regulatory approvals. Waukegan is the county seat of Lake County, which has a population of approximately 714,000. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Lake County is the third most populous county in the state, and one of the wealthier counties in both Illinois and the United States. In February 2023, we began opening The Temporary by American Place, a temporary casino facility that we will operate while the larger, more lavish American Place facility is under construction. In Spring 2023, we expect to augment the number of available games on our casino floor and increase the hours of operation for our casino and its amenities. We also expect to open The Temporary s second restaurant in the coming weeks, followed by our fine-dining restaurant in the second quarter of 2023. When fully open, The Temporary will feature approximately 1,000 slot machines, 50 table games, a fine-dining restaurant, two additional restaurants, and a center bar. The permanent American Place facility is slated to include a world-class casino with a state-of-the-art sports book; a premium boutique hotel comprised of 20 luxurious villas; a 1,500-seat live entertainment venue; a gourmet restaurant designed to rival the finest restaurants in Chicago; additional eateries and bars; and other amenities that will attract gaming and non-gaming patrons from throughout Chicagoland and beyond. The Temporary and American Place are located on approximately 42 acres of land, consisting of approximately 10 acres of owned land and an adjoining approximately 32 acres that are under a 99-year lease with the City of Waukegan. Government Regulation The gaming industry is highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. Each of our casinos is subject to extensive regulation under the laws, rules, and regulations of the jurisdiction in which it is located. These laws, rules, and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability, and character of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interests in the gaming operations and include, without limitation, the following conditions and restrictions: Periodic license fees and taxes must be paid to state and local gaming authorities; Certain officers, directors, key employees, and gaming employees are required to be licensed or otherwise approved by the gaming authorities; Individuals who must be approved by the gaming authorities must submit comprehensive personal disclosure forms and undergo an extensive background investigation; Changes in any licensed or approved individuals must be reported to and/or approved by the relevant gaming authority; Failure to timely file the required application forms by any individual required to be approved by the relevant gaming authority may result in that individual s denial and the gaming licensee may be required by the gaming authority to disassociate with that individual; and If any individual is found unsuitable by a gaming authority, the gaming licensee is required to disassociate with that individual. 
 Violations of gaming laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions. A summary of the governmental gaming regulations to which we are subject is filed as Exhibit 99.1 and is herein incorporated by reference.

 Our businesses are also subject to other various federal, state, and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, smoking, environmental matters, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, construction, land use, and marketing and advertising. We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional discussion. Costs and Effects of Compliance with Environmental Laws We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations, including emissions and discharges into the environment, and the handling and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes. For example, our Indiana property is subject to environmental regulations for its riverboat, ferry boat and golf club operations. Our Mississippi property is located near environmental wetlands. In Colorado and Illinois, we are building major new casino hotels and such construction must also adhere to certain environmental regulations. Our Colorado facilities, for example, are in historical mining areas. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in costs for corrective action, penalties or the imposition of other liabilities or restrictions. We also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and clean-up responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of the property may be liable for the costs of remediating contaminated soil or groundwater on or from its property, without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or caused, the contamination, and may also incur liability to third parties impacted by such contamination. The presence of contamination, or failure to remediate it properly, may adversely affect our ability to use, sell or rent the property. To date, none of these matters or other matters arising under environmental laws has had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations; however, we cannot assure you that such matters will not have such an effect in the future. Competition The gaming industry is highly competitive. Gaming activities with which we compete include traditional commercial casinos and casino resorts in various states, including on tribal lands and at racetracks; state-sponsored lotteries; video poker in restaurants, bars and hotels; pari-mutuel betting on horse and dog racing and jai alai; sports betting; and card rooms. We also face competition from Internet lotteries, sweepstakes, and other Internet gaming services, beyond those in which we participate. Internet gaming services, which are legal in some states, allow customers to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and play Las Vegas-style casino games from home or in non-casino settings. Although there is no meaningful evidence to date that this has been the case, this could divert customers from our properties, and thus, adversely affect our business. All of our casinos, as well as other casinos that we may develop or acquire, compete with all these forms of gaming. We also compete with any new forms or jurisdictions of gaming that may be legalized, as well as with other types of entertainment. Some of our competitors have more personnel and greater financial or other resources than we do. The principal methods of competition are: location, with casinos located closer to their feeder markets at an advantage; casino, lodging, entertainment and other hospitality product quality in terms of facilities, customer service and ease of access; breadth of offerings, including the types of casino games and other non-gaming amenities; and marketing, including the amount, quality, and frequency of promotions offered to guests. Silver Slipper Casino and Hotel Silver Slipper is in Mississippi, but is close to the North Shore of Lake Pontchartrain, one of the most affluent and fastest-growing regions in Louisiana. Louisiana law permits 15 riverboat casinos, one land-based casino, four casinos at racetracks, and in certain areas, a limited number of slot machines at qualifying truck stops and off-track betting parlors. The legislation permitting riverboat and truck stop casinos requires a local referendum. At this time, all licenses for riverboat casinos in Louisiana have been granted and only one of such casinos is not currently in operation. In 2021, the owners of the closed casino attempted to move their gaming license from Bossier City to Slidell, Louisiana, where it would have competed with the Silver Slipper. Such efforts were not successful, as voters rejected the casino referendum by a vote of 63 to 37 . Mississippi does not have a limitation on the number of casino licenses, but requires casinos to be within approximately 800 feet of the Mississippi River shoreline or the Gulf of Mexico, as defined by state law. There are occasionally proposals to relocate casinos within Louisiana or to develop new casinos in Mississippi, but there are considerable political and economic constraints on such potential competition. Management does not believe such efforts will be successful in the foreseeable future.

 Bronco Billy s Casino and Hotel and Chamonix Casino Hotel Bronco Billy s and Chamonix are located in Cripple Creek, Colorado, which is a historical gold mining town located approximately one hour from Colorado Springs, on the west side of Pikes Peak. Cripple Creek is one of only three locations in Colorado where commercial gaming is permitted. The other two cities adjoin each other and are approximately one hour west of Denver and two hours from Colorado Springs. Downtown Denver and Colorado Springs are approximately 70 miles apart and certain suburbs of each metropolitan area largely merge into the other. Two Native American gaming operations also exist in southwestern Colorado and there are tribal casinos in Oklahoma, but these are much further from Colorado Springs and Denver than Cripple Creek. There are no federally-recognized Native American tribes in the Colorado Front Range, which includes Denver and Colorado Springs. As of December 31, 2022, Bronco Billy s was one of nine gaming facilities operating in Cripple Creek. One of those competitors added a 100-guest-room hotel in 2021. Chamonix, which is currently under construction, will be significantly larger and is planned to be higher in quality than any of the existing casinos in Cripple Creek. Rising Star Casino Resort Rising Star Casino Resort is located on the banks of the Ohio River in Rising Sun, Indiana, approximately one hour from Cincinnati, Ohio, and within two hours of Indianapolis, Indiana, and Louisville and Lexington, Kentucky. One of three riverboat casinos in southeastern Indiana, its closest competitors are each approximately 15 miles away, near bridges crossing the Ohio River. There is no bridge at Rising Star, but in September 2018, we commenced a ferry boat service connecting Rising Sun, Indiana, to the populous Northern Kentucky region. Rising Star also competes with a large land-based casino near Louisville; casinos in Ohio and elsewhere in Indiana; and slot parlors associated with racetracks in Kentucky. A significant slot parlor associated with a racetrack opened in Northern Kentucky in September 2022. Stockman s Casino Stockman s Casino is the largest of several casinos in Churchill County, Nevada, which has a population of approximately 25,000 residents. Churchill County is also the home of the Fallon Naval Air Station, the United States Navy s premier air training facility, informally referred to as the Top Gun school. While the Navy appears to be expanding its base in Fallon, a reduction of its activities at the base would likely have an adverse effect on Stockman s results of operations. Fallon is approximately 30 minutes east of the large Tesla battery factory and other developments in the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center. Stockman s also competes with casinos in other rural communities in the area, as well as with casinos in Reno, some of which are significantly larger and offer more amenities. Grand Lodge Casino Grand Lodge is located in Incline Village, Nevada, and is one of four casinos located within a five-mile radius in the North Lake Tahoe area. Grand Lodge Casino also competes with casinos in South Lake Tahoe and Reno. There are also numerous Native American casinos in California serving the Northern California market. American Place / The Temporary The Temporary (and, upon opening, American Place) compete against two existing casinos which primarily serve the suburbs north of Chicago, a tribal casino in Milwaukee, and slot machines in bars (limited to six machines per bar) in many parts of Illinois. The Temporary is the only full-service casino in Lake County, Illinois, which has a population of approximately 700,000 residents. Including areas neighboring Lake County, we estimate that The Temporary is the closest casino to more than one million individuals. The permanent American Place facility is being designed to offer more, and better, amenities than any other casino operating today in Illinois.

Our properties do not have coordinated loyalty programs, due to the disparate locations of our properties. Instead, our loyalty programs focus on providing each casino s customers the amenities they most prefer in each market. Intellectual Property We use a variety of trademarks, patents and copyrights in our operations and believe that we have all the licenses necessary to conduct our continuing operations. We have registered several trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office or otherwise acquired the licenses to use certain trademarks, patents and copyrights that are material to conduct our business. Employees As of March 1, 2023, we had 13 full-time corporate employees, four of whom are executive officers and one additional senior management employee. Our casino properties had 1,268 full-time and 259 part-time employees, as follows:

 Summary of Risk Factors The following is a summary of the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10-K. This summary should be read in conjunction with those Risk Factors and should not be relied upon as an exhaustive summary of the material risks facing our business. Risks Related to our Business and Operations We face significant competition from other gaming and entertainment operations. We may face revenue declines if discretionary consumer spending drops due to an economic downturn. We cannot assure you that any of our contracted sports betting parties, through the use of our permitted website skins, will be able to compete effectively, that our contracted sports parties will have the ability and/or willingness to sustain sports betting operations should they experience an extended period of unprofitability, or that we will have the ability to replace existing partners or vendors on similar terms as our existing contractual revenue minimums. Marine transportation is inherently risky, and insurance may be insufficient to cover losses that may occur to our assets or result from our ferry boat operations. Our Mississippi casino hotel currently generates a significant percentage of our revenues and Adjusted EBITDA. Our ability to meet our operating and debt service requirements is dependent, in part, upon the continued success of that property. We derive our revenues and operating income from our properties located in Mississippi, Colorado, Indiana, Nevada and Illinois, and are especially subject to certain risks, including economic and competitive risks, associated with the conditions in those areas and in the states from which we draw patrons. Some of our operations are located on leased property. If the lessor of the Grand Lodge Casino exercises its buyout rights or if we default on this or certain of our other leases, the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the affected casino. A prolonged closure of our casinos would negatively impact our ability to service our debt. The impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business and results of operations remains uncertain. Adverse weather conditions, road construction, gasoline shortages and other factors affecting our facilities and the areas in which we operate could make it more difficult for potential customers to travel to our properties and deter customers from visiting our properties. Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the occurrence of natural disasters, including as a result of climate change, such as hurricanes, floods, wildfires, pandemics, epidemics, widespread health emergencies, or outbreaks of infectious diseases such as the coronavirus pandemic, or other catastrophic events, including war, terrorism and gun violence. Several of our properties, including Silver Slipper, Bronco Billy s and Rising Star, are accessed by our customers via routes that have few alternatives. We may incur property and other losses that are not adequately covered by insurance, including adequate levels of Weather Catastrophe Occurrence/Named Windstorm, Flood and Earthquake insurance coverage for our properties. We depend on our key personnel and our ability to attract and retain employees. Higher wage and benefit costs could adversely affect our business. Rising operating costs at our gaming properties could have a negative impact on our business. We face the risk of fraud and cheating. Win rates for our gaming operations depend on a variety of factors, some beyond our control. The concentration and evolution of the slot machine manufacturing industry could impose additional costs on us. Our business may be adversely affected by legislation prohibiting tobacco smoking. We rely on, among other things, trademarks, licenses, confidentiality procedures, and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights and we may be unable to protect or may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property rights. Our commercial success depends upon us avoiding the infringement of intellectual property rights owned by others and any such infringements, including those that are inadvertent, may have a material adverse effect on our business. We are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility and reputation.

 Risks Related to Development and Growth Opportunities We are engaged from time to time in one or more construction and development projects, including Chamonix and American Place, and many factors could prevent us from completing them as planned. The construction costs for our growth projects, including Chamonix and American Place, may exceed budgeted amounts plus contingencies, which may result in insufficient funds to complete these projects or the need to raise additional capital. There is no assurance that our growth projects, including Chamonix and American Place, will not be subject to additional regulatory restrictions, delays, or challenges. There is no assurance that our growth projects, including Chamonix and American Place, will be successful. Failure to comply with the terms of our construction disbursement agreement related to Chamonix could limit our access to funds. We face a number of challenges prior to opening new or upgraded facilities. We may face disruption and other difficulties in integrating and managing facilities we have recently developed or acquired, or may develop or acquire in the future. The construction of Chamonix and American Place may inconvenience customers and disrupt business activity at the adjoining Bronco Billy s casino and the Temporary, respectively. The permanent American Place facility, additional growth projects or potential enhancements at our properties may require us to raise additional capital. The casino, hotel and resort industry is capital intensive, and we may not be able to finance expansion and renovation projects, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. We may face risks related to our ability to receive regulatory approvals required to complete certain acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures, and other developments, as well as other potential delays in completing certain transactions. If we fail to obtain necessary government approvals in a timely manner, or at all, it can adversely impact our various expansion, development, investment and renovation projects. Insufficient or lower-than-expected results generated from our new developments and acquired properties may negatively affect our operating results and financial condition. Risks Related to our Indebtedness Our significant indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations. The indenture governing the Notes and the Credit Facility impose restrictive covenants and limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business and lead to events of default if we do not comply with the covenants. To service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to service all of our indebtedness and fund our operating expenses, working capital needs and capital expenditures, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful. We depend on our subsidiaries for certain dividends, distributions and repayment of our indebtedness, including the Notes and any borrowings under the Credit Facility. Our ability to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms may be limited. The obligations under the Notes and the Credit Facility are collateralized by a security interest in substantially all of our assets, so if we default on those obligations, the holders of the Notes and lenders under the Credit Facility could foreclose on our assets. In addition, the existence of these security interests may adversely affect our financial flexibility. We and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt, which could further exacerbate the risks described above. Risks Related to our Legal and Regulatory Environment We face extensive regulation from gaming and other regulatory authorities and the cost of compliance or failure to comply with such regulations may adversely affect our business and results of operations. Changes in legislation and regulation of our business could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Stockholders may be required to dispose of their shares of our common stock if they are found unsuitable by gaming authorities.

 We are subject to environmental laws and potential exposure to environmental liabilities. We are subject to litigation which, if adversely determined, could cause us to incur substantial losses. Our ferry boat service is highly regulated, which can adversely affect our operations. Risks Related to Technology Our gaming operations rely heavily on technology services and an uninterrupted supply of electrical power. If we experience damage or service interruptions, we may have to cease some or all of our operations, which will result in a decrease in revenue. Our information technology and other systems are subject to cyber-security risk, misappropriation of customer information and other breaches of information security. General Risks Our ability to utilize our net operating loss NOL carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited. The market price for our common stock may be volatile, and investors may not be able to sell their stock at a favorable price, or at all. The exercise of outstanding options to purchase common stock may result in substantial dilution and may depress the trading price of our common stock. Risks Related to our Business and Operations We face significant competition from other gaming and entertainment operations. The gaming industry is characterized by an increasingly high degree of competition among a large number of participants. Our casinos and contracted sport wagering businesses compete with other forms of gaming, such as casinos, racetracks, state-sponsored lotteries, sweepstakes, charitable gaming, video gaming terminals at bars, restaurants, taverns and truck stops, illegal slot machines and skill games, fantasy sports and internet or mobile-based gaming platforms, including online gaming and sports betting. Certain state and other jurisdictions are considering expansion of such forms of gaming. Each of these could divert customers from our casinos and services, and thus materially and adversely affect our business. In most markets, we compete directly with other casino facilities operating in the immediate and surrounding market areas. In some markets, we face competition from nearby markets in addition to direct competition within our market areas. As competing properties and new markets are opened, our operating results may be negatively impacted. In addition, some of our direct competitors in certain markets may have superior facilities and/or operating conditions. We expect each existing or future market in which we participate to be highly competitive. The competitive position of each of our casino properties is discussed in Part I, Item 1. Business Competition . In a broader sense, our casinos and sports wagering businesses face competition from all manner of leisure and entertainment activities, including other non-gaming resorts and vacation destinations, shopping, athletic events, television and movies, concerts, and travel. We may face revenue declines if discretionary consumer spending drops due to an economic downturn. Our revenues are highly dependent upon the volume and spending levels of customers at our properties and, as such, our business has been in the past, and could be in the future, adversely impacted by economic downturns. Decreases in discretionary consumer spending brought about by factors such as, but not limited to, lackluster recoveries from recessions; increases in costs of goods and services due to continued or increased inflationary pressures; pandemics, epidemics, widespread health emergencies, or outbreaks of infectious diseases such as COVID-19; high unemployment levels; higher income taxes; low levels of consumer confidence; weakness or uncertainty in the housing market; cultural and demographic changes; the impact of high energy, fuel, food and healthcare costs; fears of war or actual conflicts, such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine, civil unrest, terrorism or violence; and increased stock market volatility may negatively impact our revenues and operating cash flow. This could lead to a reduction in discretionary spending by our guests on entertainment and leisure activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, cash flow and results of operations. Furthermore, during periods of economic contraction, our revenues may decrease while many of our costs remain fixed and some costs may increase, resulting in decreased earnings.

 We cannot assure you that any of our contracted sports betting parties, through the use of our permitted website skins, will be able to compete effectively, that our contracted sports parties will have the ability and/or willingness to sustain sports betting operations should they experience an extended period of unprofitability, or that we will have the ability to replace existing partners or vendors on similar terms as our existing contractual revenue minimums or operate the skins ourselves. Our contracted sports betting parties, through the use of our permitted website skins, compete in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive market against an increasing number of competitors. The success of their sports betting operations is dependent on a number of factors that are beyond their control, and ours, including the ultimate tax rates and license fees charged by jurisdictions across the United States; their ability to gain market share in a newly developing market; the timeliness and the technological and popular viability of their products; their ability to compete with new entrants in the market; changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences; and the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment. While our current agreements with our contracted sports betting parties provide us with contractual minimums for revenue upon their launch of operations, we cannot assure you that any of our contracted sports parties will be able to compete effectively or that they will have the ability or willingness to sustain sports betting operations for an extended period of unprofitability. Should any of our contracted sports betting parties cease operations, whether due to unprofitability or for other reasons, there can be no assurance that we will be able to replace them on similar terms as our existing agreements or at all, or that we will be able to successfully operate the skins ourselves. Marine transportation is inherently risky, and insurance may be insufficient to cover losses that may occur to our assets or result from our ferry boat operations. The operation of our ferry boat is subject to various inherent risks, including: catastrophic marine disasters and accidents; adverse weather conditions or natural disasters; mechanical failure or equipment damage; hazardous substance spills; and navigation and human errors. The occurrence of any of these events may result in, among other things, damage to or loss of our ferry boat, damage to other vessels and the environment, loss of revenues, short-term or long-term interruption of ferry boat service, termination of our vessel charter or other contracts, fines, penalties or other restrictions on conducting business, damage to our reputation and customer relationships, and death or injury to personnel and passengers. Such occurrences may also result in a significant increase in our operating costs or liability to third parties. Our Mississippi casino hotel currently generates a significant percentage of our revenues and Adjusted EBITDA. Our ability to meet our operating and debt service requirements is dependent, in part, upon the continued success of that property. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated 49.5 of our revenues and 51.7 of our Adjusted Segment EBITDA from our casino resort in Mississippi. Therefore, until our new developments are operating, our results will be dependent on the regional economies and competitive landscapes at our Mississippi property. Likewise, our ability to meet our operating and debt service requirements is dependent, in part, upon the continued success of this property. We derive our revenues and operating income from our properties located in Mississippi, Colorado, Indiana, Nevada and Illinois, and are especially subject to certain risks, including economic and competitive risks, associated with the conditions in those areas and in the states from which we draw patrons. Because we derive our revenues and operating income from properties concentrated in five states, we are subject to greater risks from regional conditions than a gaming company with operating properties in a greater number of different geographic regions. A decrease in revenues from, or an increase in costs for, one of these locations is likely to have a proportionally greater impact on our business and operations than it would for a gaming company with more geographically diverse operating properties. Risks from regional conditions include the following: 
 14 

Table of Contents 
 regional economic conditions; regional competitive conditions, including legalization or expansion of gaming in Mississippi, Colorado, Indiana, Nevada, Illinois or in neighboring states; allowance of new types of gaming, such as the introduction of online sports wagering in Louisiana or Internet gaming; reduced land or air travel due to increasing fuel costs or transportation disruptions; and, vulnerability to regional economic downturns in the markets in which we operate. Some of our operations are located on leased property. If the lessor of the Grand Lodge Casino exercises its buyout rights or if we default on this or certain of our other leases, the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the affected casino. We lease certain parcels of land at our Silver Slipper Casino and Hotel in Mississippi, certain land and buildings at Bronco Billy s Hotel and Casino in Colorado (much of which is to be utilized for Chamonix), one of the two hotels at our Rising Star Casino Resort in Indiana, and certain parcels at American Place in Illinois. We also lease casino space at our Grand Lodge Casino in Nevada. Unless we have a purchase option under such leases and exercise such option, we will have no interest in the improvements thereon at the expiration of the leases. We have purchase options on substantially all of our leased property, except for our corporate offices and the Grand Lodge Casino. It is either currently more advantageous for us to continue to lease rather than exercise such buyout options, or we have certain restrictions which only allow us to exercise the purchase option during certain future time periods. The obligations under the Notes and the Credit Facility are collateralized by a security interest in substantially all of our assets. The Notes contain representations and warranties, financial covenants, and restrictions on dividends customary for notes of this type. Mandatory prepayments, in whole or in part, of the Notes will be required upon the occurrence of certain events, including sales of certain assets, upon certain changes of control, or should the Company have certain unused funds in the construction disbursement account following the completion of Chamonix. The Credit Facility contains a number of negative covenants that, subject to certain exceptions, are substantially similar to the covenants contained in the Notes. The Credit Facility also requires compliance with a financial covenant as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, such that Adjusted EBITDA (as defined) for the trailing twelve-month period must equal or exceed the utilized portion of the Credit Facility, if drawn. Under certain circumstances and at the expirations of the underlying leases, we might be forced to exercise our buyout options in order to continue to operate those properties. There is no certainty that the funds could be raised at that time at a reasonable cost, or at all, to exercise some or all of the buyout options. The operating lease at the Grand Lodge Casino, which is set to expire on December 31, 2024, includes certain lessor buyout rights based upon a multiple of EBITDA that, if exercised, could result in the lessor purchasing our leasehold interest and the operating assets on terms that may be less than fair market value or financially unfavorable to us. Since we do not completely control the land, buildings, hotel and space underlying our leased properties, a lessor could take certain actions to disrupt our rights under the long-term leases, which are beyond our control. If the entity owning any leased land, buildings, hotel or space were to disrupt our use either permanently or for a significant period of time, and we were not in a position to exercise our buyout rights at that time, then the value of our assets could be impaired and our business and operations could be adversely affected. If we were to default on the lease, then the lessor could terminate the affected lease and we could lose possession of the affected land, buildings, hotel or space and any improvements thereon. The loss of the lease through exercise of buyout rights or through termination upon default could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations as we would then be unable to operate all or portions of the affected facilities, which, in turn, may result in a default under our debt agreements. A prolonged closure of our casinos would negatively impact our ability to service our debt. Our casinos are our primary sources of income and operating cash flows that we rely upon to pay all of our obligations and to remain in compliance with debt covenants under any indebtedness we may incur and meet our obligations when due. Because we operate in several different jurisdictions, we are subject to different legal and market conditions in order to remain open. We have no control over and cannot predict the length of any future operating restrictions or future closures of our casinos and hotels. Any required closures may require us to seek to amend our debt agreements, though there is no certainty that we would be successful in such efforts. Additionally, we may be required to seek additional liquidity through the issuance of new debt or equity, or through the sale of certain assets. Our ability to obtain additional financing would depend in part on factors outside of our control.

 The impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business and results of operations remains uncertain. The extent of the ongoing and future effects of pandemics, including COVID-19 and new variants, on our business remains uncertain and depends on a number of factors that are beyond our control, including the possibility that governmental regulations and directives enacted in the future may limit the operations of our properties or prohibit or discourage customers from visiting our properties. Our ability to attract customers to our properties and results of operations would be negatively impacted if we were required to reinstate limitations on the number of customers present in our facilities, reduce gaming operations, restrict hotel, food and beverage outlets or special events or implement other social distancing or health and safety measures. In addition, even as the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, the disruption already caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may still lead to prolonged changes in consumer behavior, the effects of which are still yet to be fully realized. The ultimate economic impacts to us of the evolving COVID-19 pandemic are uncertain and difficult to predict and could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Adverse weather conditions, road construction, gasoline shortages and other factors affecting our facilities and the areas in which we operate could make it more difficult for potential customers to travel to our properties and deter customers from visiting our properties. Our continued success depends upon our ability to draw customers from each of the geographic markets in which we operate. Adverse weather conditions or road construction can deter our customers from traveling to our facilities or make it difficult for them to frequent our properties. In recent years, there were severe cold temperatures that we believe adversely affected our Indiana and Mississippi properties financial performance, and historically abnormal snow levels and forest fires in the Lake Tahoe region adversely affected visitation and financial performance at Grand Lodge. Moreover, gasoline shortages or fuel price increases could make it more difficult for potential customers to travel to our properties and deter customers from visiting. Our dockside gaming facility in Indiana, as well as any additional riverboat or dockside casino properties that might be developed or acquired, are also subject to risks, in addition to those associated with land-based casinos, which could disrupt our operations. Although our Indiana casino vessel does not leave its moorings in normal operations, there are risks associated with the movement or mooring of vessels on waterways, including risks of casualty due to river turbulence, flooding, collisions with other vessels and severe weather conditions. Our ferry boat that we operate at Rising Star has similar risks as our Indiana casino vessel, as well as additional risks related to ferry boat operations. Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the occurrence of natural disasters, including as a result of climate change, such as hurricanes, floods, wildfires, pandemics, epidemics, widespread health emergencies, or outbreaks of infectious diseases such as the coronavirus pandemic, or other catastrophic events, including war, terrorism and gun violence. Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, potentially exacerbated by climate change, such as major hurricanes, tornadoes, typhoons, floods, fires and earthquakes, could adversely affect our business and operating results. Certain of our properties are located in areas that may be subject to extreme weather conditions. Hurricanes are common in the area in which our Mississippi property is located, and the severity of such natural disasters is unpredictable. In October 2020, Hurricane Zeta caused the temporary closure of the Silver Slipper and caused approximately 5 million of damage, most of which was covered by insurance. In 2005, prior to the development of the Silver Slipper, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita caused significant damage in the Gulf Coast region. Additionally, our Indiana property is at risk of flooding due to its proximity to the Ohio River. Wildfires are also increasing in frequency and intensity, and the Western United States and the Rocky Mountain Region have been experiencing continuing drought conditions. Conversely, recent months have seen larger than normal snowfall in the Lake Tahoe region, sometimes impacting regional travel. Bronco Billy s and Grand Lodge were adversely affected by nearby forest fires and the impacts therefrom. Changes in federal, state, and local legislation and regulation based on concerns about climate change could result in increased regulatory costs, which may include capital expenditures at our existing properties to ensure compliance with any new or updated regulations. This may also adversely affect our operations. There can be no assurance that the potential impacts of climate change and severe weather will not have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations or business. If a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, occurs in the United States or on a global scale, our business may be adversely affected. As described elsewhere in these Risk Factors, such events may result in closures of our properties, a period of business disruption, and/or in reduced operations, any of which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 Catastrophic events, such as terrorist and war activities in the United States and elsewhere, when they occur, have had a negative effect on travel and leisure expenditures, including lodging, gaming and tourism. Gun violence has also occurred at casinos, including a mass shooting at a casino in Las Vegas in 2017. We cannot accurately predict the extent to which such events may affect us, directly or indirectly, in the future. There also can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or choose to purchase any insurance coverage with respect to occurrences of terrorist and violent acts and any losses that could result from these acts. If there is a prolonged disruption at our properties due to natural disasters, terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Several of our properties, including Silver Slipper, Bronco Billy s and Rising Star, are accessed by our customers via routes that have few alternatives. The Silver Slipper is located at the end of a dead-end road, with no other access. Bronco Billy s is accessed by most guests via a mountain pass; if that pass is closed for any reason, the alternative is longer. Rising Star s primary access from Cincinnati is via a road alongside the Ohio River; if this road is closed, for example, by flooding, the alternative routes involve a ferry boat or more winding roads through the rolling hills inland from the river. If access to any of these roads is blocked for any significant period, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially affected. We may incur property and other losses that are not adequately covered by insurance, including adequate levels of Weather Catastrophe Occurrence/Named Windstorm, Flood and Earthquake insurance coverage for our properties. Although we maintain insurance that our management believes is customary and appropriate for our business, there can be no assurance that insurance will be available at reasonable costs in any given year or adequate to cover all losses and damage to which our business or our assets might be subjected. The lack of adequate insurance for certain types or levels of risk could expose us to significant losses in the event that a catastrophe occurred for which we are uninsured or under-insured. Any losses we incur that are not adequately covered by insurance may decrease our future operating income, require us to find replacements or repairs for destroyed property, and reduce the funds available for payments of our obligations. In addition, certain casualty events, such as labor strikes, nuclear events, acts of war, declines in visitation and loss of income due to fear of terrorism or other acts of violence, loss of electrical power due to catastrophic events, rolling blackouts or otherwise, deterioration or corrosion, insect or animal damage, pandemic-related shutdowns and pollution, may not be covered at all under our policies. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could, therefore, expose us to substantial uninsured losses. There is no certainty that insurance companies will continue to offer insurance at acceptable rates, or at all, in hurricane-prone areas or other areas affected by extreme weather, including the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Some insurance companies may significantly limit the amount of coverage they will write in these markets and increase the premiums charged for this coverage. Additionally, uncertainty can occur as to the viability of certain insurance companies. While we believe that the insurance companies from which we have purchased insurance policies will remain solvent, there is no certainty that this will be the case. We depend on our key personnel and our ability to attract and retain employees. We are highly dependent on the services of our executive management team and other members of our senior management team. Our ability to attract and retain key personnel is affected by the competitiveness of our compensation packages and the other terms and conditions of employment, our continued ability to compete effectively against other gaming companies, and our growth prospects. The loss of the services of any members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have faced increased challenges in attracting and retaining qualified employees, particularly in light of recent labor shortages, including increased employee resignations that took place throughout the United States as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. If we fail to retain our current employees, it would be difficult and costly to identify, recruit and train replacements needed to continue to conduct and expand our business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain and motivate our employees.

 Higher wage and benefit costs could adversely affect our business. While the majority of our employees earn more than the minimum wage in their relative jurisdictions and many receive medical plan benefits from us, changes in federal and state minimum wage laws and other laws relating to employee benefits, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, have in the past, and could in the future, cause us to incur additional wage and benefits costs. Increased labor costs brought about by changes in either federal or state minimum wage laws, other regulations or prevailing market conditions have recently, and could in the future, further increase our expenses, which could have an adverse impact on our profitability, or decrease the number of employees we are able to employ, which could decrease customer service levels at our gaming facilities and therefore adversely impact revenues. Rising operating costs at our gaming properties could have a negative impact on our business. The operating expenses associated with our gaming properties could increase due to, among other reasons, the following factors: continued or increased inflationary pressures; supply chain issues that are beyond our control; changes in federal, state or local tax or regulations, including gaming regulations or gaming taxes, could impose additional restrictions or increase our operating costs; aggressive marketing and promotional campaigns by our competitors for an extended period of time could force us to increase our expenditures for marketing and promotional campaigns in order to maintain our existing customer base or attract new customers; as our properties age, we may need to increase our expenditures for repairs, maintenance, and to replace equipment necessary to operate our business in amounts greater than what we have spent historically; our reliance on slot play revenues and any additional costs imposed on us from slot machine vendors; availability and cost of the many products and services we provide our customers, including food, beverages, retail items, entertainment, hotel rooms, spa and golf; availability and costs associated with insurance; increases in costs of labor; our properties use significant amounts of electricity, natural gas and other forms of energy, and energy price increases may adversely affect our cost structure; our properties use significant amounts of water, and a water shortage may adversely affect our operations; and at Grand Lodge, we rely on Hyatt Lake Tahoe to provide certain items at reasonable costs, including food, beverages, parking and rooms. Any change in its pricing or the availability of such items may affect our ability to compete. 
 If our operating expenses increase without any offsetting increase in our revenues, our results of operations would suffer. We face the risk of fraud and cheating. Our gaming customers may attempt or commit fraud or cheat in order to increase winnings. Acts of fraud or cheating could involve the use of counterfeit chips or other tactics, possibly in collusion with our employees. Internal acts of cheating could also be conducted by employees directly or through collusion with dealers, surveillance staff, floor managers or other casino or gaming area staff. While we carry insurance for employee theft, such insurance may not cover all or any of such losses. Failure to discover such acts or schemes in a timely manner could result in losses in our gaming operations. In addition, negative publicity related to such schemes could have an adverse effect on our reputation, potentially causing a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

 Win rates for our gaming operations depend on a variety of factors, some beyond our control. The gaming industry is characterized by an element of chance. In addition to the element of chance, win rates are also affected by other factors, including players skill and experience, the mix of games played, the financial resources of players, the spread of table limits, the volume of bets played and the amount of time played. Our gaming profits are mainly derived from the difference between our casino winnings and the casino winnings of our gaming customers. Since there is an inherent element of chance in the gaming industry, we do not have full control over our winnings or the winnings of our gaming customers. If our winnings do not exceed the winnings of our gaming customers by enough to cover our operating costs, we may record a loss from our gaming operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The concentration and evolution of the slot machine manufacturing industry could impose additional costs on us. A majority of our revenues are attributable to slot machines and related systems operated by us at our gaming facilities. It is important, for competitive reasons, that we offer popular and up-to-date slot machine games to our customers. A substantial majority of the slot machines sold in the U.S. in recent years were manufactured by only a few companies, and there has been recent consolidation activity within the gaming equipment sector. In recent years, slot machine manufacturers have frequently refused to sell slot machines featuring the most popular games, instead requiring participation lease arrangements. Participation slot machine leasing arrangements typically require the payment of a fixed daily rental or a percentage payment of coin-in or net win. Generally, a participation lease is more expensive over the long term than the cost to purchase a new machine. For competitive reasons, we may be forced to purchase new slot machines or enter into participation lease arrangements that are more expensive than our current costs associated with the continued operation of our existing slot machines. If the newer slot machines do not result in sufficient incremental revenues to offset the increased investment and participation lease costs, it could hurt our profitability. Our business may be adversely affected by legislation prohibiting tobacco smoking. Legislation in various forms to ban indoor tobacco smoking has been enacted or introduced in jurisdictions in which we operate. Except for our casinos in Colorado and Illinois, the gaming areas of our properties are not currently subject to tobacco restrictions. If additional restrictions on smoking are enacted in jurisdictions in which we operate, we could experience a decrease in gaming revenue. This is particularly the case if such restrictions are not applicable to all competitive facilities in that gaming market. We rely on, among other things, trademarks, licenses, confidentiality procedures, and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights and we may be unable to protect or may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property rights. Our commercial success depends upon our ability to develop brands and to successfully obtain or acquire proprietary or statutory protection for our intellectual property rights and to implement new or improved technologies purchased or licensed from third parties. We rely on, among other things, trademarks, licenses, confidentiality procedures, and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights. While we enter into license, confidentiality, and non-disclosure agreements to attempt to limit access to, and distribution of, proprietary and confidential information, it is possible that: some or all of our confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements will not be honored; disputes concerning the ownership of intellectual property will arise with our strategic partners, users or others; unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property, including know-how or trade secrets, will occur; we will be unable to successfully enforce our trademark or copyright rights; or contractual provisions may not be enforceable. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting our intellectual property rights or that we will become aware of third-party infringements that might be occurring. Inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our prospects, business, financial condition or results of operations.

 Our commercial success depends upon us avoiding the infringement of intellectual property rights owned by others and any such infringements, including those that are inadvertent, may have a material adverse effect on our business. The industries in which we compete have many participants that own, or claim to own, intellectual property, including participants that own intellectual property similar to our own, and proprietary rights for technologies similar to those used or licensed by us. Some of this intellectual property may provide very broad protection to the third-party owners thereof. Patents in particular can be issued very rapidly and there is often a great deal of secrecy surrounding pending patent applications. We cannot determine with certainty whether any existing third-party intellectual property or the issuance of any new third-party intellectual property would require our partners or suppliers to alter their technologies or services, pay for licenses, challenge the validity or enforceability of the intellectual property, or cease certain activities. Third parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us and against our partners and/or suppliers. We may be subject to these types of claims either directly or indirectly through indemnities assuming liability for these claims that we may provide to certain partners or suppliers. There can be no assurance that our attempts to negotiate favorable intellectual property indemnities in favor of us with our partners or suppliers for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights will be successful or that a partner s or supplier s indemnity will cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our partners and other suppliers due to infringing products, or that we can secure a license, modification or replacement of a partner s or supplier s products with non-infringing products that may otherwise mitigate such damages and losses. Some of our competitors have, or are affiliated with companies that have, substantially greater resources than us, and these competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property infringement litigation to a greater degree and for longer periods of time than us. Regardless of whether third-party claims of infringement against us have any merit, these claims could: adversely affect our relationships with our customers; be time-consuming to evaluate and defend; result in costly litigation; result in negative publicity for us; divert our management s attention and resources; cause product and software delivery delays or stoppages; subject us to significant liabilities; require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements; require us to develop possible workaround solutions that may be costly and disruptive to implement; or require us to cease certain activities or to cease providing services in certain markets. In addition to being liable for potentially substantial damages relating to intellectual property following an infringement action against us, we may be prohibited from commercializing certain technologies, or products or services unless we obtain a license from the holder of the applicable intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such license or acquire intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we do not obtain such a license, our prospects, business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected and we could be required to cease related business operations in some markets and restructure our business to focus on continuing operations in other markets. We are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility and reputation. Many factors influence our reputation and the value of our brands, including the perception held by our customers, business partners, other key stakeholders and the communities in which we do business. Our business faces increasing scrutiny related to environmental, social and governance activities and risk of damage to our reputation and the value of our brands if we fail to act responsibly in a number of areas, such as diversity and inclusion, environmental stewardship, climate change, workplace conduct, human rights, philanthropy and support for local communities. Any harm to our reputation could impact employee engagement and retention and the willingness of customers and our partners to do business with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.

 Risks Related to Development and Growth Opportunities We are engaged from time to time in one or more construction and development projects, including Chamonix and American Place, and many factors could prevent us from completing them as planned. We are currently constructing Chamonix in Cripple Creek, Colorado, adjoining and connected to our existing Bronco Billy s casino. We also intend to construct the permanent American Place facility in Waukegan, Illinois, located adjacent to The Temporary. Construction of these types of projects have certain inherent risks, including the risks of fire, structural collapse, human error and electrical, mechanical and plumbing malfunction. Our development and expansion projects are exposed to significant risks, including: shortage of materials, including due to supply chain issues that are beyond our control; shortage of skilled labor or work stoppages; unforeseen construction scheduling, engineering, excavation, environmental or geological problems; increases in the cost of steel and other raw materials for construction, driven by inflation, U.S. tariffs on imports, demand, higher labor and construction costs and other factors, may cause price increases beyond those anticipated in the budgets for our development projects; natural disasters, hurricanes, weather interference, changes in river levels, floods, fires, earthquakes, the impacts of pandemic such as coronavirus, or other casualty losses or delays; unanticipated cost increases or delays in completing the project; delays in obtaining, or inability to obtain or maintain, necessary license or permits; lack of sufficient funds, or delays in the availability of, financing; failure to comply with the terms of our disbursement agreements under our indenture could limit our access to funds for the projects; changes to plans or specifications; performance by contractors and subcontractors; disputes with contractors; mechanic s liens on real property collateral that may have priority over the liens securing our indebtedness; personal injuries to workers and other persons; structural heights and the use of cranes; disruption of our operations caused by diversion of management s attention to new development projects and construction at our existing properties; remediation of environmental contamination at some of our proposed construction sites, which may prove more difficult or expensive than anticipated in our construction budgets; failure to obtain and maintain necessary gaming regulatory approvals and licenses, or failure to obtain such approvals and licenses on a timely basis; requirements or government-established goals concerning union labor or requiring that a portion of the project expenditures be through companies controlled by specific ethnic or gender groups, goals that may not be obtainable, or may only be obtainable at additional project cost; and other unanticipated circumstances or cost increases. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could increase the total costs of a project, or delay or prevent its construction, development, expansion or opening. Escalating construction costs may cause us to modify the design and scope of projects from those initially contemplated or cause the budgets for those projects to be increased. We generally carry insurance to cover certain liabilities related to construction, but not all risks are covered, and it is uncertain whether such insurance will provide sufficient payment in a timely fashion even for those risks that are insured and material to us.

 The construction costs for our growth projects, including Chamonix and American Place, may exceed budgeted amounts plus contingencies, which may result in insufficient funds to complete these projects or the need to raise additional capital. Delays in the completion of the plans and specifications for our growth projects, including Chamonix and American Place, could delay completion of the projects. In addition, completion of the plans and specifications while construction is in progress could cause inefficiencies, and certain items may need to be modified or replaced after they have been purchased, constructed or installed in order to conform to building code requirements or subsequently-developed plans and specifications. The Pre-Construction Services Agreement and Letter of Intent with our general contractor for Chamonix provides that the cost of construction may increase and the deadlines for the contractor s obligations to complete construction may be adjusted for alterations in the project s scope. We may enter into similar arrangements with the general contractor for American Place. We can give no assurance that changes in the scope of these projects will not increase the cost of the projects or extend their completion dates. We establish budgets for the projects based, in part, on our estimate of the cost of various construction goods and services for parts of the projects that, in some cases, are not yet fully designed. If the actual cost with respect to these allowance items exceeds the estimated amount, we will be responsible for the payment of those excess amounts out of the cash flow from our other operations and from cash balances and other financial resources. Our cash flow, cash reserves and other financial resources may not be adequate at any given time to address balancing of the construction budgets if there are increased costs. If our contingency, cash flow from operations and anticipated excess liquidity are insufficient to cover any shortfall, we may not have sufficient funds to complete the projects without seeking additional capital or at all. There is no assurance that our growth projects, including Chamonix and American Place, will not be subject to additional regulatory restrictions, delays, or challenges. We received approval of the plans for Chamonix from the Cripple Creek Historic Preservation Commission and Cripple Creek City Council in January and February 2021, respectively. Additionally, as part of these approvals, the Cripple Creek City Council voted to amend the prior Development Agreement with Bronco Billy s regarding the project, as an Amended and Restated Development Agreement, and further amended as the Second Amendment to Amended and Restated Development Agreement in which we are obligated to complete the project by December 31, 2023. If we do not complete the project by that date, the City may exercise its right of reversion for previously vacated rights of way of portions of 2nd Avenue and a nearby alley. If the project is substantially underway at the deadline, it is likely that the City Council would agree to extend the deadline; however, there is no certainty that would be the case. We are still developing our plans related to the permanent facility for American Place. Such plans will be subject to regulatory approval. Illinois regulations allow The Temporary to only operate for two years, unless the Illinois Gaming Board approves an additional year to accommodate appropriate construction. Construction of the permanent American Place facility may require more than two years. We have not yet applied for the additional year permitted under the regulations and, if we do so, there is no certainty such extension will be granted. We intend to avoid having an extended period of time between the closing of The Temporary and the opening of American Place, as it could be detrimental to our business, but there is no certainty that this can be achieved. Completion of these projects could also be delayed by weather, labor shortages or other construction delays. There is no assurance that these projects will not be subject to additional restrictions, delays, or challenges. There is no assurance that our growth projects, including Chamonix and American Place, will be successful. In addition to the construction and regulatory risks associated with the development of our growth projects, including Chamonix and American Place, we cannot assure you that the level of consumer demand for these projects will meet our expectations. The operating results of these projects may be materially different than expected due to, among other factors, consumer spending and preferences in the geographic areas, competition from other markets, or other developments that may be beyond our control. In addition, these projects may be more sensitive than anticipated by management to certain risks, including risks associated with downturns in the economy. Further, these projects may not generate cash flows on our anticipated timeline. We may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategy with respect to these projects, capital investments, and acquisitions. There is no assurance that these projects will result in a more successful business operation, or that these projects will increase clientele or revenues. With respect to Chamonix, there is no assurance that a more modern expansion will attract new visitors to a city with historic architecture. The occurrence of any of these issues could adversely affect our prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

 Failure to comply with the terms of our disbursement agreement related to Chamonix could limit our access to funds. As of December 31, 2022 , we had approximately 134.6 million deposited in a construction disbursement account for Chamonix. The funds in the construction disbursement account, which will be used to fund the completion of the design, development, construction, equipping and opening costs of Chamonix, will be disbursed pursuant to the terms of our Cash Collateral and Disbursement Agreement. Funds will be distributed from this account only upon satisfaction of certain conditions, including the approval of the disbursements by an independent construction consultant, as contemplated by the Cash Collateral and Disbursement Agreement. Such agreement is designed to ensure that the funds in the construction disbursement account at each test date are sufficient to fund the anticipated costs to complete the Chamonix project. If we fail to satisfy draw conditions or the independent construction consultant does not give its approval to construction draws, in each case under our Cash Collateral and Disbursement Agreement, we may have to put additional funds into the construction disbursement account. There is no certainty that we would have access to funds when needed to keep the account in balance, which could cause delays in the construction of Chamonix. We face a number of challenges prior to opening new or upgraded facilities. No assurance can be given that, when we endeavor to open new or upgraded facilities, the expected timetables for opening such facilities will be met in light of the uncertainties inherent in the development of the regulatory framework, construction, the licensing process, legislative action and litigation. Delays in opening new or upgraded facilities could lead to increased costs and delays in receiving anticipated revenues with respect to such facilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may face disruption and other difficulties in integrating and managing facilities we have recently developed or acquired, or may develop or acquire in the future. We may face certain challenges as we integrate the operational and administrative systems of recently developed or acquired facilities into our business. As a result, the realization of anticipated benefits may be delayed or substantially reduced. Events outside of our control, including changes in state and federal regulations and laws, as well as economic trends, also could adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the acquisition or development. We expect to continue pursuing expansion opportunities. We regularly evaluate opportunities for acquisition and development of new properties. We could face significant challenges in managing and integrating our expanded or combined operations and any other properties we may develop or acquire, particularly in new competitive markets. The integration of properties we may develop or acquire will require the dedication of management resources that may temporarily divert attention from our day-to-day business. The process of integrating properties that we may acquire also could interrupt the activities of those businesses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the development of new properties may involve construction, local opposition, regulatory, legal and competitive risks, as well as the risks attendant to partnership deals on these development opportunities. In projects where we team up with a joint venture partner, if we cannot reach agreement with such partners, or our relationships otherwise deteriorate, we could face significant increased costs and delays. Local opposition can delay or increase the anticipated cost of a project. Finally, given the competitive nature of these types of limited license opportunities, litigation is possible. Management of new properties, especially in new geographic areas, may require that we increase our management resources. We cannot assure you that we will be able to manage any new or acquired operations effectively or realize any of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions. We also cannot assure you that, if acquisitions are completed, the acquired businesses will generate returns consistent with our expectations. Our ability to achieve our objectives in connection with any acquisition we may consummate may be highly dependent on, among other things, our ability to retain the senior-level property management teams of such acquisition candidates. If, for any reason, we are unable to retain these management teams following such acquisitions or if we fail to attract new capable executives, our operations after consummation of such acquisitions could be materially adversely affected. If we make new acquisitions or new investments, we may face additional risks related to our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, ability to satisfy financial covenants and comply with other restrictive covenants under our indenture, and ability to pay or refinance our indebtedness.

 The occurrence of some or all of the above-described events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The construction of Chamonix and American Place may inconvenience customers and disrupt business activity at the adjoining Bronco Billy s casino and The Temporary, respectively. Although we have attempted to minimize disruption of our existing Bronco Billy s operations, construction of Chamonix has required portions of the adjoining Bronco Billy s to be closed or disrupted. For example, Chamonix is being built, in part, on surface parking lots that were once used by guests of Bronco Billy s. As a result, we closed such parking lots and relocated guest parking until Chamonix s new parking garage is available for use. Similarly, all on-site hotel rooms at Bronco Billy s were closed to facilitate construction. The Temporary was designed so that construction of American Place on adjoining land should not materially disrupt business activity at The Temporary, but there is no certainty that this will be the case. Disruptions in operations at Bronco Billy s or The Temporary could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The permanent American Place facility, additional growth projects or potential enhancements at our properties may require us to raise additional capital. We may need to access financial institution sources, capital markets, private sources or otherwise obtain additional funds to fund the permanent American Place facility. Additional capital may also be needed to fund other growth projects or potential enhancements we may undertake at our other properties. We do not know when, or if, financial institution sources, capital markets or private sources will permit us to raise additional funds for such phases and enhancements in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all. Inability to access financial institution sources, capital markets or private sources, or the availability of capital only on less-than-favorable terms, may cause or force us to delay, reduce, or cancel our growth and enhancement projects. Our ability to obtain additional funding may also be limited by our financial condition, results of operations or other factors, such as our credit rating or outlook at the time of any such financing or offering and the covenants in our existing debt agreements, as well as by general economic conditions and contingencies and uncertainties that are beyond our control. As we seek additional financing, we will be subject to the risks of rising interest rates and other factors affecting the financial markets. The casino, hotel and resort industry is capital intensive, and we may not be able to finance expansion and renovation projects, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Our properties have an ongoing need for renovations and other capital improvements to remain competitive, including replacement, from time to time, of furniture, fixtures and equipment, including slot machines. We may also need to make capital expenditures at our casino properties to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Renovations and other capital improvements at our properties may require significant capital expenditures. In addition, renovations and capital improvements sometimes generate little or no cash flow until the projects are completed. We may not be able to fund such projects solely from existing resources and cash provided from operating activities. Consequently, we may have to rely upon the availability of debt or equity capital to fund renovations and capital improvements, and our ability to carry them out could be limited if we cannot obtain satisfactory debt or equity financing, which will depend on, among other things, market conditions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional equity or debt financing, if needed, or that we will be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms. A failure to renovate or properly maintain our properties may put us at a competitive disadvantage.

 We may face risks related to our ability to receive regulatory approvals required to complete certain acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures, and other developments, as well as other potential delays in completing certain transactions. Our growth may be fueled, in part, by the acquisition of existing gaming and development properties. In addition to standard closing conditions, our material transactions, including but not limited to acquisitions, are often conditioned on the receipt of regulatory approvals and other hurdles that create uncertainty and could increase costs. Such delays could significantly reduce the benefits to us of such transactions and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we fail to obtain necessary government approvals in a timely manner, or at all, it can adversely impact our various expansion, development, investment and renovation projects. The scope of the approvals required for expansion, development, investment or renovation projects can be extensive and may include regulatory approvals, state and local land-use permits, and building and zoning permits. Unexpected changes or concessions required by local, state or federal regulatory authorities could involve significant additional costs and delay the scheduled openings of the facilities. We may not obtain the necessary permits, licenses, entitlements and approvals within the anticipated time frames, or at all. Insufficient or lower-than-expected results generated from our new developments and acquired properties may negatively affect our operating results and financial condition. We cannot assure you that the revenues generated from our new developments and acquired properties will be sufficient to pay related expenses if and when these developments are completed; or, even if revenues are sufficient to pay expenses, that the new developments and acquired properties will yield an adequate or expected return, or any return, on our significant investments. As previously discussed, the development of new properties may involve construction, regulatory, legal and competitive risks or local opposition, any of which can significantly increase the anticipated cost of a project. Our projects, if completed, may not achieve the level of guest acceptance and patronage we anticipate. For this or other reasons, such projects may take significantly longer than we expect to generate returns, if any. If our new developments or acquired properties do not achieve the financial results anticipated, it could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. Moreover, lower-than-expected results from the opening of a new facility may make it more difficult to raise capital. Risks Related to our Indebtedness Our significant indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations. As of December 31, 2022, the total principal amount of our indebtedness, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs, was 410.0 million, consisting entirely of the Notes. Our Credit Facility was drawn for 36.0 million in January 2023 and remains outstanding as of this report date. The Notes and the Credit Facility are summarized in Part I, Item 1. Business Operating Properties American Place / The Temporary . We also have a finance lease at our Rising Star Casino Resort with an outstanding balance of 2.8 million. Our debt could, among other things: require us to dedicate a large portion of our cash flow from operations to the servicing and repayment of our debt, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions, and other general corporate requirements; limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate; restrict our ability to make strategic acquisitions or dispositions or to exploit business opportunities; increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and increases in interest rates; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and

 adversely affect our credit rating, which may adversely affect our cost to borrow funds or the market price of our common stock. Any of these risks could impact our ability to fund our operations or limit our ability to expand our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The indenture governing the Notes and the Credit Facility impose restrictive covenants and limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business and lead to events of default if we do not comply with the covenants. The indenture governing the Notes and the Credit Facility impose restrictive covenants on us and our subsidiaries that may limit our current and future operations. The restrictions that are imposed include, among other obligations, limitations on our and our subsidiaries ability to: incur additional debt and guarantee indebtedness; make payments on subordinated obligations; make dividends or distributions and repurchase stock; make investments; enter into transactions with affiliates; grant liens on our property to secure debt; sell assets or enter into mergers or consolidations; sell equity interest in our subsidiaries; make capital expenditures; or amend or modify our subordinate indebtedness without obtaining certain consents from the holders of our indebtedness. These restrictions could adversely affect our ability to: obtain additional financing for our operations; make needed capital expenditures; make strategic acquisitions or investments or enter into alliances; withstand a continued and sustained downturn in our business or the economy in general; engage in business activities, including future opportunities, that may be in our interest; and plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies. Our ability to comply with the covenants under the indenture, the Credit Facility, or in any instrument governing future indebtedness, may be affected by general economic conditions, industry conditions, and other events beyond our control, including delays in the completion of new projects under construction. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with these covenants. Our failure to comply with the covenants contained under the indenture the Credit Facility, or in any instrument governing future indebtedness, including failure to comply as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default. If there were an event of default and it is not waived by the requisite parties (at their option), the agent, the trustee or holders, as applicable, could cause all the outstanding obligations under the Notes, the Credit Facility or other future indebtedness to be due and payable, subject to applicable grace periods, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition. Additionally, this could trigger cross-defaults under other debt obligations. We cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to repay our obligations under the Notes, the Credit Facility or any future outstanding debt obligations, if accelerated upon an event of default, or that we would be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance the Notes, the Credit Facility or any future debt instruments. To service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, and to fund planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts, will depend upon our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors.

Table of Contents 
 We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or asset sales, our anticipated growth in operations, including through our expansion efforts, will be realized, or that future borrowings will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to repay the Notes, and any amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility and to fund our other liquidity needs. In addition, as we undertake substantial new developments or facility renovations or if we consummate significant acquisitions in the future, our cash requirements may increase significantly and we may need to obtain additional equity or debt financing or joint venture partners. Any increase in our level of indebtedness could impose additional cash requirements on us in order to support interest payments. If we incur additional debt, the related risks that we now face could intensify. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to repay the Notes or any amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility, as needed, or to obtain adequate additional financing, we may have to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying planned expenses and capital expenditures, selling assets, or issuing equity. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to service all of our indebtedness and fund our operating expenses, working capital needs and capital expenditures, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our indebtedness will depend upon our future operating performance and our ability to generate cash flow in the future, which are subject to general economic, financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or fund our other liquidity needs. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investment and capital expenditures, dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Such alternative measures, if necessary, may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, such alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. The indenture governing the Notes and the Credit Facility restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from asset dispositions, and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to repay or service our indebtedness. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and, as a result, our lenders could declare all outstanding amounts to be due and payable and foreclose against the collateral securing such debt, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and could result in you losing your investment in us. We depend on our subsidiaries for certain dividends, distributions and repayment of our indebtedness, including the Notes and any borrowings under the Credit Facility. The source of much of our cash flow to pay our obligations under the Notes and any borrowings under the Credit Facility and to make payments on any other indebtedness will be dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries. If our subsidiaries are unable to make dividend payments or distributions to us and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available, we may not be able to pay interest or principal under the Notes or borrowings under the Credit Facility. Unless they guarantee the Notes and the Credit Facility, our subsidiaries (a) will not have any obligation to pay amounts due under the Notes and the Credit Facility or to make funds available for that purpose and (b) may not be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness, including the Notes and the Credit Facility. Each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. In addition, while the indentures governing the Notes and the Credit Facility limit the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to restrict the payment of dividends or make other intercompany payments to us, these limitations will be subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, including the Notes and the Credit Facility.

 Our ability to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms may be limited. Although we believe that our cash, cash equivalents, working capital, future cash from operations, and the capital obtained from the Notes and available borrowing under the Credit Facility will provide adequate resources to fund completion of Chamonix, the Temporary at American Place and ongoing operating requirements, we may need to refinance or seek additional financing to compete effectively or grow our business, including to complete the permanent American Place facility. These financing strategies may not be completed on satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, certain financing transactions require approval of gaming regulatory authorities. Some requirements may prevent or delay us from obtaining necessary capital. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain any additional financing, refinance our existing debt, or fund our growth efforts. If we are unable to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms, it could: reduce funds available to us for purposes such as working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; restrict our ability to capitalize on business opportunities; increase our vulnerability to economic downturns and competitive pressures in the markets in which we operate; and place us at a competitive disadvantage. The obligations under the Notes and the Credit Facility are collateralized by a security interest in substantially all of our assets, so if we default on those obligations, the holders of the Notes and lenders under the Credit Facility could foreclose on our assets. In addition, the existence of these security interests may adversely affect our financial flexibility. The obligations under the Notes and any borrowings under the Credit Facility are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our assets. As a result, if we default under our obligations under the Notes or the Credit Facility, the holders of the Notes and the lenders under the Credit Facility, acting through their appointed agent, could foreclose on their security interests and liquidate some or all of these assets, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations and could require us to reduce or cease operations. In addition, the pledge of these assets and other restrictions may limit our flexibility in raising capital for other purposes. Because substantially all of our assets are pledged under these financing arrangements, our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness or to sell or dispose of assets to raise capital may be impaired, which could have an adverse effect on our financial flexibility. We and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt, which could further exacerbate the risks described above. We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The indentures governing the Notes and the Credit Facility do not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from doing so. If new debt is added to our or our subsidiaries current debt levels, the related risks that we or they now face could intensify. Risks Related to our Legal and Regulatory Environment We face extensive regulation from gaming and other regulatory authorities and the cost of compliance or failure to comply with such regulations may adversely affect our business and results of operations. Licensing. The gaming industry is highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. The ownership, management and operation of gaming facilities are subject to extensive state and local regulation in the jurisdiction in which it is located. These laws, rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability and character of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interest in the gaming operations. The regulatory authorities in jurisdictions where we operate have broad discretion. They may, for any reason set forth in the applicable legislation, rules and regulations, limit, condition, suspend, fail to renew or revoke a license or registration to conduct gaming operations. Furthermore, because we are subject to regulation in each jurisdiction in which we operate, and because regulatory agencies within each jurisdiction review our compliance with gaming laws in other jurisdictions, it is possible that gaming compliance issues in one jurisdiction may lead to reviews and compliance issues in other jurisdictions.

 Taxation and fees. We believe that the prospect of significant tax revenue is one of the primary reasons that jurisdictions permit legalized gaming. As a result, gaming companies are typically subject to significant revenue-based taxes and fees in addition to normal federal, state, and local income and employment taxes. Such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. From time to time, federal, state, and local legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. In addition, any downturn in economic conditions could intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes and/or property taxes. It is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws. Any material increase, or the adoption of additional taxes or fees, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Compliance with other laws. In addition to gaming regulations, we are also subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations affecting businesses in general. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, environmental matters, employment, currency transactions, taxation, construction, zoning, land-use laws, marketing and advertising, smoking, and regulations governing the serving of alcoholic beverages. The Bank Secrecy Act, enforced by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network FinCEN of the U.S. Treasury Department, requires us to report currency transactions in excess of 10,000, including groupings of related transactions, occurring within a gaming day, including identification of the guest by name and social security number, to the Internal Revenue Service IRS ). This regulation also requires us to report certain suspicious activity, including any transaction that exceeds 5,000 that we know, suspect or have reason to believe involves funds from illegal activity or is designed to evade federal regulations or reporting requirements. Periodic audits by the IRS and our internal audit function assess compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act, and substantial penalties can be imposed against us if we fail to comply with this regulation. In recent years, the U.S. Treasury Department has increased its focus on Bank Secrecy Act compliance throughout the gaming industry. Recent public comments by FinCEN suggest that casinos should make efforts to obtain information on each customer s sources of income. This could impact our ability to attract and retain casino guests. We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Any violations of anti-money laundering laws or regulations by any of our properties could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Our riverboat and ferry boat operations at Rising Star must comply with certain federal and state laws and regulations with respect to boat design, on-board facilities, equipment, personnel and safety. In addition, we are required to have third parties periodically inspect and certify our boats for safety, stability and single compartment flooding integrity. All of our casinos also must meet local fire safety standards. We could incur additional costs if our gaming facilities are not in compliance with one or more of these regulations. Changes in legislation and regulation of our business could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Regulations governing the conduct of gaming activities and the obligations of gaming companies in any jurisdiction in which we have or in the future may have gaming operations are subject to change and could impose additional operating, financial, competitive or other burdens on the way we conduct our business. In particular, certain areas of law governing new gaming activities, such as the federal and state law applicable to sports betting, are new or developing in light of emerging technologies. New and developing areas of law may be subject to the interpretation of the government agencies tasked with enforcing them. In some circumstances, a government agency may interpret a statute or regulation in one manner and then reconsider its interpretation at a later date. No assurance can be provided that government agencies will interpret or enforce new or developing areas of law consistently, predictably, or favorably. Moreover, legislation to prohibit, limit or add burdens to our business may be introduced in the future in states where gaming has been legalized. In addition, from time to time, legislators and special interest groups have proposed legislation that would expand, restrict or prevent gaming operations or which may otherwise adversely impact our operations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Any expansion of gaming or restriction on or prohibition of our gaming operations or enactment of other adverse regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.

 Stockholders may be required to dispose of their shares of our common stock if they are found unsuitable by gaming authorities. While gaming authorities generally focus on stockholders with more than 5 and often 10 of a company s shares, such authorities generally can require that any beneficial owner of our common stock and other securities file an application for a finding of suitability. If a gaming authority requires a record or beneficial owner of our securities to file a suitability application, the owner must apply for a finding of suitability within 30 days or at an earlier time prescribed by the gaming authority. The gaming authority has the power to investigate an owner s suitability and the owner must pay all costs of the investigation. If the owner is found unsuitable, then the owner may be required by law to dispose of our securities. Our certificate of incorporation also provides us with the right to repurchase shares of our common stock from certain beneficial owners declared by gaming regulators to be unsuitable holders of our equity securities. The price we may pay to any such beneficial owner may be below the price such beneficial owner would otherwise accept for his or her shares of our common stock. We are subject to environmental laws and potential exposure to environmental liabilities. We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations, including emissions and discharges into the environment, and the handling and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in costs for corrective action, penalties or the imposition of other liabilities or restrictions. We also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and clean-up responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of remediating contaminated soil or groundwater on or from its property, without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or caused, the contamination, as well as incur liability to third parties impacted by such contamination. The presence of contamination, or failure to remediate it properly, may adversely affect our ability to use, sell or rent property. There can be no assurances that these matters or other matters arising under environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations in the future. We are subject to litigation which, if adversely determined, could cause us to incur substantial losses. From time to time during the normal course of operating our businesses, we are subject to various litigation claims and legal disputes. Some of the litigation claims may not be covered under our insurance policies, or our insurance carriers may seek to deny coverage. As a result, we might also be required to incur significant legal fees, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position. In addition, because we cannot accurately predict the outcome of any action, it is possible that, as a result of current and/or future litigation, we will be subject to adverse judgments or settlements that could significantly reduce our earnings or result in losses. Our ferry boat service is highly regulated, which can adversely affect our operations. Our ferry boat service at the Rising Star Casino Resort is subject to stringent local, state and federal laws and regulations governing, among other things, the health and safety of our passengers and personnel, and the operation and insurance of our vessel. Many aspects of our ferry boat service are subject to regulation by a wide array of agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard and other federal authorities, the State of Indiana and Commonwealth of Kentucky authorities, as well as local authorities in Ohio County, Indiana and Boone County, Kentucky. In addition, we are required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain, maintain and periodically renew certain permits, licenses and certificates with respect to our ferry boat service. Compliance with or the enforcement of applicable laws and regulations can be costly. In addition, failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in administrative and civil penalties, criminal sanctions or, in certain cases, the suspension or termination of our ferry boat service.

 Risks Related to Technology Our gaming operations rely heavily on technology services and an uninterrupted supply of electrical power. If we experience damage or service interruptions, we may have to cease some or all of our operations, which will result in a decrease in revenue. Our gaming operations rely heavily on technology services and an uninterrupted supply of electrical power. Our security system and all of our slot machines are controlled by computers and reliant on electrical power to operate. A loss of electrical power or a failure of the technology services needed to run the computers could make us unable to run all or parts of our gaming operations. Any unscheduled interruption in our technology services or interruption in the supply of electrical power is likely to result in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenue due to a shutdown of our gaming operations. Although we have designed our systems around industry-standard designs to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences, they remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks and similar events. Additionally, substantial increases in the cost of electricity and natural gas could negatively affect our results of operations. Our information technology and other systems are subject to cyber-security risk, misappropriation of customer information and other breaches of information security. We rely extensively on our computer systems to process customer transactions, manage customer data, manage employee data and communicate with third-party vendors and other third parties, and we may also access the Internet to use our computer systems. Our operations require that we collect and store customer data, including credit card numbers and other personal information, for various business purposes, including marketing and promotional purposes. We also collect and store personal information about our employees. Breaches of our security measures or information technology systems or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive personal information or confidential data about us, or our customers, or our employees including the potential loss or disclosure of such information as a result of hacking or other cyber-attack, computer virus, fraudulent use by customers, employees or employees of third party vendors, trickery or other forms of deception or unauthorized use, or due to system failure, could expose us, our customers, our employees or other individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our reputation or brand names or otherwise harm our business. Additionally, disruptions in the availability of our computer systems, through cyber-attacks or otherwise, could impact our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our sales and the results of operations. We rely on proprietary and commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of customer information, such as payment card, employee information and other confidential or proprietary information. Our data security measures are reviewed and evaluated regularly; however, they might not protect us against increasingly sophisticated and aggressive threats. The cost and operational consequences of implementing further data security measures could be significant and there is no certainty that such measures, if purchased, could thwart all threats. Additionally, while we maintain cyber risk insurance to assist in the cost of recovery from a significant cyber event, such coverage may not be sufficient. Additionally, the collection of customer and employee personal information imposes various privacy compliance related obligations on our business and increases the risks associated with a breach or failure of the integrity of our information technology systems. The collection and use of personal information are governed by privacy laws and regulations enacted in the United States and other jurisdictions around the world. Privacy regulations continue to evolve and on occasion may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another.

 There are also laws and regulations governing the collection and use of biometric information, such as fingerprints and facial scans. For example, the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, 740 ILCS 14/1 et seq. BIPA applies to the collection and use of biometric identifiers and biometric information which include fingerprints and facial scans. BIPA requires written notice and consent before a private entity (like us and our subsidiaries) may collect or disseminate biometric information. It further provides that any private entity in possession of biometric information must establish, publish and comply with a policy regarding its schedule for destroying biometric information and follow reasonable security measures to protect such information. Individuals are afforded a private right of action under BIPA and may recover statutory damages equal to the greater of 1,000 (or 5,000 for reckless violations) or actual damages and reasonable attorneys fees and costs for each unlawful collection of biometric information, which the Illinois Supreme Court has interpreted to include not only the initial collection of information to create a biometric template, but also, each subsequent scan of biometric information to identify an individual. Many Illinois businesses, including casinos, have been accused of using biometric-enabled devices, including hand or fingerprint scanners for timekeeping or security purposes, and facial recognition technology for security purposes, without the required policy, notice or consent. Any biometric-enabled devices or technologies used by us in Illinois must comply with BIPA s notice, consent, policy and security requirements to avoid potential liability. In addition to BIPA, a number of other proposals exist for new federal and state privacy legislation that, if passed, could increase our potential liability, increase our compliance costs and materially adversely affect our business. Compliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations may increase our operating costs and/or adversely impact our ability to market our products, properties and services to our customers. In addition, non-compliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations by us (or in some circumstances non-compliance by third party service providers engaged by us) may also result in damage of reputation, result in vulnerabilities that could be exploited to breach our systems and/or subject us to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits (including class actions) or restrictions on our use or transfer of personal information (including biometric information). General Risks Our ability to utilize our net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited. Our ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards to offset potential future taxable income and related income taxes that would otherwise be due is dependent upon our generation of future taxable income before the expiration dates, if applicable, of the NOL carryforwards, and we cannot predict with certainty when, or whether, we will generate sufficient taxable income to use all of our NOL carryforwards. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change, generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership by certain stockholders over a three-year period, the corporation s ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research and development tax credits) to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. We have experienced ownership changes in the past, and we may experience ownership changes in the future and/or subsequent shifts in our stock ownership (some of which may be outside our control). As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change NOL carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations under Section 382, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of NOL carryforwards is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.

 The market price for our common stock may be volatile, and investors may not be able to sell our stock at a favorable price or at all. Many factors could cause the market price of our common stock to rise and fall, including: actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly results of operations; the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on our business; change in market valuations of companies in our industry; change in expectations of future financial performance; regulatory changes; fluctuations in stock market prices and volumes; issuance of common stock market prices and volumes; the addition or departure of key personnel; and announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, investments, dispositions, joint ventures or other significant business decisions. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to companies operating performance, for example, as a result of the coronavirus epidemic or increases in the borrowing rates set by the Federal Reserve. Broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities, stockholder derivative lawsuits and/or securities class-action litigation has sometimes been instituted against that company, sometimes irrespective of whether the company took any action contributing to such volatility. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources. The exercise of outstanding options to purchase common stock may result in substantial dilution and may depress the trading price of our common stock. If our outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock are exercised and the underlying shares of common stock issued upon such exercise are sold, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution and the market price of our shares of common stock could decline. Further, the perception that such securities might be exercised could adversely affect the trading price of our shares of common stock. During the time that such securities are outstanding, they may adversely affect the terms on which we could obtain additional capital. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. Not applicable.

Such holders are not included in the number of registered holders above. Dividend Policy We have not paid any dividends on our common stock to date. The payment of dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be contingent upon our revenues and earnings, if any; the terms of our indebtedness; our capital requirements; growth opportunities; and general financial condition. Our debt covenants restrict the payment of dividends and it is the present intention of our board of directors to retain all earnings, if any, for use in our business operations, debt reduction and growth initiatives, reinvesting such earnings on behalf of stockholders. Accordingly, we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Item 6. [Reserved]

Full House Resorts, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, may be referred to as Full House, the Company, we, our or us. Executive Overview Our primary business is the ownership and/or operation of casino and related hospitality and entertainment facilities, which includes offering casino gambling, hotel accommodations, dining, golfing, RV camping, sports betting, entertainment and retail outlets, among other amenities. We currently operate six casinos: five on real estate that we own or lease and one located within a hotel owned by a third party. Construction continues for a seventh property, Chamonix Casino Hotel Chamonix ), adjacent to our existing Bronco Billy s Casino and Hotel in Cripple Creek, Colorado. We are also designing our permanent American Place casino destination, which will be built adjacent to a temporary facility that we opened in February 2023 named The Temporary by American Place The Temporary (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ). We intend to operate The Temporary until the opening of American Place. Additionally, we benefit from seven permitted sports wagering skins three in Colorado, three in Indiana, and one in Illinois. Other companies operate or will operate these online sports wagering websites under their brands, paying us a percentage of revenues, as defined, subject to annual minimum amounts.

 Our financial results are dependent upon the number of patrons that we attract to our properties and the amounts those guests spend per visit. While we provide credit at some of our casinos where permitted by gaming regulations, most of our revenues are cash-based, through customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. Our revenues are primarily derived from slot machines, but also include other gaming activities, including table games, keno and sports betting. In addition, we derive a significant amount of revenue from our hotels and our food and beverage outlets. We also derive revenues from our golf course and ferry boat service at Rising Star, our RV parks owned at Rising Star and managed at Silver Slipper, and retail outlets and entertainment. We often provide hotel rooms, food and beverages, entertainment, ferry usage, and golf privileges to customers on a complimentary basis; the value of such services is included as revenue in those categories, offset by contra-revenue in the casino revenue category. As a result, the casino revenues in our financial statements reflect patron gaming wins and losses, reduced by the retail value of complimentary services, the value of free play provided to customers, the value of points earned by casino customers that can be redeemed for services or free play, and adjustments for certain progressive jackpots offered by the Company. We set minimum and maximum betting limits for our slot machines and table games based on market conditions, customer demand and other factors. Our gaming revenues are derived from a broad base of guests that includes both high- and low-stakes players. At Silver Slipper, our sports book operations are in partnership with a company specializing in race and sports betting. At Rising Star, Bronco Billy s, and The Temporary/American Place, we have contracted with other companies to operate our online sports wagering skins under their own brands in exchange for a percentage of revenues, as defined, subject to annual minimum amounts. Our operating results may also be affected by, among other things, overall economic conditions affecting the disposable income of our guests, weather conditions affecting access to our properties, achieving and maintaining cost efficiencies, taxation and other regulatory changes, and competitive factors, including but not limited to, additions and improvements to the competitive supply of gaming facilities, as well as pandemics, epidemics, widespread health emergencies, or outbreaks of infectious diseases such as the coronavirus. We may experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results due to seasonality, variations in gaming hold percentages and other factors. Consequently, our operating results for any quarter or year are not necessarily comparable and may not be indicative of results in future periods. Our market environment is highly competitive and capital-intensive. Nevertheless, there are significant restrictions and barriers to entry vis- -vis opening new casinos in most of the markets in which we operate. We rely on the ability of our properties to generate operating cash flow to pay interest, repay debt, and fund maintenance and certain growth-related capital expenditures. We continuously focus on improving the operating margins of our existing properties through a combination of revenue growth and expense management. We also assess growth and development opportunities, which include capital investments at our existing properties, the development of new properties, and the acquisition of existing properties. Recent Developments American Place . In December 2021, we were selected by the IGB to develop and operate American Place, our proposal for a casino and entertainment destination in Waukegan, Illinois. While the larger, more lavish American Place facility is under construction, we will operate a temporary casino facility, aptly named The Temporary. Opened in February 2023, The Temporary was designed to include approximately 1,000 slot machines, 50 table games, a fine-dining restaurant, two additional restaurants, and a center bar. The permanent American Place facility is expected to include a world-class casino with a state-of-the-art sportsbook; a premium boutique hotel comprised of twenty luxurious villas; a 1,500-seat live entertainment venue; and various food and beverage outlets.

 To accommodate operations for The Temporary, as well as construction of the permanent American Place facility, we entered into a 99-year ground lease (the Ground Lease with the City of Waukegan, Illinois (the City in January 2023 for approximately 32 acres of land (the City-Owned Parcel ), which is adjacent to a 10-acre parcel of land that we purchased in March 2022 for 7.5 million. Annual rent under the Ground Lease is the greater of (i) 3.0 million or (ii) 2.5 of Adjusted Gross Receipts (as defined) generated by either the Temporary or American Place. The Ground Lease is only terminable to the extent that the Development and Host Community Agreement with the City is terminated. We have the right to purchase the City-Owned Parcel at any time during the term of the Ground Lease for 30 million, but if we do so prior to the opening of American Place, then we must continue to pay rent due to the City under the Ground Lease until the permanent casino is open. For more information, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Debt Financing. On February 21, 2023, we issued 40.0 million of Additional Notes. The Additional Notes were issued pursuant to an amended indenture governing the 410 million of Existing Notes. In connection with the issuance of the Additional Notes, we entered into a Fourth Supplemental Indenture with Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee, dated February 21, 2023 (as further amended, the Indenture ). The Additional Notes are treated as a single series of senior secured debt securities with the Existing Notes and as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Proceeds from the offering, net of related expenses and discounts, were approximately 34 million. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 8.25 per year and mature on February 15, 2028. Interest on the Notes is payable on February 15 and August 15 in arrears of each year. Also on February 21, 2023, we entered into a Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement with Capital One, National Association Capital One ), which, among other things, increased the amount of additional Indebtedness permitted under our Credit Agreement, dated as of March 31, 2021 (as further amended, the Credit Agreement ), permitting the issuance of the Additional Notes. The Notes are guaranteed, jointly and severally (such guarantees, the Guarantees ), by each of the Company s restricted subsidiaries (collectively, the Guarantors ). The Notes and the Guarantees are the Company s and the Guarantor s general senior secured obligations, subject to the terms of the Collateral Trust Agreement (as defined in the Indenture), ranking senior in right of payment to all of the Company s and the Guarantor s existing and future debt that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and the Guarantees, if any, and ranking equally in right of payment with all of the Company s and the Guarantors existing and future senior debt. The Notes, together with borrowings under the Credit Facility, are equally and ratably secured by a first priority security interest in, subject to certain exceptions and limitations and the terms of the Collateral Trust Agreement, the Company s and the Guarantors furniture, equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, other personal property and real property. Additionally, the Notes (but not the borrowings under the Credit Facility) are secured by a first priority security interest in the securities accounts and the deposit accounts established pursuant to the Cash Collateral and Disbursement Agreement. Sports Wagering in Illinois. In May 2022, we signed a retail and mobile sports wagering contract for Illinois. Such operations are expected to commence in Spring 2023, pending the receipt of customary gaming approvals. We received an upfront fee of 5 million, which was capitalized and will be amortized over the eight-year term of the agreement that is expected to commence in Spring 2023. We will receive a percentage of revenues (as defined), subject to an annual minimum of 5 million. For more information, see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Sports Wagering in Colorado. In December 2022, we entered into a contract with a third-party to operate mobile sports wagering under our permitted third skin in Colorado. The 10-year agreement began its contractual term in March 2023. Such agreement replaces an unrelated operator that ceased operations in May 2022. In total, we have three sports wagering agreements in Colorado, for which we receive a percentage of revenues (as defined), subject to annual minimums totaling 3 million. For more information, see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

 COVID-19 Pandemic Update . The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and certain precautionary and stimulus measures, as well as other factors, have created economic uncertainty both in the United States and globally, as well as significant and prolonged volatility in, and disruption to, financial markets, labor markets and supply chains. Global supply chain disruptions and other world events have resulted in shipping delays, increased shipping costs, supply shortages, and inflationary pressures, including increases in prices for fuel, food, building materials, labor, and other items. These increased costs, labor shortages, and supply shortages continued to put additional constraints on our operating business and our construction projects for the year ended December 31, 2022. We do not know when, or if, these cost, labor, and supply chain issues will materially alleviate and, accordingly, they may continue to impact our existing business and our construction projects. We believe that we have a strong balance sheet and sufficient liquidity in place. As of December 31, 2022, we had total cash and cash equivalents of 191.2 million, including 134.6 million of restricted cash reserved to fund the construction of Chamonix, and availability under our revolver. As noted above, we further augmented our liquidity in the first quarter of 2023 through the issuance of 40.0 million of Additional Notes, as well as the drawdown of 36.0 million under our Credit Facility. Key Performance Indicators We use several key performance indicators to evaluate the operations of our properties. These key performance indicators include the following: Gaming revenue indicators: Slot coin-in is the gross dollar amount wagered in slot machines and table game drop is the total amount of cash or credit exchanged into chips at table games for use by our customers. Slot coin-in and table game drop are indicators of volume. Slot win is the difference between customer wagers and customer winnings on slot machines. Table game hold is the difference between the amount of money or markers exchanged into chips at the tables and customer winnings paid. Slot win and table game hold percentages represent the relationship between slot win and coin-in and table game win and drop. Room revenue indicators: Hotel occupancy rate is an indicator of the utilization of our available rooms. Complimentary room sales, or the retail value of accommodations furnished to customers free of charge, are included in the calculation of the hotel occupancy rate. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Segment EBITDA and Adjusted Segment EBITDA Margin: Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of our performance. For a description of Adjusted EBITDA see Non-GAAP Measure . We utilize Adjusted Segment EBITDA as the measure of segment profitability in assessing performance and allocating resources at the reportable segment level. For information regarding our operating segments, see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Additionally, we use Adjusted Segment EBITDA Margin, which is calculated by dividing Adjusted Segment EBITDA by the property s revenues.

 The following discussion is based on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Revenues. Consolidated revenues decreased by 9.4 (or 16.9 million) in 2022, primarily due to a 14.9 million decline in slot revenues from lower volumes at our three properties in Colorado, Mississippi, and Indiana. These lower volumes can be primarily attributed to the absence of government stimulus programs of the same scale as in 2021; construction disruptions at Bronco Billy s to advance the completion of our Chamonix project; the launch of competing online sports wagering in Louisiana in January 2022; and adverse weather in December 2022 across several properties. Additionally, our revenues were impacted by factors that are inherently hard to quantify, as discussed in the Recent Developments COVID-19 Pandemic Update section. These include inflationary pressures, which could affect the spending pattern of customers, as well as labor shortages for us to meet the demands of potential customers. Other Non-casino Revenues includes 7.2 million of revenue related to our contracted sports wagering agreements in 2022, compared to 5.9 million in 2021. See Operating Results Reportable Segments below for details. Operating expenses. Consolidated operating expenses increased by 5.6 (or 8.0 million) in 2022, primarily due to 9.5 million of additional preopening costs for The Temporary and Chamonix and a 2.6 million increase to food and beverage costs. Such amounts were partially offset by a 4.0 million decrease in casino costs tied to lower volumes than in 2021, as noted above. See further information within our reportable segments described below. Interest and other non-operating expense, net. Interest Expense 

(In thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Interest expense (excluding bond fee amortization and premium) 33,496 24,179 Amortization of debt issuance costs, discounts and premiums 1,649 1,349 Capitalized interest (10,802) (1,871) Interest income and other (1,355) 22,988 23,657 Interest expense decreased marginally due to increases in capitalized interest related to construction of The Temporary and Chamonix projects, as well as interest income earned during the year. Both items more than offset the increased interest expense that resulted from the February 2022 issuance of 100 million of additional senior secured notes. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a more detailed discussion. Other non-operating expense, net In 2022, we incurred 4.5 million of other non-operating expense, primarily consisting of debt modification costs related to our offering of 100 million of additional notes in February 2022. In 2021, we incurred 1.8 million of other non-operating expense, which included 0.4 million for the extinguishment of prior debts and 1.3 million for the settlement of our former warrants. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a more detailed discussion.

 Income taxes. Our effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 0.2 and 3.6 , respectively. Our tax rates differ from the statutory rate of 21.0 primarily due to changes in valuation allowance and items that are permanently treated differently for GAAP and tax purposes. During 2022, we continued to provide a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets DTAs ), net of any available deferred tax liabilities, as applicable, based on our analysis of the timing of reversal of such deferred taxes. For 2022, the valuation allowance was 15.2 million, compared to 9.9 million for 2021. In future years, if it is determined that we meet the more likely than not threshold of utilizing our DTAs, then we may reverse some or all of our valuation allowance. We do not expect to pay any federal income taxes or receive any federal tax refunds related to our 2022 results. We used net operating loss carryforwards from previous years to offset taxable income generated in 2022. Due to the level of uncertainty regarding sufficient prospective income as measured under GAAP, we maintain a valuation allowance against our DTAs, as mentioned above. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a more detailed discussion. Operating results reportable segments We manage our casinos based primarily on geographic regions within the United States and type of income. For more information, please refer to our earlier discussion within the Executive Overview section. The following table presents detail by segment of our consolidated revenues and Adjusted EBITDA (see Non-GAAP Measure for more information). Additionally, management uses Adjusted Segment EBITDA as its measure of segment profitability in accordance with GAAP.

 Mississippi Our Mississippi segment consists of the Silver Slipper Casino and Hotel. The prior year was among the best in the property s history in terms of casino revenue and total revenue, benefiting from the issuance of government stimulus checks to customers. Compared to 2021, total revenues during 2022 decreased by 10.8 (or 9.8 million), primarily due to declines in casino revenue of 14.5 (or 9.2 million). During 2022, slot revenue declined by 12.4 (or 6.6 million) due to lower volumes. Other casino revenues declined by 2.2 million during 2022, primarily from our on-site sports book that was impacted by the competitive launch of online sports wagering in January 2022 within nearby Louisiana. Non-casino revenue decreased by 2.3 (or 0.6 million) during 2022, also due to lower volumes during the year. The majority of our non-casino revenue comes from our food and beverage operations, which revenue declined by 2.6 (or 0.5 million). Hotel revenue rose by 1.1 (or 0.1 million), due to higher average daily room rates as compared to 2021, despite a decline in hotel occupancy rates to 91.7 in 2022, as compared to 93.6 in 2021. Adjusted Segment EBITDA decreased by 34.7 (or 10.4 million) from the prior year, reflecting revenue declines from a lack of stimulus payments and the launch of online sports wagering in Louisiana mentioned above; a 1.8 million increase in food costs; and a 1.4 million increase in property insurance costs. Indiana Our Indiana segment consists of Rising Star Casino Resort. Similar to the Silver Slipper, total revenues for the prior year benefited from customers receiving government stimulus payments. Additionally, a nearby facility with historical racing machines (which are a form of slot machine) opened in September 2022. As a result, total revenues for 2022 decreased by 5.7 (or 2.3 million), compared to 2021, due to declines in casino revenue of 7.6 (or 2.2 million). During 2022, slot revenue declined by 5.7 (or 1.5 million) due to lower volumes, while table game revenue declined by 0.7 million. Non-casino revenue declined by 0.8 (or 0.1 million) during 2022, also from lower volumes. Increases in food and beverage revenue of 12.0 (or 0.4 million) nearly offset decreases in other non-casino revenue (3.1 , or 0.1 million) and hotel revenue (9.7 , or 0.4 million). Total occupied room-nights declined by 9.2 in 2022 to 47,587 room-nights from 51,951 room-nights in 2021, and average daily room rates also declined. Adjusted Segment EBITDA decreased by 21.2 (or 1.8 million) from the prior year due to lower volumes as discussed above. Lower volumes led to declines in many variable costs, such as gaming taxes, related fees, and payroll. However, marketing costs during 2022 increased by 0.5 million to address lower volumes, as 2021 was assisted by the issuance of government stimulus checks to customers. Colorado Our Colorado segment includes Bronco Billy s Casino and Hotel and the Chamonix project. The Colorado gaming market, including Cripple Creek, has shown significant growth since betting limits were eliminated in May 2021. Bronco Billy s, however, has incurred significant construction disruption, including temporarily-reduced gaming and restaurant capacity and the temporary absence of all on-site hotel rooms and on-site self-parking. Total revenues for 2022 decreased by 31.6 (or 7.5 million) when compared to 2021, reflecting business disruptions to accommodate the construction of Chamonix. Casino revenue for 2022 decreased by 33.0 (or 6.7 million), compared to 2021, which was largely due to the construction disruptions mentioned above. Slot revenue declined by 34.5 (or 6.8 million) during 2022. Table games revenue rose by 18.7 (or 0.1 million) during 2022 due to a higher hold percentage and increased volumes versus 2021, when table games operations resumed in February 2021 under pandemic-related constraints. Non-casino revenue decreased by 23.2 (or 0.8 million) during 2022, due to declines in food and beverage revenue of 26.6 (or 0.6 million) after the temporary closure of the property s steakhouse since May 2022 and, to a lesser extent, declines in ATM and related surcharge income of 0.1 million.

 Adjusted Segment EBITDA decreased by 6.2 million, from positive Adjusted Segment EBITDA of 5.5 million to an Adjusted Segment EBITDA loss of 688,000, due to significant disruptions in 2022 from the construction of Chamonix, as mentioned above. Similar to Rising Star, lower volumes also led to declines in many variable costs, such as gaming taxes, gaming position fees, and food and beverage costs. To alleviate the lack of on-site parking, Bronco Billy s currently offers complimentary valet parking and a free shuttle service to an off-site parking lot, resulting in additional expenses. The casino has also maintained much of its payroll, despite reduced activity levels, anticipating the need for the larger workforce required to open and operate Chamonix. In addition to construction disruption due to our neighboring Chamonix project, we are currently undergoing a modest refurbishment of a portion of Bronco Billy s, which began in May 2022. Accordingly, Bronco Billy s contribution to earnings was impacted by the casino refurbishment (which was completed in December 2022), and will likely continue to be impacted until restaurant work at Bronco Billy s is completed in the third quarter of 2023 and Chamonix begins its phased opening, potentially also in the third quarter of 2023. When Chamonix opens, Bronco Billy s will share the significant on-site parking garage, valet and surface parking capacity of the new casino, and also benefit from Chamonix s adjoining 300-guestroom hotel. The market in Cripple Creek is seasonal, favoring the summer months. Nevada The Nevada segment consists of the Grand Lodge and Stockman s casinos. Our Nevada operations have historically been seasonal, with the summer months accounting for a disproportionate share of annual revenues. Additionally, snowfall levels during the winter months can often affect operations, as Grand Lodge Casino is located near several major ski resorts. We typically benefit from a good snow year, resulting in extended periods of operation at the nearby ski areas, although at times, major snowstorms can restrict access to the property. Total revenues for 2022 increased by 7.7 (or 1.4 million), compared to 2021, primarily due to higher casino revenue at Grand Lodge. Casino revenue increased by 9.1 (or 1.5 million) in 2022 due to higher revenue from both our slots and table games departments. Slot revenue rose by 5.4 (or 0.8 million) and table games revenue rose by 34.3 (or 0.8 million) in 2022, due to increases in both volumes and higher hold percentages. During the third quarter of 2021, Grand Lodge was adversely affected by significant wildfires in the area. Additionally, in July 2022, Stockman s resumed table games operations, which had remained closed since March 2020. Adjusted Segment EBITDA was relatively flat at 4.9 million each for 2022 and 2021. Increased volumes largely reflecting the recovery of tourism to the Lake Tahoe region at Grand Lodge during 2022 resulted in higher variable costs, such as gaming taxes, related fees, and payroll. Contracted Sports Wagering The Contracted Sports Wagering segment consists of our on-site and online sports wagering skins in Colorado, Indiana and, upon launch, Illinois. For 2022, revenues increased by 21.6 or 1.3 million) and Adjusted Segment EBITDA increased by 21.0 or 1.2 million), compared to 2021, which results reflect an additional skin that contractually went live on December 1, 2021, as well as an acceleration of deferred revenue for two agreements (one in each of Indiana and Colorado) that ceased operations in May 2022, when one of our contracted parties ceased operations, each in Indiana and Colorado. In December 2022, we entered into a sports wagering agreement to replace such operator in Colorado. We are currently evaluating whether to utilize the remaining skin in Indiana ourselves or to find a replacement operator for such skin. However, there is no certainty that we will be able to enter into an agreement with a replacement operator or successfully operate the skin ourselves. Additionally, the results of this segment do not yet include income contribution from our agreement for a third party to operate on-site and online sports betting in Illinois. Under such agreement, we will receive a percentage of revenues, as defined in the contract, subject to an annualized minimum of 5 million, with minimal expected expenses. We anticipate the Illinois sports operations will begin in Spring 2023, subject to customary regulatory approvals. For details, see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

 Corporate Corporate expenses declined by 27.7 (or 2.1 million) in 2022. In 2021, we incurred 2.1 million of costs related to non-recurring corporate initiatives. Additionally, increases to certain third-party costs were offset by a decrease in accrued bonus compensation. Non-GAAP Measure Adjusted EBITDA is earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening expenses, impairment charges, asset write-offs, recoveries, gain (loss) from asset disposals, project development and acquisition costs, and non-cash share-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA information is presented solely as supplemental disclosure to measures reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP because management believes this measure is (i) a widely used measure of operating performance in the gaming and hospitality industries and (ii) a principal basis for valuation of gaming and hospitality companies. In addition, a version of Adjusted EBITDA (known as Consolidated Cash Flow) is utilized in the covenants within our credit facility, although not necessarily defined in the same way as above. Adjusted EBITDA is not, however, a measure of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP. Accordingly, this measure should be considered supplemental and not a substitute for net income (loss) or cash flows as an indicator of our operating performance or liquidity. The following table presents a reconciliation of net (loss) income to Adjusted EBITDA:

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows As of December 31, 2022, we had 191.2 million of cash and equivalents, including 134.6 million of restricted cash dedicated to the construction of Chamonix. Subsequent to year-end, we closed on the issuance of additional senior secured notes, resulting in net proceeds of approximately 34 million. We currently estimate that between 10 million and 15 million of cash is required for our day-to-day operations, including on-site cash in our slot machines, change and redemption kiosks, and cages. We believe that current cash balances, together with the available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility and cash flows from operating activities across our six properties (including The Temporary, which opened in February 2023), will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital resource needs for the next 12 months of operations. Cash flows operating activities. On a consolidated basis, cash provided by operations during 2022 was 4.4 million, compared to 29.5 million in 2021. Trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in operating income, excluding non-cash charges, but are also affected by changes in working capital. Our operating cash flows decreased in 2022 primarily due to decreases in revenues and income, which includes preopening expenses incurred for The Temporary (which opened in February 2023) and Chamonix. Cash flows investing activities. On a consolidated basis, cash used in investing activities during 2022 was 172.1 million, primarily related to capital expenditures for Chamonix and The Temporary/American Place. In 2021, such amount was 37.2 million, primarily for our Chamonix construction project and real estate purchases in Cripple Creek, as well as to repair hurricane damage at Silver Slipper. Cash flows financing activities. On a consolidated basis, cash provided by financing activities during 2022 was 93.6 million, while cash provided by financing activities during 2021 was 235.3 million. In February 2022, we received 102.0 million of gross proceeds from the issuance of additional senior secured notes to construct The Temporary. In February and March 2021, respectively, we received 310.0 million of gross proceeds from the issuance of our 2028 Notes and 46.0 million of gross proceeds from our underwritten equity offering. These cash inflows in 2021 were partially offset by the payoff of the Prior Notes (including the related prepayment premiums), as well as expenses related to our debt and equity offerings. Other Factors Affecting Liquidity We have significant outstanding debt and contractual obligations, in addition to planned capital expenditures related to the construction of Chamonix and American Place. Our principal debt matures in February 2028. Certain planned capital expenditures designed to grow the Company, such as the permanent American Place facility and the potential future expansion of Silver Slipper, may require additional financing and/or temporarily reduce the Company s ability to repay debt. Our operations are subject to financial, economic, competitive, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Such factors include the potential effects of COVID-19 and its variants. The extent to which our liquidity in future periods may be affected by COVID-19 and its variants may largely depend on future developments. Such future developments are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted at this time, as discussed under Recent Developments . Long-Term Debt. At December 31, 2022, we had 410.0 million of principal indebtedness outstanding under the Existing Notes as issued in February 2021 and February 2022, and no drawn amounts under the Credit Facility or any outstanding letters of credit. With the exception of our Credit Facility, we have fixed interest rates on the remainder of our debt. See Note 6 and Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for details on our debt obligations.

The lease, which has been extended several times in the past, was subsequently extended through December 31, 2024. See Note 7 and Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information about this option and related rental commitments that could affect our liquidity and capital resources. Capital Investments. In addition to normal maintenance capital expenditures, we continue to make significant capital investments related to the construction of Chamonix, The Temporary and American Place. Chamonix As previously discussed in Operating Properties Chamonix Casino and Hotel under Part I, Item 1. Business, we increased the size of the Chamonix project s hotel capacity by 67 , to approximately 300 luxury guest rooms and suites from our previously planned 180 guest rooms. To fund Chamonix s construction, we issued our 2028 Notes and placed a portion of such proceeds into a restricted cash account dedicated to Chamonix s construction (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ). As of December 31, 2022, the balance of such restricted cash account was approximately 135 million . We expect to invest all of such amount in 2023, as full completion of construction is expected before the end of 2023. American Place As discussed above in the Executive Overview , we were selected by the IGB to develop and operate American Place in Waukegan, Illinois. While the larger permanent facility is under construction, we will operate a temporary casino named The Temporary by American Place, which opened in February 2023. During 2023, we expect to invest approximately 70 million into this project, consisting largely of significant upfront gaming license payments and the recent completion of The Temporary s construction, as well as professional fees related to the design of the permanent American Place facility. We expect to transfer purchased slot machines and other equipment to the permanent casino once opened. See Note 6 and Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Other Capital Expenditures Additionally, we may fund various other capital expenditure projects, depending on our financial resources. Our capital expenditures may fluctuate due to decisions regarding strategic capital investments in new or existing facilities, and the timing of capital investments to maintain the quality of our properties. No assurance can be given that any of our planned capital expenditure projects will be completed or that any completed projects will be successful. Our annual capital expenditures typically include some number of new slot machines and related equipment; to some extent, we can coordinate such purchases to match our resources. We evaluate projects based on a number of factors, including profitability forecasts, length of the development period, the regulatory and political environment, and the ability to secure the funding necessary to complete the development or acquisition, among other considerations. No assurance can be given that any additional projects will be pursued or completed or that any completed projects will be successful. Principal Debt Arrangements See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information.

 Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies Our consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Certain of our accounting policies require that we apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions for calculating estimates that affect reported amounts and disclosures. By their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, and therefore, actual results may differ from our estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Impairment of Long-lived Assets, Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangibles Our long-lived assets include property and equipment, goodwill, and indefinite-lived intangibles, and are evaluated at least annually (and more frequently when circumstances warrant) to determine if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Examples of such events or changes in circumstances that might indicate impairment testing is warranted might include, as applicable, an adverse change in the legal, regulatory or business climate relative to gaming nationally or in the jurisdictions in which we operate, or a significant long-term decline in historical or forecasted earnings or cash flows or the fair value of our property or business, possibly as a result of competitive or other economic or political factors. In evaluating whether a loss in value is other than temporary, we consider: (i) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value or market value has been less than cost; (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the casino property, including any specific events which may influence the operations; (iii) our intent related to the asset and ability to retain it for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value; (iv) the condition and trend of the economic cycle; (v) historical and forecasted financial performance; and (vi) trends in the general market. We review the carrying value of our property and equipment used in our operations whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset. Fair value is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model whereby future cash flows are discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital, developed using a standard capital-asset pricing model, based on guideline companies in our industry. We test our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or when a triggering event occurs. For our 2022 and 2021 annual impairment tests, we utilized the option to perform a qualitative analysis for our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of such intangibles exceeded their carrying values. Any impairment charges incurred are not reversed if a subsequent evaluation concludes a higher valuation than the carrying value. For further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets, see Note 2 and Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Fixed Asset Capitalization and Depreciation Policies We define fixed assets as certain property and equipment with economic useful lives that extend beyond a year. Such fixed assets are stated at cost. For the majority of our property and equipment, cost was determined at the acquisition date based on estimated fair values. We acquired Bronco Billy s in May 2016, Silver Slipper in October 2012, Rising Star in April 2011 and Stockman s in January 2007. Project development costs, which are amounts expended on the pursuit of new business opportunities, acquisition-related costs, as well as other business development activities in the ordinary course of business, are expensed as incurred. Maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are also expensed as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. When we construct assets, we capitalize direct costs of the project, including fees paid to architects and contractors and property taxes. Salaries are capitalized only for employees working directly on the project. In addition, interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project. Interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weighted-average cost of our outstanding borrowings. Capitalization of interest starts when construction activities begin and ceases when construction is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period.

 We must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures. Whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset is sometimes a matter of judgment. When constructing or purchasing assets, we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired, which also may be a matter of judgment. In addition, our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets estimated useful lives. We determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets, engineering studies, and our estimate of the usage of the asset. Whenever events or circumstances occur, which would change the estimated useful life of an asset, we account for the change prospectively. Income Taxes We are subject to federal and state taxes in the United States. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance recorded against our net DTAs. Such valuation allowance was 15.2 million for 2022 and 9.9 million for 2021 . We make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices may be subject to change due to economic or political conditions, including fundamental changes to the applicable tax laws. Our income tax returns are subject to examination by the IRS and other tax authorities. Positions taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately be accepted by the IRS or other tax authorities. We assess our tax positions using a two-step process. A tax position is recognized if it meets a more likely than not threshold. It is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized. Additionally, we recognize accrued interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. For further discussion of income taxes, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. As a smaller reporting company during the year ended December 31, 2022, as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 of the Company and our report dated March 15, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ March 15, 2023

 Income Taxes Valuation Allowance Refer to Note 8 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of their respective assets and liabilities. The Company provides valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when it is deemed more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Future realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Sources of taxable income include future reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, ability to carry tax attributes back to prior years, and tax planning strategies. The Company s valuation allowance for its US federal and certain state deferred tax assets was 15.2 million as of December 31, 2022. We identified the Company s valuation allowance analysis and conclusion as a critical audit matter because of the estimates and judgments required by management in determining whether deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized, including the projected timing and pattern of future reversals of existing temporary differences and the projection of future sources of taxable income. Auditing management s projected timing and pattern of future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and the projection of future sources of taxable income, which affect the recorded valuation allowance, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our income tax specialists. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the Company s valuation allowance analysis included the following, among others: 
 We tested the effectiveness of management s internal controls over the valuation allowance analysis. With the assistance of our income tax specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of management s analysis, including the projected timing and pattern of future reversals of deferred tax assets and liabilities. We evaluated the reasonableness of management s assessment of the significance and weighting of negative and positive evidence that is objectively verifiable, as well as whether it was more likely than not that sufficient estimated taxable income sources would be generated in the future for all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets to be realized, including consideration of: 
 o Relevant tax laws and regulations; o Future reversals of deferred tax assets and liabilities; o Relevant tax planning strategies; and 
 
 o Projected future taxable income, including adjustments for non-recurring items, as applicable.

From March 2020 through the date of this report, our operations have been impacted by the novel coronavirus as a global pandemic COVID-19 ). Although COVID-19 continues to spread throughout the U.S. and the world, the number of newly reported cases has been in overall decline in the U.S., though new variants could result in a reversal of these trends. The onset of COVID-19 resulted in the implementation of significant, government-imposed measures to prevent or reduce its spread, including travel restrictions, business restrictions, closing of borders, shelter-in-place orders and business closures. From April 2020 to March 2021, the federal government issued three rounds of stimulus payments for qualified individuals and sponsored certain CARES Act programs to offer economic relief and reduce the financial strain that many consumers and businesses alike felt from COVID-19 and related restrictions.

 by asset class for gaming-related equipment; as a result, the Company will not allocate contract consideration to the separate lease and non-lease components based on their relative standalone prices. Finance and operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future minimum lease payments over the expected lease term at commencement, plus any qualifying initial direct costs paid prior to commencement for ROU assets. As the implicit rate is not determinable in most of the Company s leases, management uses the Company s incremental borrowing rate as estimated by third-party valuation specialists in determining the present value of future payments based on the information available at the commencement date and/or modification date. The expected lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term for operating leases. For finance leases, the ROU asset depreciates/amortizes on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or useful life of the ROU asset as applicable, and the lease liability accretes interest based on the interest method using the discount rate determined at lease commencement.

Deferred Revenues: Market Access Fees from Sports Wagering Agreements. The Company entered into several agreements with various unaffiliated companies allowing for online sports wagering within Indiana, Colorado and Illinois, as well as on-site sports wagering at Rising Star Casino Resort, Bronco Billy s Casino and Hotel, and The Temporary/American Place (the Sports Agreements ). As part of these long-term Sports Agreements, the Company received one-time market access fees, which were recorded as long-term liabilities and are being recognized as revenue ratably over the initial contract terms (or as accelerated due to termination), beginning with the commencement of operations. On May 15, 2022, one of the Company s contracted parties for sports wagering ceased operations, which created available skin in each of Colorado and Indiana. Accordingly, this accelerated the recognition of million of deferred revenue, which was recognized through the May 2022 termination date, as opposed to the remaining eight years of the original -year term. Indiana. The Company s Sports Agreements commenced operations in December 2019, April 2021, and December 2021. As noted above, one of these Sports Agreements ceased operations in May 2022. The Company continues to evaluate whether to utilize the remaining skin itself or to find a replacement operator for such skin. There is no certainty that the Company will be able to enter into an agreement with a replacement operator or successfully operate the skin itself. Colorado. The Company s Sports Agreements commenced operations in June 2020, December 2020 and April 2021. As noted above, of these Sports Agreements ceased operations in May 2022. In December 2022, the Company signed a Sports Agreement with a new third party for this available skin, which upfront fee was capitalized and will be amortized over the -year term of the agreement that contractually commenced in March 2023, but is still pending the receipt of customary gaming approvals. Under the Company s three active Sports Agreements in Colorado, we receive a percentage of revenues (as defined), subject to annual minimums totaling 3 million. Illinois. In May 2022, the Company signed a Sports Agreement for its sole Illinois sports skin and received an upfront fee of million, which was capitalized and will be amortized over the term of the agreement that is expected to commence in Spring 2023, pending the receipt of customary gaming approvals. The Company will also receive a percentage of revenues (as defined), subject to a minimum of million per year. In addition to the market access fees, deferred revenue includes the annual prepayment of contracted revenue, as required in of the Sports Agreements. As of December 31, 2022, million of such deferred revenue has been recognized during the year.

The lease was valued at and represents the excess fair value of the land over the estimated net present value of the land lease payments, and the water rights value of represents the fair value of the water rights based upon market rates in Hancock County, Mississippi. Gaming Licenses. Gaming licenses primarily represent the value of the license to conduct gaming in certain jurisdictions, which are subject to highly extensive regulatory oversight and, in some cases, a limitation on the number of licenses available for issuance. The values of gaming licenses were primarily estimated using a multi-period excess earning method of the income approach, which examines the economic returns contributed by the identified tangible and intangible assets of a company, and then isolates the excess return, which is attributable to the asset being valued, based on cash flows attributable to the gaming license.

In general, our federal tax net operating loss carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely and our state tax carryforwards can be carried forward . The Company also has general business credits of million, which begin to expire in 2035. In assessing the realizability of its deferred tax assets DTAs ), the Company considered whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the DTAs will not be realized. The ultimate realization of DTAs is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. The Company considered all of the available positive and negative evidence when determining the need for a valuation allowance, including, but not limited to, the scheduled reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. As of December 31, 2022, the Company continues to provide a valuation allowance against its DTAs that cannot be offset by existing deferred tax liabilities. In accordance with ASC 740, this assessment has taken into consideration the jurisdictions in which these DTAs reside. The valuation allowance against DTAs has no effect on the actual taxes paid or owed by the Company. In the future, if it is determined that we meet the more likely than not threshold of utilizing our deferred tax assets as required under ASC 740, we may reverse some or all of our valuation allowance. We will continue to evaluate the need for the valuation allowance during each interim period in 2023. Should net income improve in the future, the valuation allowance could be reversed by the end of 2023, absent any unforeseen impact to our operations. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had million and million, respectively, of deferred tax liabilities relating to goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles net of the maximum benefit allowed under the statute after netting with the indefinite-lived DTAs.

Option valuation weighted-average assumptions were as follows: Expected dividend yield Expected term (in years) Weighted average risk-free rate Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock price. Dividend yield is based on the estimate of annual dividends expected to be paid at the time of the grant. The expected term considers the contractual term of the option as well as historical exercise and forfeiture behavior. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rates in effect on the grant date for U.S. Treasury instruments with maturities matching the relevant expected term of the award.

Exhibit 4.1 FULL HOUSE RESORTS, INC. DESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRANT S SECURITIES REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 Full House Resorts, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company, we, us or our has one class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended: our Common Stock (as defined below). The following description of our Common Stock is a summary and does not purport to be complete. This summary is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended Certificate of Incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws By-laws ), each of which is filed as an exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this Exhibit 4.1 is a part. We encourage you to read our Certificate of Incorporation, our By-laws, and the applicable provisions of the General Corporation law of the State of Delaware (the DGCL for additional information. Authorized Shares Our authorized capital consists of 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value 0.0001 per share Common Stock ), and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value 0.0001 per share Preferred Stock ). All outstanding shares of our Common Stock are fully paid and non-assessable. As of December 31, 2022, we had 34,407,654 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding and no shares of Preferred Stock issued or outstanding. Common Stock Dividends Holders of our Common Stock are entitled to receive such dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by our board of directors out of legally available funds. The declaration and payment of dividends on our Common Stock is a business decision to be made by our board of directors from time to time based upon results of our operations and our financial condition and any other factors as our board of directors considers relevant. Under the DGCL, we can only pay dividends to the extent that we have surplus the extent by which the fair market value of our net assets exceeds the amount of our capital, or to the extent of our net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. In addition, the payment of dividends may be restricted by loan agreements, indentures and other transactions entered into us from time to time. Voting Rights Holders of Common Stock have the exclusive power to vote on all matters presented to our stockholders, including the election of directors, except as otherwise provided by the DGCL or as provided with respect to any other class or series of stock, if any. Holders of Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share. An affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders at which a quorum is present and entitled to vote thereon is sufficient for approval of all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. There is no cumulative voting. 

 Liquidation Rights In the event we are dissolved and our affairs our wound up, after we pay or make adequate provision for all of our debts and liabilities in accordance with applicable law, each holder of our Common Stock will receive dividends pro rata out of assets that we can legally use to pay distributions. Other Rights Subject to the preferential rights of any other class or series of stock, all shares of Common Stock have equal dividend, distribution, liquidation and other rights, and have no preference or appraisal rights, except for any appraisal rights provided by the DGCL. Furthermore, holders of our Common Stock have no conversion, sinking fund or redemption rights, or rights to subscribe for any of our securities, except that our Certificate of Incorporation imposes certain obligations on holders of our Common Stock relating to compliance with the gaming authorities and empowers the Company to redeem shares of Common Stock under certain limited circumstances. For additional information, see Description of Governmental Gaming Regulations in Exhibit 99.1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Listing Our Common Stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol FLL. Preferred Stock Prior to the issuance of any shares of our Preferred Stock, an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation must be adopted by our board of directors and approved by our stockholders to designate one or more series of such Preferred Stock and to fix, for each series, the designations, powers and preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of the shares of each series and any qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, as are permitted by the DGCL. Our Certificate of Incorporation does not include a blank check provision that would otherwise authorize our board of directors to issue our Preferred Stock in any number or series and to determine the rights of each series without needing additional stockholder approval. Certain Anti-Takeover Effects of our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws and Delaware Law General. Certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and our By-laws, and certain provisions of the DGCL could make our acquisition by a third party, a change in our incumbent management, or a similar change of control more difficult. These provisions, which are summarized below, are likely to reduce our vulnerability to an unsolicited proposal for the restructuring or sale of all or substantially all of our assets or an unsolicited takeover attempt. The summary of the provisions set forth below does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to our Certificate of Incorporation and our By-laws and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Advance Notice Requirements. Stockholders wishing to nominate persons for election to our board of directors at an annual meeting or to propose any business to be considered by our stockholders at an annual meeting must comply with certain advance notice and other requirements set forth in our By-laws. Likewise, if our board of directors has determined that directors shall be elected at a special meeting of stockholders, stockholders wishing to nominate or re-nominate persons for election to our board of directors at such special meeting must comply with certain advance notice and other requirements set forth in our By-laws. Special Meetings. Our By-laws provide that special meetings of stockholders may only be called by our board of directors or at the request in writing of stockholders owning at least forty percent (40 of the shares entitled to vote. 

 Board Vacancies. Any vacancy on our board of directors may be filled by a majority vote of the directors then in office, though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. Any director elected to fill a vacancy shall hold office for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders and until their successors are elected and qualified. If one or more directors shall resign from our board of directors effective at a future date, a majority of directors then in office, including those who have so resigned, shall have the power to fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote thereon to take effect when such resignation or resignations shall become effective, and each director so chosen shall hold office as provided for the filling of other vacancies. Exclusive Forum Bylaws Provision . Our By-laws require that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, and unless the Company consents in writing to an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the Eighth Judicial District Court of Clark County, Nevada, will be the sole and exclusive forum for any internal corporate claims. Internal corporate claims means claims, including claims in the right of the corporation, (i) that are based upon a violation of a duty by a current or former director or officer or stockholder in such capacity, or (ii) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL . Although we believe this provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the consistent application of law in the type of lawsuits to which it applies, the provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers. Authorized but Unissued Shares. Our authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock are generally available for our board of directors to issue without stockholder approval. We may use these additional shares for a variety of corporate purposes, including future offerings to raise additional capital, corporate acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of our authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of our company by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or other transaction. Section 203 of the DGCL . We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In general, Section 203 prohibits a Delaware corporation that is listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 shareholders from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a three-year period following the time that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. A business combination includes, among other things, certain mergers, asset or stock sales or other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. An interested stockholder is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns, or did own within three years prior to the determination of interested stockholder status, 15 or more of the corporation s outstanding voting stock. Under Section 203, a business combination between a corporation and an interested stockholder is prohibited unless it satisfies one of the following conditions: before the stockholder became interested, the board of directors approved either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder; upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85 of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding, shares owned by persons who are directors and also officers, and employee stock plans, in some instances; or at or after the time the stockholder became interested, the business combination was approved by the board of directors of the corporation and authorized at an annual or special meeting of the stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2 / 3 of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested stockholder.

 B. The indemnification provisions of Section 8.5 shall not be limited in any way by any limitation on the amount or type of damages, compensation or benefits payable by or for Tenant or any contractor or subcontractor of Tenant under any workers or workmen s compensation acts, disability benefit acts or other employee benefit acts. In no event shall the Indemnified Claims include any claims arising solely out of the grossly negligent or willful acts or omissions of the Indemnified Parties. 
 C. Landlord shall notify Tenant (such notification is herein called a Notice of Claim or Notice of Potential Claim , as the case may be) of any Indemnified Claim or of any occurrence or event that could give rise to an Indemnified Claim Potential Claim for which Landlord or one of the Indemnified Parties is (or believes it is) entitled to be indemnified or defended under this Ground Lease promptly after Landlord obtains actual knowledge of any Indemnified Claim or Potential Claim. A Notice of Claim or Notice of Potential Claim shall specify, in reasonable detail, the nature and estimated amount of any such Indemnified Claim or Potential Claim and the basis for Landlord s belief as to why it or applicable Indemnified Party is entitled to be indemnified or defended.

 Page 18 

D. If it becomes necessary for Landlord to defend an Indemnified Claim, Landlord may provide Tenant with a Notice of Claims and tender defense of such action to Tenant. Tenant shall accept such tender of defense and Tenant will pay all actual out-of-pocket costs, actual out-of-pocket expenses, and reasonable actual out-of-pocket attorney s fees incurred in effecting such defense, in addition to any other sums which Landlord may be called upon to pay by reason of the entry of a judgment against Landlord in the litigation in which such claim is asserted.

Landlord and Tenant agree to have all fire and extended coverage and material damage insurance which may be carried by either of them endorsed with a clause providing that any release from liability of or waiver of claim for recovery from the other Party entered into in writing by the insured thereunder prior to any loss or damage shall not affect the validity of said policy or the right of the insured to recover thereunder, and providing further that the insurer waives all rights of subrogation which such insurer might have against the other Party. Without limiting any release or waiver of liability or recovery contained in any other provision of this Ground Lease but rather in confirmation and furtherance thereof, Landlord waives all claims for recovery from Tenant and its agents, partners and employees, and Tenant waives all claims for recovery from Landlord and its agents, partners and employees, for any loss or damage to any of its property insured under valid and collectible insurance policies to the extent of any recovery collectible under such insurance policies. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything contained in this Ground Lease to the contrary, any release or any waiver of claims shall not be operative, nor shall the foregoing endorsements be required, in any case where the effect of such release or waiver is to invalidate insurance coverage or invalidate the right of the insured to recover thereunder or increase the cost thereof (provided that in the case of increased cost the other Party shall have the right, within ten days following written notice, to pay such increased cost, thereby keeping such release or waiver in full force and effect).

Upon acquisition of Tenant s interest in this Ground Lease and performance by such Leasehold Mortgagee of all covenants and agreements of Tenant, except those which by their nature cannot be performed or cured by any Person other than Tenant, Landlord s right to terminate this Ground Lease and right to possession of the tenant hereunder shall be waived with respect to the matters which have been cured by Leasehold Mortgagee. This Section 14(B) shall not limit Section 15.2(H) of this Ground Lease.

 F. In the event any right granted to a Leasehold Mortgagee under this Section 15.2 shall by its nature only be exercisable by one Leasehold Mortgagee, and if there are multiple Leasehold Mortgagees, then only the Leasehold Mortgagee holding the most senior Leasehold Mortgage shall be entitled to do so unless such Leasehold Mortgagee delegates its right to exercise such right to a Leasehold Mortgagee holding a junior Leasehold Mortgage.
 G. In the event a Leasehold Mortgagee or its designee (by foreclosure, conveyance in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise), or the purchaser at a foreclosure sale or the assignee or designee of such purchaser, acquires Tenant s interest in this Ground Lease, the Leasehold Mortgagee or its designee shall not be bound by any modification or amendment to this Ground Lease entered into after Leasehold Mortgagee acquired a security interest in the Tenant s interest in this Ground Lease not otherwise previously approved by the Leasehold Mortgagee.
 H.

 Page 33 

payment or take any action which it is entitled to take under this Section 15.2 until such time as such Leasehold Mortgagee assumes possession of the Premises or acquires the Tenant s interest in the Ground Lease, and then only for as long as it remains in possession or the owner of the leasehold estate created thereby, and Landlord expressly waives any and all such claims.
 J. The liability of any Leasehold Mortgagee, its successors and assigns, under this Ground Lease shall be limited in all respects to its interest in this Ground Lease and the leasehold estate created hereby and such Leasehold Mortgagee shall have no personal liability hereunder and no judgment or decree shall be enforceable beyond the interest of such Leasehold Mortgagee in the leasehold estate created under this Ground Lease or shall be sought or entered in any action or proceeding brought in connection with this Ground Lease.
 K. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Ground Lease, if a Leasehold Mortgagee or its designee shall acquire title to Tenant s interest in this Ground Lease, by foreclosure of its Leasehold Mortgage thereon or by assignment in lieu of foreclosure, such Leasehold Mortgagee or designee may freely assign this Ground Lease without the consent of Landlord and shall thereupon be released from all liability for the performance or observance of the covenants and conditions in this Ground Lease contained on Tenant s part to be performed and observed from and after the date of such assignment; provided, however, that the assignee shall have assumed, pursuant to legally binding written instruments, the obligations of Tenant under the Ground Lease and the DHCA that first accrue from and after the date of such assumption.
 L.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Ground Lease, the appointment of the Receiver for the Premises or the Improvements by any court at the request of a Leasehold Mortgagee or by agreement between Tenant and such Leasehold Mortgagee, or the entering into possession of the Premises or the Improvements by such Receiver, shall not be deemed to make such Leasehold Mortgagee a mortgagee-in-possession or otherwise liable in any manner with respect to the Premises or the Improvements and shall not, in and of itself, constitute default under this Ground Lease.
 M. Tenant and Landlord agree that the provisions of this Section 15.2 are for the benefit of and shall be enforceable by each Leasehold Mortgagee, its respective successors and assigns, provided that each such Leasehold Mortgagee, and its respective successors and assigns, comply with the provisions of this Section 15.2.

Further, each Leasehold Mortgage shall provide that the Leasehold Mortgagee will execute such reasonable agreements and instruments as may be required by Landlord and/ or its lenders to further evidence such subordination. Tenant acknowledges and agrees that Landlord s title in and to the Land shall at all times be superior to and paramount to the interest in the Land of

Tenant and anyone claiming by, through or under Tenant including, without limitation, any Leasehold Mortgagee or other encumbrancer, assignee or subtenant of Tenant. 
 O.

Leasehold Mortgagee or its designee, as tenant under the new lease, shall have priority equal to Tenant s estate under the Ground Lease (that is, there shall be no charge, lien, or burden upon the Premises or improvements prior to or superior to the estate granted by such new lease that was not prior to or superior to Tenant s estate under the Ground Lease as of the date immediately preceding the date the Ground Lease went into default, except, however, any charge, lien or burden that should not have been permitted and/or should have been discharged by Tenant under the terms of the Ground Lease).

Exhibit 99.1 DESCRIPTION OF GOVERNMENTAL GAMING REGULATIONS Nevada Regulatory Matters In order to own or lease Stockman s Casino, the Grand Lodge Casino or any other gaming operation in Nevada, we are subject to the Nevada Gaming Control Act and to the licensing and regulatory control of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, the Nevada Gaming Commission, and various local, city and county regulatory agencies. In May 2006, we applied for registration with the Nevada Gaming Commission as a publicly traded corporation, which was granted on January 25, 2007. We must regularly submit detailed financial and operating reports to the Nevada Gaming Control Board. Certain loans, leases, sales of securities and similar financing transactions must also be reported to or approved by the Nevada Gaming Commission. The Nevada Gaming Commission may also require anyone having a material relationship or involvement with us to be found suitable or licensed, in which case those persons are required to pay the costs and fees of the Nevada Gaming Control Board in connection with the investigation. Any person who acquires more than 5 of any class of our voting securities must report the acquisition to the Nevada Gaming Commission. Any person who becomes a beneficial owner of 10 or more of our voting securities is required to apply for a finding of suitability. The Nevada Gaming Commission may also, in its discretion, require any other holders of our debt or equity securities to file applications to be found suitable to own the debt or equity securities. If the Nevada Gaming Commission determines that a person is unsuitable to own such security, then pursuant to the regulations of the Nevada Gaming Commission, we may be sanctioned, including the loss of our approvals, if, without the prior approval of the Nevada Gaming Commission, we: pay to the unsuitable person any dividends, interest or any distribution whatsoever; recognize any voting right by such unsuitable person in connection with such securities; pay the unsuitable person remuneration in any form; or make any payment to the unsuitable person by way of principal, redemption, conversion exchange, liquidation or similar transaction. 
 Under certain circumstances, an institutional investor, as such term is defined in the regulations of the Nevada Gaming Commission, which acquires more than 10 , but not more than 25 of our voting securities, may apply to the Nevada Gaming Commission for a waiver of such finding of suitability requirements, provided the institutional investor holds the voting securities for investment purposes only. Any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license within 30 days after being ordered to do so by the Nevada Gaming Commission may be found unsuitable based solely on such failure or refusal. We are required to maintain a current stock ledger in Nevada which may be examined by the Nevada Gaming Commission at any time, and to file with the Nevada Gaming Commission, at least annually, a list of our stockholders. The Nevada Gaming Commission has the power to require our stock certificates to bear a legend indicating that the securities are subject to the Nevada Gaming Control Act and the regulations of the Nevada Gaming Commission. As a licensee or registrant, we may not make certain public offerings of our securities without the prior approval of the Nevada Gaming Commission. We have received a waiver of the prior approval requirement with respect to public offerings of securities subject to certain conditions. Also, changes in control through merger, consolidation, acquisition of assets, management or consulting agreements or any form of takeover cannot occur without prior investigation by the Nevada Gaming Control Board and approval by the Nevada Gaming Commission. 

 The Nevada Legislature has declared that some repurchases of voting securities, corporate acquisitions opposed by management, and corporate defense tactics affecting Nevada gaming licensees, and registered companies that are affiliated with those operations, may be harmful to stable and productive corporate gaming. Because we are a registered company, approvals may be required from the Nevada Gaming Commission before we can make exceptional repurchases of voting securities above their current market price and before a corporate acquisition opposed by management can be consummated. The Nevada Gaming Control Act also requires prior approval of a plan of recapitalization proposed by a registered company s Board in response to a tender offer made directly to its stockholders for the purpose of acquiring control. Licensee fees and taxes, computed in various ways depending on the type of gaming or activity involved, are payable to the State of Nevada and to the counties and cities in which the Nevada licensee s respective operations are conducted. Depending upon the particular fee or tax involved, these fees and taxes are payable monthly, quarterly or annually and are based upon either: a percentage of the gross revenues received; the number of gaming devices operated; or the number of table games operated. 
 A live entertainment tax is also paid on admission charges where entertainment is furnished. Nevada licensees that hold a license as an operator of a slot route, a manufacturer or a distributor also pay certain fees and taxes to the State of Nevada. The Nevada Gaming Commission enacted a cybersecurity regulation in December 2022, which requires us to conduct a risk assessment to develop cybersecurity best practices by December 31, 2023, and designate an individual to be responsible for cybersecurity, as well as to have our independent accountant annually review the cybersecurity best practices we develop. The Nevada regulation also includes reporting obligations to the Nevada Gaming Control Board in the event we experience a cyber-attack. Any person who is licensed, required to be licensed, registered, required to be registered, or who is under common control with those persons, collectively, licensees, and who proposes to become involved in a gaming venture outside of Nevada, is required to deposit with the Nevada Gaming Control Board, and thereafter maintain, a revolving fund in the amount of 10,000 to pay the expenses of investigation by the Nevada Gaming Control Board of the licensee s participation in foreign gaming. We currently comply with this requirement. The revolving fund is subject to increase or decrease at the discretion of the Nevada Gaming Commission. Licensees are required to comply with the reporting requirements imposed by the Nevada Gaming Control Act. A licensee is also subject to disciplinary action by the Nevada Gaming Commission if it: knowingly violates any laws of the foreign jurisdiction pertaining to the foreign gaming operation; fails to conduct the foreign gaming operation in accordance with the standards of honesty and integrity required of Nevada gaming operations; engages in any activity or enters into any association that is unsuitable because it poses an unreasonable threat to the control of gaming in Nevada, reflects or tends to reflect, discredit or disrepute upon the State of Nevada or gaming in Nevada, or is contrary to the gaming policies of Nevada; engages in activities or enters into associations that are harmful to the State of Nevada or its ability to collect gaming taxes and fees; or employs, contracts with or associates with a person in the foreign operation who has been denied a license or a finding of suitability in Nevada on the ground of unsuitability. 

Indiana Regulatory Matters We own and operate a wholly-owned subsidiary, Gaming Entertainment (Indiana) LLC, which acquired and operates Rising Star Casino Resort in Rising Sun, Indiana. The ownership and operation of casino facilities in Indiana are subject to extensive state and local regulation, including primarily the licensing and regulatory control of the Indiana Gaming Commission IGC ). The Indiana Riverboat Gaming Act Riverboat Act and the Gambling Games at Racetracks Act, together and as amended (the Indiana Acts ), allow up to thirteen commercial (non-tribal) casinos in the State of Indiana. Specifically, the IGC has presently authorized: (i) owner s licenses for the operation of four riverboat casinos in counties contiguous to Lake Michigan in northern Indiana, as well as five riverboat casinos in counties contiguous to the Ohio River in southern Indiana; (ii) one operating agent contract permitting a private company to operate a land based casino in French Lick, Indiana; and (iii) two gambling game licenses for the operation of land based casinos at Indiana s two pari-mutuel horse racing tracks. In 2019, the Indiana General Assembly passed legislation that allowed one of the owner s licenses allocated to one of the riverboats previously located in a county contiguous to Lake Michigan in northern Indiana to be moved to a land based casino in Terre Haute, Indiana. The same legislation allowed the holder of another of the riverboat casino licenses located in northwest Indiana to move to a land-based site, still located in a county contiguous to Lake Michigan, in Gary, Indiana. The Terre Haute casino license was awarded in November of 2021 and is presently expected to open in 2024. In 2015, Indiana enacted legislation that would have allowed both racinos to begin offering live table games after March 1, 2021. However, the legislation enacted in 2019 (as noted above) enabled the racinos to begin offering live table games on January 1, 2020, which both locations implemented at that time. The 2015 legislation also authorized an increase of each racino s maximum size to 2,200 gambling games (beginning on January 1, 2021), while imposing a cap on the size of all other casino properties that is equal to the greatest number of gambling games offered by the applicable casino property since January 1, 2007. The 2015 legislation also permitted riverboat owners to relocate an owner s gaming operation from a riverboat facility to an inland facility, provided such inland facility is, among other things, located on a parcel that is adjacent to the dock site of the licensed owner s riverboat. Any such inland casino is subject to the same gambling game cap applicable to the riverboat. Since passage of the 2015 legislation, the IGC has demonstrated a willingness to consider and approve requests to relocate certain gaming devices to off-riverboat locations that are adjacent to still-functioning riverboat casinos, thus enabling partial land-based gaming without relocating the entire gaming facility to land. In 2015, Public Law 255-2015 specified a process for entering into tribal-state compacts concerning Indian Gaming, a procedure not previously contemplated under Indiana law. Prior to that, in May of 2012, the Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians (the Band submitted to the Bureau of Indian Affairs a fee-to-trust application to take 165 acres of land in South Bend into trust. In 2017, the Band opened a Class II gaming facility in South Bend, Indiana. In 2019, the Band began negotiations with the State of Indiana to enter into a tribal-state compact for Class III gaming at the facility in South Bend, Indiana. In April of 2021, the Indiana General Assembly passed legislation to ratify and codify a tribal-state compact negotiated between the Band and the State of Indiana. In May of 2021, it was announced that the Band had finalized and executed the compact with the State. The Pokagon Band is currently operating a Class III facility in South Bend, Indiana. The Indiana Acts strictly regulate the facilities, persons, associations and practices related to gaming operations pursuant to the police powers of Indiana, including comprehensive law enforcement provisions. The Indiana Acts vest the IGC with the power and duties of administering, regulating and enforcing the system of casino gaming in Indiana. The IGC s jurisdiction extends to every person, association, corporation, partnership, owner, and trust involved in casino gaming operations in Indiana and grants the IGC the authority to request specific information from all such persons or entities. 

 An Indiana owner s license allows the licensee to own and operate one riverboat per license granted and gaming equipment as part of a gaming operation. An owner s license is not a property right and remains, at all times, the property of the State of Indiana. The Riverboat Act allows a person to hold up to a 100 ownership interest in not more than six of any combination of riverboat licenses or gambling game licenses issued under IC 4-35 (racino licenses). Each owner s license is subject to renewal on an annual basis upon a determination by the IGC that the licensee continues to be suitable to hold an owner s license pursuant to the Riverboat Act and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder. A licensee may not lease, hypothecate, borrow money against or lend money against an owner s license. An ownership interest in an owner s license may only be transferred in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the IGC under the Riverboat Act. Gaming Entertainment (Indiana) LLC applied for and, on March 15, 2011, was granted the transfer of a riverboat owner s license. Thereafter, Gaming Entertainment (Indiana) LLC has renewed its license annually, effective on September 15 of each year. The Riverboat Act requires that a licensed owner undergo a complete re-investigation every three years. If for any reason the license is terminated, the assets of the riverboat gaming operation cannot be disposed of without the approval of the IGC. The IGC also requires a comprehensive disclosure of financial and operating information by licensees, by their principal officers and by their parent corporations. If an institutional investor acquires a beneficial ownership interest of 5 or more of any class of voting securities of a publicly traded corporation, the investor is required to notify the IGC and may be subject to licensure and a finding of suitability. Institutional investors who acquire a beneficial ownership interest of 15 or more of any class of voting securities are subject to a full investigation and finding of suitability. In addition, the IGC may require an institutional investor that acquires 15 or more of certain non-voting equity units to apply for a finding of suitability. Any person who is not an institutional investor that acquires beneficial ownership of 5 or more of any class of voting securities of a licensee is required to apply for a finding of suitability. The Riverboat Act prohibits contributions to a candidate for any state, legislative, or local office; to a candidate s committee; or to a regular party committee by: (i) the holder of an owner s license; (ii) a person holding at least 1 interest in an owner licensee; (iii) an officer of an owner licensee; (iv) an officer of a person that holds at least 1 interest in an owner licensee; or (v) a political action committee of an owner licensee. The prohibition on political contributions is applicable while an owner licensee holds the license and for a period of three years following the expiration or termination of such license. In 2009, the Indiana General Assembly enacted legislation requiring all casino operators to submit for approval by the IGC a written power of attorney identifying a person who would serve as a trustee to temporarily operate the casino in certain rare circumstances, such as: the revocation or non-renewal of any owner s license; the denial of an owner s license to a proposed transferee and the person attempting to sell the riverboat is unable or unwilling to retain ownership or control; the involuntary bankruptcy of the licensed owner; or a licensed owner s agreement in writing to relinquish control of the riverboat. During any time period that the trustee is operating the casino, the trustee has exclusive and broad authority over the casino gambling operations. The IGC most recently approved Gaming Entertainment (Indiana) LLC s power of attorney renewal in September of 2022. The IGC requires licensees to maintain a cash reserve equal to a licensee s average payout for a three-day period based on the licensee s performance during the prior calendar quarter. The cash reserve can consist of cash on hand, cash maintained in Indiana bank accounts and cash equivalents not otherwise committed or obligated. The IGC also prohibits distributions, other than distributions for the payment of state or federal taxes, by a licensee to its partners, shareholders, itself or any affiliated entity if the distribution would impair the financial viability of the gaming operation. The Indiana Acts do not limit the maximum bet or loss per patron. Each licensee sets minimum and maximum wagers on its own games. Players must use chips or tokens as, according to the Indiana Acts, wagering may not be conducted with money or other negotiable currency. No person under the age of 21 is permitted to wager or enter a casino. With the exception of permitted sports wagers that are accepted through licensed mobile sports wagering operations, as is discussed in greater detail below, wagers may only be made by persons who are physically present at a licensed casino. 

 Contracts to which Gaming Entertainment (Indiana) LLC is a party are subject to regulatory oversight by the IGC, including in certain circumstances, disclosure and approval processes imposed by Indiana regulations. An owner licensee may not enter into or perform any contract or transaction in which it transfers or receives consideration which is not commercially reasonable or which does not reflect the fair market value of the goods or services rendered or received. All contracts are subject to disapproval and/or cancellation by the IGC. Through the establishment of purchasing goals for licensees, the IGC encourages minority business enterprises and women business enterprises to participate in the gaming industry. The goals must be derived from the statistical analysis of utilization studies of licensee contracts for goods and services. Any failure by a licensee to meet these goals will be scrutinized heavily by the IGC and the Riverboat Act authorizes the IGC to suspend, limit, or revoke an owner s gaming license, or to impose a fine, if the licensee does not demonstrate compliance within ninety days of a finding of noncompliance. Pursuant to a 2019 amendment to the graduated wagering tax portion of the Riverboat Act, licensees that receive Adjusted Gross Receipts AGR under 75 million in the preceding state fiscal year are subject to the following graduated wagering taxes (for state fiscal years beginning after June 30, 2021): 2.5 on the first 25 million of AGR for state fiscal years beginning after June 30, 2021. 10 on the AGR in excess of 25 million, but not exceeding 50 million, for state fiscal years beginning after June 30, 2021. 20 on the AGR in excess of 50 million, but not exceeding 75 million, for state fiscal years beginning after June 30, 2021. 30 of the AGR in excess of 75 million, but not exceeding 150 million. 35 of all AGR in excess of 150 million, but not exceeding 600 million. 40 of all AGR exceeding 600 million. 
 AGR is the total of all cash and property received from gaming, less cash paid out as winnings and uncollectible gaming receivables (not to exceed 2 ). Legislation passed in 2013 permitted all Indiana casinos to begin deducting from AGR certain amounts attributable to qualified wagering incentives. Such qualified wagering incentives (commonly referred to as free play are defined as wagers made by patrons using non-cashable vouchers, coupons, electronic credits or electronic promotions offered by a licensee. For state fiscal years ending after June 30, 2013 and before July 1, 2015, the maximum amount of permitted qualified wagering deductions was 5 million per casino. In 2015, that maximum deduction was increased to 7 million for fiscal years following June 30, 2015. In 2019, the maximum deduction was increased to 9 million for fiscal years following June 30, 2021. In addition to wagering taxes, an admissions tax of 3 per admission was previously assessed for all casinos other than the casino operating in French Lick, Indiana, the two racinos, and the land-based casino operating in Evansville, Indiana. Pursuant to legislation passed in 2017, as soon as the operator of the Evansville casino relocated its riverboat casino to a land-based facility, it began paying a supplemental wagering tax equal to three percent (3 of AGR in lieu of continuing to pay admissions tax. Pursuant to the same 2017 legislation, all other casinos for whom the admissions tax had been applicable began paying a supplemental wagering tax on July 1, 2018. The supplemental wagering tax replaced the admissions tax for these casinos. The Supplemental wagering tax rate varies by location based on a statutory formula but was capped at four percent (4 of AGR until June 30, 2019, and three and five tenths percent (3.5 of AGR thereafter. The Riverboat Act provides for the suspension or revocation of a license if the wagering taxes, admissions taxes, and/or supplemental wagering taxes are not timely remitted. Pursuant to a development agreement between the Company and the City of Rising Sun, Indiana, we are required to pay annually to the Rising Sun Regional Foundation a sum equal to either: (i) 1.55 of AGR, if AGR is 150 million or less; or (ii) 1.6 of AGR, if AGR is greater than 150 million. 

 Real property taxes are imposed on riverboats at rates determined by local taxing authorities. Income to us from Rising Star Casino Resort is also subject to the Indiana adjusted gross income tax, which has traditionally been calculated in a manner that required adding back the value of any federal income tax deductions that were allowable for wagering taxes paid to the state. Legislation passed in 2017 permits for the gradual phase-out of the add back calculation, such that beginning in the first taxable year following December 31, 2025, no such add back shall be required. Sales on a riverboat and at its related amenities, other than gaming revenues, are subject to applicable use, excise, and retail taxes. The Riverboat Act requires a licensee to directly reimburse the IGC for costs associated with gaming enforcement agents, which are required to be present at the casino while gaming is conducted. An owner licensee may enter into debt transactions of 1 million or greater only with the prior approval of the IGC. Such approval is subject to compliance with requisite procedures and a showing that each person with whom the licensee enters into a debt transaction would be suitable for licensure under the Riverboat Act. Unless waived, approval of debt transactions requires consideration by the IGC at two business meetings. The IGC, by resolution, has authorized its executive director, subject to subsequent ratification by the IGC, to approve debt transactions. Such approval may occur following appropriate review of the transaction along with concurrence by: (i) the executive director, (ii) IGC s Chair, and (iii) the IGC member who is a certified public accountant. The Riverboat Act provides that the sale of alcoholic beverages at casinos is subject to licensing, control and regulation pursuant to Title 7.1 of the Indiana Code and the rules adopted by the Indiana Alcohol and Tobacco Commission. In 2019, the Indiana General Assembly passed legislation legalizing certain sports wagering and mobile sports wagering activities and operations in the State of Indiana (the Indiana Sports Wagering Act (See IC 4-38). In the same year, the IGC approved emergency rules to regulate licensed sports wagering operations. The Indiana Sports Wagering Act allowed sports wagering operations to commence in Indiana on September 1, 2019, subject to regulatory approval by the IGC for individual operators to begin accepting wagers. Permanent sports wagering rules were promulgated in 2021. Under the Indiana Sports Wagering Act, a licensed operator of an Indiana riverboat casino, a racino, or an off-track facility where horse wagering is allowed (a Satellite Facility is granted the opportunity to apply for and receive a Certificate of Authority to conduct sports wagering (thereby becoming a Certificate Holder ). A Certificate Holder is entitled to operate an on-site retail sportsbook at the casino, racino, or Satellite Facility affiliated with the Certificate of Authority, as well as to contract with three individually branded vendors (a Vendor for the conduct of mobile sports wagering through digital platforms. There are currently fifteen licensed Certificate Holders and fifteen licensed mobile Vendors in Indiana. Gaming Entertainment (Indiana) LLC holds a permanent Certificate of Authority which renews annually in the ordinary course and was last renewed on December 15, 2022, effective November 7, 2022 through November 6, 2023. Rising Star is presently using two of the three mobile Vendors that it is permitted to use under the Certificate of Authority. Sports wagers may not be placed either in-person at a retail location or via mobile platform by an individual less than 21 years of age. All mobile sports wagering patrons must undergo Know Your Customer age and identification verification processes prior to using a mobile device to place sports wagers. This process may be undertaken via mobile device remotely and does not require in-person registration at a casino. Additionally, all mobile sports wagering patrons must undergo geolocation measures prior to placing wagers using a mobile device to ensure their physical presence in the State of Indiana. Each Vendor is subject to corporate and individual licensing and findings of suitability by the IGC and is responsible for compliance with all relevant sports wagering laws and regulations relevant to their retail and/or mobile sports wagering operations. Each of Rising Star s sports wagering Vendors is required by Indiana regulations to perform an annual system integrity and security assessment of sports wagering systems and online sports wagering systems. The assessment must be conducted by an independent professional selected by the Vendor which is subject to approval of the IGC executive director. 

 Mississippi Regulatory Matters Our ownership and operation of the Silver Slipper Casino and Hotel is subject to the Mississippi Gaming Control Act Mississippi Act and to the licensing and regulatory control of the Mississippi Gaming Commission, the Mississippi Department of Revenue and various local, city and county regulatory agencies. The Mississippi Act provides for legalized gaming in each of the fourteen counties that border the Gulf Coast or the Mississippi River; however, gaming is legal only if the voters in the county have not voted to prohibit gaming in that county. Voters have approved gaming in nine of the fourteen counties and currently occurs in seven counties. The Mississippi Act originally required gaming vessels to be located on the Mississippi River or on navigable waters in eligible counties along the Mississippi River, or in the waters lying south of the counties along the Mississippi Gulf Coast. However, the Mississippi Act was amended to permit licensees in the three counties along the Gulf Coast to establish casino structures that are located in whole or part on shore and land-based casino operations, provided the land-based gaming areas do not extend more than 800 feet beyond the nineteen-year mean high water line, (except in Harrison County where the 800-foot limit can be extended as far as the greater of 800 feet beyond the 19-year mean high water line or the southern boundary of Highway 90). Due to another change in the interpretation of the Mississippi Act, the Mississippi Gaming Commission has also permitted licensees in approved Mississippi River counties to conduct gaming operations on permanent structures, provided that the majority of the gaming floor in any such structure is located on the river side of the bank full line of the Mississippi River. There are no limitations on the number of gaming licenses that may be granted. Further, the Mississippi Act provides for 24-hour gaming operations and does not limit the maximum bet or loss per patron or the percentage of space that may be utilized for gaming. In 2018, the Mississippi Gaming Commission adopted regulations permitting race books and sports pools to be operated by licensed Mississippi gaming operators. Although mobile wagering is permitted, such wagers may be made only while the patron is on the property of a licensed gaming establishment. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Silver Slipper Casino Venture LLC is licensed as the operator of the Silver Slipper Casino and Hotel. A Mississippi gaming licensee must maintain a gaming license from the Mississippi Gaming Commission, subject to certain conditions, including continued compliance with all applicable state laws and regulations. If we fail to satisfy the requirements of the Mississippi Act and regulations, we and Silver Slipper Casino Venture LLC cannot own or operate gaming facilities in Mississippi. Gaming licenses are issued for a three-year period, are not transferable, and must be renewed periodically thereafter. There is no assurance that a new license can be obtained at the end of each three-year period of a license. Silver Slipper Casino and Hotel was most recently granted a renewal of its license by the Mississippi Gaming Commission on June 17, 2021, effective July 20, 2021. The license expires on July 19, 2024. The Mississippi Act and the Mississippi Gaming Commission regulations require that certain of our officers and directors and certain key employees of Silver Slipper Hotel and Casino be found suitable or approved by the Mississippi Gaming Commission. A finding of suitability is comparable to licensing, and both require submission of detailed personal and financial information followed by a thorough investigation. We believe that we have obtained, applied for or are in the process of applying for all necessary findings of suitability, although the Mississippi Gaming Commission, in its discretion, may require any individual who has a material relationship to, or material involvement with, a licensee to file an application to determine whether the individual is suitable to be associated with a gaming licensee. As the sole member of Silver Slipper Casino Venture LLC, we applied for registration with the Mississippi Gaming Commission as a publicly traded corporation, which was granted on September 20, 2012. As a registered, publicly-traded corporation, we are required periodically to submit financial and operating reports, and any other information that the Mississippi Gaming Commission may require. Certain loans, leases, sales of securities and similar financing transactions must also be reported to or approved by the Mississippi Gaming Commission. 

 Any person who acquires more than 5 of any class of our voting securities must report the acquisition to the Mississippi Gaming Commission and may be required to file an application for a finding of suitability. If a security holder who must be found suitable is a corporation, partnership or trust, it must submit detailed business and financial information, including a list of its beneficial owners. The Mississippi Gaming Commission may require us to disclose the identities of the holders of our debt or other securities, and, in its discretion, require such holders to file applications, be investigated and be found suitable to own our debt or equity securities. Although the Mississippi Gaming Commission generally does not require the individual holders of such securities to be investigated and found suitable, it retains the right to do so for any reason deemed necessary by the Mississippi Gaming Commission. If the Mississippi Gaming Commission determines that a person is unsuitable to hold, directly or indirectly, voting securities of a registered publicly traded corporation, any beneficial ownership of such securities by the unsuitable person beyond such period of time as may be prescribed by the Mississippi Gaming Commission is a misdemeanor. We are subject to disciplinary action if, after we receive notice that a person is unsuitable to be a security holder or to have any other relationship with us, we: pay that person any dividend or interest upon our voting securities; recognize the exercise, directly or indirectly of any voting right conferred through securities held by that person; pay the unsuitable person any remuneration in any form for services rendered or otherwise, except in certain limited and specific circumstances; or fail to pursue all lawful efforts to require the unsuitable person to divest himself of the securities including, if necessary, the immediate purchase of the securities for cash at fair market value. 
 Under certain circumstances, an institutional investor, as such term is defined in the regulations of the Mississippi Gaming Commission, which acquires more than 10 , but not more than 25 of our voting securities, may apply to the Mississippi Gaming Commission for a waiver of such finding of suitability requirements, provided the institutional investor holds the voting securities for investment purposes only. No person may receive any percentage of gaming revenue from a Mississippi gaming licensee without first obtaining the necessary licensing and approvals from the Mississippi Gaming Commission. The Mississippi Gaming Commission may also require anyone having a material relationship or involvement with us to be found suitable or licensed, in which case those persons are required to pay the costs and fees of the Mississippi Gaming Commission in connection with the investigation. Any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license within 30 days after being ordered to do so by the Mississippi Gaming Commission may be found unsuitable based solely on such failure or refusal. We are required to maintain a current stock ledger in Mississippi, which may be examined by the Mississippi Gaming Commission at any time, and to file with the Mississippi Gaming Commission, at least annually, a list of our stockholders. The Mississippi Gaming Commission has the power to require our stock certificates to bear a legend indicating that the securities are subject to the Mississippi Gaming Control Act and the regulations of the Mississippi Gaming Commission. We obtained a waiver of this requirement on September 20, 2012. Substantially all material loans, leases, sales of securities and similar financing transactions by a registered corporation or a Mississippi gaming licensee must be reported to and approved by the Mississippi Gaming Commission. Changes in control through merger, consolidation, acquisition of assets, management or consulting agreements or any form of takeover cannot occur without prior investigation and approval by the Mississippi Gaming Commission. We may not make certain public offerings of our securities without the prior approval of the Mississippi Gaming Commission. Such approval, if given, does not constitute a recommendation or approval of the investment merits of the securities subject to the offering. We have received a waiver of the prior approval requirement with respect to public offerings of securities subject to certain conditions. 

 The Mississippi legislature has declared that some repurchases of voting securities, corporate acquisitions opposed by management, and corporate defense tactics affecting Mississippi gaming licensees, and registered companies that are affiliated with those operations, may be harmful to stable and productive corporate gaming. Because we are a registered company, approvals may be required from the Mississippi Gaming Commission before we can make exceptional repurchases of voting securities above their current market price and before a corporate acquisition opposed by management can be consummated. The Mississippi Gaming Control Act also requires prior approval of a plan of recapitalization proposed by a registered company s Board in response to a tender offer made directly to its stockholders for the purpose of acquiring control. A Mississippi licensee may not guarantee a security issued by an affiliated company pursuant to a public offering, or pledge its assets to secure payment or performance of the obligations evidenced by a security issued by an affiliated company, without the prior approval of the Mississippi Gaming Commission. We have obtained waivers from the Mississippi Gaming Commission, effective September 20, 2021 through September 19, 2024, for such guarantees, pledges and restrictions in connection with public offerings of our securities, subject to certain restrictions. A pledge of the stock of a Mississippi licensee and the foreclosure of such a pledge are ineffective without the prior approval of the Mississippi Gaming Commission. All legal gaming conducted in the state is subject to taxation. Gaming fees and tax calculations are generally based upon a percentage of the gross revenue and the number of gaming devices and table games operated by the casino. The license fee payable to the State of Mississippi is based upon gross revenue (generally defined as gaming receipts less payout to customers as winnings) and equals 4 of gross revenue of 50,000 or less per calendar month, 6 of gross revenue in excess of 50,000 but less than 134,000 per calendar month, and 8 of gross revenue in excess of 134,000 per calendar month. Each licensee must pay an annual license fee of 5,000. Each licensee must pay an annual fee based on the number of games, both electronic gaming devices and table games, it operates at its establishment. Licensees operating thirty-five (35) games pay a fee of 81,200 for the first 35 games, plus 100 for each game over 35. Licensees located within certain municipalities or counties may be required to pay fees to those municipalities or counties based on the licensees gross revenues. These fees are paid in the same manner as the state gross revenue fees. The fees payable to the county in which Silver Slipper Hotel and Casino operates is an amount not to exceed four percent (4 of all gross revenue and an annual license fee of 100 per gaming device. The Gaming Commission imposes a flat annual fee on each casino operator licensee, payable quarterly, covering all investigative fees for that year associated with an operator licensee, any entity registered as a holding company or publicly traded corporation of that licensee, and any person required to be found suitable in connection with that licensee or any holding company or publicly traded corporation of that licensee. The annual fee is based on the average number of gaming devices operated by the licensee during a twelve-month period, as reported to the Mississippi Gaming Commission. The investigative fee is 325,000 for licensees with 1,500 or more gaming devices, 250,000 for licensees with 1,000 to 1,499 gaming devices, and 150,000 for licensees with less than 1,000 gaming devices. The fee is payable in four equal quarterly installments. Neither we nor Silver Slipper Casino Venture LLC may engage in gaming activities outside of Mississippi without approval of, or a waiver of such approval by, the Mississippi Gaming Commission. We have approval from the Mississippi Gaming Commission for foreign gaming operations in that such approval for foreign gaming operations is automatically granted under the Mississippi regulations in connection with foreign operations conducted within the 50 states or any territory of the United States, or on board any cruise ship embarking from a port located therein. However, the Mississippi Gaming Commission requires a formal foreign gaming waiver for involvement in Internet gaming. A violation of the Mississippi gaming laws could result in a fine; revocation or suspension of, or a limitation or condition on, the gaming license, and criminal action. Disciplinary action in any jurisdiction may lead to disciplinary action in Mississippi, including, but not limited to, the revocation or suspension of the Silver Slipper Casino Venture, LLC gaming license. 

 Colorado Regulatory Matters The Colorado Limited Gaming Control Commission (the Colorado Commission initially approved all our necessary licenses on February 18, 2016, to acquire the operating assets and assume certain liabilities of Bronco Billy s Casino and Hotel in Cripple Creek, Colorado, which closed on May 13, 2016. The license approvals initially issued and subsequently renewed include (i) an Operator s license for Full House Resorts, Inc.; (ii) three (3) Retail Licenses for our wholly owned subsidiary, FHR-Colorado, LLC; (iii) three (3) Master Sports Betting licenses, each associated with the three (3) Retail Licenses held by FHR-Colorado LLC; (iv) a Manufacturer/Distributor s License for FHR-Colorado, LLC; (v) findings of suitability for key personnel and our Board of Directors. We continue to renew these licenses every two years, with our licenses most recently renewed through February 18, 2024. Under the Colorado Limited Gaming Act of 1991 (the Colorado Act ), the ownership and operation of limited-stakes gaming facilities in Colorado are subject to the Colorado Gaming Regulations (the Colorado Regulations and final authority of the Colorado Commission. The Colorado Act also created the Colorado Division of Gaming (the Division of Gaming within the Colorado Department of Revenue to license, supervise and enforce the conduct of limited stakes gaming. No person may offer limited gaming to the public unless such person holds a valid retail gaming license, which must be renewed every two years. Our licenses were most recently renewed on February 17, 2022, expiring on February 18, 2024. The Colorado Act requires that licensees file applications for renewal with the Colorado Commission not less than 120 days prior to their expiration. Limited-stakes gaming became lawful in the cities of Central City, Black Hawk and Cripple Creek when the state constitution was amended, effective October 1, 1991 Colorado Amendment ). Currently, limited-stakes gaming means a maximum single bet of 100 on slot machines, blackjack, poker, craps and roulette, and it is permitted 24 hours a day. Limited-stakes gaming is confined to the commercial districts of these cities as defined by Central City ordinance on October 7, 1981, by Black Hawk ordinance on May 4, 1978, and by Cripple Creek ordinance on December 3, 1973. Additionally, the Colorado Amendment restricts limited-stakes gaming to structures which conform to the architectural styles and designs which were common to the areas prior to World War I and that conform to the requirements of applicable city ordinances regardless of the age of the structures. Under the Colorado Amendment, no more than 35 of the square footage of any building and no more than 50 of any one floor of any building may be used for limited-stakes gaming. Persons under the age of 21 cannot participate in limited-stakes gaming. Under Colorado state law, smoking is not permitted in any indoor area, including limited gaming facilities and any other facilities in which any gaming or gambling activity is conducted. The Colorado Commission has delegated authority to the Division of Gaming to conduct background investigations and review of financial documents, issue certain types of licenses, and approve certain limited changes in ownership. With limited exceptions applicable to licensees which are publicly traded entities, no person may sell, lease, purchase, convey or acquire any interest in a retail gaming, manufacturer or distributor, associated equipment supplier, or operator license or business without the prior approval of the Colorado Commission or the Division of Gaming. As a general rule, the Colorado Act prohibits any person from having an ownership interest in more than three retail gaming licenses in Colorado. The Colorado Commission has ruled that a person does not have an ownership interest in a retail gaming licensee for purposes of the multiple license prohibition if any of the following apply: A person has less than a 5 ownership interest in an institutional investor that has an ownership interest in a publicly traded licensee or publicly traded company affiliated with a licensee; A person has a 5 or more ownership interest in an institutional investor, but the institutional investor has less than a 5 ownership interest in a publicly traded licensee or publicly traded company affiliated with a licensee; An institutional investor has less than a 5 ownership interest in a publicly traded licensee or publicly traded company affiliated with a licensee; An institutional investor possesses voting securities in a fiduciary capacity for another person and does not exercise voting control over 5 or more of the outstanding voting securities of a publicly traded licensee or of a publicly traded company affiliated with a licensee; 

 A registered broker or dealer retains possession of voting securities of a publicly traded licensee or of a publicly traded company affiliated with a licensee for its customers and not for its own account, and exercises voting rights for less than 5 of the outstanding voting securities of a publicly traded licensee or publicly traded company affiliated with a licensee; A registered broker or dealer acts as a market maker for the stock of a publicly traded licensee or of a publicly traded company affiliated with a licensee and exercises voting rights in less than 5 of the outstanding voting securities of the publicly traded licensee or publicly traded company affiliated with a licensee; An underwriter is holding securities of a publicly traded licensee or publicly traded company affiliated with a licensee as part of an underwriting for no more than 90 days after the beginning of such underwriting if it exercises voting rights of less than 5 of the outstanding voting securities of a publicly traded licensee or publicly traded company affiliated with a licensee; A book entry transfer facility holds voting securities for third parties, if it exercises voting rights with respect to less than 5 of the outstanding voting securities of a publicly traded licensee or publicly traded company affiliated with a licensee; or A person s sole ownership interest is less than 5 of the outstanding voting securities of the publicly traded licensee or publicly traded company affiliated with a licensee. 
 The Colorado Commission has enacted Rule 4.5, which imposes requirements on publicly traded corporations holding gaming licenses in Colorado and on gaming licenses owned directly or indirectly by a publicly traded corporation, whether through a subsidiary or intermediary company. Such requirements automatically apply to any ownership interest held by a publicly traded corporation, holding company or intermediary company thereof, where the ownership interest directly or indirectly is, or will be upon approval of the Colorado Commission, 5 or more of the entire licensee. However, the Colorado Commission also has the discretion to require that any publicly traded corporation, subsidiary, intermediary, or holding company that it determines has the actual ability to exercise influence over a licensee, regardless of ownership percentage, comply with the disclosure regulations and requirements contained in Rule 4.5. Additionally, the Colorado Regulations require that every officer, director and stockholder of private corporations or equivalent office or ownership holders for non-corporate applicants, and every officer, director or stockholder holding either a 5 or greater interest or controlling interest of a publicly traded corporation or owners of an applicant or licensee, shall be a person of good moral character and submit to, and pay for, a full background investigation conducted by the Division of Gaming and the Colorado Commission. The Colorado Commission may require any person having an interest in a license to undergo a full background investigation and pay the cost of investigation in the same manner as an applicant. Licensees are required to provide information and file periodic reports with the Division of Gaming, including identifying (i) those who have a 5 or greater ownership, financial or equity interest in the licensee, (ii) those who have the ability to control or exercise significant influence over the licensee, (iii) those who loan money or other things of value to a licensee, and (iv) those who have the right to share in revenue derived from limited gaming, or to whom any interest or share in profits of limited gaming has been pledged as security for a debt or performance of an act. Additional reporting requirements include (i) notifying the Division of Gaming if any licensee, including its parent company or subsidiary, applies for, or holds a license to conduct foreign gaming operations, and (ii) reporting any criminal convictions or charges against all persons licensed by the Colorado Commission and any associated person of a licensee. The Colorado Commission and Division of Gaming also may require information regarding every person who is a party to a gaming contract, defined as an agreement where a person does business with, or that is conducted on the premises of, a licensed entity, or a lease with a licensee (or applicant). In that event, such person must promptly provide the Colorado Commission or the Division of Gaming requested information, which may include a financial history, description of financial holdings, real and personal property ownership, interests in other companies, criminal history, personal history and associations, character, reputation in the community and all other information which might be relevant to a determination of whether a person would be suitable to be licensed by the Colorado Commission. Failure to provide all information requested constitutes sufficient grounds for the Colorado Commission or the Division of Gaming to require a licensee or applicant to terminate its gaming contract or lease with any person who failed to provide the information requested. The Colorado Commission or the Division of Gaming may also require that the gaming contract be amended prior to approval of an application or commencement of the contract. 

 The Colorado Commission and the Division of Gaming have interpreted the Colorado Regulations to permit the Colorado Commission to investigate and find suitable persons or entities providing financing to or acquiring securities from us. As previously noted, any person or entity that is required to provide information, submit an application, or be found suitable, must pay all application and investigation fees and costs. Although the Colorado Regulations do not require prior approval for the execution of credit facilities or issuance of debt securities, the Colorado Commission reserves the right to approve, require changes to or require the termination of any financing, including, but not limited to, situations where a person or entity is required to be found suitable and is not found suitable. In any event, note holders, lenders and others providing financing will not be able to exercise certain rights and remedies without the prior approval of the Colorado Commission. Information regarding any changes in holders of securities may be required to be periodically reported to the Colorado Commission or the Division of Gaming. Any changes in lending relationships or terms or conditions must be immediately reported to the Division of Gaming. The Colorado Constitution provides for a tax on the total amount wagered, less all payouts to players, which is known as the adjusted gross proceeds AGP ). For poker, the tax is calculated based on the sums wagered which are retained by the licensee as compensation, consistent with the minimum and maximum amounts established by the Colorado Commission. The Constitution sets a maximum tax rate of 40 , and voter approval of a constitutional amendment would be required to increase this maximum rate. The Colorado Commission votes annually on the structure of the gaming taxes. Currently, the tax structure is tiered with a graduated rate of between .25 and 20 of AGP. Specifically, the rate tiers are: 0.25 up to and including 2 million of AGP; 2.0 on amounts from 2 million to 5 million of AGP; 9.0 on amounts from 5 million to 8 million of AGP; 11.0 on amounts from 8 million to 10 million of AGP; 16.0 on amounts from 10 million to 13 million of AGP; and 20.0 on amounts over 13 million of AGP. 
 These rates became effective July 1, 2012. Pursuant to the Colorado state constitution, any Commission decision to increase the tax levels on the adjusted gross proceeds of limited gaming requires statewide voter approval. Effective July 1, 2021, the Colorado Commission also implemented a three-year pilot program to allow casinos to receive a quarterly tax rebate equal to the amount of tax paid on free play coupons for the preceding quarter. Casinos are eligible for this rebate if the gaming tax revenue paid to the State grew by at least 3.5 , compounded annually, over the preceding year. If eligible, the casino will receive a credit against the following month s tax payment. If total free play and total gaming revenue have grown by at least 10.87 after the first three years, the rebate program would become permanent, effective July 1, 2025. To date, there have been no tax credits granted to casinos under this program. 

 On November 5, 2019, Colorado voters approved sports betting offered at casinos in Cripple Creek, Black Hawk, and Central City or through Internet sports betting operators that are associated with brick-and-mortar casinos in those towns. The state imposes a tax of 10 on net sports betting proceeds which is distinct and taxed separately from limited gaming adjusted gross proceeds. The state also imposes multiple fees to pay for: (1) the privilege of being licensed to operate as a sports betting licensee; (2) the costs of applicant investigation; and (3) the Division of Gaming s ongoing regulation of sports betting. The City of Cripple Creek may also impose device fees on sports betting gaming equipment used at casinos licensed if they are used to conduct a sports betting operation. Those device fees may be more, less, or the same as the current fee imposed by the City on limited gaming devices. Sports betting became legal in Colorado on May 1, 2020. In January 2020, FHR-Colorado LLC applied for three (3) master sports betting licenses to be associated with each of its three (3) retail licenses. Subject to regulatory licensing and other requisite approvals, FHR-Colorado LLC offers mobile sports wagering through its third-party sports wagering vendors. We received our three (3) Master Licenses on March 19, 2020, and their renewal and expiration dates coincide with our three (3) Retail Licenses (February 18, 2024). FHR-Colorado LLC began offering mobile sports wagering through its three third-party vendors with one of its third-party vendors on June 4, 2020. Thereafter, FHR-Colorado offered its retail sports book on September 24, 2020, and mobile sports wagering on April 21, 2021, both through its second third-party vendor. Lastly, FHR-Colorado began offering mobile sports wagering through its third third-party vendor on December 22, 2020; however, as of May 15, 2022, FHR-Colorado no longer utilizes the third third-party vendor, but intends to utilize its third Master License to offer mobile sports through a new third-party vendor, subject to licensure of the vendor and approval by the Colorado Commission. No person under 21 years of age may place any sports wager in Colorado. All mobile sports wagering patrons must undergo Know Your Customer age and identification verification processes prior to using a mobile device to place sports wagers. This process may be undertaken via mobile device remotely and does not require in-person registration at a casino. Additionally, all mobile sports wagering patrons must undergo geolocation measures prior to placing wagers using a mobile device to ensure their physical presence in the State of Colorado. Each third-party sports wagering vendor must be licensed by the Colorado Commission, and any vendor director, officer, key employee, and affiliated business may be required to either be licensed or found suitable by the Commission. Depending on whether they share in sports betting revenues or what types of goods or services they provided, businesses involved with sports wagering operations may also be required to be licensed. All licensed entities and licensed persons are responsible for compliance with all relevant sports wagering laws and regulations relevant to their retail and/or mobile sports wagering operations. On November 3, 2020, Colorado voters approved Amendment 77, which allowed the Cities of Central City, Black Hawk, and Cripple Creek to (1) approve a maximum single bet limit of any amount and (2) expand allowable game types in addition to slot machines, blackjack, poker, roulette, and craps. In the City of Cripple Creek, pursuant to Article 5 of the municipal code, the City Clerk is authorized to calculate, collect, and enforce a gaming device fee, which may be amended from time to time by the City Council. For purposes of Article 5, a gaming device means any slot machine, poker table and/or blackjack table. The term gaming device shall include each table manned by a single dealer for the games of blackjack and/or poker and shall include each slot machine. Currently, this gaming device fee is paid quarterly, in advance, on the first day of the month for each quarter. The fee amount depends on a number of factors, including when the device is placed into service, and the total number of gaming devices the licensee has in operation. For example, each gaming licensee shall pay 300 per gaming device for its first three (3) months of operation, and each new gaming device added shall have a gaming device fee of 300, regardless of the day the device is placed into service. Subsequently, the gaming device fee is charged per device, at the following rates: First fifty (50) gaming devices - 50 for the first quarter, 100 for the second quarter, 225 for the third quarter, and 225 for the fourth quarter. Each device in excess of fifty (50) - 300 per quarter. 
 The sale of alcoholic beverages in gaming establishments is subject to strict licensing, control and regulation by State and local authorities. There are various classes of retail liquor licenses which may be issued under the Colorado Liquor Code, and no person may be financially interested in more than one such class of liquor license. A retail gaming tavern licensee may sell malt, vinous or spirituous liquors only by the individual drink for consumption on the premises. An application for an alcoholic beverage license in Colorado requires notice, posting and a public hearing before the local liquor licensing authority prior to approval. The Colorado Department of Revenue s Liquor Enforcement Division must also approve the application on behalf of the state. Each Bronco Billy s location has been approved for and holds a retail gaming tavern liquor license for its casino, hotel and restaurant operations. 

 All persons who directly or indirectly hold a 10 or greater interest in, or 10 or more of the issued and outstanding capital stock of, a licensee must file applications and may possibly be investigated by state and local liquor authorities. The Colorado liquor authorities also may investigate persons who, directly or indirectly, loan money to or have any financial interest in liquor licensees. In addition, there are restrictions on stockholders, directors and officers of liquor licensees preventing such persons from being a stockholder, director, officer or otherwise interested in certain persons who lend money to liquor licensees and from making loans to other liquor licensees. Persons directly or indirectly interested in any of our Colorado gaming properties may be limited with regard to certain other types of liquor licenses in which they may have an interest, and specifically cannot have an interest in a retail liquor store license. No person can hold more than three retail gaming tavern liquor licenses. In addition, the remedies of certain lenders may be limited by applicable liquor laws and regulations. Alcoholic beverage licenses are revocable and nontransferable. State and local licensing authorities have full power to limit, condition, suspend for as long as six months or revoke any such licenses for violations of the liquor and regulatory requirements, which could have a material adverse effect upon our operations. Our Colorado operations are subject to Governor Polis Disaster Declaration, as it may be amended from time to time, addressing COVID-19 protocols for our business operations; In Colorado, our operations are also subject to the Colorado Department of Public Health Environment and Teller County COVID-19 restrictions.

 Illinois Regulatory Matters Following a competitive bidding process, on December 8, 2021, the Illinois Gaming Board (the IGB unanimously granted preliminary suitability to us for the development of a new casino to be located in Waukegan, Illinois. At its meeting on January 27, 2022, the IGB unanimously granted us approval to (i) amend our application pending before the IGB to change the applicant thereunder from Full House Resorts, Inc. to our wholly-owned subsidiary, FHR-Illinois, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company FHR-IL ), on the express condition that FHR-IL assumes all agreements, obligations and commitments made by us to the IGB, State of Illinois and City of Waukegan in our application; and (ii) allow all prior actions, approvals and findings (including the finding of preliminary suitability) made by the IGB with respect to us to be applicable, binding and transferable to FHR-IL. In accordance with this approval, by the terms of that certain Assignment and Assumption Agreement effective as of January 27, 2022 by and between us, as assignor, and FHR-IL, as assignee, we assigned to FHR-IL all agreements, obligations and commitments made by us to the IGB, State of Illinois and City of Waukegan in our application. On January 18, 2023, FHR-IL and the City of Waukegan entered into a Development and Host Community Agreement (the Development Agreement related to FHR-IL s development, construction and operation of a temporary casino facility The Temporary and a permanent casino facility American Place in Waukegan, Illinois. The Development Agreement establishes terms and conditions related to the project, including project milestones requiring (i) the completion of The Temporary s construction by January 31, 2023, with operations commencing within three months of such completion and (ii) the completion of American Place s construction within thirty-six (36) months of The Temporary s opening, with operations also commencing within three months of such completion. The Development Agreement provides a mechanism for the extension of the above deadlines in certain circumstances, including if FHR-IL is diligently pursuing construction of the facilities. The Development Agreement also establishes the procedures for obtaining approvals for current and future phases of the project, penalties for failure to complete the phases of the project on time, and standards and terms for the use, operations and maintenance of the property. The Development Agreement also requires FHR-IL to pay 150,000 for anticipated public works and public safety costs related to the opening of The Temporary and to make annual contributions to the City of Waukegan of at least 500,000 to support charitable programs and causes following the commencement of operations at American Place. FHR-IL has the right to terminate the Development Agreement and the Ground Lease (defined below) if it has complied with its obligations related to the application and pursuit of applicable regulatory approvals and either (i) such approvals are denied, materially delayed, or otherwise not approved; or (ii) FHR-IL determines, in its reasonable judgment, that any necessary regulatory approvals cannot be obtained using its best efforts. On January 18, 2023, FHR-IL and the City of Waukegan entered into a 99-year Ground Lease (the Ground Lease for approximately 31.7 acres of land (the City-Owned Parcel ). The City-Owned Parcel and an adjacent 10-acre parcel owned by FHR-IL comprise the location of American Place, including The Temporary. The Ground Lease is a triple-net lease whereby FHR-IL is required to pay all taxes, utilities, and expenses associated with the leased property. FHR-IL will pay annual rent under the Ground Lease in an amount equal to the greater of (i) 3,000,000 (the Annual Guaranteed Minimum Rent ), or (ii) 2.5 of Adjusted Gross Receipts (as defined in Section 4 of the Illinois Gambling Act, 230 ILCS 10/1 et seq. (the Illinois Act )) generated by either The Temporary or American Place. The Ground Lease is only terminable to the extent that the Development Agreement is terminated. FHR-IL has the right to purchase the City-Owned Parcel at any time during the term of the Ground Lease for 30 million, but if it does so prior to the opening of American Place, it must continue to pay rent due to the City of Waukegan under the Ground Lease until the permanent casino is open. The Ground Lease contains customary terms with respect to taxes, leasehold mortgage, insurance, condemnation, and other terms and conditions typically found in long-term ground leases of similar nature. 

 On February 16, 2023, the IGB s Administrator granted FHR-IL a temporary operating permit authorizing it to conduct gaming operations at The Temporary beginning February 17, 2023, subject to subject the terms and conditions provided in such temporary operating permit. Operations commenced on February 17, 2023 at The Temporary s grand opening. The IGB s finding of preliminary suitability and issuance of the temporary operating permit do not constitute the issuance of an owners license under the Illinois Act. Rather, under the Illinois Act (and IGB s rules thereunder), a finding of preliminary suitability and issuance of a temporary operating permit are steps toward the issuance of an owners license to FHR-IL. A temporary operating permit may be withdrawn by the IGB s Administrator if he determines that gambling operations are not suitable for continued operation. We anticipate that FHR-IL will receive its owners license shortly, but the issuance of such license is subject to the discretion of the IGB. As an applicant for an owners license FHR-IL is, and as an owners licensee FHR-IL will be, subject to extensive regulation under the Illinois Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the IGB. In February 1990, the State of Illinois legalized riverboat gambling. Initially, the Illinois Act authorized the IGB to issue up to ten owners licenses authorizing the holders thereof to conduct gambling operations on riverboats located on any water within the State of Illinois or any water other than Lake Michigan which constitutes a boundary of the State of Illinois. The original ten owners licenses are in operation in Alton, Aurora, East Peoria, East St. Louis, Elgin, Joliet (two licenses), Metropolis, Rock Island, and Des Plaines, Illinois. On June 28, 2019, Governor Pritzker signed into law Public Act 101-0091 PA 101-0091 which implemented historic gaming expansion throughout Illinois. Among other things, PA 101-0091 amended the Illinois Act to: (a) authorize an additional six new casinos in the following locations: City of Chicago, City of Danville, City of Waukegan, City of Rockford, Williamson County and any one of the following townships in Cook County Bloom, Bremen, Calumet, Rich, Thornton or Worth; (b) permit casinos to be land-based (including allowing Illinois existing riverboat casinos to relocate on land); and (c) permit each racetrack facility licensed pursuant to the Illinois Horse Racing Act of 1975 Organization Licensees to apply for an Organization Gaming license, which authorizes table games and slot machines at the Organization Licensee s racetrack facilities. The Illinois Act strictly regulates the facilities, persons, associations and practices related to gaming operations. It grants the IGB specific powers and duties, and all other powers necessary and proper to fully and effectively execute the Illinois Act for the purpose of administering, regulating and enforcing the system of casino gaming. The IGB has authority over every person, association, corporation, partnership and trust involved in casino gaming operations in the State of Illinois. The Illinois Act requires the owner of a casino gaming operation to hold an owners license issued by the IGB and restricts the number of gaming positions for each owners license. Each of Illinois original ten owners licensees were limited to operating 1,200 gaming positions. PA 101-0091 authorized each of these existing ten owners licensees to expand gaming operations from 1,200 to 2,000 gaming positions, subject to the payment of a per gaming position fee of 17,500 (or 30,000 if located within Cook County) (the Position Fee ). The owners license in the City of Chicago is authorized to have up to 4,000 gaming positions, the owners license in Williamson County is limited to 1,200 gaming positions and the other four new owners licenses, including the owners license expected to be issued to FHR-IL, are permitted a maximum of 2,000 gaming positions, subject to payment of the applicable Position Fee. The number of gaming positions are determined in accordance with the IGB s rules. Ultimately, FHR-IL will be required to pay 17,500 for each of its 2,000 positions. Each owners licensee of the six new casinos authorized by PA101-0091 (including FHR-IL) must make a reconciliation payment (the Reconciliation Payment to the State of Illinois. The Reconciliation Payment is calculated 3 years after the date the owners licensee begins operating in an amount equal to 75 of the adjusted gross receipts for the most lucrative 12-month period of operations, minus an amount equal to the aggregate Position Fee paid by such owners licensee. The Reconciliation Fee is paid as follows: (1) 15,000,000 is paid upon issuance of the owners license; and (2) the remainder of the Reconciliation Fee, if any, is paid in installments over a period of six years (without interest) beginning in year four of the owners licensee s operations. If the calculation of the Reconciliation Fee results in a negative amount, the owners licensee is not entitled to reimbursement of any fees previously paid. Each owners license is valid for four years. The fee for the issuance or renewal of a new owners license is 250,000. An owners licensee is eligible for renewal upon payment of the applicable fee and a determination by the IGB that the licensee continues to meet all of the requirements of the Illinois Act and IGB s rules. An ownership interest in an owners license may not be transferred or pledged as collateral without the prior approval of the IGB. 

 Pursuant to the Illinois Act, in determining whether to approve direct or indirect ownership or control of an owners license, the IGB must consider the impact of any economic concentration caused by such ownership or control. No direct or indirect ownership or control may be approved which will result in undue economic concentration of the ownership of a casino gambling operation in Illinois. The Illinois Act specifies a number of criteria for the IGB to consider in determining whether the approval of the issuance, transfer or holding of a license will create undue economic concentration. The IGB s application of such criteria could reduce the number of potential purchasers for American Place. The Illinois Act does not limit the maximum bet or per patron loss. Minimum and maximum wagers on games are set by the holder of the owners license. Wagering may only be conducted with money or other negotiable currency. No person under the age of 21 is permitted to wager and wagers may only be received from a person present at the casino. With respect to electronic gaming devices, the payout percentage may not be less than 80 or more than 100 unless approved by the IGB s Administrator. On January 1, 2008 Illinois statewide public smoking ban became effective making it illegal to smoke in Illinois casinos, bars, restaurants and other public establishments. Illinois imposes an admission tax and a wagering tax on all Illinois casinos. From time to time, the Illinois legislature has taken actions to change these taxes. Historically, these legislative changes have resulted in tax increases. Currently, the admission tax is 3.00 per person admitted into the casino (with the exception of the casino in Rock Island, which is subject to an admissions tax of 2.00 per person admitted). The wagering tax is imposed on the adjusted gross receipts, as defined in the Illinois Act, of a gambling operation. The owners licensee is required, on a daily basis, to wire the wagering tax payment to the IGB. For all casinos (other than the proposed Chicago casino), the wagering tax for all gambling games other than table games, including, but not limited to, slot machines, video game of chance gambling, and electronic gambling games is assessed at the following rates: 15.0 of annual adjusted gross receipts up to and including 25.0 million; 22.5 of annual adjusted gross receipts in excess of 25.0 million but not exceeding 50.0 million; 27.5 of annual adjusted gross receipts in excess of 50.0 million but not exceeding 75.0 million; 32.5 of annual adjusted gross receipts in excess of 75.0 million but not exceeding 100.0 million; 37.5 of annual adjusted gross receipts in excess of 100.0 million but not exceeding 150.0 million; 45.0 of annual adjusted gross receipts in excess of 150.0 million but not exceeding 200.0 million; and 50.0 of annual adjusted gross receipts in excess of 200.0 million. For all casinos (other than the proposed Chicago casino), the wagering tax for table games is assessed at the following rates: 15.0 of annual adjusted gross receipts up to and including 25.0 million; 20.0 of annual adjusted gross receipts in excess of 25.0 million 
 A holder of any gaming license in Illinois is subject to imposition of fines, suspension or revocation of such license, or other action for any act or failure to act by the licensee or the licensee s agents or employees, that is injurious to the public health, safety, morals, good order and general welfare of the people of the State of Illinois, or that would discredit or tend to discredit the Illinois gaming industry or the State of Illinois. The IGB may revoke or suspend licenses, as the IGB may determine and, in compliance with applicable Illinois law regarding administrative procedures, may suspend an owners license, without notice or hearing, upon a determination that the safety or health of patrons or employees is jeopardized by continuing such gambling operations. The suspension may remain in effect until the IGB determines that the cause for suspension has been abated and it may revoke the owners license upon a determination that the owner has not made satisfactory progress toward abating the hazard. If the IGB has suspended, revoked or refused to renew an owners license or if a casino gambling operation is closing and the owner is voluntarily surrendering its owners license, the IGB may petition the local circuit court in which the casino is situated for appointment of a receiver. The circuit court has sole jurisdiction over any and all issues pertaining to the appointment of a receiver. The IGB specifies the powers, duties and limitations of the receiver. The IGB requires that each Key Person of an owners licensee submit a Personal Disclosure or Business Entity Disclosure Form and be investigated and approved by the IGB. The IGB determines which positions, individuals or business entities are required to be approved by the Board as Key Persons. Once approved, such Key Person status must be maintained. Key Persons include: 

 any business entity and any individual with an ownership interest or voting rights of more than 5 in the licensee or applicant and the trustee of any trust holding such ownership interest or voting rights; the directors of the licensee or applicant and its chief executive officer, president and chief operating officer or their functional equivalents; a Gaming Operations Manager (as defined in the IGB s rules) or any other business entity or individual who has influence and/or control over the conduct of gaming or the Casino Gaming Operation (as defined in the IGB s rules); and all other individuals or Business Entities that, upon review of the applicant s or licensee s organizational structure, the Board determines hold a position or a level of ownership, control or influence that is material to the regulatory concerns and obligations of the IGB for the specified licensee or applicant. 
 Each owners licensee must provide a means for the economic disassociation of a Key Person in the event such economic disassociation is required by an order of the IGB. Based upon findings from an investigation into the character, reputation, experience, associations, business probity and financial integrity of a Key Person, the IGB may enter an order upon the licensee or require the economic disassociation of the Key Person. Applicants for and holders of an owners license are required to obtain the IGB s approval for changes in the following: (i) Key Persons; (ii) type of entity; (iii) equity and debt capitalization of the entity; (iv) investors and/or debt holders; (v) sources of funds; (vi) economic development plans or proposals; (vii) casino capacity or significant design changes; (viii) gaming positions; (ix) anticipated economic impact; or (x) agreements, oral or written, relating to the acquisition or disposition of property (real or personal) of a value greater than 1 million. Illinois regulations provide that a holder of an owners license may make distributions to its stockholders only to the extent that such distributions do not impair the financial viability of the owner. Additionally, the IGB requires each holder of an owners license to obtain the IGB s approval prior to issuing a guaranty of any indebtedness. The IGB requires that each institutional investor, as that term is defined by IGB, that, individually or jointly with others, cumulatively acquires, directly or indirectly, 5 or more of any class of voting securities of a publicly-traded licensee or a licensee s publicly-traded parent corporation (like Full House) shall, within no less than ten days after acquiring such securities, notify the IGB of such ownership and shall, upon request, provide such additional information as may be required by the IGB (which additional information may include requiring the filing of an Institutional Investor Disclosure Form ). An institutional investor that, individually or jointly with others, cumulatively acquires, directly or indirectly, 10 or more of any class of voting securities of a publicly-traded licensee or a licensee s publicly-traded parent corporation must file an Institutional Investor Disclosure Form, provided by the IGB, within 45 days after cumulatively acquiring such level of ownership interest, unless such requirement is waived by the IGB. Additionally, we must notify the IGB as soon as possible after we become aware that we are involved in an ownership acquisition by an institutional investor. The IGB may waive any licensing requirement or procedure provided by rule if it determines that the waiver is in the best interests of the public and the gaming industry. Also, the IGB may, from time to time, amend or change its rules. Beginning August 1, 2020, the IGB established benchmark contract utilization goals for owners licensees as set forth below: 11 for minority-owned businesses; 7 for women-owned businesses; 2 for businesses owned by persons with disabilities; and 3 for veteran-owned businesses. 
 Each owners licensee is required to submit to the IGB proposed contracting goals for the coming calendar year and final contracting goals shall be established through a consultation process with each owners licensee and subsequent IGB evaluation and approval. By March 31st of each year, each owners licensee is required to file with the IGB an annual report of its utilization of minority-owned businesses, women-owned businesses, businesses owned by persons with disabilities and veteran-owned businesses during the preceding calendar year. The IGB strongly encourages compliance with these benchmarking goals. Any failure by an owners licensee to meet these goals will be scrutinized by the IGB, and if the IGB determines that its goals and policies are not being met by an owners licensee, then the Board may recommend remedies for these violations in accordance with the IGB s rules. 

 On July 13, 2009, Illinois enacted the Video Gaming Act, which initially legalized the use of up to five video gaming terminals in most bars, restaurants, fraternal organizations and veterans organizations holding valid Illinois liquor licenses, as well as at qualifying truck stops. Effective October 9, 2012, video gaming in Illinois became operational. The video gaming terminals in licensed establishments allow patrons to play games such as video poker, line up and blackjack. PA101-0091 similarly expanded the Video Gaming Act by authorizing the use of up to six video gaming terminals (increased from five) in most bars, restaurants, fraternal organizations and veterans organizations holding valid Illinois liquor licenses and created a new category of licensure for large truck stop establishments that are authorized to operate up to ten video gaming terminals. As of December 2022, there were approximately 45,000 video gaming terminals in operation in Illinois. Revenues at American Place (including The Temporary) may be adversely impacted by the availability of video gaming terminals in non-casino establishments proximately located to its customer base. From time to time, various proposals have been introduced in the Illinois legislature that, if enacted, would affect the taxation, regulation, operation or other aspects of the gaming industry. The Illinois legislature regularly considers proposals that would expand gaming opportunities in Illinois. Some of this legislation, if enacted, could adversely affect the gaming industry. No assurance can be given whether such or similar legislation will be enacted.
