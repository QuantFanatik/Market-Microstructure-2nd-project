 We continue to focus on sustainability by taking steps to reduce the negative impact our operations have on the environment while generating economic value by manufacturing and selling products, solutions and technologies that enable our customers to reduce the negative impact they have on the environment. As a leading global water technology company, we address some of the world s most important sustainability priorities the conservation, control and safe use of water. Our smart and connected strategy is anchored by a commitment to connect our customers to smart systems, control those systems for optimal performance, and conserve critical water and other resources by increasing operability, efficiency, and safety. Internally, we have reduced our global water consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, improved our safety performance, made our work environment more diverse, equitable and inclusive, and maintained robust ethics and compliance programs to help ensure we do business with integrity and in accordance with high ethical standards. We intend to generate incremental growth by targeting select acquisitions both in our core markets and in new complementary markets. We have completed 12 acquisitions since 2012. Our acquisition strategy focuses on businesses that manufacture preferred brand name products that address our themes of safety and regulation, energy efficiency and water conservation. We target businesses that will provide us with one or more of the following: an entry into new markets, improved channel access, unique and/or proprietary technologies, advanced production capabilities or complementary solution offerings. We are committed to reducing our manufacturing and operating costs using Lean methodologies to drive improvement across all key processes. We have a number of manufacturing facilities in lower-cost regions. In recent years, we have announced global restructuring plans which reduced our manufacturing and distribution footprint in order to reduce our costs and to realize incremental operating efficiencies. Additionally, a majority of our manufacturing facilities are ISO 9000, 9001 or 9002 certified by the International Organization for Standardization. The majority of our sales are for products that have been approved under regulatory standards incorporated into state and municipal plumbing, heating, building and fire protection codes in the Americas, Europe, and certain countries within APMEA. We have consistently advocated for the development and enforcement of plumbing codes and are committed to providing products to meet these standards. Products We have a broad range of products in terms of design distinction, size and configuration. We classify our many products into four global product categories. These product categories are: Residential commercial flow control and protection products includes products typically sold into plumbing and hot water applications such as backflow preventers, water pressure regulators, temperature and pressure relief valves, thermostatic mixing valves and leak detection and protection products. Many of our flow control and protection products are now smart and connected, warning of leaks and floods with alerts to Business Management Systems (BMS) and/or personal devices giving our customers greater insight into their water management and the ability to shut off the water supply to avoid waste and mitigate damages . Residential commercial flow control and protection products accounted for approximately 52 , 53 and 52 of our total net sales in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. HVAC gas products includes commercial high-efficiency boilers, water heaters and custom heat and hot water solutions, hydronic and electric heating systems for under-floor radiant applications, hydronic pump groups for boiler manufacturers and alternative energy control packages, and flexible stainless steel connectors for natural and liquid propane gas in commercial food service and residential applications . Most of our HVAC products feature advanced controls enabling customers to easily connect to the Building Automation System for better monitoring, control and operation . HVAC gas products accounted for approximately 31 of our total net sales in 2022 and 2021, and 30 of our total net sales in 2020. HVAC is an acronym for heating, ventilation and air conditioning.

 Drainage water re-use products includes drainage products and engineered rain water harvesting solutions for commercial, industrial, marine and residential applications, including connected roof drain systems . Drainage water re-use products accounted for approximately 10 of our total net sales in 2022 and 2021, and 11 of our total net sales in 2020. Water quality products includes point-of-use and point-of-entry water filtration, monitoring, conditioning and scale prevention systems for commercial, marine and residential applications. Water quality products accounted for approximately 7 , 6 and 7 of our total net sales in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Commercial and Operational Excellence We strive to invest in product innovation that meets the wants and needs of our customers. Our focus is on differentiated products and solutions that will provide greater opportunity to distinguish ourselves in the marketplace. We continue to migrate away from commoditized products where it is more difficult to add value. Our goal is to be a solutions provider, not merely a components supplier. We refer to this customer-facing mindset as commercial excellence, and we are continually looking for strategic opportunities to invest or divest, where necessary, in order to meet those objectives. In conjunction with this customer-centric focus, we continually review our operations to ensure we can efficiently and effectively produce and deliver products to customers. We are also striving to simplify our administrative operations to drive further efficiencies. We call this aspect of our business operational excellence. Customers and Markets We sell our products to plumbing, heating and mechanical wholesale distributors and dealers, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), specialty product distributors, and major do-it-yourself (DIY) and retail chains. Wholesalers. Approximately 60 , 61 and 60 of our net sales in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, were to wholesale distributors for commercial and residential applications. OEMs. Approximately 15 of our net sales in 2022, 2021 and 2020 were to OEMs. In the Americas, our typical OEM customers are water heater manufacturers and equipment and water systems manufacturers needing flow control devices and other products. Our sales to OEMs in Europe are primarily to boiler manufacturers and radiant system manufacturers. Our sales to OEMs in APMEA are primarily to water heater, air conditioning, and appliance manufacturers. Specialty. Approximately 21 of our net sales in 2022, and 19 of our net sales in 2021 and 2020 were through our specialty channel. The specialty channel primarily includes sales related to high-efficiency boilers and water heaters, water filtration and conditioning products, specialty floor and tile products, food service products and leak detection products. DIY Chains. Approximately 4 of our net sales in 2022, and 5 of our net sales in 2021 and 2020 were to DIY chains. The DIY channel primarily includes sales related to valves and a portion of our water quality products. In 2022, 2021 and 2020, no customer accounted for more than 10 of our total net sales. Our top ten customers accounted for 431.7 million, or 21.8 , of our total net sales in 2022; 371.5 million, or 20.5 , of our total net sales in 2021; and 344.1 million, or 22.8 , of our total net sales in 2020. Thousands of other customers constituted the balance of our net sales in each of those years. Marketing and Sales For product sales in the Americas, we rely primarily on commissioned manufacturers representatives to market our product lines, some of which maintain a consigned inventory of our products. These representatives sell primarily to plumbing and heating wholesalers and contractors or supply DIY stores. Our specialty channel products in the Americas are sold through independent representatives, dealers and distributors. We also sell products directly to wholesalers, OEMs and private label accounts primarily in Europe and APMEA, and, to a lesser extent, in the Americas.

 We aim to inform and educate our channel partners, installers and end-use customers on how to maximize our product solutions. We do so through a variety of traditional and digital marketing avenues, including social media, trade shows, and advertising. We pride ourselves in providing industry leading product education through four distinct training vehicles: Online Courses, on-location Lunch and Learns, Live and Virtual Instructor Led Training, and Continuing Education Units (CEUs) for designers. Manufacturing We have integrated and automated manufacturing capabilities, including a state-of-the-art foundry dedicated exclusively to the production of products that qualify as lead-free under the U.S. Safe Drinking Water Act; and machining capabilities, plastic extrusion, and injection molding and assembly operations. Our foundry operations include metal pouring systems, automatic core making, and brass and bronze die-castings. Our machining operations feature computer-controlled machine tools, high-speed chucking machines with robotics, robotic assembly capability, laser-cutting technology, and automatic screw machines for machining bronze, brass and steel components. Our heating and hot water product manufacturing capabilities include all phases of light and heavy gauge metal fabrication, incorporating the latest technology for welding and brazing, as well as laser cutting; automated and robotic applications; and metal finishing, which includes chemical passivation of stainless steel. We have invested in recent years to expand our manufacturing capabilities and to adopt the most efficient and productive equipment. We are committed to maintaining our manufacturing equipment at a level consistent with current technology in order to maintain high levels of quality and manufacturing efficiencies. In 2022, we continued to invest in our systems and in our manufacturing facilities and our commercial and operational excellence initiatives. Capital expenditures and depreciation for each of the last three years were as follows: 

Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (in millions) Capital expenditures 28.1 26.7 43.8 Depreciation 27.6 31.4 31.3 Purchased Raw Materials and Components Our products are made using various purchased components and raw materials, including primarily bronze, brass, cast iron, stainless steel, steel, and plastic. Substantially all of the raw materials we require to manufacture our products are purchased from outside sources. The commodity markets have experienced tremendous volatility over the past several years, particularly with respect to copper and stainless steel, and we have experienced high inflationary pressures in these markets. Tariffs impact the total cost of our products and the components and raw materials that go into manufacturing them. Increased tariff costs could adversely impact the gross margin we earn on our products. Because we internationally source a significant amount of raw materials and components, several months of raw materials and work in process are moving through our supply chain at any point in time. We are not able to predict whether component costs or commodity costs, including copper and stainless steel, will significantly increase or decrease in the future. If component costs or commodity costs increase in the future and we are not able to reduce or eliminate the effect of the cost increases by reducing production costs or implementing price increases, our profit margins could decrease. If component costs or commodity costs were to decline, we may experience pressure from customers to reduce our selling prices. The timing of any price reductions and decreases in commodity costs may not align. As a result, our margins could be affected. With limited exceptions, we have multiple suppliers for our components and raw materials. We believe our relationships with our key suppliers are good and that an interruption in supply from any one supplier would not materially affect our ability to meet our immediate demands while another supplier is qualified. We regularly review our suppliers to evaluate their strengths. If a supplier is unable to meet our demands, we believe that in most cases our inventory of components and raw materials will allow for sufficient time to identify and obtain the necessary commodities and other raw materials from an alternate source. We believe that the nature of the components and raw materials used in our business are such that multiple sources are generally available in the market. However, our current and alternative suppliers are largely concentrated in China. The occurrence of natural disasters, public health crises such as pandemics or epidemics, political crises such as war, terrorism or political instability, or other events that result in widespread business or supply chain disruptions in China could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain necessary components and raw materials, and our business and operating results could suffer.

 The current global supply chain disruptions are impacting our supply of raw materials and purchased components. Refer to Item. 1A Risk Factors for risks related to the impact of supply chain and logistic disruptions and Item. 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional disclosure. Code Compliance Products representing a majority of our sales are subject to regulatory standards and code enforcement, which typically require that these products meet stringent performance criteria. Codes and standards in the Americas are established by industry and government organizations such as the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME),the Canadian Standards Association (CSA), the American Society of Sanitary Engineering (ASSE), NSF International (NSF) Underwriters Laboratories (UL), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Californian Energy Commission (CEC), the International Code Council (ICC) and the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials (IAPMO). Many of the codes and standards are incorporated into state and municipal plumbing and heating, building and fire protection codes. National regulatory standards in Europe vary by country. The major standards and/or guidelines that our products must meet are AFNOR (France), DVGW (Germany), UNI/ICIM (Italy), SVGW (Switzerland), SITAC (Sweden), WRAS (United Kingdom) and CEN (Denmark). Further, there are local regulatory standards requiring compliance as well. We consistently advocate for the development and enforcement of plumbing codes and standards. Our product-testing capabilities and dedicated investments are areas of strength for us. Manufacturing operations consistently maintain stringent quality control and testing procedures, thus ensuring products remain in continuous compliance with all requirements. Investment in product-testing capability and in plant and equipment also ensures ongoing continuous product compliance. Additionally, a majority of our manufacturing facilities are ISO 9000, 9001 or 9002 certified by the International Organization for Standardization. Watts also proactively monitors and participates in regulatory, codes and standards development activities with the various aforementioned entities and others. We are a primary participating member of the U.S.-based voluntary industry association American Supply Association (ASA), which provides its members with industry information and coordinates resources for addressing regulatory issues and developing and maintaining codes and standards. Watts is also a member of the Canadian Institute of Plumbing and Heating (CIPH), which provides a similar function and benefit as ASA by monitoring and advocating on behalf of its members on various legislative and regulatory issues. New Product Development and Engineering We retain our own product development staff, design teams, and testing laboratories in the Americas, Europe and APMEA that work to enhance our existing products and develop new products and solutions with a focus on sustainable customer-centric technological innovation and smart and connected solutions. We maintain sophisticated product development and testing laboratories and continue to invest in our smart and connected product pipeline. We employ a global new-product development process that is used to prioritize, guide and support new projects. Over the years, we have continued to bring innovation to our markets, with smart and connected advancement in our backflow product line now providing sensors for flood detection, notification, and tampering security, providing potential to avoid tremendous water loss from undetected floods. Leak detection has also become an important product group helping avoid costly water-based damage and loss, providing the ability shut off water supply remotely at the first detection of a leak with our Leak Defense system. We continue to invest in leak detection and have solutions that service both the residential market and commercial properties and multifamily units, together making water safer and cutting off water loss. We launched a new product, the Centurion, a 2000 MBH water heater that features state of the art combustion control technology, the first water heater to offer O 2 Trim which allows the unit to self-adjust and maintain optimal air/fuel rations for peak efficiency, low emissions and maximum uptime reliability. We have made advancements in our Heat Interface Units, which act as a bridge between the central boiler and the heating /cooling domestic water systems to maximize their efficiency and provide optimal comfort and energy efficiency in the home. We also launched a smart and connected boiler control which allows for operation of any boiler and provides remote connectivity for troubleshooting and system diagnosis.

 In 2022, we launched 20 new smart and connected product offerings, adding to our portfolio and expansion of our smart and connected strategy. We will continue to focus on and invest in our global new product development program to leverage new technologies, inhouse expertise and our electronics capabilities to expand our smart and connected strategy. Competition The domestic and international markets for energy efficient products, water conservation devices, and products that address the safety and regulation for the flow of fluids, are intensely competitive and require us to compete against some companies possessing greater financial, marketing and other resources than ours. Due to the breadth of our product offerings, the number and identities of our competitors vary by product line and market. We consider quality, brand preference, delivery times, engineering specifications, plumbing code requirements, price, technological expertise, breadth of product offerings, products that help customers sustainability efforts, and smart and connected products and solutions to be the primary competitive factors. We believe that new product development and product engineering are also important to success in the water industry and that our position in the industry is attributable in part to our ability to develop new and innovative products quickly and to adapt and enhance existing products. We continue to develop new and innovative products to expand our market position and are implementing manufacturing and design programs to reduce costs. We cannot be certain that our efforts to develop new products will be successful or that our customers will accept our new products. Although we own certain patents and trademarks that we consider to be of importance, we do not believe that our business and competitiveness as a whole are dependent on any one of our patents or trademarks or on patent or trademark protection generally. Human Capital Management We believe that our employees are our greatest asset, and we aim to provide a safe, inclusive and high-performance culture where our people can thrive. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 4,600 employees globally, including 2,100 in the Americas, 2,200 in Europe and 300 in APMEA. At Watts, we strive to attract, develop, retain and engage high performing talent and we reward employee performance. By developing and promoting our talented people, we are creating value for our customers and shareholders while advancing our Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance ESG goals. As the economy and our business grow, so does the need for highly qualified talent; hence we are always competing for the best people in an environment of increasingly challenged supply. To that end, we have developed, and continue to enhance and refine, a robust and comprehensive talent management strategy that spans from talent attraction to performance management, career development and retention of our top talent and, ultimately, to succession planning across our organization. We continually strive to cultivate and support a highly engaged and productive workforce. Talent Acquisition Recruitment efforts follow a defined Talent Acquisition process to attract and hire top talent. We provide a robust college internship program to identify and cultivate an early-in-career pipeline of talent. We are actively engaging with a select group of historically Black colleges and universities, minority serving institutions, and professional organizations to help attract and recruit diverse professionals. We engage with external professional recruiting firms to supplement our internal recruiting efforts as needed. We have a rich global employee referral bonus program to attract qualified candidates and reward employees. We provide training to Human Resources Business Partners and hiring managers on the Watts Talent Acquisition Process. Professional Development Leadership Inclusivity. In 2022, we launched a global, multi-phased leadership training program for all employees that is designed to build leadership capability through a set of clear frameworks that are simple to use and easily recalled, thus enabling our employees to practice new habits and build inclusive behaviors. This training includes three modules focused on identifying bias to make better decisions, creating teams where all people feel valued and empowering people to use their voice and contribute ideas.

Survey results are also reviewed with our Board of Directors, or Board, and used to develop and refine other aspects of our overall human capital management and other growth strategies. In 2022, 80 of our employee population participated in a pulse survey to gain feedback on a core set of engagement items and performance drivers aligned to our business priorities. Performance Management Framework. We maintain a robust annual performance management process across the organization. Together with their managers, employees start the process by setting goals; year-end activities begin with employee self-assessments and conclude with a conversation led by the manager on goal accomplishment and defined core competencies. Safety. Employee safety is one of our highest priorities and we strive for zero hazards and zero injuries by educating and training employees on safety best practices through awareness campaigns and related engagement initiatives. Diversity, Equity Inclusion An integral part of our mission to build a high performance, values-driven culture is creating an inclusive culture that welcomes and celebrates diversity. Our path to innovation starts and ends with our employees, who are fundamental to the vibrancy and success of Watts. Everything we accomplish depends on creating an environment that is engaging and supportive and enables employees to perform to their potential. This is why we have initiated a comprehensive approach to diversity, equity and inclusion focusing on awareness and education programs for our leaders and employees; monitoring engagement through employee survey feedback; creating awareness with our employees about diversity, equity and inclusion topics through our company intranet, in employee meetings and on our public website; and improving our hiring and leadership development processes to increase diversity, equity and inclusion at all levels at Watts. We have also encouraged the visibility of diverse employees through the formation of employee resource groups, which are voluntary employee-led groups that provide a forum for employees to share common interests and experiences, gain professional development support, engage with our leadership teams, and drive initiatives to improve diversity, equity and inclusion at Watts. Sustainability Commitment to Sustainability We have demonstrated our commitment to environmental sustainability by reducing our impact on the environment in multiple areas of our global business and by providing innovative products and solutions that enable our customers to reduce their impact on the environment. We are also focused on building a sustainable company by adhering to responsible business practices, prioritizing employee safety and providing our employees with opportunities for personal and professional growth, including through programs and initiatives to promote diversity, equity and inclusion. We also

 strive to have a positive impact on the communities in which we live and work and other communities in need through community involvement, educational partnerships and charitable giving. Sustainability Leadership In May 2022, our Board amended the charter of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to rename it as the Governance and Sustainability Committee and to assign it primary responsibility for the oversight of our ESG efforts and strategy. The Governance and Sustainability Committee reviews the Company s ESG performance and strategic plans four times a year at its regularly scheduled quarterly meetings and receives additional updates from the Company s Chief Sustainability Officer as needed. At the management level, our General Counsel and Chief Sustainability Officer, who reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer, has general oversight responsibility for all sustainability matters. Our General Counsel and Chief Sustainability Officer also chairs our global Sustainability Steering Committee, which is made up of senior company leaders and is responsible for formulating our sustainability strategy and overseeing the execution of our environmental, social and governance initiatives. Sustainability Strategy The materiality principle is one of the core principles of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). GRI is an independent global organization that provides one of the most widely used reporting standards framework for companies to communicate and demonstrate accountability for their impacts on the environment, economy and people. In order to address the principle of materiality, a company should undertake a process of identifying its key material topics that have the greatest financial, environmental and social impact on its business, as well as those topics regarded as highly important by its key internal and external stakeholder groups. We have conducted a sustainability materiality assessment with the assistance of an external consultant. The results of that assessment are being used by the Sustainability Steering Committee to identify our key focus areas and from there to build a strategy to address the material environmental, social and governance topics identified by the materiality assessment. Climate Change Impact The effects of climate change present several risks for our business. Recent municipal regulations prohibiting the installation of gas powered appliances have reduced the available market for our gas powered water heaters and boilers and our gas appliance connectors. Severe weather and climate events have also negatively impacted our operations. Recent hurricanes interrupted our operations in Fort Meyers, Florida; wildfires have threatened our facilities and operations in Woodland, California and Vernon, British Columbia, Canada; flooding and droughts have negatively impacted our operations in Italy and St. Pauls, North Carolina; and freezing temperatures have interrupted our operations in San Antonio, Texas. However, none of these events individually or collectively had a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Climate change and the increasing focus on sustainability have also created opportunities for our business. The growing interest in energy efficient products has increased demand for our high-efficiency boilers and water heaters, our Aegis heat pumps, under floor heating systems, smart thermostats, and our Microflex insulated pipes. Concern around water conservation has led to increased interest in products that are designed to reduce water consumption, such as our ACV Assure monitoring system, Intelliflow water shut off device, ZeroWaste reverse osmosis filters, OneFlow anti-scale system, Hygienic Pro drains and our Trident and Leak Defense leak detection and water shutoff systems. We have also seen increased interest in our products and services that are designed to protect our customers from contaminated water and safeguard biodiversity, such as backflow preventers, HF Scientific ballast water testing systems, Intellistation digital water mixing systems, and Lync brand solutions. Severe weather events that cause damage to, or destruction of, water systems and plumbing devices have also resulted in increased demand for replacement products and repair kits. Environmental Stewardship We have made substantial progress in minimizing the environmental impact of our operations. Recent initiatives have resulted in a reduction on our global water consumption and our greenhouse gas emissions, including through the implementation of smart monitoring systems in many of our high water use facilities to promote early leak and surge detection and investments in various energy reduction projects. With respect to our product handprint, we provide a portfolio of products, components and systems that conserve water, save energy, reduce waste and preserve water quality

 and safety. In addition, our goal is to embed sustainability throughout the lifecycle of our products by creating safe, efficient, long-lasting products made with high-recycling-value materials wherever possible. Social Responsibility We are committed to creating both economic and social value and strive to have a positive impact on our global community. During 2022, we supported those in need through donations of money and products to several non-profit charitable organizations and through the volunteer efforts of our employees. One example was our ongoing partnership with the Planet Water Foundation. During 2022, we worked with Planet Water to fund the construction of six AquaTowers and AquaSan systems, which provide clean, safe drinking water for up to 10,800 people in Cambodia, India, Mexico, the Philippines and Indonesia. Governance, Business Ethics, and Compliance We believe that good corporate governance and an environment of high ethical standards are important for us to achieve business success and to create value for our stockholders. Our Board is committed to high governance standards and continually works to improve them. We periodically review our corporate governance policies and practices and compare them to those suggested by various authorities on corporate governance and employed by other public companies and consider changes to our corporate governance policies and practices in light of such guidance and interpretations. We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct applicable to all officers, employees and Board members worldwide that serves as the foundation for our ethics and compliance program, and drives policy development, training initiatives, and reinforcement of our values throughout the global organization. Recognition In 2022, we were recognized for the fourth year in a row as one of Newsweek s Most Responsible Companies. We were also promoted to the low-risk category by Sustainalytics in their annual ESG Risk Rating Report. More information about our sustainability efforts is included in our latest Sustainability Report, available at https://investors.wattswater.com/sustainability. The material in our Sustainability Report is for informational purposes only and is not included as part of, or incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Product Liability, Environmental and Other Litigation Matters We are subject to a variety of potential liabilities connected with our business operations, including potential liabilities and expenses associated with possible product defects or failures and compliance with environmental laws. We maintain product liability and other insurance coverage, which we believe to be generally in accordance with industry practices. Nonetheless, such insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us fully against substantial damage claims. See Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. Environmental Remediation We have been named as a potentially responsible party with respect to a limited number of identified contaminated sites. The levels of contamination vary significantly from site to site as do the related levels of remediation efforts. Environmental liabilities are recorded based on the most probable cost, if known, or on the estimated minimum cost of remediation. Accruals are not discounted to their present value, unless the amount and timing of expenditures are fixed and reliably determinable. We accrue estimated environmental liabilities based on assumptions, which are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties. Circumstances that can affect the reliability and precision of these estimates include identification of additional sites, environmental regulations, level of clean-up required, technologies available, number and financial condition of other contributors to remediation and the time period over which remediation may occur. We recognize changes in estimates as new remediation requirements are defined or as new information becomes available. See Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, both of which are incorporated herein by reference.

 Asbestos Litigation We are defending approximately 550 lawsuits in different jurisdictions, alleging injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos. The complaints in these cases typically name a large number of defendants and do not identify any of our particular products as a source of asbestos exposure. To date, discovery has failed to yield evidence of substantial exposure to any of our products and no judgments have been entered against us. Other Litigation Other lawsuits and proceedings or claims, arising from the ordinary course of operations, are also pending or threatened against us.

Industry Risk Factors Economic cycles, particularly those involving reduced levels of commercial and residential starts and remodeling, may have adverse effects on our revenues and operating results. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in revenues and operating results due to economic and business cycles. The businesses of most of our customers, particularly plumbing and heating wholesalers and OEM manufacturers, are cyclical. Therefore, the level of our business activity has been cyclical, fluctuating with economic cycles. An economic downturn may also affect the financial stability of our customers, which could affect their ability to pay amounts owed to their vendors, including us. We also believe our level of business activity is influenced by commercial and residential starts and renovation and remodeling, which are, in turn, heavily influenced by interest rates, consumer debt levels, changes in disposable income, employment growth and consumer confidence. Credit market conditions may prevent commercial and residential builders or developers from obtaining the necessary capital to 
 15 

Table of Contents 
 continue existing projects or to start new projects. This may result in the delay or cancellation of orders from our customers or potential customers and may adversely affect our revenues and our ability to manage inventory levels, collect customer receivables and maintain profitability. Economic conditions and financial markets in the United States and globally have experienced significant volatility. Central banks have raised interest rates to slow inflationary conditions. The economic conditions for fiscal year 2023 are predicted to be very challenging as a result of the inflationary environment, higher interest rates, labor challenges and potential recession. We cannot predict how ongoing inflation, risk of recession, the war in Ukraine, COVID-19 restrictions, supply chain disruptions and related costs may impact our ability to service our customers or the potential impact on our profit margins going forward. If these market conditions persist, we may see diminished liquidity and credit availability, inability to access capital markets, and the bankruptcy, failure, collapse, or sale of various entities that could directly or indirectly impact our business, including certain of our customers and suppliers. If economic conditions worsen in the future, our revenues and profits could decrease or trigger additional goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or long-lived asset impairments and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Changes in the costs of raw materials and purchased components, including imposition of or changes in tariff rates, as well as supply chain and logistics disruptions, could reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our ability to meet our customer delivery commitments. Our products are made using various purchased components and raw materials, including primarily bronze, brass, cast iron, stainless steel, steel and plastic. Substantially all of the raw materials we require to manufacture our products are purchased from outside sources. The costs and availability of raw materials and components may be subject to change due to, among other things, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in worldwide price, demand levels, exchange rates and imposition of or changes in tariff rates. We typically do not enter into long-term supply agreements. Our inability to obtain supplies of raw materials and purchased components for our products at favorable costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations by decreasing our profit margins. Commodity prices, particularly copper and stainless-steel prices, have experienced tremendous volatility over the past several years, mainly due to global macroeconomic trends, including global price inflation, supply chain disruption and the war in Ukraine. Should commodity costs or purchased component costs increase substantially, we may not be able to recover such costs, through selling price increases to our customers or other product cost reductions, which would have a negative effect on our financial results. If commodity costs or purchased component costs decline, we may experience pressure from customers to reduce our selling prices. Additionally, we continue to purchase components and finished goods from international sources. In limited cases, these components or finished goods are single-sourced. The availability of components and finished goods from international sources could be adversely impacted by, among other things, interruptions in production by suppliers including due to pandemics or other public health crises, suppliers allocations to other purchasers, threats of wars and global geo-political instability, and new laws, tariffs or regulations. As a global manufacturer and distributor, we are facing additional risks related to ongoing disruptions and increased costs in our supply chain and logistics. Although the global supply chain disruptions have shown signs of easing, some logistics issues and electronic component shortages remain. We are experiencing inflation across our cost of materials, labor, transportation, and energy. Labor shortages and workforce disruptions have affected our manufacturing and distribution processes, as well as those of our suppliers. The ongoing war in Ukraine has added strain to the European markets and the global economy, as well as exacerbated inflation, particularly energy inflation. We face intense competition and, if we are not able to respond to competition in our markets, our revenues and profits may decrease. Competitive pressures in our markets could adversely affect our competitive position, leading to a possible loss of market share or a decrease in prices, either of which could result in decreased revenues and profits. We encounter intense competition in all areas of our business. To remain competitive, we will need to invest continually in manufacturing, product development, marketing, customer service and support and our distribution networks. We may not have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments and we may be unable to maintain our competitive position. In addition, we may have to reduce the prices of some of our products to stay competitive, potentially resulting in a reduction in the profit margin for, and inventory valuation of, these products. Some of our competitors are based in foreign countries and have cost structures and prices in foreign currencies. Accordingly, currency fluctuations could cause our U.S. dollar costed products to be less competitive than our competitors products costed in other currencies.

 We are subject to risks associated with changing technology, product innovation, manufacturing techniques, operational flexibility and business continuity, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage. The successful implementation of our business strategy requires us to continually evolve our existing products and introduce new products to meet customers needs in the industries we serve, as evidenced by our investments in our smart and connected strategy. Many of our products are characterized by stringent performance and specification requirements that mandate a high degree of manufacturing, engineering, and technological expertise. If we fail to meet these requirements, or if our product offerings, including our smart and connected products, are not accepted by the market, our business could be at risk. We believe that our customers rigorously evaluate their suppliers on the basis of a number of factors, including product quality, price competitiveness, technical and manufacturing expertise, development and product design capability, new product innovation, reliability and timeliness of delivery, operational flexibility, customer service and overall management. Our success will depend on our ability to continue to meet customers changing specifications with respect to these criteria. We cannot ensure that we will be able to address technological advances or introduce new products that may be necessary to remain competitive within our business. We cannot ensure that we can adequately protect any of our technological developments to produce a sustainable competitive advantage. Furthermore, we may be subject to business continuity risk in the event of an unexpected loss of a material facility or operation. We cannot ensure that we adequately protect against such loss. Economic and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our business and future operating results. Since we sell and manufacture our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Our business and future operating results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including: unexpected geo-political events in foreign countries in which we operate, which could adversely affect manufacturing and our ability to fulfill customer orders; and threats of war, terrorism or governmental instability, including the war in Ukraine; our failure to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various international jurisdictions, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom s Bribery Act of 2010; trade protection measures and import or export duties or licensing requirements, which could increase our costs of doing business internationally; potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws, which could have an adverse impact on our profits; difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, which could reduce our productivity; costs of compliance with differing labor regulations, especially in connection with restructuring our overseas operations; laws of some foreign countries, which may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S.; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, which may be costly and require time to implement; and foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which could also materially affect our reported results. A portion of our net sales and certain portions of our costs, assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Approximately 34 , 38 and 37 of our net sales in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, were from sales outside of the U.S. The U.S. dollar strengthened as compared to many foreign currencies, including the Euro, during fiscal 2022, which adversely affected reported revenues of our international subsidiaries. We cannot predict whether currencies such as the euro, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, or other currencies in which we transact will appreciate or depreciate against the U.S. dollar in future periods or whether future foreign exchange rate fluctuations will have a positive or negative impact on our reported results.

 The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The COVID-19 pandemic, the resulting global economic slowdown, and the reopening of global economies that has followed have created a number of macroeconomic challenges that have impacted our business, including volatility and uncertainty in business planning, disruptions in global supply chains, material, freight and labor inflation, shortages of and delays in obtaining certain materials and component parts, and labor shortages. New variants of COVID-19 and other future public health crises and pandemics may affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or not presently considered to be a significant risk to our operations. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other future public health crises and pandemics may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks and uncertainties described in this Risk Factors section. Company Risk Factors Our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by information technology and other business disruptions. Our business may be impacted by disruptions, including information technology attacks or failures, threats to physical security, as well as damaging weather, fire or other acts of nature. We depend heavily on information technology infrastructure including third-party data centers and other third-party cloud services to manage our business objectives and operations, support our customers requirements and protect sensitive information. Any damage to, or failure of, our systems or the third-party hosting facility or other service that we use, could severely impact our ability to conduct our business operations, attract new customers, maintain existing customers, or result in a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, any of which could materially adversely affect our future operating results. While we have taken steps to reduce interruptions by implementing additional internal controls, network and data center resiliency, redundancy and recovery processes, these measures may be inadequate. Our information technology risks also relate to cyber security attacks and disruptions caused by potential failures in the performance of our primary enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. Cyber security attacks, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. Cyber security may also be breached due to employee error, malfeasance, system errors or vulnerabilities, including vulnerabilities of our customers, distributors, vendors, suppliers, and their products. We have experienced certain cyber security attacks and may continue to experience them going forward, potentially with more frequency. We have a portion of our workforce working remotely, which may heighten these risks. In addition, we have designed products and services that connect to and are part of the Internet of Things which may also be vulnerable to cyber security breaches. As we continue to design and develop smart and connected products, services and solutions that leverage our hosted or cloud-based resources, the Internet-of-Things and other wireless/remote technologies, and include networks of distributed and interconnected devices that contain sensors, data transfers and other computing capabilities, our customers data and systems may be subjected to harmful or illegal content or attacks, including potential cybersecurity threats. Additionally, we may not have adequately anticipated or precluded such cybersecurity threats through our product design or development. Consequently, these products, services and solutions also may be subjected to harmful or illegal content or attacks that develop vulnerabilities or critical security issues that cannot be disclosed without compromising security. If we need to address multiple vulnerabilities simultaneously, we may also need to make prioritization decisions in determining which vulnerabilities or security defects to fix first, and the timing of these fixes, which could result in compromised security. These vulnerabilities and security defects could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss, disclosure, or misuse of data; adversely affect our operating results; result in litigation, liability, or regulatory action (including under laws related to privacy, data protection, data security, network security, and consumer protection); deter customers or sellers from using our products, services and solutions; and otherwise harm our business and reputation. We have adopted measures and incurred cost to mitigate potential risks associated with information technology disruptions and cybersecurity threats; however, there is no assurance that these measures will prevent cyber-attacks or security breaches. In addition, cybersecurity and data privacy and protection laws and regulations are evolving and present increasing compliance challenges, which may increase our costs, affect our competitiveness and expose us to substantial fines or other penalties.

 We also may experience unplanned system interruptions or outages of our primary ERP system as it continues to age, which may affect our ability to support and maintain the system in an effective manner. Any disruptions, delays or deficiencies related to our primary ERP system could lead to substantial business interruption, including our ability to perform routine business transactions, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products to our customers, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, misappropriation, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems, networks or our products, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. We plan to replace our current primary ERP system with a new ERP system, and this system implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years. Any software implementation requires significant investment of human and financial resources and we may experience significant delays, increased costs and other difficulties. Any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of our software systems, including our new ERP, could adversely affect our ability to process orders, ship product, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business. While we invest significant resources in planning and project management, significant issues may arise, which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. In addition, our current primary ERP system will continue to be used over the course of the phased implementation and we may experience system interruptions or deficiencies as described in the paragraph above. Implementation of our acquisition strategy may not be successful, which could affect our ability to increase our revenues or our profitability. One of our strategies is to increase our revenues and profitability and expand our business through acquisitions that will provide us with complementary products and solutions and increase market share for our existing product categories. We cannot be certain that we will be able to identify, acquire or profitably manage additional companies or successfully integrate such additional companies without substantial costs, delays or other problems. Also, companies acquired recently and in the future may not achieve anticipated revenues, cost synergies, profitability or cash flows that justify our investment in them. We have faced increasing competition for acquisition candidates, which has resulted in significant increases in the purchase prices of many acquisition candidates. This competition, and the resulting purchase price increases, may limit the number of acquisition opportunities available to us, possibly leading to a decrease in the rate of growth of our revenues and profitability. In addition, acquisitions may involve a number of risks, including, but not limited to: inadequate internal control over financial reporting and our ability to bring such controls into compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in a timely manner; adverse short-term effects on our reported operating results; diversion of management s attention; investigations of, or challenges to, acquisitions by competition authorities; loss of key personnel at acquired companies; unanticipated management or operational problems or legal liabilities; and potential goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or long- lived asset impairment charges. 
 We are subject to risks related to product defects, which could result in product recalls and could subject us to warranty claims in excess of our warranty provisions or which are greater than anticipated due to the unenforceability of liability limitations. We cannot be certain that our quality controls and procedures, including the testing of raw materials and safety testing of selected finished products, will reveal latent defects in our products or the materials from which they are made, which may not become apparent until after the products have been sold into the market. We also cannot be certain that our 
 19 

Table of Contents 
 suppliers will always eliminate latent defects in products we purchase from them. Accordingly, there is a risk that product defects will occur, which could require a product recall. Product recalls can be expensive to implement and, if a product recall occurs during the product s warranty period, we may be required to replace the defective product. In addition, a product recall may damage our relationship with our customers and we may lose market share with our customers. Our insurance policies may not cover the costs of a product recall. Our standard warranties contain limits on damages and exclusions of liability for consequential damages and for misuse, improper installation, alteration, accident or mishandling while in the possession of someone other than us. We may incur additional operating expenses if our warranty provision does not reflect the actual cost of resolving issues related to defects in our products. If these additional expenses are significant, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We face risks from product liability and other lawsuits, which may adversely affect our business. We have been and expect to continue to be subject to various product liability claims or other lawsuits, including, among others, that our products include inadequate or improper instructions for use or installation, inadequate warnings concerning the effects of the failure of our products, alleged manufacturing or design defects, or allegations that our products contain asbestos. If we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification, damages from these claims would have to be paid from our assets and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Like other manufacturers and distributors of products designed to control and regulate fluids and gases, we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims and other lawsuits in the event that the use of our products results in personal injury, property damage or business interruption to our customers. We cannot be certain that our products will be completely free from defect. In addition, in certain cases, we rely on third-party manufacturers for our products or components of our products. We cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost, or, if available, will be adequate to cover any such liabilities. For more information, see Item 1. Business Product Liability, Environmental and Other Litigation Matters and Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. We face risks from costs for environmental compliance and/or to address potential liabilities under environmental laws and regulations. Our operations and facilities worldwide are subject to laws and regulations related to pollution and the protection of the environment, health and safety, including, but not limited to those governing air emissions, discharges to water, the generation, handling, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous wastes and other materials, and the remediation of contaminated sites. A failure by us to comply with applicable requirements or maintain the permits required for our operations could result in civil or criminal fines, penalties, enforcement actions, third-party claims for property damage and personal injury, requirements to clean up property or to pay for the costs of cleanup or regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures, including the installation of pollution control equipment or remedial actions. Certain environmental laws and regulations impose on present and former owners and operators of facilities and sites, and on potentially responsible parties PRPs for sites to which such parties may have sent waste for disposal, requirements to investigate and remediate contamination. Such liability can be imposed without regard to fault and, under certain circumstances, may be joint and several, resulting in one PRP being held responsible for the entire obligation. Liability may also include damages to natural resources. On occasion we are involved in such investigations and/or cleanup, and also have been and could continue to be named as a PRP in environmental matters. The discovery of additional contamination, including at acquired facilities, the imposition of more stringent environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including cleanup requirements, or the insolvency, or other grounds for refusing to participate, of other responsible parties could require us to incur capital expenditures or operating costs materially in excess of our accruals. Future investigations we undertake may lead to discoveries of contamination that must be remediated, and decisions to close facilities may trigger remediation requirements that are not currently applicable. We may also face liability for alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to hazardous substances used or disposed of by us, contained within our current or former products, or present in the soil or groundwater at our current or former facilities. We could incur significant costs in connection with such liabilities. See Item 1. Business Product Liability, Environmental and Other Litigation Matters and Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, both of which are incorporated herein by reference.

 Climate change, and legislation or regulations addressing climate change, may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations . The impacts of climate change are highly unpredictable and vary depending on geographical location, but could include changing temperatures, droughts, water shortages, wildfires, changes in weather and rainfall patterns, changes in sea levels, and changing storm patterns and intensities. These impacts present several potential challenges to water and energy related products, such as potential degradation of water quality and changes in water conservation or energy efficiency requirements, particularly during periods of increased precipitation, flooding, or water shortages. Inclement weather and extreme weather events may have varying impacts on our business. Certain events may disrupt the operations of our customers, creating customer shutdowns that prevent or defer sales of our product, while other events may drive increased demand for our products, which may create volatility in our financial results. Additionally, these events may disrupt our own operations and the operations of our suppliers, including the operation of manufacturing plants, the transportation of raw materials from our suppliers, and the transportation of products to our customers, any of which may increase our costs, reduce our productivity and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Additionally, concern over climate change may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change, including limitations on greenhouse gas emissions, which could increase our costs or require additional investments in our facilities and equipment, and require us to make significant new disclosures regarding the climate-related impacts of our business. New legislation and regulatory requirements may also impact our customers and suppliers, which could affect demand for our products or our ability to source key materials. In addition, our customers and suppliers may impose their own requirements with respect to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, that may require us to incur additional costs to comply with such requirements. Any failure to comply with those requirements may also affect demand for our products or our ability to source key materials. We establish our own goals with respect to reducing our impact on the environment. Any failure to achieve our own goals, or any perception of a failure to act responsibly with respect to the environment or to effectively respond to regulatory requirements concerning climate change can lead to adverse publicity, resulting in an adverse effect on our business or damage to our reputation. Our ability to achieve savings through our restructuring and business transformation activities may be adversely affected by management s ability to fully execute the plans as a result of local regulations, geo-political risk or other factors within or beyond the control of management. We have implemented a number of restructuring and business transformation activities, which include steps that we believe are necessary to enhance the value and performance of the Company, including reducing operating costs and increasing efficiencies throughout our manufacturing, sales and distribution footprint. Factors within the control of management, or factors beyond management s control such as local labor regulations or legal or political intervention, may change the total estimated costs or the timing of when the savings will be achieved under the plans. Further, if we are not successful in completing the restructuring or business transformation activities timely or if additional or unanticipated issues such as labor disruptions, inability to retain key personnel during and after the transformation or higher exit costs arise, our expected cost savings may not be met and our operating results could be negatively affected. In addition, our restructuring and transformation activities may place substantial demands on our management, which could lead to diversion of management s attention from other business priorities and result in a reduced customer focus. The requirements to evaluate goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment may result in a write-off of all or a portion of our recorded amounts, which would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition. As of December 31, 2022, our balance sheet included goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, amortizable intangible assets and property, plant and equipment of 592.4 million, 35.0 million, 78.7 million and 196.8 million, respectively. In lieu of amortization, we are required to perform an annual impairment review of both goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. In 2022, 2021 and 2020, none of our goodwill reporting units or our indefinite lived tradenames were impaired. We are also required to perform an impairment review of our long-lived assets if indicators of impairment exist. In 2022, we recognized a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of 1.3 million related to a technology intangible asset. In 2020, we recognized a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of 1.4 million related to a long-lived asset and a technology intangible asset. These impairments were due to market value expectations indicating the carrying amounts of these assets were in excess of the fair value. In 2021 none of our long-lived assets were impaired. 
 21 

Table of Contents 
 There can be no assurances that future goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets or other long-lived asset impairments will not occur. We perform our annual test for indications of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or sooner if indicators of impairment exist. The loss or financial instability of major customers could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In 2022, our top ten customers accounted for approximately 22 of our total net sales with no one customer accounting for more than 10 of our total net sales. Our customers generally are not obligated to purchase any minimum volume of products from us and are able to terminate their relationships with us at any time. In addition, increases in the prices of our products could result in a reduction in orders from our customers. A significant reduction in orders from, or change in terms of contracts with, any significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations. Our credit facility may limit our ability to pay dividends, incur additional debt and make acquisitions and other investments. Our revolving credit facility contains operational and financial covenants that restrict our ability to make distributions to stockholders, incur additional debt and make acquisitions and other investments unless we satisfy certain financial tests and comply with various financial ratios. If we do not maintain compliance with these covenants, our creditors could declare a default under our revolving credit facility, and our indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable. Our ability to comply with the provisions of our indebtedness may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions beyond our control. Further, one of our strategies is to increase our revenues and profitability and expand our business through acquisitions. We may require capital in excess of our available cash and the unused portion of our revolving credit facility to make large acquisitions, which we would generally obtain from access to the credit markets. There can be no assurance that if a large acquisition is identified that we would have access to sufficient capital to complete such acquisition. Should we require additional debt financing above our existing credit limit, we cannot be assured such financing would be available to us or available to us on reasonable economic terms Our inability to attract and retain key personnel may adversely affect our business. Our success depends on our ability to recruit, retain and develop highly-skilled management and key personnel. Competition for these individuals in our industry is intense and we may not be able to successfully recruit, train or retain qualified personnel, or to effectively implement successions to existing personnel. If we fail to retain and recruit the necessary personnel or arrange for successors to key personnel, our business could materially suffer. Investment Risk Factors One of our stockholders can exercise substantial influence over our Company. As of December 31, 2022, Timothy P. Horne beneficially owned 5,938,290 shares of Class B common stock. Our Class B common stock entitles its holders to ten votes for each share, and our Class A common stock entitles its holders to one vote per share. As of December 31, 2022, Timothy P. Horne beneficially owned approximately 18.0 of our outstanding shares of Class A common stock (assuming conversion of all shares of Class B common stock beneficially owned by Mr. Horne into Class A common stock) and approximately 99.7 of our outstanding shares of Class B common stock, which represents approximately 68.4 of the total outstanding voting power. As long as Mr. Horne controls shares representing at least a majority of the total voting power of our outstanding stock, Mr. Horne will be able to unilaterally determine the outcome of most stockholder votes, and other stockholders will not be able to affect the outcome of any such votes. Conversion and subsequent sale of a significant number of shares of our Class B common stock could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock. As of December 31, 2022, there were outstanding 27,314,679 shares of our Class A common stock and 5,958,290 shares of our Class B common stock. Shares of our Class B common stock may be converted into Class A common stock at any time on a one for one basis. Under the terms of a registration rights agreement with respect to outstanding shares of our Class B common stock, the holders of our Class B common stock have rights with respect to the registration of the underlying Class A common stock. Under these registration rights, the holders of Class B common stock may require, on 
 22 

Table of Contents 
 up to two occasions that we register their shares for public resale. If we are eligible to use Form S-3 or a similar short-form registration statement, the holders of Class B common stock may require that we register their shares for public resale up to two times per year. If we elect to register any shares of Class A common stock for any public offering, the holders of Class B common stock are entitled to include shares of Class A common stock into which such shares of Class B common stock may be converted in such registration. However, we may reduce the number of shares proposed to be registered in view of market conditions. We will pay all expenses in connection with any registration, other than underwriting discounts and commissions. If all of the available registered shares are sold into the public market the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline. General Risk Factors Changes in regulations or standards could adversely affect our business. Our products and business are subject to a wide variety of statutory, regulatory and industry standards and requirements. A significant change to regulatory requirements, whether federal, foreign, state or local, or to industry standards, could substantially increase manufacturing costs, impact the size and timing of demand for our products, or put us at a competitive disadvantage, any of which could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Our operating results could be negatively affected by changes in tax rates, the adoption of new tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities. As a global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. As a result, our effective rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various places that we operate. Our future taxes could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in the mix of our profitability from country to country, the results of examinations and audits of our tax filings, adjustments to our uncertain tax positions, changes in accounting for income taxes and changes in tax laws. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities, and in evaluating our tax positions. Our tax filings are regularly under audit by tax authorities and the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. In October 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD issued model rules for a new global minimum tax framework. In 2022, several countries have announced the intention to bring these into effect starting from 2024. While the overarching framework has been published, we are awaiting legislation and detailed guidance to assess the full implications. The U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 IRA in August 2022, which, among other provisions, creates a new corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) of at least 15 for certain large corporations that have at least an average of 1 billion in adjusted financial statement income over a consecutive three-year period effective in tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. The IRA also includes a 1 excise tax on new corporate stock repurchases beginning in 2023. We do not expect to meet the CAMT threshold in the near term nor expect the IRA to have a material impact on our financial statements. However, it is possible that the U.S. Congress could advance other tax legislation proposals in the future that could have a material impact on our financial statements and we will continue to evaluate the impact of the IRA as additional information becomes available.

 Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. We are from time to time involved in various legal and administrative proceedings. See Item 1. Business Product Liability, Environmental and Other Litigation Matters, and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. Item 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES. Not applicable. PART II Item 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES. Our Class A common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol WTS. There is no established public trading market for our Class B common stock, which is held by members of the Horne family. The principal holders of such stock are subject to restrictions on transfer with respect to their shares. Each share of our Class B common stock (10 votes per share) is convertible into one share of Class A common stock (1 vote per share). The number of record holders of our Class A common stock as of January 22, 2023 was 61. The number of record holders of our Class B common stock as of January 22, 2023 was 10. Aggregate common stock dividend payments in 2022 were 39.5 million, which consisted of 32.5 million and 7.0 million for Class A shares and Class B shares, respectively. Aggregate common stock dividend payments in 2021 were 34.3 million, which consisted of 28.2 million and 6.1 million for Class A shares and Class B shares, respectively. While we presently intend to continue to pay comparable cash dividends, the payment of future cash dividends depends upon the Board of Directors assessment of our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors. We satisfy the minimum withholding tax obligation due upon the vesting of shares of restricted stock and the conversion of deferred stock awards and restricted stock units into shares of Class A common stock by automatically withholding from the shares being issued a number of shares with an aggregate fair market value on the date of such vesting or conversion that would satisfy the withholding amount due.

Overview We are a leading supplier of products and solutions that manage and conserve the flow of fluids and energy into, through and out of buildings in the commercial, industrial and residential markets in the Americas, Europe and Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa APMEA ). For nearly 150 years, we have designed and produced valve systems that safeguard and regulate water systems, energy efficient heating and hydronic systems, drainage systems and water filtration technology that helps purify and conserve water. We earn revenue and income almost exclusively from the sale of our products. Our principal product categories include: Residential commercial flow control and protection products includes products typically sold into plumbing and hot water applications such as backflow preventers, water pressure regulators, temperature and pressure relief valves, thermostatic mixing valves and leak detection and protection products. Many of our flow control and protection products are now smart and connected warning of leaks and floods with alerts to Business Management Systems (BMS) and/or personal devices giving our customers greater insight into their water management and the ability to shut off the water supply to avoid waste and mitigate damage. HVAC gas products includes commercial high-efficiency boilers, water heaters and heating solutions, hydronic and electric heating systems for under-floor radiant applications, custom heat and hot water solutions, hydronic pump groups for boiler manufacturers and alternative energy control packages, and flexible stainless steel connectors for natural and liquid propane gas in commercial food service and residential applications. Most of our HVAC products feature advanced controls enabling customers to easily connect to the Building Automation System for better monitoring, control and operation. HVAC is an acronym for heating, ventilation and air conditioning. Drainage water re-use products includes drainage products and engineered rain water harvesting solutions for commercial, industrial, marine and residential applications , including connected roof drain systems. Water quality products includes point-of-use and point-of-entry water filtration, monitoring, conditioning and scale prevention systems for commercial, marine and residential applications . Our business is reported in three geographic segments: Americas, Europe, and APMEA. We distribute our products through four primary distribution channels: wholesale, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), specialty, and do-it-yourself (DIY). We believe that the factors relating to our future growth include continued product innovation that meets the needs of our customers and our end markets; our ability to continue to make selective acquisitions, both in our core markets as well as in complementary markets; regulatory requirements relating to the quality and conservation of water and the safe use of water; increased demand for clean water; and continued enforcement of plumbing and building codes. We have completed 12 acquisitions since 2012. Our acquisition strategy focuses on businesses that promote our key macro themes around safety and regulation, energy efficiency and water conservation. We target businesses that will provide us with one or more of the following: an entry into new markets and/or new geographies, improved channel access, unique and/or proprietary technologies, including smart and connected technologies, advanced production capabilities or complementary solution offerings. We believe that sustainability guides and permeates every aspect of our business, including our product development strategy and design, and how we structure our operations. Our innovation strategy is focused on differentiated products and solutions that will provide greater opportunity to distinguish ourselves in the marketplace, while at the same time creating innovative products and smart solutions to protect, control, and conserve critical resources, and help our customers with their sustainability efforts through the use of our products. We continue to migrate away from commoditized products where we cannot add value. Our goal is to be a solutions provider, not merely a components supplier. We continually look for strategic opportunities to invest in new products and markets or divest existing product lines where necessary in order to meet those objectives.

 Over the past several years we have been building our smart and connected foundation by expanding our internal capabilities and making strategic acquisitions. Our strategy is to deliver superior customer value through smart and connected products and solutions. This strategy focuses on three dimensions: Connect, Control and Conserve. We are focused on introducing products that connect our customers with smart systems, control systems for optimal performance, and conserve critical resources by increasing operability, efficiency and safety. Products representing a majority of our sales are subject to regulatory standards and code enforcement, which typically require that these products meet stringent performance criteria. We have consistently advocated for the development and enforcement of such plumbing codes. We are focused on maintaining stringent quality control and testing procedures at each of our manufacturing facilities in order to manufacture products in compliance with code requirements and take advantage of the resulting demand for compliant products. We believe that product development, product testing capability and investment in plant and equipment needed to manufacture products in compliance with code requirements, represent a competitive advantage for us. Market activity levels have generally recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, we experienced some disruptions to our business in China due to government-mandated lockdowns, though these shutdowns and restrictions did not have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial results. We continue to focus on the health and safety of our employees by maintaining health authority and government recommended safety protocols, enabling remote work and hybrid work schedules where feasible, providing personal protective equipment and providing COVID-19 information, which includes the latest CDC and other government protocols and our safety requirements. The global supply chain disruptions have shown signs of easing; however, some logistics issues and electronic component shortages remain. We are experiencing inflation across our cost of materials, labor, transportation, and energy. Labor shortages and workforce disruptions have affected our manufacturing and distribution processes, as well as those of our suppliers. The ongoing war in Ukraine has added strain to the European markets and the global economy, as well as exacerbated inflation, particularly energy inflation. While we believe we were able to effectively manage these disruptions during 2022 by various measures, including raising prices to address cost inflation and taking certain cost reduction actions, we cannot predict how ongoing inflation, risk of recession, the war in Ukraine, supply chain disruptions and related costs may impact our ability to service our customers or the potential impact on our profit margins going forward. We expect that economic conditions in 2023 will be challenging. Higher interest rates and inflation have significantly slowed new residential construction and global GDP is declining, which could impact repair and replacement activity and may reduce the demand for our products. Non-residential new construction may be more resilient, at least through the first half of 2023. Starting in the third quarter of 2022 and continuing into the fourth quarter of 2022 we experienced some channel destocking in Europe. We also saw some destocking In North America in the fourth quarter of 2022 by customers in the residential OEM channel. Our expectation is that it may continue in the first quarter of 2023 and we will monitor this as the year progresses. Despite these anticipated challenges, we continue to invest in our business, including new products, our smart and connected solutions and our growth and productivity initiatives. We remain focused on our customers needs and executing on our long-term strategy. Due to the above circumstances and as described generally in this Form 10-K, our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of future results. Management cannot predict the full impact of the uncertainties discussed above. For further information regarding the impact on the Company, see Item 1A, Risk Factors. Financial Overview We delivered record results for 2022 while facing unprecedented inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions. Net sales for 2022 increased 9.4 , or 170.3 million, on a reported basis and 13.0 , or 235.6 million, on an organic basis, compared to 2021, primarily driven by incremental price across all of our operating segments. The reported sales increase included the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 3.9 , or 71.5 million, primarily driven by the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro and Chinese yuan, and acquired sales of 6.1 million. Organic sales is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. Management believes reporting organic sales growth provides useful information to investors, potential investors and others, because it allows for additional insight into underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. We reconcile the change in organic sales to our reported sales for each region within our results below. Operating income of 315.0 million increased by 75.4 million, or 31.5 , in 2022 compared to 2021.

 This increase was primarily driven by incremental price, savings from productivity and restructuring actions, partially offset by inflation and incremental investments. Management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 can be found in Item 7 of Part II, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Recent Developments On February 6, 2023, we declared a quarterly dividend of thirty cents 0.30) per share on each outstanding share of Class A common stock and Class B common stock payable on March 15, 2023 to stockholders of record on March 1, 2023. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021 Net Sales. Our business is reported in three geographic segments: Americas, Europe and APMEA. Our net sales in each of these segments for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were as follows:

 Organic net sales in Europe increased due to incremental price, with growth in all platforms as well as all major regions. A significant portion of this growth related to HVAC products within the OEM markets in Italy and Germany driven by government energy incentives. Sales growth was negatively impacted by approximately 9 million due to our decision to exit all direct sales into Russia as a result of the war in Ukraine effective April 1, 2022. Organic net sales in APMEA increased primarily due to higher volumes and price, with sales growth in China, Australia, New Zealand and the Middle East. China s sales growth was primarily driven by higher demand for commercial valves within data centers. The net decrease in sales due to foreign exchange was mostly due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro and Chinese yuan in 2022. We cannot predict whether foreign currencies will appreciate or depreciate against the U.S. dollar in future periods or whether future foreign exchange rate fluctuations will have a positive or negative impact on our net sales. The change in net sales due to acquisitions relates to an immaterial acquisition in the Americas segment in the fourth quarter of 2021. Gross Profit. Gross profit and gross profit as a percent of net sales (gross margin) for 2022 and 2021 were as follows: 

Year Ended December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (dollars in millions) Gross profit 874.3 767.1 Gross margin 44.2 42.4 Gross profit and gross margin increased primarily from incremental price, productivity and restructuring savings, partially offset by inflation related to material and labor costs and higher logistic and energy costs. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative, or SG A, expenses increased 42.3 million, or 8.3 , in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase in SG A expenses was attributable to the following: 

(in millions) Change Organic 54.2 10.6 Foreign exchange (15.4) (3.0) Acquired 3.5 0.7 Total 42.3 8.3 The organic increase was primarily due to an increase in investments of 23.0 million, including in our smart and connected and commercial excellence initiatives, general inflation of 15.7 million, increased variable costs due to the higher sales of 14.4 million and an increase in marketing, travel and other normalized spending of 11.2 million compared to 2021. These increases were partially offset by 11.5 million due to productivity initiatives and a decrease in short-term and long-term compensation expense of 6.9 million. The decrease in foreign exchange was mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro. The acquired SG A costs related to an immaterial acquisition in the Americas segment in the fourth quarter of 2021. Total SG A expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 27.8 in 2022 compared to 28.1 in 2021. Restructuring. In 2022, we recorded a net restructuring charge of 10.6 million, which related to a 2021 French restructuring program as well as other actions related to the decommissioning of machinery at one of our facilities in the Americas and cost reduction actions in Europe and the Americas. In 2021, we recorded a net restructuring charge of 19.3 million, primarily for costs related to the 2021 French restructuring program that was approved in the second quarter of 2021. For a more detailed description of our current restructuring plans, see Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report Form 10-K.

These increases were partially offset by inflation related to material and labor costs, higher logistic and energy costs, incremental investments and the return of expenses related to business normalization. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased 0.7 million, or 11.1 , in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to an increase in interest rates, partially offset by a lower principal balance of debt outstanding. Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form10-K for further details. Other expense (income), net. Other expense (income) increased 1.8 million to an expense balance of 1.0 million compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to 1.0 million of additional expense related to the reduction in deferred compensation plan assets. Refer to Note 16 Financial Instruments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form10-K for further details. Income Taxes. Our effective income tax rate decreased to 18.2 in 2022, from 29.2 in 2021. The decrease is primarily due to a 16.1 million tax benefit related to the modification of the structure of our Mexican supply chain operations in 2022, while the initial restructuring of our Mexican supply chain operations in 2021 resulted in a net 7.2 million tax charge. In 2022, we also benefited from the release of tax reserves of 2.5 million due to statute of limitation expirations. Net Income. Net income for 2022 was 251.5 million, or 7.48 per common share on a diluted basis, compared to 165.7 million, or 4.88 per common share on a diluted basis, for 2021. Results for 2022 include an after-tax benefit of 18.2 million, or 0.54 per common share, primarily for an income tax benefit related to the modification of the structure of our Mexican supply chain operations and 1.4 million, or 0.04 per common share, for an after-tax gain on sale of asset; partially offset by an after-tax charge of 7.9 million, or 0.23 per common share, for restructuring. Results for 2021 include an after-tax charge of 14.1 million, or 0.42 per common share, for restructuring and 7.2 million, or 0.22 per common share, for an income tax adjustment related to the restructuring of our Mexican manufacturing supply chain operations.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 2022 and 2021 Cash Flows We generated 224.0 million of net cash from operating activities in 2022 as compared to 180.8 million in 2021. The increase in cash generated was primarily due to higher net income and lower investment in inventory, partially offset by lower accounts payable balances associated with the reduction in inventory purchases and increased payments related to income taxes, restructuring and employee and customer incentives . We used 22.9 million of net cash for investing activities in 2022 compared to 30.7 million used in 2021. We spent 1.3 million more on net capital expenditures and 9.1 million less for acquisitions in 2022 compared to 2021. We used 121.7 million of net cash from financing activities in 2022 primarily due to long-term debt repayments of 80.0 million, dividend payments of 39.5 million, tax withholding payments on vested stock awards of 13.3 million and payments of 69.4 million to repurchase 493,733 shares of Class A common stock. These payments were partially offset by proceeds from drawdowns on our line of credit totaling 85.0 million. In 2021, w e used 118.6 million of net cash from financing activities primarily due to long-term debt repayments of 95.0 million, dividend payments of 34.3 million, tax withholding payments on vested stock awards of 9.6 million and payments of 16.0 million to repurchase approximately 110,000 shares of Class A common stock. These payments were partially offset by proceeds from drawdowns on our line of credit totaling 40.0 million. On March 30, 2021, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement amended the Company s borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement entered into on April 24, 2020 (the Prior Credit Agreement ), to extend the maturity date of the 800 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility from February 12, 2022 to March 30, 2026 (the Revolving Credit Facility ). Among other changes from the Prior Credit Agreement, the Credit Agreement increased our maximum consolidated leverage ratio (including both the base ratio and the ratio permitted during temporary step-ups following certain acquisitions), adjusted certain fees to reflect market conditions and reduced the 1.00 floor on the adjusted London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) to 0.00 . On August 2, 2022, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Agreement (as so amended, the Amended Credit Agreement to replace LIBOR as a reference rate for borrowings with the term secured overnight financing rate Term SOFR ), and to provide for a fixed adjustment of 10 basis points added to Term SOFR Term Benchmark for all Term SOFR borrowings, subject to a 0.00 floor. The Company elected the optional expedient under Accounting Standards Update ASC No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), in connection with amending its credit agreement to replace the reference rate from LIBOR to Term Benchmark to consider the amendment as a continuation of the existing contract without having to perform an assessment that would otherwise be required under U.S. GAAP. The Revolving Credit Facility also includes sub-limits of 100 million for letters of credit and 15 million for swing line loans. As of December 31, 2022, we had drawn down 150.0 million on this line of credit and had 12.1 million in letters of credit outstanding, which resulted in 637.9 million of unused and available credit under the Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to an applicable percentage defined as (i) in the case of Term Benchmark loans, the Term Benchmark rate plus an applicable percentage, ranging from 1.075 to 1.325 , determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio, or (ii) in the case of alternate base rate loans and swing line loans, interest (which at all times will not be less than 1.00 at the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate in effect on such day, (b) the FRBNY Rate in effect on such day plus 0.50 and (c) the Term Benchmark rate plus 1.00 for a one month interest period. The weighted average interest rate on debt outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2022 was 5.35 . The weighted average interest rate on debt outstanding inclusive of the interest rate swap discussed in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and interest rates under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2022 was 3.23 . In addition to paying interest under the Amended Credit Agreement, we are also required to pay certain fees in connection with the Revolving Credit Facility, including, but not limited to, an unused facility fee and letter of credit fees. The Amended Credit Agreement matures on March 30, 2026, subject to extension under certain circumstances and subject to the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement. We may repay loans outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement from time to time without premium or penalty, other than customary breakage costs, if any, and subject to the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement . As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all covenants related to the Amended Credit Agreement.

 As of December 31, 2022, we held 310.8 million in cash and cash equivalents. Of this amount, 221.2 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. Our U.S. operations typically generate sufficient cash flows to meet our domestic obligations. However, if we did have to borrow to fund some or all of our expected cash outlays, we can do so at reasonable interest rates by utilizing the undrawn borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. Subsequent to recording the Toll Tax as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, our intent is to permanently reinvest undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and we do not have any current plans to repatriate post-Toll Tax foreign earnings to fund operations in the United States. However, if amounts held by foreign subsidiaries were needed to fund operations in the United States, we could be required to accrue and pay taxes to repatriate these funds. Such charges may include potential state income taxes and other tax charges. Covenant Compliance Under the Amended Credit Agreement, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios and other financial condition tests as of December 31, 2022. The financial ratios include a consolidated interest coverage ratio based on consolidated earnings before income taxes, interest expense, depreciation, and amortization (Consolidated EBITDA) to consolidated interest expense, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement. The Amended Credit Agreement defines Consolidated EBITDA to exclude unusual or non-recurring charges and gains. We are also required to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of consolidated funded debt to Consolidated EBITDA. Consolidated funded debt, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement, includes all long and short-term debt, finance lease obligations and any trade letters of credit that are outstanding, less cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2022, our actual financial ratios calculated in accordance with the Amended Credit Agreement compared to the required levels under the Amended Credit Agreement were as follows: 

Actual Ratio Required Level Minimum level Interest Charge Coverage Ratio 54.1 to 1.00 3.50 to 1.00 Maximum level Leverage Ratio 0.00 to 1.00 3.50 to 1.00 As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all covenants related to the Amended Credit Agreement. In addition to financial ratios, the Amended Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants that include limitations on disposition or sale of assets, prohibitions on assuming or incurring any liens on assets with limited exceptions and limitations on making investments other than those permitted by the agreement. Working capital (defined as current assets less current liabilities) as of December 31, 2022 was 571.9 million compared to 453.0 million as of December 31, 2021. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.5 to 1 as of December 31, 2022 compared to 2.1 to 1 as of December 31, 2021. The increase in working capital is primarily related to the increase in cash and cash equivalents as a result of increased cash from operating activities. Material Cash Requirements We expect existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations and financing activities to be sufficient to meet our cash needs during 2023 and thereafter for the foreseeable future. We anticipate investing between 40 million to 45 million in capital expenditures during 2023 to improve our manufacturing capabilities and invest in technology and other commercial and operational excellence initiatives. We anticipate spending approximately 6.0 million during 2023 related to various restructuring programs. For a more detailed description of our current restructuring plans, see Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report Form 10-K.

 We intend to continue to repurchase shares of Class A common stock consistent with prior years. The repurchases are executed from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and number of shares repurchased will be determined based on our evaluation of market conditions and other factors, see Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report Form 10-K. While we presently intend to continue to pay comparable quarterly cash dividends on both Class A and B common stock, the payment of future cash dividends depends upon the Board of Directors assessment of our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors. We maintain letters of credit that guarantee our performance or payment to third parties in accordance with specified terms and conditions. Amounts outstanding were approximately 12.1 million as of December 31, 2022 and 14.0 million as of December 31, 2021. Our letters of credit are primarily associated with insurance coverage and, to a lesser extent, foreign purchases and generally expire within one year of issuance. These instruments may exist or expire without being drawn down; therefore, they do not necessarily represent future cash flow obligations. Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2022 are presented in the following table:

 We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In accordance with the SEC s Regulation G and Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K, the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures used by management. We believe that these measures enhance the overall understanding of underlying business results and trends. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measure, but rather as supplemental information to more fully understand our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. Organic net sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of net sales growth that excludes the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from period-over-period comparisons. A reconciliation to the most closely related U.S. GAAP measure, net sales, has been included in our discussion within Results of Operations above. Organic net sales should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to net sales. Management believes reporting organic sales growth provides useful information to investors, potential investors and others, by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods. Adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margins, adjusted net income, and adjusted earnings per share are non-GAAP measures that exclude certain expenses incurred and benefits recognized in the periods presented that relate primarily to our global restructuring programs, gain on sale of asset, and the related income tax impacts on these items and other tax adjustments. Management believes reporting these financial measures provides useful information to investors, potential investors and others, by facilitating easier comparisons of our performance with prior and future periods.

Therefore, it should not be considered an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities as an indication of our performance. The cash conversion rate of free cash flow to net income is also a measure of our performance in cash flow generation. We believe free cash flow to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating performance because it provides investors with a measure of our ability to generate cash, repay debt, pay dividends, repurchase stock and fund acquisitions. A reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow and calculation of our cash conversion rate is provided below: 

Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 (in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities 224.0 180.8 Less: additions to property, plant, and equipment (28.1) (26.7) Plus: proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment 5.2 5.1 Free cash flow 201.1 159.2 Net income as reported 251.5 165.7 Cash conversion rate of free cash flow to net income 80.0 96.1

 Our free cash flow increased in 2022 when compared to 2021 primarily driven by higher net income and lower investment in inventory, partially offset by lower accounts payable balances associated with the reduction in inventory purchases and increased payments related to income taxes, restructuring and employee and customer incentives . Our net debt to capitalization ratio, a non-GAAP financial measure used by management, at December 31, 2022 was (14.3) for 2022 compared to (9.3) in 2021. The change was driven by an increase in net cash of 68.8 million, partially offset by an increase in debt outstanding of 5.7 million at December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021. Management believes the net debt to capitalization ratio is an appropriate supplemental measure because it helps investors understand our ability to meet our financing needs and serves as a basis to evaluate our financial structure. Our computation may not be comparable to other companies that may define their net debt to capitalization ratios differently. A reconciliation of long-term debt (including current portion) to net debt and our net debt to capitalization ratio is provided below:

A critical accounting estimate is an assumption about highly uncertain matters and could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements if another, also reasonable, amount were used, or, a change in the estimate is reasonably likely from period to period. We base our assumptions on historical experience and on other estimates that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. There were no significant changes in our accounting policies or significant changes in our accounting estimates during 2022. We periodically discuss the development, selection and disclosure of the estimates with our Audit Committee. Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions. Revenue recognition We recognize revenue under the core principle to depict the transfer of control to our customers in an amount reflecting the consideration to which we expect to be entitled. In order to achieve that core principle, we apply the following five-step approach: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied. When determining the transaction price of each contract, we consider contractual consideration payable by the customer and assess variable consideration that may affect the total transaction price. Variable consideration, consisting of early payment discounts, rebates and other sources of price variability, are included in the estimated transaction price based on both customer-specific information as well as historical experience. We regularly review our estimates of variable consideration on the transaction price and recognize changes in 
 38 

Table of Contents 
 estimates on a cumulative catch-up basis as if the most current estimate of the transaction price adjusted for variable consideration had been known as of the inception of the contract. Our revenue for product sales is recognized on a point in time model, at the point control transfers to the customer, which is generally when products are shipped from the Company s manufacturing or distribution facilities or when delivered to the customer s named location. Sales tax, value-added tax, or other taxes collected concurrent with revenue producing activities are excluded from revenue. Freight costs billed to customers for shipping and handling activities are included in revenue with the related cost included in selling, general and administrative expenses. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further disclosures and detail regarding revenue recognition. Inventory valuation Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with costs determined primarily on a first-in first-out basis. We evaluate the need to record adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory at least quarterly. We utilize both specific product identification and historical product demand as the basis for estimating our excess or obsolete inventory reserve. We identify all inventories that exceed a range of one to three years in sales to calculate inventory on hand that exceeds estimated demand. This is determined by comparing the current inventory balance against unit sales for the trailing twelve months. New products added to inventory within the past twelve months are excluded from this analysis. A portion of our products contain recoverable materials, therefore the excess and obsolete reserve is established net of any estimated recoverable amounts based on historical experience. Changes in market conditions, lower-than- expected customer demand or changes in technology or features could result in additional excess or obsolete inventory that is not saleable and could require additional inventory reserve provisions. In certain countries, additional inventory reserves are maintained for potential shrinkage experienced in the manufacturing process. The reserve is established based on the prior year s inventory losses adjusted for any change in the gross inventory balance. Goodwill and other intangibles We have made numerous acquisitions over the years and have recognized a significant amount of goodwill. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit when a quantitative analysis is performed. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using an income approach based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, and when appropriate, guideline public company and guideline transaction market approaches. Accounting guidance allows us to assess goodwill for impairment utilizing either qualitative or quantitative analyses. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then performing the quantitative impairment test is unnecessary. We first identify those reporting units that we believe could pass a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. For each reporting unit identified, our qualitative analysis includes: 1) A review of the most recent fair value calculation to identify the extent of the cushion between fair value and carrying amount, to determine if a substantial cushion existed. 2) A review of events and circumstances that have occurred since the most recent fair value calculation to determine if those events or circumstances would have affected our previous fair value assessment. Items identified and reviewed include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market changes, cost factor changes, events that affect the reporting unit, and financial performance against expectations. We then compile this information and make our assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we determine it is not more likely than not, then no further quantitative analysis is required. 
 39 

Table of Contents 
 In 2022, we had seven reporting units. One of these reporting units, Water Quality, had no goodwill. We performed a qualitative analysis for each of the six remaining reporting units, which include Bl cher, US Drains, Fluid Solutions-Europe, Fluid Solutions-Americas, Heating and Hot Water Solutions HHWS and APMEA. As of our October 23, 2022 testing date, we had 581.2 million of goodwill on our balance sheet. As a result of our qualitative analyses, we determined that the fair values of the six reporting units noted above were more likely than not greater than the carrying amounts. In 2022, we did not need to proceed beyond the qualitative analysis, and no goodwill impairments were recorded. Changes in macroeconomic, industry or market conditions, or our inability to achieve projected results that were used to complete the qualitative analyses could result in the reporting unit fair value not exceeding the carrying amounts and could lead to impairment. Intangible assets such as trademarks and trade names are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition and we have recorded certain trademarks and trade names as indefinite-lived intangible assets. Values assigned to intangible assets are typically determined by an independent valuation firm based on our estimates and judgments regarding expectations of the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. Accounting guidance allows us to perform a qualitative impairment assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets consistent with the goodwill guidance noted previously. For our 2022 impairment assessment, which occurred as of October 23, 2022, we performed a qualitative assessment for all trademarks and tradenames as each intangible asset s fair value significantly exceeded the carrying value in the previous quantitative assessment performed and each had sales growth in 2022, and no other indicators of impairment were present. The majority of the trademarks and tradenames are expected to have sales growth in 2023, with a few expected to potentially have minimal sales decline in 2023 but sales growth in 2024. As a result of our qualitative analyses, we determined that the fair values of the indefinite-lived intangibles assets were more likely than not greater than the carrying amounts. If we were to perform a quantitative assessment, the methodology we employ is the relief from royalty method, a subset of the income approach. During 2022, 2021, and 2020, no impairment was recognized on our indefinite-lived intangible assets. Changes in macroeconomic, industry or market conditions, or our inability to achieve projected results that were used to complete the qualitative analyses could result in the trademark s or trade name s fair value not exceeding its carrying amount and could lead to impairment. Product liability Because of retention requirements associated with our insurance policies, we are generally self-insured for potential product liability claims. We are subject to a variety of potential liabilities in connection with product liability cases, and for our most significant volume of liability matters, we maintain a high self-insured retention limit within our product liability and general liability coverage, which we believe to be generally in accordance with industry practices. We maintain excess liability insurance to minimize our risks related to claims in excess of our primary insurance policies. The product liability accrual is established after considering any applicable insurance coverage. For our product liability cases in the U.S., we establish a product liability accrual, which includes estimated legal costs associated with accrued claims. For our most significant volume of liability matters, we utilize third-party actuarial valuations which incorporate historical trend factors including, but not limited to, claim frequency and loss severity, and our specific claims experience derived from loss reports provided by third-party claims administrators to establish our product liability accrual. The product liability accrual represents the estimated ultimate losses for all reported and incurred but not reported claims. For the remainder of our product liability accrual, where we do not utilize third-party actuarial valuations, we maintain insurance and calculate potential product liability accruals which includes legal costs associated with the accrued claims on a case by case basis. Changes in the nature and volume of product liability claims, legal costs, or the actual settlement amounts could affect the adequacy of the estimates and require changes to the accrual. Because the liability is an estimate, the ultimate liability may be more or less than reported. Any material change in the aforementioned factors could have an adverse impact on our operating results for any particular period depending, in part, upon the operating results for such period. Legal contingencies We are a defendant in numerous legal matters including those involving environmental issues and product liability as discussed in more detail in Part I, Item 1. Business Product Liability, Environmental and Other Litigation Matters and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As required by GAAP, we determine whether an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and the loss amount can be reasonably estimated. When it is possible to estimate reasonably possible 
 40 

Table of Contents 
 loss or range of loss above the amount accrued, that estimate is aggregated and disclosed. Estimates of potential outcomes of these contingencies are often developed in consultation with outside counsel. While this assessment is based upon all available information, litigation is inherently uncertain and the actual liability to fully resolve litigation cannot be predicted with any assurance of accuracy. In the event of an unfavorable outcome in one or more legal matters, the ultimate liability may be in excess of amounts currently accrued, if any, and may be material to our operating results or cash flows for a particular quarterly or annual period. However, based on information currently known to us, management believes that the ultimate outcome of all legal contingencies, as they are resolved over time, is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Income taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. We estimate and use our expected annual effective income tax rates to accrue income taxes. Effective tax rates are determined based on budgeted earnings before taxes, including our best estimate of permanent items that will affect the effective rate for the year. Management periodically reviews these rates with outside tax advisors and changes are made if material variances from expectations are identified. Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We consider estimated future taxable income, future reversals of the deferred tax liabilities, and tax planning strategies, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. Changes in the relevant facts, including the accuracy of our estimated future taxable income, can significantly impact the judgment or need for valuation allowances. In the event we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. As of December 31, 2021, we released 22.1 million of our valuation allowance on foreign tax credits related to the additional foreign source income resulting from our restructured Mexican manufacturing supply chain operations. As of December 31, 2022, there were no material adjustments to our valuation allowances. See Note 9 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for further disclosures. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. We use derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and costs of certain raw materials used in the manufacturing process. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. As a matter of policy, all derivative positions are used to reduce risk by hedging underlying economic exposure. The derivatives we use are instruments with liquid markets. See Note 16 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. Our consolidated earnings, which are reported in United States dollars, are subject to translation risks due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This risk is concentrated in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro; the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar; and the U.S. dollar and the Chinese yuan. Our non-U.S. subsidiaries transact most business, including certain intercompany transactions, in foreign currencies. Such transactions are principally purchases or sales of materials and are denominated in European currencies, the Chinese yuan or the U.S. or Canadian dollar. We use foreign currency forward exchange contracts from time to time to manage the risk related to intercompany loans, intercompany purchases and intercompany sales that occur during the course of a year, and certain open foreign currency denominated commitments to sell products to third parties. We have entered into forward exchange contracts which hedge approximately 80 to 85 of the forecasted intercompany 
 41 

Table of Contents 
 purchases between one of our Canadian subsidiaries and our U.S. operating subsidiaries for the next twelve months. We also entered into forward exchange contracts which hedge up to 60 of the forecasted intercompany sales transactions between one of our Chinese subsidiaries and one of our U.S. operating subsidiaries for the next twelve months. We record the effective portion of the designated foreign currency hedge contracts in other comprehensive income until inventory turns and is sold to a third-party. Once the third-party transaction associated with the hedged forecasted transaction occurs, the effective portion of any related gain or loss on the designated foreign currency hedge is reclassified into cost of goods sold within earnings. The fair value of our designated foreign hedge contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2022 was an asset of 0.2 million. Under the Amended Credit Agreement, our earnings and cash flows are exposed to fluctuations in interest payments related to our floating rate debt. In order to manage our exposure, we entered into an interest rate swap on March 30, 2021. Under the interest rate swap agreement, we received the one-month USD-LIBOR subject to a 0.00 floor and paid a fixed rate of 1.02975 on a notional amount of 100.0 million. On August 2, 2022, the Company amended the interest rate swap to replace LIBOR as a reference rate for borrowings with Term SOFR. Under the amended interest rate swap agreement, the Company receives the one-month Term SOFR subject to a -0.1 floor and pays a fixed rate of 0.942 on a notional amount of 100.0 million. The swap matures on March 30, 2026. Information about our long-term debt facility and related interest rates appears in Note 16 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. We purchase significant amounts of bronze ingot, brass rod, cast iron, stainless steel and plastic, which are utilized in manufacturing our many product lines. Our operating results can be adversely affected by changes in commodity prices if we are unable to pass on related price increases to our customers. We manage this risk by monitoring related market prices, working with our suppliers to achieve the maximum level of stability in their costs and related pricing, seeking alternative supply sources when necessary and passing increases in commodity costs to our customers, to the maximum extent possible, when they occur. Item 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA. The financial statements listed in section (a) (1) of Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules of this Annual Report are incorporated herein by reference. Item 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE. None. Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures. The effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures is also necessarily limited by the staff and other resources available to us and the geographic diversity of our operations. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, in that they provided reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and in that such controls are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. The independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Company s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has also audited the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, as stated in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading, Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We will continue to review and document our disclosure controls and procedures, including our internal control over financial reporting, and may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that our systems evolve with our business. Item 9B. OTHER INFORMATION. None. Item 9C. DISCLOSURE REGARDING FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS THAT PREVENT INSPECTIONS. Not applicable.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and Board of Directors Watts Water Technologies, Inc.: Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Watts Water Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement Schedule II - Valuation and Qualifying Accounts (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Basis for Opinions The Company s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the

Table of Contents 
 transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Product liability accrual As discussed in Notes 10 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s product liability accrual as of December 31, 2022 was 22.4 million. The Company is generally self-insured for potential product liability claims. For its most significant volume of liability matters, the Company uses third-party actuarial valuations, which incorporate historical trend factors and its specific claims experience derived from loss reports provided by third-party claims administrators, to establish its product liability accrual. We identified the evaluation of the product liability accrual as a critical audit matter. A high degree of auditor judgment and actuarial professionals with specialized skills and knowledge were required to (1) assess the actuarial methods used, and (2) evaluate the estimated ultimate losses on claims that are based on application of loss development factors to historical claims experience. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls related to the product liability accrual, which included controls over the review of the actuarial valuations and selection of estimated ultimate losses, as well as completeness and accuracy of claims data used in the actuarial valuations. We tested current year claims data used to estimate the product liability accrual by selecting certain claims and comparing them to relevant underlying claim information, including documentation of claim payments. We involved an actuarial professional with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: assessing the actuarial methods used to calculate the product liability accrual for consistency with generally accepted actuarial standard s; assessing the loss development factors by comparing them to historical loss development factors and industry loss development trends; and evaluating the weighting of actuarial methods used to derive ultimate losses .

 2021 France Restructuring Actions On June 25, 2021, the Board of Directors approved a restructuring program with respect to the Company s operating facilities in France, within its Europe operating segment. The restructuring program included the shutdown of the Company s manufacturing facility in M ry, France and the consolidation of that facility s operations primarily into the Company s facilities in Virey-le-Grand and Hautvillers, France. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had incurred all pre-tax restructuring charges related to the program, resulting in total program charges of million. The total charges include costs for employee severance, relocation of equipment, clean-up of the facility and certain asset write-downs, and resulted in the elimination of approximately positions at the M ry, France facility. As a result of the facility consolidation, the net headcount reduction in France was approximately positions. Total net after-tax charges for this restructuring program were approximately million (including approximately million in non-cash charges). The Company spent approximately million in capital expenditures to consolidate operations. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company received cash proceeds from the sale of the manufacturing facility of approximately million and recognized a pre-tax gain on sale of approximately million. Annual cash savings, net of tax, are estimated to be approximately million, which the Company expects to fully realize by 2023.

 OEM Specialty DIY Total For the year ended December 31, 2021 (in millions) Principal Product Category Americas Europe APMEA Consolidated Residential Commercial Flow Control HVAC and Gas Products Drainage and Water Re-use Products Water Quality Products Total The Company generally considers customer purchase orders, which in some cases are governed by master sales agreements, to represent the contract with a customer. The Company s contracts with customers are generally for products only and typically do not include other performance obligations such as professional services, extended warranties, or other material rights. In situations where sales are to a distributor, the Company has concluded that its contracts are with the distributor as the Company holds a contract bearing enforceable rights and obligations only with the distributor. As part of its consideration of the contract, the Company evaluates certain factors including the customer s ability to pay (or credit risk). For each contract, the Company considers the promise to transfer products, each of which is distinct, to be the identified performance obligation. In determining the transaction price, the Company evaluates whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled. As the Company s standard payment terms are less than one year, the Company has elected not to assess whether a contract has a significant financing component. The Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct product based on its relative standalone selling price. The product price as specified on the purchase order is considered the standalone selling price as it is an observable input which depicts the price as if sold to a similar customer in similar circumstances. Revenue is recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer (i.e., when the Company s performance obligation is satisfied), which typically occurs at shipment from the Company s manufacturing site or distribution center, or delivery to the customer s named location. In determining whether control has transferred, the Company considers if there is a present right to payment, physical possession and legal title, along with risks and rewards of ownership having transferred to the customer. In certain circumstances, the Company manufactures customized products without alternative use for its customers. However, as these arrangements do not entitle the Company to a right to payment of cost plus a profit for work completed, the Company has concluded that control transfers at the point in time and not over time. At times, the Company receives orders for products to be delivered over multiple dates that may extend across reporting periods. The Company invoices for each delivery upon shipment and recognizes revenue for each distinct product delivered, assuming transfer of control has occurred. As scheduled delivery dates are within one year, under the optional exemption as provided for under ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers ), revenues allocated to future shipments of partially completed contracts are not disclosed. The Company generally provides an assurance warranty that its products will substantially conform to the published specification. The Company s liability is limited to either a credit equal to the purchase price or replacement of the defective part. Returns under warranty have historically been immaterial. The Company does not consider activities related to such warranty, if any, to be a separate performance obligation. For certain of its products, the Company will separately sell extended warranty and service policies to its customers. The Company considers the sale of these as separate performance obligations. These policies typically are for periods ranging from one to . Payments received are deferred and recognized over the policy period. For all periods presented, the revenue recognized and the revenue deferred under these policies is not material to the consolidated financial statements.

The remaining leases primarily consist of automobiles, machinery and equipment used in the manufacturing processes (e.g., forklifts and pallets), general office equipment and certain service arrangements, each with various lease terms. The Company s automobile leases typically have terms ranging from to . The Company s remaining population of have ranging from to . Certain lease arrangements may contain renewal terms ranging from to . The majority of the Company s real estate, automobile, and equipment leases consist of fixed and variable lease payments. For the Company s real estate leases, variable payments include those for common area maintenance, property taxes, and insurance. For automobile leases, variable payments primarily include maintenance, taxes, and insurance. For equipment leases, variable payments include maintenance and payments based on usage. The Company has elected to account for lease and non-lease components as a single component for all leases. Therefore, all fixed costs within a lease arrangement are included in the fixed lease payments for the single, combined lease component and used to measure the lease liability. Variable lease costs are recognized in the period when the event, activity, or circumstance in the lease agreement occurs. Some of the Company s lease agreements include Company options to either extend and/or early terminate the lease, the costs of which are included in the Company s lease liability to the extent that such options are reasonably certain of being exercised. Renewal options are generally not included in the lease term for the Company s existing leases because the Company is not reasonably certain to exercise these renewal options. The Company does not generally enter into leases involving the construction or design of the underlying asset, and nearly all of the assets the Company leases are not specialized in nature. The Company s leases generally do options for either party to the lease or restrictive financial or other covenants. The Company s lease agreements generally do not include residual value guarantees.

The Company performed a qualitative analysis for each of the remaining reporting units, which include Bl cher, US Drains, Fluid Solutions-Europe, Fluid Solutions-Americas, Heating and Hot Water Solutions (HHWS) and APMEA. As a result of the qualitative analyses, the Company determined that the fair values of the reporting units were more likely than not greater than the carrying amounts. In 2022 and 2021, the Company did not need to proceed beyond the qualitative analysis, and goodwill impairments were recorded.

The Company performs its annual indefinite-lived intangibles impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year. In 2022 and 2021, the Company performed a qualitative assessment for all tradenames. Based on the results of the assessments, the Company did not recognize an impairment on any indefinite-lived intangibles in 2022 or 2021. Intangible assets with estimable lives and other long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment at least quarterly or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of intangible assets with estimable lives and other long-lived assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to future net undiscounted pre-tax cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If these comparisons indicate that an asset is not recoverable, the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the related estimated fair value. Estimated fair value is based on either discounted future pre-tax operating cash flows or appraised values, depending on the nature of the asset. The Company determines the discount rate for this analysis based on the weighted average cost of capital using the market and guideline public companies for the related businesses and does not allocate interest charges to the asset or asset group being measured. Judgment is required to estimate future operating cash flows. In 2022, the Company recognized a million impairment charge for an amortizable technology asset. In 2020, the Company recognized a million impairment charge for a long-lived asset and million impairment charge for an amortizable technology asset. All impairments were recognized within the Americas segment and due to changes in market expectations indicated the carrying amount of these assets were no longer recoverable. In 2021, there were no indications of the carrying amounts of intangible assets with estimable lives not being recoverable.

 Actual income taxes reported are different than what would have been computed by applying the federal statutory tax rate to income before income taxes. The reasons for these differences are as follows: State income taxes, net of federal tax benefit Foreign tax rate differential Restructuring of manufacturing supply chain operations ) Valuation allowance ) GILTI HTE ) Unrecognized tax benefits, net ) ) Other, net ) ) ) In 2020, final tax regulations were released with respect to the GILTI (Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income) tax regime. These regulations permit an exclusion from GILTI for items of foreign income subject to a high effective tax rate, referred to as the GILTI High Tax Exclusion (HTE). Under the new regulations, the Company was allowed to review its GILTI income for the 2018 and 2019 tax years. The Company elected the exclusion for both the 2018 and 2019 tax years resulting in a total tax benefit of million which was recorded in 2020. In 2021, the Company restructured its Mexican manufacturing supply chain operations, which resulted in million in additional tax expense, and was offset by a million release of the valuation allowance on foreign tax credits, for a net tax of million. The additional tax expense was primarily related to the prepayment of future royalties from the new structure, which resulted in current foreign source income. The foreign tax credit benefit significantly offset the additional tax expense resulting from the new supply chain structure. In 2022, to further align the new supply chain structure with developments, the Company modified the restructuring of its Mexican manufacturing supply chain operations which resulted in the recognition of a million deferred tax asset which will be amortized over . At December 31, 2022, the Company had foreign and domestic net operating loss carry forwards of million and million, respectively, for income tax purposes before considering valuation allowances; million of the foreign losses can be carried forward indefinitely, million of the foreign losses expire in 2029, and million of the domestic losses expire between 2035 and 2040 and million of the domestic losses can be carried forward indefinitely. The net operating losses consist of million related to Austrian operations, million related to Switzerland operations and million related to United States operations. At December 31, 2022, the Company had a U.S. capital loss carry forward of million before considering valuation allowances that will expire in 2025. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had foreign tax credit carry forwards of million and million, respectively, for income tax purposes before considering valuation allowances. The foreign tax credit carryforwards expire between 2027 and 2031. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had valuation allowances of million and million, respectively. At December 31, 2022, million related to foreign tax credits, million related to Austrian net operating losses, and million related to the domestic capital loss carry forward. At December 31, 2021, million related to foreign tax credits, million related to Austrian net operating losses, and million related to the domestic capital loss carry forward. Management believes that the ability of the Company to use such foreign tax credits and losses within the applicable carry forward period does not rise to the level of the more likely than not threshold. The Company does not have a valuation allowance on other deferred tax assets, as management believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will recover the net deferred tax assets. Management believes it is more likely than not that the future reversals of the deferred tax liabilities, together with forecasted income, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. Subsequent to recording the Toll Tax as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, after December 2017, the Company considers all of its foreign earnings to be permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. and has no plans to repatriate these foreign earnings to the U.S.

 million, approximately million of which, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. The difference between the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and the amount that would affect the effective tax rate consists of allowable correlative adjustments that are available for certain jurisdictions. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: Increases related to prior year tax positions Increases related to current year tax positions Decreases due to lapse in statutes ) Currency movement ) Balance at December 31, 2022 The Company estimates that it is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2022 may decrease by million to million in the next twelve months, as a result of lapses in statutes of limitations and settlements and million to million of which, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.

The Credit Agreement amended the Company s borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement entered into on April 24, 2020 (the Prior Credit Agreement ), to extend the maturity date of the million senior unsecured revolving credit facility from February 12, 2022 to March 30, 2026 (the Revolving Credit Facility). Among other changes from the Prior Credit Agreement, the Credit Agreement increased the Company s maximum consolidated leverage ratio (including both the base ratio and the ratio permitted during temporary step-ups following certain acquisitions), adjusted certain fees to reflect market conditions and reduced the floor on the adjusted London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) rate to . On August 2, 2022, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Agreement (as so amended, the Amended Credit Agreement) to replace LIBOR as a reference rate for borrowings with the term secured overnight financing rate (Term SOFR), and to provide for a fixed adjustment of basis points added to Term SOFR (Term Benchmark) for all Term SOFR borrowings, subject to a floor. The Company elected the optional expedient under Accounting Standards Update ASC No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), in connection with amending its credit agreement to replace the reference rate from LIBOR to Term Benchmark to consider the amendment as a continuation of the existing contract without having to perform an assessment that would otherwise be required under U.S. GAAP. The Revolving Credit Facility also includes sublimits of million for letters of credit and million for swing line loans. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had drawn down million on this line of credit and had million in letters of credit outstanding, which resulted in million of unused and available credit under the Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to an applicable percentage defined as (i) in the case of Term Benchmark loans, the Term Benchmark rate plus an applicable percentage, ranging from to , determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio, or (ii) in the case of alternate base rate loans and swing line loans, interest (which at all times will not be less than at the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate in effect on such day, (b) the FRBNY Rate in effect on such day plus and (c) the Term Benchmark rate plus for a one month interest period.

The weighted average interest rate on debt outstanding inclusive of the interest rate swap discussed in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and interest rates under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2022 was . In addition to paying interest under the Amended Credit Agreement, the Company is also required to pay certain fees in connection with the Revolving Credit Facility, including, but not limited to, an unused facility fee and letter of credit fees. The Amended Credit Agreement matures on March 30, 2026, subject to extension under certain circumstances and subject to the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement. The Company may repay loans outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement from time to time without premium or penalty, other than customary breakage costs, if any, and subject to the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement.

For the stock repurchase program, the Company enters into Rule 10b5-1 plans, which permit shares to be repurchased when the Company might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time, subject to the terms of the Rule 10b5-1 plans the Company entered into with respect to the repurchase program.

At December 31, 2022, shares of Class A common stock were authorized for future grants of new equity awards under this plan. The Company currently grants shares of deferred stock awards to key employees and stock awards to non-employee members of the Company s Board of Directors under the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan. The Company also previously granted shares of restricted stock to key employees. Stock awards to non-employee members of the Company s Board of Directors vest immediately. Employees restricted stock awards and deferred stock awards typically vest over a period at the rate of one-third per year. The restricted stock awards are outstanding upon grant whereas the deferred stock awards are outstanding upon vesting. The restricted stock awards and deferred stock awards are amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The Company also grants performance stock units to key employees under the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan. Performance stock units cliff vest at the end of a performance period set by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors at the time of grant, which is currently . Upon vesting, the number of shares of the Company s Class A common stock awarded to each performance stock unit recipient will be determined based on the Company s performance relative to certain performance goals set at the time the performance stock units were granted. The recipient of a performance stock unit award may earn from shares to twice the number of target shares awarded to such recipient. The performance stock units are amortized to expense over the vesting period, and based on the Company s performance relative to the performance goals, may be adjusted. Changes to the estimated shares expected to vest will result in adjustments to the related share-based compensation expense that will be recorded in the period of change. If the performance goals are not met, no awards are earned and previously recognized compensation expense is reversed. The Company granted performance stock units in 2022, 2021 and 2020. The performance goals for the performance stock units are based on the compound annual growth rate of the Company s revenue over the performance period and the Company s return on invested capital (ROIC) for the third year of the performance period .

Beginning in 2022, a provision was added that requires the employee remain employed through the last working day of the grant year in addition to the other provisions. In 2015, the Company stopped granting stock options as part of its annual equity awards to employees. Previously under the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan, key employees were granted nonqualified stock options to purchase the Company s Class A common stock. Minimal options remain outstanding, all of which are vested and expire from the date of grant. Options granted under the plan may have exercise prices of not less than of the fair market value of the Class A common stock on the date of grant. The Company s practice was to grant all options at fair market value on the grant date. Upon exercise of options, the Company issues shares of Class A common stock. The Company also has a Management Stock Purchase Plan that allows for the granting of restricted stock units (RSUs) to key employees. On an annual basis, key employees may elect to receive a portion of their annual incentive compensation in RSUs instead of cash. Participating employees may use up to of their annual incentive bonus to purchase RSUs for a purchase price equal to of the fair market value of the Company s Class A common stock as of the date of grant. RSUs vest either annually over a period from the grant date or upon the third anniversary of the grant date. Receipt of the shares underlying RSUs is deferred for a minimum of , or such greater number of years as is chosen by the employee, from the date of grant. An aggregate of shares of Class A common stock may be issued under the Management Stock Purchase Plan.

The expected life (estimated period of time outstanding) of RSUs and volatility were calculated using historical data. The expected dividend yield of stock is the Company s best estimate of the expected future dividend yield. The above assumptions were used to determine the weighted average grant-date fair value of RSUs granted of , and during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

In connection with the immaterial acquisition of Australian Valve Group Pty Ltd (AVG), completed during the third quarter of 2020, and Sentinel Hydrosolutions, LLC (Sentinel), completed during the fourth quarter of 2021, contingent liabilities of million and million, respectively, were recognized as the estimates of the acquisition date fair values of the contingent consideration. During the third quarter of 2022 and second quarter of 2021, the AVG contingent liability was reduced by million and increased by million, respectively, due to adjusted probability of achieving lower or higher performance metrics, and foreign exchange translations. The AVG contingent liability was settled in the fourth quarter of 2022 for million. These liabilities were classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy as they were based on the probability of achievement of future performance metrics as of the respective dates of acquisition, which were not observable in the market. Failure to meet the performance metrics would reduce this liability to , while complete achievement would increase the liability to a maximum contingent consideration. Cash equivalents consist of instruments with remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase and consist primarily of money market funds, for which the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. The Company uses financial instruments from time to time to enhance its ability to manage risk, including foreign currency and commodity pricing exposures, which exist as part of its ongoing business operations. The use of derivatives exposes the Company to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The Company manages its exposure to counterparty credit risk through diversification of counterparties. The Company s counterparties in derivative transactions are substantial commercial banks with significant experience using such derivative instruments. The impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of the Company s derivative instruments is monitored and the Company restricts the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities. The Company does not enter into contracts for trading purposes nor does the Company enter into any contracts for speculative purposes. The use of derivative instruments is approved by senior management under written guidelines.

 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility from February 12, 2022 to March 30, 2026. On August 2, 2022, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Agreement to replace the LIBOR as a reference rate for borrowings with Term SOFR and to provide for a fixed adjustment of basis points added to Term SOFR for all Term SOFR borrowings, subject to a floor. Borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum as further detailed in Note 11. In order to manage the Company s exposure to changes in cash flows attributable to fluctuations in interest payments related to the Company s floating rate debt, the Company entered into an interest rate swap on March 30, 2021. Under the interest rate swap agreement, the Company received the one-month USD-LIBOR subject to a floor and paid a fixed rate of on a notional amount of million. On August 2, 2022, the Company amended the interest rate swap to replace LIBOR as a reference rate for borrowings with Term SOFR. Under the amended interest rate swap agreement, the Company receives the one-month Term SOFR subject to a - floor and pays a fixed rate of on a notional amount of million. The swap matures on March 30, 2026. The Company elected the optional expedient in connection with amending its interest rate swap to replace the reference rate from LIBOR to Term SOFR to consider the amendment as a continuation of the existing contract without having to perform an assessment that would otherwise be required under U.S. GAAP. The Company formally documents the hedge relationships at hedge inception to ensure that its interest rate swaps qualify for hedge accounting. On a quarterly basis, the Company assesses whether the interest rate swap is highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flow of the hedged item. The Company does not hold or issue interest rate swaps for trading purposes. The swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, a net gain of million and million, respectively, was recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss to recognize the effective portion of the fair value of the interest rate swap that qualifies as a cash flow hedge. Designated Foreign Currency Hedges The Company s foreign subsidiaries transact most business, including certain intercompany transactions, in foreign currencies. Such transactions are principally purchases or sales of materials. The Company has exposure to a number of foreign currencies, including the Canadian dollar, the euro, and the Chinese yuan. The Company uses a layering methodology, whereby at the end of each quarter, the Company enters into forward exchange contracts hedging Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar, which hedge up to of the forecasted intercompany purchase transactions between one of the Company s Canadian subsidiaries and the Company s U.S. operating subsidiaries for the next . The Company uses a similar layering methodology when entering into forward exchange contracts hedging U.S. dollar to the Chinese yuan, which hedge up to of the forecasted intercompany sales transactions between one of the Company s Chinese subsidiaries and one of the Company s U.S. operating subsidiaries for the next . As of December 31, 2022, all designated foreign exchange hedge contracts were cash flow hedges under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging . The Company records the effective portion of the designated foreign currency hedge contracts in other comprehensive income until inventory turns and is sold to a third-party. Once the third-party transaction associated with the hedged forecasted transaction occurs, the effective portion of any related gain or loss on the designated foreign currency hedge is reclassified into earnings within cost of goods sold. In the event the notional amount of the derivatives exceeds the forecasted intercompany purchases for a given month, the excess hedge position will be attributed to the following month s forecasted purchases. However, if the following month s forecasted purchases cannot absorb the excess hedge position from the current month, the effective portion of the hedge recorded in other comprehensive income will be reclassified to earnings. The notional amounts outstanding as of December 31, 2022 for the Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar contracts and the U.S. dollar to the Chinese yuan were million and million, respectively. The fair value of the Company s designated foreign hedge contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2022 was an asset of million. As of December 31, 2022, the amount expected to be reclassified into cost of goods sold from other comprehensive income in the next is a gain of million. geographic segments: Americas, Europe, and APMEA.

Exhibit 4 DESCRIPTION OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK General The following is a description of the material terms and provisions of our common stock. It may not contain all the information that is important to you. You can access complete information by referring to our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws. Under our restated certificate of incorporation, we have authority to issue 120,000,000 shares of class A common stock, 0.10 par value per share, and 25,000,000 shares of class B common stock, 0.10 par value per share. As of January 22, 2023, 27,309,838 shares of class A common stock and 5,958,290 shares of class B common stock were issued and outstanding. All shares of common stock will, when issued, be duly authorized, fully paid and nonassessable. Thus, the full price for the outstanding shares of common stock will have been paid at issuance and any holder of our common stock will not be later required to pay us any additional money for such common stock. Dividends Subject to preferential rights of any other class or series of stock, the holders of shares of our class A common stock and our class B common stock are entitled to receive dividends, including dividends of our stock, as and when declared by our board of directors, subject to any limitations applicable by law and to the rights of the holders, if any, of our preferred stock. Whenever we pay any dividends, other than dividends of our stock, on our class A common stock, each share of class B common stock is entitled to receive a dividend at least equal to the dividend paid per share on our class A common stock and vice versa. In the event we are liquidated, dissolved or our affairs are wound up, after we pay or make adequate provision for all of our known debts and liabilities, each holder of class A common stock and class B common stock will receive dividends pro rata out of assets that we can legally use to pay distributions, subject to any rights that are granted to the holders of any class or series of preferred stock. Voting Rights The holders of class A common stock have one vote per share and the holders of class B common stock have ten votes per share. Except as may be required by law and in connection with some significant actions, such as mergers, consolidations or amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation that affect the rights of stockholders, holders of our class A common stock and our class B common stock vote together as a single class. Each share of our class B common stock is convertible into one share of our class A common stock at any time at the holder s option. There is no cumulative voting in the election of our directors, which means that, subject to any rights to elect directors that are granted to the holders of any class or series of preferred stock, a plurality of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders at which a quorum is present is sufficient to elect a director. Other Rights Subject to the preferential rights of any other class or series of stock, all shares of common stock have equal dividend, distribution, liquidation and other rights, and have no preference, appraisal or exchange rights, except for any appraisal rights provided by Delaware law. Furthermore, holders of common stock have no conversion, sinking fund or redemption rights, or preemptive rights to subscribe for any of our securities. Transfer Agent and Registrar The transfer agent for our class A common stock is Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, Inc. The transfer agent for our class B common stock is Flowers and Manning, LLP.

Exhibit 10.8 INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT This Agreement made and entered into this ___ day of ________ ____, (the Agreement ), by and between Watts Water Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company, which term shall include, where appropriate, any Entity (as hereinafter defined) controlled directly or indirectly by the Company) and ____________ (the Indemnitee ): WHEREAS, it is essential to the Company that it be able to retain and attract as directors and officers the most capable persons available; WHEREAS, increased corporate litigation has subjected directors and officers to litigation risks and expenses, and the limitations on the availability of directors and officers liability insurance have made it increasingly difficult for the Company to attract and retain such persons; WHEREAS, the Company s Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws (the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws, respectively) require it to indemnify its directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by law and permit it to make other indemnification arrangements and agreements; WHEREAS, the Company desires to provide Indemnitee with specific contractual assurance of Indemnitee s rights to full indemnification against litigation risks and expenses (regardless, among other things, of any amendment to or revocation of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws or any change in the ownership of the Company or the composition of its Board of Directors); WHEREAS, the Company intends that this Agreement provide Indemnitee with greater protection than that which is provided by the Company s Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws; and WHEREAS, Indemnitee is relying upon the rights afforded under this Agreement in continuing as a director or officer of the Company. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and the covenants contained herein, the Company and Indemnitee do hereby covenant and agree as follows: 1. Definitions . (a) Corporate Status describes the status of a person who is serving or has served (i) as a director or officer of the Company, (ii) in any capacity with respect to any employee benefit plan of the Company, or (iii) as a director, partner, trustee, officer, employee, or agent of any other Entity at the request of the Company. For purposes of subsection (iii) of this Section 1(a), if Indemnitee is serving or has served as a director, partner, trustee, officer, employee or agent of a Subsidiary, Indemnitee shall be deemed to be serving at the request of the Company. (b) Entity shall mean any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, foundation, association, organization or other legal entity. (c) Expenses shall mean all fees, costs and expenses incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding (as defined below), including, without limitation, attorneys fees, disbursements and retainers (including, without limitation, any such fees, disbursements and retainers incurred by Indemnitee pursuant to Sections 10 and 11(c) of this Agreement), fees and disbursements of expert witnesses, private investigators and professional advisors (including, 

 without limitation, accountants and investment bankers), court costs, transcript costs, fees of experts, travel expenses, duplicating, printing and binding costs, telephone and fax transmission charges, postage, delivery services, secretarial services, and other disbursements and expenses. (d) Indemnifiable Expenses, Indemnifiable Liabilities and Indemnifiable Amounts shall have the meanings ascribed to those terms in Section 3(a) below. (e) Liabilities shall mean judgments, damages, liabilities, losses, penalties, excise taxes, fines and amounts paid in settlement. (f) Proceeding shall mean any threatened, pending or completed claim, action, suit, arbitration, alternate dispute resolution process, investigation, administrative hearing, appeal, or any other proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, arbitrative or investigative, whether formal or informal, including a proceeding initiated by Indemnitee pursuant to Section 10 of this Agreement to enforce Indemnitee s rights hereunder. (g) Subsidiary shall mean any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or other Entity of which the Company owns (either directly or through or together with another Subsidiary of the Company) either (i) a general partner, managing member or other similar interest or (ii) (A) 50 or more of the voting power of the voting capital equity interests of such corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture or other Entity, or (B) 50 or more of the outstanding voting capital stock or other voting equity interests of such corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture or other Entity. 2. Services of Indemnitee . In consideration of the Company s covenants and commitments hereunder, Indemnitee agrees to serve or continue to serve as a director and/or officer of the Company. However, this Agreement shall not impose any obligation on Indemnitee or the Company to continue Indemnitee s service to the Company beyond any period otherwise required by law or by other agreements or commitments of the parties, if any. 3. Agreement to Indemnify . The Company agrees to indemnify Indemnitee as follows: (a) Proceedings Other Than By or In the Right of the Company . Subject to the exceptions contained in Section 4(a) below, if Indemnitee was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any Proceeding (other than an action by or in the right of the Company) by reason of Indemnitee s Corporate Status, Indemnitee shall be indemnified by the Company against all Expenses and Liabilities incurred or paid by Indemnitee in connection with such Proceeding (referred to herein as Indemnifiable Expenses and Indemnifiable Liabilities, respectively, and collectively as Indemnifiable Amounts ). (b) Proceedings By or In the Right of the Company . Subject to the exceptions contained in Section 4(b) below, if Indemnitee was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any Proceeding by or in the right of the Company by reason of Indemnitee s Corporate Status, Indemnitee shall be indemnified by the Company against all Indemnifiable Expenses. (c) Conclusive Presumption Regarding Standard of Care . In making any determination required to be made under Delaware law with respect to entitlement to indemnification hereunder, the person, persons or entity making such determination shall presume that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement if Indemnitee submitted a request therefor in accordance with Section 5 of this Agreement, and the Company shall have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption in connection with the making by any person, persons or entity of any determination contrary to that presumption. 

 4. Exceptions to Indemnification . Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification under Sections 3(a) and 3(b) above in all circumstances other than with respect to any specific claim, issue or matter involved in the Proceeding out of which Indemnitee s claim for indemnification has arisen, as follows: (a) Proceedings Other Than By or In the Right of the Company . If indemnification is requested under Section 3(a) and it has been finally adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction that, in connection with such specific claim, issue or matter, Indemnitee failed to act (i) in good faith and (ii) in a manner Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, or, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that Indemnitee s conduct was unlawful, Indemnitee shall not be entitled to payment of Indemnifiable Amounts hereunder. (b) Proceedings By or In the Right of the Company . If indemnification is requested under Section 3(b) and (i) it has been finally adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction that, in connection with such specific claim, issue or matter, Indemnitee failed to act (A) in good faith and (B) in a manner Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, Indemnitee shall not be entitled to payment of Indemnifiable Expenses hereunder; or (ii) it has been finally adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction that Indemnitee is liable to the Company with respect to such specific claim, Indemnitee shall not be entitled to payment of Indemnifiable Expenses hereunder with respect to such claim, issue or matter unless the Court of Chancery or another court in which such Proceeding was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability, but in view of all the circumstances of the case, Indemnitee is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification for such Indemnifiable Expenses which such court shall deem proper; or (iii) it has been finally adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction that Indemnitee is liable to the Company for an accounting of profits made from the purchase or sale by the Indemnitee of securities of the Company pursuant to the provisions of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and amendments thereto or similar provisions of any federal, state or local statutory law, Indemnitee shall not be entitled to payment of Indemnifiable Expenses hereunder. (c) Insurance Proceeds . To the extent payment is actually made to the Indemnitee under a valid and collectible insurance policy in respect of Indemnifiable Amounts in connection with such specific claim, issue or matter, Indemnitee shall not be entitled to payment of Indemnifiable Amounts hereunder except in respect of any excess beyond the amount of payment under such insurance. 

 5. Procedure for Payment of Indemnifiable Amounts . Indemnitee shall submit to the Company a written request specifying the Indemnifiable Amounts for which Indemnitee seeks payment under Section 3 of this Agreement and the basis for the claim. The Company shall pay such Indemnifiable Amounts to Indemnitee within sixty (60) calendar days of receipt of the request. At the request of the Company, Indemnitee shall furnish such documentation and information as are reasonably available to Indemnitee and necessary to establish that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification hereunder. 6. Indemnification for Expenses of a Party Who is Wholly or Partly Successful . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, and without limiting any such provision, to the extent that Indemnitee is, by reason of Indemnitee s Corporate Status, a party to and is successful, on the merits or otherwise, in any Proceeding, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee s behalf in connection therewith. If Indemnitee is not wholly successful in such Proceeding but is successful, on the merits or otherwise, as to one or more but less than all claims, issues or matters in such Proceeding, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against all Expenses reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee s behalf in connection with each successfully resolved claim, issue or matter. For purposes of this Agreement, the termination of any claim, issue or matter in such a Proceeding by dismissal, with or without prejudice, by reason of settlement, judgment, order or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a successful result as to such claim, issue or matter. 7. Effect of Certain Resolutions . Neither the settlement or termination of any Proceeding nor the failure of the Company to award indemnification or to determine that indemnification is payable shall create a presumption that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification hereunder. In addition, the termination of any proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not create a presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company or, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that Indemnitee s action was unlawful. 8. Agreement to Advance Expenses; Undertaking . The Company shall advance all Expenses incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding, including a Proceeding by or in the right of the Company, in which Indemnitee is involved by reason of such Indemnitee s Corporate Status within ten (10) calendar days after the receipt by the Company of a written statement from Indemnitee requesting such advance or advances from time to time, whether prior to or after final disposition of such Proceeding. To the extent required by Delaware law, Indemnitee hereby undertakes to repay any and all of the amount of Indemnifiable Expenses paid to Indemnitee if it is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that Indemnitee is not entitled under this Agreement to indemnification with respect to such Expenses. This undertaking is an unlimited general obligation of Indemnitee. 9. Procedure for Advance Payment of Expenses . Indemnitee shall submit to the Company a written request specifying the Indemnifiable Expenses for which Indemnitee seeks an advancement under Section 8 of this Agreement, together with documentation evidencing that Indemnitee has incurred such Indemnifiable Expenses. Payment of Indemnifiable Expenses under Section 8 shall be made no later than ten (10) calendar days after the Company s receipt of such request. 

 10. Remedies of Indemnitee . (a) Right to Petition Court . In the event that Indemnitee makes a request for payment of Indemnifiable Amounts under Sections 3 and 5 above or a request for an advancement of Indemnifiable Expenses under Sections 8 and 9 above and the Company fails to make such payment or advancement in a timely manner pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, Indemnitee may petition the Court of Chancery to enforce the Company s obligations under this Agreement. (b) Burden of Proof . In any judicial proceeding brought under Section 10(a) above, the Company shall have the burden of proving that Indemnitee is not entitled to payment of Indemnifiable Amounts hereunder. (c) Expenses . The Company agrees to reimburse Indemnitee in full for any Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in connection with investigating, preparing for, litigating, defending or settling any action brought by Indemnitee under Section 10(a) above, or in connection with any claim or counterclaim brought by the Company in connection therewith, whether or not Indemnitee is successful in whole or in part in connection with any such action. (d) Failure to Act Not a Defense . The failure of the Company (including its Board of Directors or any committee thereof, independent legal counsel, or stockholders) to make a determination concerning the permissibility of the payment of Indemnifiable Amounts or the advancement of Indemnifiable Expenses under this Agreement shall not be a defense in any action brought under Section 10(a) above, and shall not create a presumption that such payment or advancement is not permissible. 11. Defense of the Underlying Proceeding . (a) Notice by Indemnitee . Indemnitee agrees to notify the Company promptly upon being served with any summons, citation, subpoena, complaint, indictment, information, or other document relating to any Proceeding which may result in the payment of Indemnifiable Amounts or the advancement of Indemnifiable Expenses hereunder; provided, however, that the failure to give any such notice shall not disqualify Indemnitee from the right, or otherwise affect in any manner any right of Indemnitee, to receive payments of Indemnifiable Amounts or advancements of Indemnifiable Expenses unless the Company s ability to defend in such Proceeding is materially and adversely prejudiced thereby. 

 (b) Defense by Company . Subject to the provisions of the last sentence of this Section 11(b) and of Section 11(c) below, the Company shall have the right to defend Indemnitee in any Proceeding which may give rise to the payment of Indemnifiable Amounts hereunder; provided, however that the Company shall notify Indemnitee of any such decision to defend within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of notice of any such Proceeding under Section 11(a) above. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Indemnitee, consent to the entry of any judgment against Indemnitee or enter into any settlement or compromise which (i) includes an admission of fault of Indemnitee or (ii) does not include, as an unconditional term thereof, the full release of Indemnitee from all liability in respect of such Proceeding, which release shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Indemnitee. This Section 11(b) shall not apply to a Proceeding brought by Indemnitee under Section 10(a) above or pursuant to Section 19 below. (c) Indemnitee s Right to Counsel . Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 11(b) above, if in a Proceeding to which Indemnitee is a party by reason of Indemnitee s Corporate Status, (i) Indemnitee reasonably concludes that he or she may have separate defenses or counterclaims to assert with respect to any issue which may not be consistent with the position of other defendants in such Proceeding, (ii) a conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest exists between Indemnitee and the Company, or (iii) if the Company fails to assume the defense of such proceeding in a timely manner, Indemnitee shall be entitled to be represented by separate legal counsel of Indemnitee s choice at the expense of the Company. In addition, if the Company fails to comply with any of its obligations under this Agreement or in the event that the Company or any other person takes any action to declare this Agreement void or unenforceable, or institutes any action, suit or proceeding to deny or to recover from Indemnitee the benefits intended to be provided to Indemnitee hereunder, Indemnitee shall have the right to retain counsel of Indemnitee s choice, at the expense of the Company, to represent Indemnitee in connection with any such matter. 12. Representations and Warranties of the Company . The Company hereby represents and warrants to Indemnitee as follows: (a) Authority . The Company has all necessary power and authority to enter into, and be bound by the terms of, this Agreement, and the execution, delivery and performance of the undertakings contemplated by this Agreement have been duly authorized by the Company. (b) Enforceability . This Agreement, when executed and delivered by the Company in accordance with the provisions hereof, shall be a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally. 

 13. Insurance . For a period of six (6) years following the date on which Indemnitee no longer serves as a director, officer or employee of the Company or any Subsidiary, and for such longer period, if any, for which Indemnitee may be subject to a Proceeding by reason of Indemnitee s Corporate Status, the Company (i) shall maintain a policy or policies of insurance with one or more reputable insurance companies providing the Indemnitee with coverage in an amount not less than, and of a type and scope not materially less favorable to Indemnitee than, the directors and officers liability insurance coverage presently maintained by the Company, (ii) shall pay on a timely basis all premiums on such insurance and (iii) shall provide such notices and renewals in a complete and timely manner and take such other actions as may be required in order to keep such insurance in full force and effect. In all policies of director and officer liability insurance, Indemnitee shall be named as an insured in such a manner as to provide Indemnitee the same rights and benefits as are accorded to the most favorably insured of the Company s officers and directors. 14. Contract Rights Not Exclusive . The rights to payment of Indemnifiable Amounts and advancement of Indemnifiable Expenses provided by this Agreement shall be in addition to, but not exclusive of, any other rights which Indemnitee may have at any time under applicable law, the Company s Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws, or any other agreement, vote of stockholders or directors (or a committee of directors), or otherwise, both as to action in Indemnitee s official capacity and as to action in any other capacity as a result of Indemnitee s serving as a director or officer of the Company. 15. Successors . This Agreement shall be (a) binding upon all successors and assigns of the Company (including any transferee of all or a substantial portion of the business, stock and/or assets of the Company and any direct or indirect successor by merger or consolidation or otherwise by operation of law) and (b) binding on and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, personal representatives, executors and administrators of Indemnitee. In the event that the Company or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person or entity, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Company assume the obligations of the Company under this Agreement. This Agreement shall continue for the benefit of Indemnitee and such heirs, personal representatives, executors and administrators after Indemnitee has ceased to have Corporate Status. 16. Subrogation . In the event of any payment of Indemnifiable Amounts under this Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of contribution or recovery of Indemnitee against other persons, and Indemnitee shall take, at the request of the Company, all reasonable action necessary to secure such rights, including the execution of such documents as are necessary to enable the Company to bring suit to enforce such rights. 17. Change in Law . To the extent that a change in Delaware law (whether by statute or judicial decision) shall permit broader indemnification or advancement of expenses than is provided under the terms of the By-laws and this Agreement, Indemnitee shall be entitled to such broader indemnification and advancements, and this Agreement shall be deemed to be amended to such extent. 18. Severability . Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement, or any clause thereof, shall be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, such provision or clause shall be limited or modified in its application to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision or clause valid, legal and enforceable, and the remaining provisions and clauses of this Agreement shall remain fully enforceable and binding on the parties. 

 19. Indemnitee as Plaintiff . Except as provided in Section 10(c) of this Agreement and in the next sentence, Indemnitee shall not be entitled to payment of Indemnifiable Amounts or advancement of Indemnifiable Expenses with respect to any Proceeding brought by Indemnitee against the Company, any Entity which it controls, any director or officer thereof, or any third party, unless the Board of Directors of the Company has consented to the initiation of such Proceeding. This Section shall not apply to counterclaims or affirmative defenses asserted by Indemnitee in an action brought against Indemnitee. 20. Modifications and Waiver . Except as provided in Section 17 above with respect to changes in Delaware law which broaden the right of Indemnitee to be indemnified by the Company, no supplement, modification or amendment of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by each of the parties hereto. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provisions of this Agreement (whether or not similar), nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver. 21. General Notices . All notices, requests, demands and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given (a) when delivered by hand, (b) when transmitted by facsimile and receipt is acknowledged, or (c) if mailed by certified or registered mail with postage prepaid, on the third business day after the date on which it is so mailed:

Exhibit 10.18 WATTS WATER TECHNOLOGIES, INC. EXECUTIVE SEVERANCE PLAN (As Amended and Restated Effective February 8, 2018) 

 WATTS WATER TECHNOLOGIES, INC. EXECUTIVE SEVERANCE PLAN (As Amended and Restated Effective February 8, 2018) ARTICLE I PURPOSE This Watts Water Technologies, Inc. Executive Severance Plan (the Plan provides severance benefits to Eligible Executives upon certain terminations of employment. The Plan was originally effective June 1, 2014 and was amended and restated in its current form effective as of February 8, 2018. The Plan is intended (1) to be exempt from Code section 409A, and (2) to be a welfare plan which is unfunded and is maintained by an employer for the purpose of providing benefits for a select group of management or highly compensated employees within the meaning of Department of Labor Regulation section 2520.104-24. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, this Plan shall be interpreted, operated and administered in a manner consistent with these intentions. ARTICLE II DEFINED TERMS Whenever used in the Plan, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below: Cause shall mean (a) an act constituting a felony; (b) fraud or dishonesty that results in or is likely to result in economic damage to the Company; or (c) willful misconduct in the performance of duties. Change in Control shall mean the consummation of (a) the dissolution or liquidation of the Company, (b) the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company on a consolidated basis to an unrelated person or entity, (c) a merger, reorganization, consolidation or business combination (whether directly involving the Company or indirectly involving the Company through one or more intermediaries) which results in (i) the beneficial holders of the Company s voting securities outstanding immediately before such transaction beneficially owning less than 60 of the combined voting power of the Company or any person or entity that, as a result of the transaction, controls directly or indirectly, the Company (the Company or such person or entity, the Successor Entity ), or (ii) any person or entity or group of persons or entities that beneficially owned more than 60 of the combined voting power of the Company immediately before such transaction beneficially owning less than 60 of the combined voting power of the Successor Entity immediately after such transaction, or (d) the sale of all of the Stock to an unrelated person or entity. For this purpose, Stock means the Class A Common Stock, par value .10 per share, of the Company. For the purposes of clarity, a conversion of shares of the Company s Class B Common Stock, par value .10 per share, into Class A Common Stock shall not, in and of itself, be deemed a Change in Control. Code shall mean the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Committee shall mean the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (or its successor). The Committee shall be the named fiduciary for purposes of ERISA. 

 Company shall mean Watts Water Technologies, Inc. Eligible Executive shall have the meaning set forth in Article III. ERISA shall mean the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, as amended. Good Reason shall mean, without an Eligible Executive s written consent, (a) a reduction of more than ten percent (10 in the Eligible Executive s annual base salary and annual bonus target opportunity as in effect immediately prior to the date of the Change in Control; (b) the Eligible Executive s mandatory relocation to an office more than fifty (50) miles from the primary location at which Eligible Executive is required to perform Eligible Executive s duties immediately prior to the date of the Change in Control; or (c) a material reduction in the Eligible Executive s responsibilities, duties or authority as in effect immediately prior to the date of the Change in Control. In each case, Eligible Executive must provide the Company with notice of the facts giving rise to a claim that Good Reason exists within 90 days of the initial existence of such Good Reason event, and the Company shall have a right to remedy such event within 30 days after receipt of Eligible Executive s notice. The Eligible Employee must resign within twenty-four months from the occurrence of the event giving rise to Good Reason. It is intended that terminations for Good Reason under the Plan qualify as involuntary terminations under Code section 409A and this definition shall be interpreted consistent with that intent. Plan shall mean this Watts Water Technologies, Inc. Executive Severance Plan, as amended from time to time. Protection Period shall mean the 24-month period beginning on the date of the first instance of a Change in Control. Termination of Employment shall mean an individual s termination of employment with the Company and all of its subsidiaries and affiliates. ARTICLE III ELIGIBILITY An officer of the Company will be eligible for participation in the Plan and considered an Eligible Executive only if, at the time of his Termination of Employment, he has been designated as an Eligible Executive by the Committee. A listing of such Eligible Executives is contained in Appendix A to the Plan. The Committee shall revise the listing of Eligible Executives from time to time in its sole discretion. ARTICLE IV TERMINATION OUTSIDE PROTECTION PERIOD If an Eligible Executive s Termination of Employment does not occur during the Protection Period, this Article IV shall govern the Eligible Executive s eligibility for Plan benefits. 
 2 

 4.1 Entitlement to Benefits An Eligible Executive who (a) is involuntarily terminated without Cause and (b) signs and does not revoke a separation agreement within the time period required by law for an effective release of claims, but no more than fifty (50) days following the date of such Termination of Employment, will be entitled to receive Plan benefits under this Article IV. Such separation agreement shall contain a release of claims against the Company and its affiliates and such restrictive covenants (e.g., non-competition, non-solicitation, and non-disparagement covenants) as the Committee determines appropriate in its sole discretion. An Eligible Executive will not be eligible for severance benefits under this Article IV if his employment terminates due to his division, location or other business unit being sold. 4.2 Amount of Benefits An Eligible Executive entitled to benefits under this Article IV shall receive a lump sum payment, net of all applicable tax withholding, within 60 days of his Termination of Employment; provided however, that if the period during which the Eligible Executive may consider and sign the separation agreement would span more than one taxable year, then such payment shall not be made until the later taxable year. The amount of the lump sum payment shall equal the sum of: (a) the monthly premium the Eligible Executive would have to pay for COBRA medical coverage (based on his coverage in effect at Termination of Employment) times 12, and (b) the Eligible Executive s annual base salary on the date of his Termination of Employment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Eligible Executive is the Chief Executive Officer of the Company at the time of his Termination of Employment, the amount in subsection (b) shall be multiplied by two. ARTICLE V TERMINATION DURING PROTECTION PERIOD If an Eligible Executive s Termination of Employment occurs during the Protection Period or under the circumstances described in Section 5.4, this Article V shall govern the Eligible Executive s eligibility for Plan benefits. 5.1 Entitlement to Benefits An Eligible Executive who is involuntarily terminated without Cause or resigns for Good Reason will be entitled to receive Plan benefits under this Article V, provided such Eligible Executive signs and does not revoke a general release of claims within the time period required by law, but no more than fifty (50) days following the date of such Termination of Employment. 
 3 

 5.2 Amount of Benefits An Eligible Executive entitled to benefits under this Article V shall receive a lump sum payment, net of all applicable tax withholding, within 60 days of his Termination of Employment; provided however, that if the period during which the Eligible Executive may consider and sign the general release of claims would span more than one taxable year, then such payment shall not be made until the later taxable year. The amount of the lump sum payment shall equal the sum of: (a) the monthly premium the Eligible Executive would have to pay for COBRA medical coverage (based on his coverage in effect at Termination of Employment) times 24, and (b) two times the sum of the Eligible Executive s annual base salary and target annual bonus immediately prior to the commencement of the Protection Period. In addition, if an Eligible Executive is entitled to benefits under this Article V, all unvested equity or equity-based awards of the Company held by the Eligible Executive will, as of the Eligible Executive s Termination of Employment and automatically without any further action by the Company or its Board of Directors, (i) if not subject to performance based vesting conditions, become fully vested, non-forfeitable and, if applicable, exercisable, or (ii) if subject to performance based vesting conditions, become vested, non-forfeitable and, if applicable, exercisable at the greater of (a) the target award or performance level or (b) the level that would apply based on actual performance calculated as if the final day of the Company s last completed fiscal quarter prior to the date of the Eligible Executive s Termination of Employment were the final day of the applicable performance period (without any reduction to the overall award to reflect the shortened performance period). The immediately preceding sentence will apply to all equity and equity-based awards held by an Eligible Executive entitled to benefits under this Article V notwithstanding any contrary terms of the documents governing the equity or equity-based awards (but subject to Section 5.3) and any stock options or stock appreciation rights that become exercisable under the immediately preceding sentence will not expire for at least sixty (60) days following the later of the relevant Change in Control or the Executive s Termination of Employment (provided that (x) such awards may be earlier terminated in connection with a corporate transaction as set forth in the documents governing the awards and (y) no such stock option or stock appreciation right will remain outstanding beyond its final expiration date). For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 5.2 will alter the payment schedule of any non-qualified deferred compensation that is subject to Section 409A of the Code. 5.3 Excise Tax Notwithstanding anything contained in this Plan to the contrary, if upon or following a Change in Control, the tax imposed by Code section 4999 or any similar or successor tax (the Excise Tax applies, solely because of the Change in Control, to any payments, benefits and/or amounts received by an Eligible Executive under the Plan or otherwise, including, without limitation, any amounts received or deemed received, within the meaning of any provision of the Code, by the Eligible Executive as a result of (and not by way of limitation) any automatic vesting, lapse of restrictions and/or accelerated target or performance achievement provisions, or otherwise, applicable to outstanding grants or awards to the Eligible Executive under any of the Company s incentive plans (collectively, the Total Payments ), then the Total Payments shall be reduced (but not below zero) 
 4 

 so that the maximum amount of the Total Payments (after reduction) shall be one dollar 1.00) less than the amount which would cause the Total Payments to be subject to the Excise Tax; provided that such reduction to the Total Payments shall be made only if the total after-tax benefit to the Eligible Executive is greater after giving effect to such reduction than if no such reduction had been made. If such a reduction is required, the Company shall reduce or eliminate the Total Payments by first reducing or eliminating any cash severance benefits, then by reducing or eliminating any accelerated vesting of stock options, then by reducing or eliminating any accelerated vesting of other equity awards, then by reducing or eliminating any other remaining Total Payments, in each case in reverse order beginning with the payments which are to be paid the farthest in time from the Change in Control. The preceding provisions of this Section 5.3 shall take precedence over the provisions of any other plan, arrangement or agreement governing the Eligible Executive s rights and entitlements to any benefits or compensation. All determinations required under this Section shall be made by the Company s independent auditors at the Company s expense and in accordance with Code section 280G. 5.4 Termination Before Protection Period Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan, an Eligible Executive who is involuntarily terminated without Cause in the six-month period immediately preceding the commencement of the Protection Period will be entitled to receive the benefits for unvested equity and equity-based awards described in Section 5.2 and a benefit under this Section 5.4 equal to the amount described in Section 5.2 less the amount described in Section 4.2 for such Eligible Executive (regardless of whether the amount described in Section 4.2 is actually paid), provided such Eligible Executive signs and does not revoke a general release of claims within the time period required by law, but no more than fifty (50) days following the Change in Control. The amount payable under this Section 5.4 shall be paid in a lump sum payment, net of all applicable tax withholding, within 60 days of the first instance of a Change in Control; provided however, that if the period during which the Eligible Executive may consider and sign the general release of claims would span more than one taxable year, then such payment shall not be made until the later taxable year. ARTICLE VI ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN 6.1 General Administration The Committee shall be responsible for the operation and administration of the Plan and for carrying out the provisions hereof. The Committee shall have the full authority and discretion to make, amend, interpret, and enforce all appropriate rules and regulations for the administration of this Plan and decide or resolve any and all questions, including interpretations of this Plan, as may arise in connection with this Plan. Any such action taken by the Committee shall be final and conclusive on any party. To the extent the Committee has been granted discretionary authority under the Plan, the Committee s prior exercise of such authority shall not obligate it to exercise its authority in a like fashion thereafter. The Committee shall be entitled to rely conclusively upon all tables, valuations, certificates, opinions and reports furnished by any actuary, accountant, controller, counsel or other person employed or engaged by the Company with respect to the Plan. The 
 5 

 Committee may, from time to time, employ agents and delegate to such agents, including employees of the Company, such administrative or other duties as it sees fit. 6.2 Claims for Benefits (a) Filing a Claim . An Eligible Executive or his authorized representative may file a claim for benefits under the Plan. Any claim must be in writing and submitted to the Committee at the Company s corporate headquarters office. Claimants will be notified in writing of approved claims, which will be processed as claimed. A claim is considered approved only if its approval is communicated in writing to a claimant. (b) Denial of Claim . In the case of the denial of a claim respecting benefits paid or payable with respect to an Eligible Executive, a written notice will be furnished to the claimant within 90 days of the date on which the claim is received by the Committee. If special circumstances (such as for a hearing) require a longer period, the claimant will be notified in writing, prior to the expiration of the 90-day period, of the reasons for an extension of time; provided, however, that no extensions will be permitted beyond 90 days after the expiration of the initial 90-day period. (c) Reasons for Denial . A denial or partial denial of a claim will be dated and will clearly set forth: (i) the specific reason or reasons for the denial; (ii) specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based; (iii) a description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and (iv) an explanation of the procedure for review of the denied or partially denied claim set forth below, including the claimant s right to bring a civil action under ERISA section 502(a) following an adverse benefit determination on review. (d) Review of Denial . Upon denial of a claim, in whole or in part, a claimant or his duly authorized representative will have the right to submit a written request to the Committee for a full and fair review of the denied claim by filing a written notice of appeal with the Committee within 60 days of the receipt by the claimant of written notice of the denial of the claim. A claimant or the claimant s authorized representative will have, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records, and other information relevant to the claimant s claim for benefits and may submit issues and comments in writing. The review will take into account all comments, documents, records, and other information submitted by the claimant relating to the claim, without regard to whether such information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination. If the claimant fails to file a request for review within 60 days of the denial notification, the claim will be deemed abandoned and the claimant precluded from reasserting it. If the claimant does file a request for review, his request must include a description of the issues and evidence he deems 
 6 

 relevant. Failure to raise issues or present evidence on review will preclude those issues or evidence from being presented in any subsequent proceeding or judicial review of the claim. (e) Decision Upon Review . The Committee will provide a prompt written decision on review. If the claim is denied on review, the decision shall set forth: (i) the specific reason or reasons for the adverse determination; (ii) specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the adverse determination is based; (iii) a statement that the claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records, and other information relevant to the claimant s claim for benefits; and (iv) a statement describing any voluntary appeal procedures offered by the Plan and the claimant s right to obtain the information about such procedures, as well as a statement of the claimant s right to bring an action under ERISA section 502(a). A decision will be rendered no more than 60 days after the Committee s receipt of the request for review, except that such period may be extended for an additional 60 days if the Committee determines that special circumstances (such as for a hearing) require such extension. If an extension of time is required, written notice of the extension will be furnished to the claimant before the end of the initial 60-day period. (f) Protection Period Terminations . If an Eligible Executive files a claim related to a Termination of Employment occurring during the Protection Period, all of the time periods related to the Committee s decisions described in this Section 6.2 shall be reduced by two-thirds (e.g., from 90 days to 30 days). (g) Limitations Period . Any suit or legal action initiated by a claimant under the Plan must be brought by the claimant no later than one year following a final decision on the claim for benefits by the Committee. The one-year limitation on suits for benefits will apply in any forum where a claimant initiates such suit or legal action. 6.3 Indemnification To the extent not covered by insurance, the Company shall indemnify the Committee, each employee, officer, director, and agent of the Company, and all persons formerly serving in such capacities, against any and all liabilities or expenses, including all legal fees relating thereto, arising in connection with the exercise of their duties and responsibilities with respect to the Plan, provided however that the Company shall not indemnify any person for liabilities or expenses due to that person s own gross negligence or willful misconduct. 
 7 

 ARTICLE VII TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT OF PLAN 7.1 Termination of Plan The Company s Board of Directors may terminate the Plan at any time, without prior notice. Upon termination of the Plan, except with respect to benefits due resulting from a Termination of Employment prior to such Plan termination, all rights to benefits hereunder, if any, shall cease. Any separation agreement executed by an Eligible Executive under Section 4.1 shall survive the Plan s termination. 7.2 Amendment of Plan The severance benefits provided for in the Plan are not vested benefits. Accordingly, the Company reserves the right in its sole and absolute discretion, to amend or modify the Plan at any time, in whole or in part, including any or all of the provisions of the Plan, by action of its Board of Directors, without prior notice. 7.3 Protection Period Changes Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, no amendment or termination of the Plan, including deletions to the listing of Eligible Executives, may occur during the Protection Period without the written consent of all Eligible Executives. 7.4 Successors to the Company The Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise) of all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company to expressly assume and agree to perform the Company s obligations under this Plan in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform them if such succession had not taken place. 
 8 

 ARTICLE VIII MISCELLANEOUS 8.1 Funding The benefits provided herein shall be funded by the Company s general assets. The Plan shall constitute an unfunded mechanism for the Company to pay Plan benefits to Eligible Executives determined to be entitled to payments hereunder. No fund or trust is created with respect to the Plan, and no Eligible Executive shall have any security or other interest in the assets of the Company. 8.2 No Contract of Employment The Plan does not constitute or imply the existence of an employment contract between the Company or any affiliate and any Eligible Executive. Employment with the Company is at will. 8.3 Governing Law To the extent not governed by federal law, the Plan shall be interpreted under the laws of the State of Delaware notwithstanding any conflict of law principles. 8.4 Severability In the event any provision of the Plan shall be held invalid or illegal for any reason, any illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of the Plan, but the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had never been inserted. 8.5 Words and Headings Words in the masculine gender shall include the feminine and the singular shall include the plural, and vice versa, unless qualified by the context. Any headings used herein are included for ease of reference only, and are not to be construed so as to alter the terms hereof.
