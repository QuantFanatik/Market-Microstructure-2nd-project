ITEM
1. Business 

We
are a self-managed and self-administered company that specializes in the acquisition, ownership and triple-net leasing of skilled nursing
facilities and other post-acute healthcare properties. As of the date of this Form 10-K, our portfolio consisted of 79 healthcare properties
with an aggregate of 10,351 licensed beds. We hold fee title to 78 of these properties, and hold one property under a long-term lease.
These properties are located across Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas. Our 79 properties
comprise 83 healthcare facilities, consisting of the following: 

76
 stand-alone skilled nursing facilities; 

two
 dual-purpose facilities used as both skilled nursing facilities and long-term acute care hospitals; and 

three
 assisted living facilities. 

We
generate substantially all of our revenues by leasing our properties to tenants under long-term leases on a triple-net basis, under which
the tenant pays the cost of real estate taxes, insurance and other operating costs of the facility and capital expenditures. Each healthcare
facility located at our properties is managed by a qualified operator with an experienced management team. 

We
are entitled to monthly rent paid by the tenants and we do not receive any income or bear any expenses from the operation of such facilities.
As of the date of this Form 10-K, the aggregate annualized average base rent under the leases for our properties was approximately 82.5
million. 

Since
the Predecessor Company was formed, we have grown significantly through acquisitions, having purchased 29 properties since
January 2017, with an aggregate purchase price of approximately 204.1 million. Since 2017, our aggregate annualized average base rent
has grown at an approximate 7.6 CAGR from 57.1 million in fiscal year 2017 to 82.5 million in fiscal year 2022. In addition, our Adjusted
EBITDA and FFO from 2018 to 2022 grew at an approximate 10.8 and 23.4 CAGR, respectfully.
During that period, we expanded our geographic footprint from six states to nine states. 

From
January 1, 2022, through March 27, 2023, we acquired one SNF for a total cost of approximately 6.0 million (including finder fees and
leasehold improvements), which includes capitalized acquisition costs. This acquisition is expected to generate initial annual cash revenues
of approximately 0.6 million. 

7 

Our
management team has extensive experience in acquiring, owning, financing, operating and leasing of skilled nursing facilities and
other types of healthcare properties. The team is led by Moishe Gubin, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of
Directors, Nahman Eingal, our Chief Financial Officer, and Jeffrey Bajtner who serves as our Senior Investment Officer. Combined,
this team has over 50 years of experience investing in real estate and particularly in healthcare related real estate and operating
companies. They have completed over 80 real estate related/healthcare related acquisitions totaling over 900 million in gross
investment through various investment vehicles. Our management team also has extensive experience as operators of, and healthcare
consultants to, skilled nursing facilities, having managed and operated over 60 skilled nursing facilities, including 41 of our
current tenants. We believe our management team s unique experience across both skilled nursing operations and real estate and
its extensive knowledge of the skilled nursing industry position us favorably to take advantage of healthcare investment
opportunities. Additionally, our deep and broad relationships with industry operators have allowed us to identify and acquire
skilled nursing facilities to which many of our competitors do not have access. 

We
have assembled a high quality and diversified portfolio of skilled nursing and other healthcare related facilities and we plan to continue
to invest primarily in skilled nursing facilities and other healthcare facilities that primarily provide services to the elderly. We
believe these asset classes provide potential for higher risk-adjusted returns compared to other forms of net-leased real estate assets
due to the specialized expertise necessary to acquire, own, finance and operate these properties, which are factors that tend to limit
competition among investors, owners, operators and finance companies. Additionally, our management team s strong relationships
in the industry have allowed us to acquire healthcare-related properties at valuations that achieve attractive lease yields, with the
goal of generating strong returns for our stockholders over the long-term. As we continue to acquire additional properties and expand
our portfolio, we expect to continue diversifying our portfolio by geography and by tenant, while also maintaining balance sheet strength
and liquidity. 

As
of December 31, 2022, we had notes receivable consisting of a working capital loan to one of our tenants with a balance of 1.9
million, two uncollateralized loans to purchasers of our former properties with an aggregate balance due of 9.1 million, an 8
million uncollateralized note that the Company purchased related to our Arkansas properties and a short-term loan with a
balance of 0.4 million which was repaid in January 2023. All of the notes receivable are current. 

We
elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ending December 31, 2022. We
believe that we have been organized and have operated, and we intend to continue to operate, in a manner to qualify for taxation as
a REIT. We operate through an umbrella partnership, commonly referred to as an UPREIT structure, in which substantially all of our
properties and assets are held through Strawberry Fields Realty, L.P. (the Operating Partnership ). We are the general
partner of the Operating Partnership and own approximately 12.0 of the outstanding OP units. To maintain REIT status, we must meet
certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we annually distribute to our stockholders at
least 90 of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital
gains. 

We
generate revenues primarily by leasing healthcare-related properties to healthcare operators in triple-net lease arrangements, under
which the tenant is solely responsible for the costs related to the property (including property taxes, insurance, maintenance and repair
costs and capital expenditures). From time to time, we also extend loans to healthcare operators, generally secured by their receivables. We conduct and manage our business as one operating segment for internal reporting and internal decision-making purposes.
We expect to grow our portfolio by pursuing opportunities to acquire additional properties that will be leased to a diverse group of
local, regional and national healthcare providers, which may include new or existing skilled nursing operators. We also anticipate diversifying
our portfolio over time, including by acquiring properties in different geographic markets, and in different asset classes. In addition,
we actively monitor the clinical, regulatory, and financial operating results of our tenants, and work to identify opportunities within
their operations and markets that could improve their operating results at our facilities. We communicate such observations to our tenants;
however, we have no contractual obligation to do so. Moreover, our tenants have sole discretion with respect to the day-to-day operation
of the facilities they lease from us, and how and whether to implement any observation we may share with them. We also actively monitor
the overall occupancy, skilled mix, and other operating metrics of our tenants monthly. 

8 

We have replaced tenants in the past, and may
elect to replace tenants in the future, if they fail to meet the terms and conditions of their leases with us. The replacement tenants
may include tenants with whom we have had no prior landlord-tenant relationship as well as current tenants with whom we are comfortable
expanding our relationships. In addition, we periodically reassess the investments we have made and the tenant relationships we have
entered, and have selectively disposed of facilities or investments, or terminated such relationships, and we expect to continue making
such reassessments and, where appropriate, taking such actions. 

Our
Industry 

The
skilled nursing industry has evolved to meet the growing demand for post-acute and custodial healthcare services generated by an aging
population, increasing life expectancies and the trend toward shifting patient care to lower cost settings. We believe this evolution
has led to a number of favorable improvements in the industry, as described below: 

Shift of Patient Care to Lower Cost Alternatives. The
growth of the senior population in the United States continues to increase healthcare costs. In response, federal and state governments
have adopted cost-containment measures that encourage the treatment of patients in more cost-effective settings such as SNFs, for which
the staffing requirements and associated costs are often significantly lower than acute care hospitals, inpatient rehabilitation facilities
and other post-acute care settings. As a result, SNFs are generally serving a larger population of higher-acuity patients than in the
past. The same trend is impacting ALFs, which are now generally serving some patients who previously would have received services at
SNFs. 

Significant Acquisition and Consolidation Opportunities.
 The skilled nursing industry is large and highly fragmented, characterized predominantly by numerous local and regional providers.
We believe this fragmentation provides significant acquisition and consolidation opportunities. 

Widening Supply and Demand Imbalance . The number of
SNFs has declined modestly over the past several years. According to the American Health Care Association, the nursing home industry
was comprised of approximately 15,000 facilities as of December 2020, as compared with over 16,700 facilities as of December 2000. We
expect that the supply/demand imbalance in the skilled nursing industry will increasingly favor skilled nursing and assisted living providers
due to the shift of patient care to lower cost settings and an aging population. 

Increased Demand Driven by Aging Populations . As seniors
account for a higher percentage of the total U.S. population, we believe the overall demand for skilled nursing services will increase.
At present, the primary market demographic for skilled nursing services is individuals aged 75 and older. The 2020 U.S. Census reported
that there were over 56 million people in the United States in 2020 over the age of 65. The U.S. Census estimates this group to be one
of the fastest growing segments of the United States population, projecting that it will almost double between 2020 and 2060. According
to the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services, nursing home care facilities and continuing care retirement expenditures are projected
to grow from approximately 196.8 billion in 2020, which includes federal expenditures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, to approximately
 266 billion in 2028. Although skilled nursing and seniors housing occupancy rates have declined during the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe
that these trends in population will support an increasing demand for skilled nursing services in the long-term, which in turn will likely
support an increasing demand for the services provided within our properties.

Tenants
and Operators 

Our
properties are currently leased to 83 tenants under 27 lease agreements. Our leases include 8 master lease agreements that cover 64 facilities
leased to 64 tenants, with the remaining 19 leases each covering a single facility leased to one tenant. Forty-one of our tenants are
related parties. 

Each
property is operated as a healthcare facility by a licensed operator, which may be the tenant or a separate operator. Each operator holds
a license granted by state regulators to operate a specific type of facility. All the operators have experienced management teams
and senior healthcare staff with substantial knowledge of their respective local markets. We target healthcare operators that are owned
by principals with a history of quality care, and the demonstrated ability to successfully navigate in a changing healthcare operating
environment. Certain operators are related parties. 

We
believe that each of the operators of our properties is primarily focused on serving the needs of the local community. Unlike operators
that are part of a large national healthcare conglomerate, we believe the operators at our properties can manage their facilities more
efficiently because they are not burdened by costly infrastructure and have the flexibility to rapidly adjust their cost structure to
respond to changes in the reimbursement environment. 

In
order to operate efficiently and improve profitability, most of the operators at our facilities have engaged large consulting firms that
specialize in healthcare and skilled nursing operations. These consulting firms provide advice and assistance on marketing, operating
policies and procedures, billing, collections and regulatory compliance. The operators and consultants work together to develop and standardize
best practices in the facilities, while operating in a cost-efficient manner. The operators at our properties primarily use one of nine
principal consulting firms, including three firms that are part of Infinity Healthcare, a healthcare consulting business that is owned
by the Moishe Gubin, who is our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Michael Blisko, who is one of our directors. 

The
tenants and operators of our properties have demonstrated the ability to generate consistent profitability despite the challenging markets
in which they operate. In many cases, these tenants and operators have successfully optimized and stabilized underperforming skilled
nursing facilities. While these tenants and operators have been successful, we expect to seek opportunities to diversify our tenant/operator
mix through future acquisitions that will be leased to new operators.

The tenant and the operator are the same for each facility other than the 13 SNFs leased under the Indiana master lease agreement and
one SNF in Amarillo, Texas. In the case of these other facilities, the tenants are county hospitals which have entered into management
agreements with the operators listed in the table. These arrangements permit the facilities to participate in a CMS program that pays
higher Medicaid reimbursement rates for facilities associated with hospitals in underserved areas.

The expiration dates do not reflect the exercise of any renewable options. 

(3)
In February 2023 the facility was closed. The closure was a result of the tenant request and mainly for efficiency reasons. This SNF
is under a master lease with 5 other facilities and the full amount of the rent payments under the master lease are continuing to be
paid. 

Related
Party Tenants 

As
of December 31, 2022, we leased 41 of our facilities to tenants that are affiliates of Moishe Gubin who serves as Chairman of the
Board and our Chief Executive Officer, Michael Blisko, who serves as one of our directors, and Ted Lerman, one of the controlling
members of the Predecessor Company. As of March 27, 2023, approximately 64.05 of our annualized base rent is received from such
related-party tenants. The failure of these tenants to fulfill their obligations under their leases or renew their leases upon
expiration could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In January 2023,
affiliates of Moishe Gubin and Michael Blisko acquired the membership interests held by the affiliate of Ted Lerman in all of the related party tenants. 

Rental
income from leases with these related party tenants represented 64.0 of all rental income for the year ended December 31, 2022. We believe
these affiliated relationships provide a strong alignment of interests between us and our tenants and offers us increased operating flexibility
with regards to potentially replacing underperforming tenants or evaluating acquisitions in new states. As we continue to grow and expand
our portfolio, we intend to develop new relationships with unrelated party tenants and operators in order to diversify our tenant base
and reduce our dependence on related party and operators.

We
monitor the creditworthiness of our tenants by evaluating the ability of the tenants to meet their lease obligations to us based on the
tenants financial performance, including the evaluation of any guarantees of tenant lease obligations. The primary basis for our
evaluation of the credit quality of our tenants (and more specifically the tenants ability to pay their rent obligations to us)
is the tenants lease coverage ratios. These coverage ratios compare (i) earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation,
amortization and rent EBITDAR to rent coverage, and (ii) earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization,
rent and management fees EBITDARM to rent coverage. We utilize a standardized 5 management fee when we calculate lease
coverage ratios. We obtain various financial and operational information from our tenants each month. We regularly review this information
to calculate the above-described coverage metrics, to identify operational trends, to assess the operational and financial impact of
the changes in the broader industry environment (including the potential impact of government reimbursement and regulatory changes),
and to evaluate the management and performance of the tenants operations. These metrics help us identify potential areas of concern
relative to our tenants credit quality and ultimately the tenants ability to generate sufficient liquidity to meet their
ongoing obligations, including their obligations to continue paying contractual rents due to us and satisfying other financial obligations
to third parties, as prescribed by our triple-net leases. 

Geographic
Diversification 

As
of March 27, 2023, our portfolio of 79 properties is broadly diversified by geographic location across nine U.S. states, comprising Arkansas,
Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas.

Competitive
Strengths 

We
believe that the following competitive strengths provide a solid foundation for the sustained growth of our business and successful execution
of our business strategies: 

Diversified
Portfolio. We have a portfolio that is diversified in terms of both geography and tenant composition. As of March 27, 2023,
our portfolio is comprised of 79 healthcare-related properties with a total of 10,351 licensed beds located throughout Arkansas,
Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas. We believe that our geographic diversification limits
the potential impact of any regulatory, reimbursement, competitive dynamic or other changes in any single market on the overall
performance of our portfolio. We lease our properties to 83 tenants, with no single tenant accounting for more than 3.1 of our
annualized base rent. This diversification limits our exposure for any single tenant that encounters financial or operational
difficulties. 

Protected
Markets . In eight of the nine states in which we operate, we benefit from CON laws that require state approval for the constructions
and expansion of certain types of healthcare facilities. These laws represent significant barriers to entry and limit competition in
these markets. 

Demonstrated
Ability to Identify and Structure Accretive Acquisition Opportunities. Our management team has long-standing relationships in
the skilled nursing and post-acute industries. Through their experience in acquiring these types of facilities, we have the proven ability
to identify and complete complex and accretive transactions. Additionally, because many of our acquisitions are off-market
opportunities sourced through our management team s network of industry relationships, we believe we do not typically compete with
larger healthcare-focused real estate companies for acquisitions as they tend to focus on larger, platform acquisition opportunities.
As a result, we have consistently acquired assets at attractive valuations and believe we can continue to identify these types of opportunities
to expand our portfolio. 

Significant
Experience Acquiring Underperforming Assets. Although we primarily seek to acquire properties that have had consistent profitability,
we may also acquire underperforming properties if we believe that the underlying facilities can become successful through better management.
Our management team s prior experience as operators gives it the ability to evaluate these types of facilities and their potential
for improved revenue enhancement and increased operating efficiencies. We will consider the acquisition of underperforming properties
if they are available at attractive valuations and provide us with significant upside potential once their new operators have successfully
stabilized and optimized their operations. If we acquire underperforming properties, we would expect to lease them to tenants and operators
that have significant turnaround experience and support from experienced consultants. 

14 

Experienced
and Adept Operators. We have strong and long-standing relationships with operators and their principals who have significant
experience in operating successful skilled nursing facilities. These operators and their principals have a strong track record of operating
in challenging markets where operators are subject to increased regulatory issues and significant competition. Additionally, these operators
and their principals have learned to successfully operate facilities in which most of the revenue is earned from providing services to
patients covered by Medicaid which are subject to lower reimbursement rates than other revenue sources. 

Consulting
Firms Provide Additional Resources for the Operators of our Facilities. Most of the operators of our facilities utilize the services
of experienced healthcare consulting firms to provide them with expert advice and assistance with their operations. We believe these
consulting firms provide the operators with additional expertise and resources that materially enhance their ability to operate efficiently
and to meet applicable regulatory requirements. 

Close
Relationships with Tenants, Operators and Consultants Provide Enhanced Oversight, Market Intelligence and Strong Alignment of Interests.
 The nature of our close relationships with the tenants and operators of our properties and their consulting firms allows us to
maintain close communication and obtain early knowledge of potential issues faced by our tenants, enabling us to address those issues
that affect us as the lessor. These relationships also provide us with intelligence on the markets in which we own properties and assistance
in locating new and replacement tenants. Additionally, the consulting firms assist us without charge in evaluating potential acquisitions
and operators. This assistance provides us with insight on local market trends, which is particularly valuable for new markets. These
relationships also provide a strong alignment of interests between our interests as a property owner and our tenants interests. 

Well-Structured,
Long-Term, Triple-Net Leases Generate Predictable and Growing Rental Income Streams. Most of our owned properties are leased
to tenants under long-term, non-cancellable, triple-net leases, pursuant to which the tenants are responsible for all maintenance and
repairs, insurance and taxes associated with the leased properties and the business conducted at the properties. As of December 31, 2022,
100 of the gross leasable area of our facilities was leased with an average remaining lease term of 6.47 years. Our leases generally
have terms that range from 10 to 20 years with two five-year extensions, and annual rent escalators of 1 to 3 per year, which provides
us with a steady and growing cash rental stream. Additionally, our leases are structured to provide us with key credit support and have
credit enhancement provisions that may include non-refundable security deposits of up to 6 months, personal and corporate guarantees
and cross-default provisions under our master leases. Approximately 70.1 of our total annualized rental revenue is generated through
our 8 master leases that have cross-default and cross-collateralization provisions. 

Seasoned
Management Team with Significant Experience. Moishe Gubin, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, has over 25 years of operating
and real estate experience in the skilled nursing and long-term care industries. Prior to founding the Predecessor Company, Mr. Gubin
worked as an operator of skilled nursing facilities and built a strong operational knowledge base that has been incorporated into the
day-to-day management of our current portfolio. Additionally, Mr. Gubin has significant acquisition experience having completed over
80 healthcare-related facilities with an aggregate investment amount of over 900 million since 2003. Nahman Eingal, our Chief Financial
Officer, has an extensive background in real estate finance with over 20 years of experience in the banking industry focusing on commercial
lending to healthcare providers. Mr. Gubin and Mr. Eingal also have significant experience accessing the debt capital markets to fund
growth, having raised over 266 million of publicly traded bonds that are listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. We believe that the
diverse operational and financial background and expertise of our management team gives us the ability to successfully manage our portfolio
and sustain our growth. 

15 

Our
Business and Growth Strategies 

Our
objective is to generate attractive returns for our stockholders over the long-term through dividends and capital appreciation. Key elements
of our strategy include the following: 

Acquire
Additional Healthcare Properties in Concentrated Geographic Areas. We plan to invest primarily in real estate used as skilled
nursing facilities and other healthcare facilities that provide services to the elderly, where our management team has substantial experience
and relationships. We believe these facilities have the potential to provide higher risk-adjusted returns compared to other forms of
net-leased real estate assets due to the specialized expertise necessary to acquire, own, finance and manage these properties, which
are factors that tend to limit competition among investors, owners, operators and finance companies. We will seek to acquire properties
in states where we believe we can build regional density in order to create competitive advantages and drive operational and cost efficiencies. 

Negotiate
Well-Structured Net Leases. Our primary ownership structure is a facility purchase with a long-term triple-net lease with the
healthcare operator. We seek to structure our leases with lease terms of 10 years with tenant options to extend the lease for an additional
period of 5 to 10 years, and rent escalators that provide a steadily growing cash rental stream. Our lease structures are designed to
provide us with credit support for our rents, including, in certain cases, lease deposits, covenants regarding liquidity, and various
provisions for cross-default. We believe these features help insulate us from variability in operator cash flows and enable us to minimize
our expenses while we continue to build our portfolio. 

Leverage
Existing and Develop New Operator Relationships. Our management team has long-standing relationships in the healthcare industry
through which we have sourced our existing portfolio, and we intend to continue to expand our portfolio by leveraging these existing
relationships. Forty-one of our properties are leased to related parties. One of our goals is to reduce our dependence on related party
tenants in order to diversify our tenant base. Although we expect to continue to lease properties to related party tenants in markets
in which the related party tenants have substantial experience and operations, we intend to lease properties in other markets to unrelated
tenants if we are able to identify qualified operators. Additionally, we will consider leasing properties to unrelated parties in markets
in which related parties operate if we are able to identify qualified operators that are willing to lease properties on terms that are
no less favorable than those available from related parties. 

Utilize
Prudent Investment Underwriting Criteria. We have adopted what we believe to be a thorough investment underwriting process based
on careful analysis and due diligence with respect to both the healthcare real estate and the healthcare service operations. We seek
to make investments in healthcare properties that have the following attributes: well-located, visible to traffic, in good physical condition
with predictable future capital improvement needs and with attractive prospects for future profitability. 

Monitor
the Performance of our Facilities and Industry Trends. We carefully monitor the financial and operational performance of our
tenants and of the specific facilities in which we invest through a variety of methods, such as reviews of periodic financial statements,
and regular meetings with the facility operators. Pursuant to the terms of our leases, our tenants are required to provide us with certain
periodic financial statements and operating data. 

16 

Utilize
Targeted Leverage in Our Investing Activities. We seek to utilize a targeted level of leverage that is appropriate in light of
market conditions, future cash flows, the creditworthiness of tenants and future rental rates. We will seek to achieve a ratio of debt
to asset fair market value in the range of 45 to 55 . However, our charter and bylaws do not limit the amount of debt that we may incur
and our board of directors has not adopted a policy limiting the total amount of our borrowings. 

Policy
for the Acquisition and Sale of Properties 

In
considering these performance targets, readers should bear in mind that targeted performance for each acquisition is not a guarantee,
projection, forecast or prediction and is not necessarily indicative of future results. These performance targets are as of the date
hereof and may change in the future. The performance targets are based on an assumption that economic, market and other conditions will
not deteriorate and, in some cases, will improve. These performance targets are also based on estimates and assumptions about performance
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, but actual realized returns of our investments will depend on, among other factors,
the ability to consummate attractive investments, future operating results, the value of the assets and market conditions at the time
of disposition, any related transaction costs and the timing and manner of sale, all of which may differ from the assumptions and circumstances
on which targeted returns are based. We believe the performance targets are reasonable, but readers should keep in mind that this investment
involves a high degree of risk and they should purchase these securities only if they can afford a complete loss of their investment. 

We
believe our management team s depth of experience in healthcare real estate, operations and finance provides us with unique perspective
in underwriting potential investments. Our real estate underwriting process focuses on both real estate and healthcare operations. The
process includes a detailed analysis of the facility and the financial strength and experience of the tenant and its management. Key
factors that we consider in the underwriting process include the following: 

the current, historical and projected cash flow and operating margins of each tenant and at each facility; 

the ratio of our tenants operating earnings both to facility rent and to facility rent plus other fixed costs, including debt
costs; 

the quality and experience of the tenant and its management team; 

construction quality, condition, design and projected capital needs of the facility and property condition assessments; 

competitive landscape; 

drivers of healthcare-related needs; 

the location of the facility; 

local economic and demographic factors and the competitive landscape of the market; 

licensure and accreditation; 

the effect of evolving healthcare legislation and other existing and future regulations and compliance with such regulations on our tenants 
profitability and liquidity; and 

the payor mix of private, Medicare and Medicaid patients at the facility. 

17 

We
also require tenants to furnish property and operator-level financials, among other data, on a monthly basis; we evaluate individual
and portfolio property performance, liquidity metrics, lease and debt coverage, occupancy, planned capital expenditures, and other measures;
and we conduct in- person visits to each facility in the portfolio at least two times per year. We believe our underwriting process enables
us to acquire desirable properties with strong tenants that will support our ability to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns to our
stockholders. 

The
policy does not limit the authority of our board of directors to change or deviate from the policy as it sees fit from time to time.
Changes to the policy do not require stockholder approval. 

Our
management does not have a fixed policy relating to the sale of properties. Accordingly, each potential sale opportunity will be examined
on its merits in view of the business opportunity involved. 

Our
Leases 

As
of March 27, 2023, all of our healthcare properties were subject to lease agreements. Our leases have a weighted-average annualized
lease income per leased square foot of 23.35, and as of December 31, 2022, a weighted-average remaining lease term of approximately
6.47 years. 

To
our knowledge, except as noted below, none of our current tenants are in default under any of the leases. 

Each
of our properties is leased under a separate lease agreement, although 8 groups of properties, covering a total of 64 facilities, are
subject to 8 master lease agreements. Each master lease agreement provides that the tenants under the master lease are jointly and severally
liable for the obligations of all of the other tenants under such master lease. We entered into these master lease agreements in order
to facilitate financing the underlying properties. Rental income under these master leases represents a substantial portion of our rental
income.

Investment
and Financing Policies 

Our
properties are located in 9 states and we intend to continue to acquire properties in other states throughout the United States. Our
investment objectives are to increase cash flow, provide quarterly cash dividends, maximize the value of our properties and acquire properties
with cash flow growth potential. We intend to invest primarily in SNFs and seniors housing, including ALFs and we may determine in the
future to expand our investments to include medical office buildings, long-term acute care hospitals and inpatient rehabilitation facilities.
Although our portfolio currently consists primarily of owned real property, future investments may include first mortgages, mezzanine
debt and other securities issued by, or joint ventures with, REITs or other entities that own real estate consistent with our investment
objectives. 

Competition 

The market for making investments in healthcare properties is highly fragmented,
and increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our investment
objectives. In acquiring and leasing healthcare properties, we compete with private equity funds, real estate developers, REITs, other
public and private real estate companies and private real estate investors, many of whom have greater financial resources than we have.
We also face competition in leasing or subleasing available facilities to prospective tenants. 

19 

Regulation 

Healthcare
Regulatory Matters 

The
following discussion describes certain material healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our operations and those of our tenants/operators.
Although there is presently no Federal regulation on the lessor itself from Federal government agencies that regulate and inspect the
operators and no regulation of the lessor in the States in which we own real property, our tenants (the operators of skilled nursing
facilities, long-term acute care hospitals and other healthcare providers) are subject to extensive federal, state and local government
healthcare laws and regulations. These laws and regulations include requirements related to licensure, conduct of operations, ownership
of the facilities operation, addition or expansion of facilities and services, prices for services, billing for services and the confidentiality
and security of health-related information. Different properties within our portfolio may be more or less subject to certain types of
regulation, some of which are specific to the type of facility or provider. These laws and regulations are wide-ranging and complex,
may vary or overlap from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and are subject frequently to change. Compliance with these regulatory requirements
can increase operating costs and, thereby, adversely affect the financial viability of our tenants/operators businesses. Our tenants/operators 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations could adversely affect their ability to successfully operate our properties, or receive
reimbursement for services rendered within them, which could negatively impact their ability to satisfy their contractual obligations
to us. Our leases will require the tenants/operators to comply with all applicable laws, including healthcare laws. 

Our
tenants are subject directly to healthcare laws and regulations, because of the broad nature of some of these restrictions, such as the
Anti-Kickback Statute discussed below. We intend for all of our business activities and operations to conform in all material respects
with all applicable laws and regulations, including healthcare laws and regulations. We expect that the healthcare industry will continue
to face increased regulation and pressure in the areas of fraud, waste and abuse, cost control, healthcare management and provision of
services. 

Healthcare
Reform Measures . The Affordable Care Act changed how healthcare services are covered, delivered and reimbursed through expanded coverage
of uninsured individuals, reduced growth in Medicare program spending, reductions in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, including but
not limited to, Disproportionate Share Hospital, or DSH payments, and expanding efforts by governmental and private third party payors
to tie reimbursement to quality and efficiency. In addition, the law reformed certain aspects of health insurance, contains provisions
intended to strengthen fraud and abuse enforcement, and encourage the development of new payment models, including the creation of Accountable
Care Organizations, or ACOs. The status of the Affordable Care Act is subject to substantial uncertainty due to proposals to terminate
or modify its provisions. We are not able to predict the effect of such changes on our business since the nature of any changes is undetermined.
However, any changes that result in a decrease in payments made on behalf of patients are likely to reduce the income that our tenants
receive from the operation of facilities at our properties. 

Sources
of Revenue and Reimbursement . Our tenants and operators receive payments for patient services from the federal government under the
Medicare program, state governments under their respective Medicaid or similar programs, managed care plans, private insurers and directly
from patients. Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 and over,
some disabled persons, persons with end-stage renal disease and persons with Lou Gehrig s Disease. Medicaid is a federal-state
program, administered by the states pursuant to certain conditions imposed by the Federal government, which provides hospital and medical
benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford healthcare. Generally, revenues for services rendered to Medicare patients
are determined under a prospective payment system, or PPS. CMS annually establishes payment rates for the PPS for each applicable facility
type and level of care provided. 

20 

Amounts
received under Medicare and Medicaid programs are generally significantly less than established facility gross charges for the services
provided and may not reflect the provider s costs. Healthcare providers generally offer discounts from established charges to certain
group purchasers of healthcare services, including private insurance companies, employers, health maintenance organizations, or HMOs,
preferred provider organizations, or PPOs and other managed care plans. These discount programs generally limit a provider s ability
to increase revenues in response to increasing costs. Patients are generally not responsible for the total difference between established
provider gross charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under Medicare, Medicaid, HMOs, PPOs and other managed care plans, but
are responsible to the extent of any exclusions, deductibles or coinsurance features of their coverage. The amount of such exclusions,
deductibles and coinsurance continues to increase. Collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than from governmental
or third-party payers takes considerably longer and often requires the involvement of, and payment to, third parties to collect. 

Payments
to providers are being increasingly tied to quality and efficiency. These initiatives include requirements to report clinical data and
patient satisfaction scores, reduced Medicare payments to hospitals based on excess readmission rates as determined by
CMS, denial of payments under Medicare, Medicaid and some private payors for services resulting from a hospital or facility-acquired
condition, or HAC, and reduced Medicare payments to hospitals with high risk-adjusted HAC rates. Certain provider types, including, but
not limited to, inpatient rehabilitation facilities and long-term acute care hospitals, are subject to specific limits and restrictions
on eligibility for admissions which, in turn, affect reimbursement at these facilities. 

The
amounts of program payments received by our tenants/operators can be changed from time to time by legislative or regulatory actions and
by determinations by agents for the programs. Level of payment has also been impacted by the Federal budget sequestration which automatically
reduces payments as a result of funding limitations. The Medicare and Medicaid statutory framework is subject to administrative rulings,
interpretations and discretion that affect the amount and timing of reimbursement made under Medicare and Medicaid. Federal healthcare
program reimbursement changes may be applied retroactively under certain circumstances. In recent years, the federal government has enacted
various measures to reduce spending under federal healthcare programs. In April 2018, CMS announced as part of its patient driven payment
model PDPM a skilled-nursing preferred payor system SNF-PPS intended to reduce administrative burden,
and foster innovation to improve care and quality for patients. CMS estimates the program of payment redesign and policy changes would
increase Medicare payments to SNFs by 2.4 850 million) during 2019. 

In
addition, many states have enacted, or are considering enacting, measures designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures and change private
healthcare insurance, and states continue to face significant challenges in maintaining appropriate levels of Medicaid funding due to
state budget shortfalls. Many States have also sought to control costs by implementing a variety of alternative care and payment models
authorized under Federal Medicaid waivers and such models often impose new or enhanced administrative requirements on health care providers
as a condition of payment. Further, non-government payers may reduce their reimbursement rates in accordance with payment reductions
by government programs or for other reasons. Healthcare provider operating margins may continue to be under significant pressure due
to the deterioration in pricing flexibility and payor mix, as well as increases in operating expenses that exceed increases in payments
under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 

21 

Anti-Kickback
Statute . A section of the Social Security Act known as the Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, the
offer, payment, solicitation or acceptance of remuneration, directly or indirectly, in return for referring an individual to a provider
of services for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal healthcare program, including the Medicare or Medicaid
programs. Courts have interpreted this statute broadly and held that the Anti-Kickback Statute is violated if just one purpose of the
remuneration is to generate referrals, even if there are other lawful purposes. The Affordable Care Act provides that knowledge of the
Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate the statute is not required in order to violate the Anti-Kickback Statute. Violation
of the Anti-Kickback Statute is a crime, punishable by fines of up to 25,000 per violation, five years imprisonment, or both. Violations
may also result in civil and administrative liability and sanctions, including civil penalties of up to 50,000 per violation, liability
under the False Claims Act, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and
additional monetary penalties in amounts treble to the underlying remuneration. 

There
are a limited number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors for categories of activities deemed protected from prosecution
under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Currently, there are statutory exceptions and safe harbors for various activities, including the following:
certain investment interests, space rental, equipment rental, practitioner recruitment, personnel services and management contracts,
sale of practice, referral services, warranties, discounts, employees, managed care arrangements, investments in group practices, freestanding
surgery centers, ambulance replenishing and referral agreements for specialty services. The safe harbor for space rental arrangements
requires, among other things, that the aggregate rental payments be set in advance, be consistent with fair market value and not be determined
in a manner that takes into account the volume or value of any referrals. The fact that conduct or a business arrangement does not fall
within a safe harbor does not necessarily render the conduct or business arrangement illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. However,
such conduct and business arrangements may lead to increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities. 

Many
states have laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute that regulate the exchange of remuneration in connection with the provision of
healthcare services, including prohibiting payments to physicians for patient referrals. The scope of these state laws is broad because
they can often apply regardless of the source of payment for care. These statutes typically provide for criminal and civil penalties,
as well as potential loss of facility licensure and eligibility for reimbursement by government payors. 

We
intend to use commercially reasonable efforts to structure our arrangements, including any lease/operating arrangements involving facilities
in which local physicians are investors, so as to satisfy, or meet as closely as possible, safe harbor requirements. The safe harbors
are narrowly structured, and there are not safe harbors available for every type of financial arrangement that we or our tenants/operators
may enter. Although it is our intention to fully comply with the Anti-Kickback Statue, as well as all other applicable state and federal
laws, we cannot assure you that all of our arrangements or the arrangements of our tenants/operators will meet all the conditions for
a safe harbor. There can be no assurance regulatory authorities enforcing these laws will determine our financial arrangements or the
financial relationships of our tenants/operators comply with the Anti-Kickback Statute or other similar laws and such regulatory authorities
or private qui tam relators bringing actions on behalf of government entities in exchange for a portion of any recovery may allege non-compliance
and seek financial or other penalties. 

Stark
Law . The Social Security Act also includes a provision commonly known as the Stark Law. The Stark Law is a strict liability
statute that prohibits a physician from making a referral to an entity furnishing designated health services paid by Medicare
or Medicaid if the physician or a member of the physician s immediate family has a financial relationship with that entity unless
an exception to the law is met. Designated health services include, among other services, inpatient and outpatient hospital services,
clinical laboratory services, physical therapy services and radiology services. The Stark Law also prohibits entities that provide designated
health services from billing the Medicare and Medicaid programs for any items or services that result from a prohibited referral and
requires the entities to refund amounts received for items or services provided pursuant to the prohibited referral. Sanctions for violating
the Stark Law are imposed without consideration to intent and include denial of payment, civil monetary penalties of up to 15,000 per
prohibited service provided for failure to return amounts received in a timely manner, and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
The statute also provides for a penalty of up to 100,000 for a circumvention scheme. Failure to refund amounts received pursuant to
a prohibited referral may also constitute a false claim and result in additional penalties under the False Claims Act, which is discussed
in greater detail below. 

22 

There
are exceptions to the self-referral prohibition for many of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and providers,
including employment contracts, leases and recruitment agreements. There is also an exception for a physician s ownership
interest in an entire hospital, as opposed to an ownership interest in a hospital department if such ownership interests and
capacity were in place as of March 23, 2010. Unlike safe harbors under the Anti-Kickback Statute, an arrangement must comply with
every requirement of a Stark Law exception, or the arrangement will be in violation of the Stark Law. Through a series of
rulemakings, CMS has issued final regulations implementing the Stark Law. While these regulations were intended to clarify the
requirements of the exceptions to the Stark Law, it is unclear how the government will interpret many of these exceptions for
enforcement purposes and even an inadvertent failure to comply with the strict requirements, such as assuring a signature, can
result in imposition of penalties under certain circumstances. 

Although
there is an exception for a physician s ownership interest in an entire hospital, the Affordable Care Act prohibits newly created
physician-owned hospitals from billing for Medicare patients referred by their physician owners. As a result, the law effectively prevents
the formation after December 31, 2010 of new physician-owned hospitals that participate in Medicare and Medicaid. While the Affordable
Care Act grandfathers existing physician-owned hospitals, it does not allow these hospitals to increase the percentage of physician ownership
and significantly restricts their ability to expand services. 

Many
states also have laws similar to the Stark Law that prohibit certain self-referrals. The scope of these state laws is broad because they
can often apply regardless of the source of payment for care, and little precedent exists for their interpretation or enforcement. These
statutes typically provide for criminal and civil penalties, as well as loss of facility licensure. 

Although
our lease agreements will require tenants to comply with the Stark Law, we cannot offer assurance that the arrangements entered into
by us or by our tenants/operators will be found to be in compliance with the Stark Law or similar state laws. 

The
False Claims Act . The federal False Claims Act prohibits knowingly making or presenting any false claim for payment to the federal
government. The government may use the False Claims Act to prosecute Medicare and other government program fraud in areas such as coding
errors, billing for services not provided, submitting false cost reports and failing to report and repay an overpayment within 60 days
of identifying the overpayment or by the date a corresponding cost report is due, whichever is later. The False Claims Act defines the
term knowingly broadly. Although simple negligence will not give rise to liability under the False Claims Act, submitting
a claim with reckless disregard to its truth or falsity or failing to correct an error with in specified period of time constitutes a
 knowing submission. 

The
False Claims Act contains qui tam, or whistleblower, provisions that allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government
alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government. Whistleblowers under the False Claims Act may collect a portion of
the government s recovery, which serves as an incentive to bring claims which then must be defended whether or not they have merit.
Every entity that receives at least 5 million annually in Medicaid payments must have written policies for all employees, contractors
or agents, providing detailed information about false claims, false statements and whistleblower protections under certain federal laws,
including the False Claims Act, and similar state laws. 

In
some cases, whistleblowers and the federal government have taken the position, and some courts have held, that providers who allegedly
have violated other statutes, such as the Anti-Kickback Statute and the Stark Law, have thereby submitted false claims under the False
Claims Act. The Affordable Care Act clarifies this issue with respect to the Anti-Kickback Statute by providing that submission of claims
for services or items generated in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim under the False Claims
Act. If a defendant is found liable under the False Claims Act, the defendant may be required to pay three times the actual damages sustained
by the government, additional civil penalties of up to 10,000 per false claim, plus reimbursement of the fees of counsel for the whistleblower. 

23 

Many
states have enacted similar statutes preventing the presentation of a false claim to a state government, and we expect more to do so
because the Social Security Act provides a financial incentive for states to enact statutes establishing state level liability. 

Other
Fraud Abuse Laws . There are various other fraud and abuse laws at both the federal and state levels that cover false claims
and false statements and these may impact our business. For example, the Civil Monetary Penalties law authorizes the imposition of monetary
penalties against an entity that engages in a number of prohibited activities. The penalties vary by the prohibited conduct, but include
penalties of 10,000 for each item or service, 15,000 for each individual with respect to whom false or misleading information was given,
and treble damages for the total amount of remuneration claimed. The prohibited actions include, but are not limited to, the following: 

knowingly presenting or causing to be presented, a claim for services not provided as claimed or which is otherwise false or fraudulent
in any way; 

knowingly giving or causing to be giving false or misleading information reasonably expected to influence the decision to discharge a
patient; 

offering or giving remuneration to any beneficiary of a federal healthcare program likely to influence the receipt of reimbursable items
or services; arranging for reimbursable services with an entity which is excluded from participation from a federal healthcare program;
or knowingly or willfully soliciting or receiving remuneration for a referral of a federal healthcare program beneficiary. 

Any
violations of the Civil Monetary Penalties Law by management or our tenants/operators could result in substantial fines and penalties,
and could have an adverse effect on our business. 

HIPAA
Administrative Simplification and Privacy and Security Requirements . HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, and its implementing regulations
create a national standard for protecting the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information (called protected
health information ). Compliance with HIPAA is mandatory for covered entities, which include healthcare providers such as tenants/operators
of our facilities. Compliance is also required for entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information on
behalf of healthcare providers or that perform services for healthcare providers that involve the disclosure of protected health information,
called business associates. 

Covered
entities must report a breach of protected health information that has not been secured through encryption or destruction to all affected
individuals without unreasonable delay, but in any case, no more than 60 days after the breach is discovered. Notification must also
be made to HHS and, in the case of a breach involving more than 500 individuals, to the media. In the final rule issued in January, 2013,
HHS modified the standard for determining whether a breach has occurred by creating a presumption that any non-permitted acquisition,
access, use or disclosure of protected health information is a breach unless the covered entity or business associate can demonstrate
that there is a low probability that the information has been compromised, based on a risk assessment. 

24 

Covered
entities and business associates are subject to civil penalties for violations of HIPAA of up to 1.5 million per year for violations
of the same requirement. In addition, criminal penalties can be imposed not only against covered entities and business associates, but
also against individual employees who obtain or disclose protected health information without authorization. The criminal penalties range
up to 250,000 and up to 10 years imprisonment. In addition, state Attorneys General may bring civil actions for HIPAA violations, HHS
must conduct periodic HIPAA compliance audits of covered entities and business associates. If any of our tenants/operators are subject
to an investigation or audit and found to be in violation of HIPAA, such tenants/operators could incur substantial penalties, which could
have a negative impact on their financial condition. Our tenants/operators may also be subject to more stringent state law privacy, security
and breach notification obligations. Enforcement of HIPAA and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH)
Act, which substantially augmented the requirements under HIPAA have become increasingly stringent and the penalties for non-compliance
have become increasingly harsh. 

Licensure,
Certification and Accreditation . Healthcare property construction and operation are subject to numerous federal, state and local
regulations relating to the adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures, maintenance of adequate
records, fire prevention, rate-setting and compliance with building codes and environmental protection laws. The requirements for licensure,
certification and accreditation are subject to change and, in order to remain qualified, it may become necessary for our tenants/operators
to make changes in their facilities, equipment, personnel and services. 

Facilities
in our portfolio will be subject to periodic inspection by governmental and other authorities to assure continued compliance with the
various standards necessary for licensing and accreditation. We will require our healthcare properties to be properly licensed under
applicable state laws. Except for provider types not eligible for participation in Medicare and Medicaid, we expect our tenant/operators
to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and, where applicable, to be accredited by an approved accrediting organization
which is also often a requirement for Medicare certification. The loss of Medicare or Medicaid certification would result in our tenants/operators
that operate Medicare/Medicaid-eligible providers from receiving reimbursement from federal healthcare programs. The loss of accreditation,
where applicable, would result in increased scrutiny by CMS and likely the loss of payment from non-government payers which often condition
participation and payment on participation in the Medicare program. 

In
some states, the construction or expansion of healthcare properties, the acquisition of existing facilities, the transfer or change of
ownership and the addition of new beds or services may be subject to review by and prior approval of, or notifications to, state regulatory
agencies under a Certificate of Need, or CON program. Such laws generally require the reviewing state agency to determine the public
need for additional or expanded healthcare properties and services and have begun to expect some level of revenue from enforcement action
in their budget planning. Some states in which we operate have also adopted limitations on the opening of new skilled nursing facilities.
See Item 1. Business Skilled nursing facility industry Business in the United States. The requirements for licensure,
certification and accreditation also include notification or approval in the event of the transfer or change of ownership or certain
other changes. Further, federal programs, including Medicare, must be notified in the event of a change of ownership or change of information
at a participating provider. Failure by our tenants/operators to provide required federal and state notifications, obtain necessary state
licensure and CON approvals could result in significant penalties as well as prevent the completion of an acquisition or effort to expand
services or facilities. We may be required to provide ownership information or otherwise participate in certain of these approvals and
notifications. 

Antitrust
Laws . The federal government and most states have enacted antitrust laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anti-skilled
nursing facilities. These laws prohibit price fixing, concerted refusal to deal, market allocation, monopolization, attempts to monopolize,
price discrimination, tying arrangements, exclusive dealing, acquisitions of competitors and other practices that have, or may have,
an adverse effect on competition. Violations of federal or state antitrust laws can result in various sanctions, including criminal and
civil penalties. Antitrust enforcement in the healthcare industry is currently a priority of the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice. We intend to operate so that we and our tenants/operators are in compliance with such federal
and state laws, but future review by courts or regulatory authorities could result in a determination that could adversely affect the
operations of our tenants/operators and, consequently, our operations. In addition to enforcement by Federal and State agencies, in an
effort to control health care costs, private payors such as employee welfare benefit plans administered by or for employers or unions
have become increasing aggressive in bringing actions against providers alleging violations of antitrust laws. 

25 

Healthcare
Industry Investigations . Significant media and public attention has focused in recent years on the healthcare industry. The federal
government is dedicated to funding additional federal enforcement activities related to healthcare providers and preventing fraud and
abuse. Our tenants/operators will engage in many routine healthcare operations and other activities that could be the subject of governmental
investigations or inquiries. For example, our tenants/operators will likely have significant Medicare and Medicaid billings, numerous
financial arrangements with physicians who are referral sources, and joint venture arrangements involving physician investors. In recent
years, Congress and the States have increased the level of funding for fraud and abuse enforcement activities. It is possible that governmental
entities could initiate investigations or litigation in the future and that such proceedings could result in significant costs and penalties,
as well as adverse publicity. It is also possible that our executives could be included in governmental investigations or litigation
or named as defendants in private litigation. 

Governmental
agencies and their agents, such as the Medicare Administrative Contractors, fiscal intermediaries and carriers, as well as the HHS-OIG,
CMS and state Medicaid programs, may conduct audits of our tenants/operator s operations. Private payers may conduct similar post-payment
audits, and our tenants/operators may also perform internal audits and monitoring. Many of these audits employ the use of statistical
sampling and extrapolation whereby a small number of claims are reviewed but adverse results are applied against a provider s claims
for long periods of time. Depending on the nature of the conduct found in such audits and whether the underlying conduct could be considered
systemic such that results are extrapolated, the resolution of these audits which can often require substantial repayments could have
a material, adverse effect on our portfolio s financial position, results of operations and liquidity. 

Under
the Recovery Audit Contractor, or RAC program, CMS contracts with RACs on a contingency basis to conduct post-payment reviews to detect
and correct improper payments in the fee-for-service Medicare program, to managed Medicare plans and in the Medicaid program. CMS has
also initiated a RAC prepayment demonstration program in 11 states. CMS also employs Medicaid Integrity Contractors, or MICs to perform
post-payment audits of Medicaid claims and identify overpayments. In addition to RACs and MICs, the state Medicaid agencies and other
contractors have increased their review activities. Aside from the costs associated with responding to a myriad of requests for substantiation
of services, should any of our tenants/operators be found out of compliance with any of these laws, regulations or programs, our business,
our financial position and our results of operations could be negatively impacted. 

Environmental
Matters 

A
wide variety of federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect healthcare property
operations. These complex federal and state statutes, and their enforcement, involve a myriad of regulations, many of which involve strict
liability on the part of the potential offender. Some of these federal and state statutes may directly impact us. Under various federal,
state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner of real property or a secured lender, such as us, may be liable
for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at, under or disposed of in connection with such property, as
well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances (including government fines and damages for injuries to persons
and adjacent property). The cost of any required remediation, removal, fines or personal or property damages and the owner s or
secured lender s liability therefore could exceed or impair the value of the property, and/or the assets of the owner or secured
lender. In addition, the presence of such substances, or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances, may adversely
affect the owner s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which, in turn, could reduce
our revenues. 

26 

Prior
to closing any property acquisition or loan, we ordinarily obtain Phase I environmental assessments in order to attempt to identify potential
environmental concerns at the facilities. These assessments will be carried out in accordance with an appropriate level of due diligence
and will generally include a physical site inspection, a review of relevant federal, state and local environmental and health agency
database records, one or more interviews with appropriate site-related personnel, review of the property s chain of title and review
of historic aerial photographs and other information on past uses of the property. We may also conduct limited subsurface investigations
and test for substances of concern where the results of the Phase I environmental assessments or other information indicates possible
contamination or where our consultants recommend such procedures. 

Americans
with Disabilities Act 

Our
properties must comply with Title III of the ADA to the extent that such properties are public accommodations as defined
by the ADA. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our
properties where such removal is readily achievable. Many States and localities have similar requirements that are in addition to, and
sometime more stringent than, Federal requirements. We believe the existing properties are in substantial compliance with the ADA and
that we will not be required to make substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA. However, noncompliance
with the ADA or a comparable State or local requirement could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants.
The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our properties and to make
alterations as appropriate in this respect. 

Emerging
Growth Company Status 

We
are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act, and we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions
from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, 
including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure
obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding
a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
We have not yet made a decision as to whether we will take advantage of any or all of these exemptions. If we do take advantage of any
of these exemptions, we do not know if some investors will find common stock less attractive as a result. The result may be a less active
trading market for common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. 

In
addition, the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period
provided in the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can
delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected
to avail ourselves of the extended transition period for adopting new or revised accounting standards available to emerging growth companies. 

We
will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which
our total annual revenue equals or exceeds 1.07 billion (subject to adjustment for inflation), (ii) the last day of the fiscal year
following the fifth anniversary of the first sale of shares pursuant to a registration statement filed under the Securities Act, (iii)
the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than 1 billion in non-convertible debt or (iv) the date
on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the Exchange Act. 

Human
Capital Resource Management 

As
of December 31, 2022, we had 8 full-time employees. Our employees are primarily located at our corporate office in Chicago. Our employees
are not members of any labor union, and we consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory. 

27 

We
endeavor to maintain workplaces that are free from discrimination or harassment on the basis of color, race, sex, national origin, ethnicity,
religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identification or expression or any other status protected by applicable law. The
basis for recruitment, hiring, development, training, compensation and advancement at the Company is qualifications, performance, skills
and experience. We believe our employees are fairly compensated, and compensation and promotion decisions are made without regard to
gender, race and ethnicity. Employees are routinely recognized for outstanding performance. 

Insurance 

We
require our tenants to maintain general liability, professional liability, all risks and other insurance coverages and to name us as
an additional insured under these policies. We believe that the policy specifications and insured limits are appropriate given the relative
risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice.

ITEM
3. Legal Proceedings 

We
are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings other than the following: 

In
March 2020, Joseph Schwartz, Rosie Schwartz and certain companies owned by them filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Illinois against Moishe Gubin, Michael Blisko, the Predecessor Company and 21 of its subsidiaries, as well as
the operators of 17 of the facilities operated at our properties. The complaint was related to the Predecessor Company s
acquisition of 16 properties located in Arkansas and Kentucky that were completed between May 2018 and April 2019 and the attempt to
purchase an additional five properties located in Massachusetts. The complaint was dismissed by the Court in 2020 on jurisdictional grounds. The plaintiffs did not file an appeal with respect to this action, and the time for an appeal has
expired. 

In
August 2020, Joseph Schwartz, Rosie Schwartz and several companies controlled by them filed a second complaint in the Circuit Court in
Pulaski County, Arkansas. The second complaint had nearly identical claims as the federal case, but was limited to matters related to
the Predecessor Company s acquisition of properties located in Arkansas. The sellers, which were affiliates of Skyline Health Care,
had encountered financial difficulties and requested the Predecessor Company to acquire these properties. The defendants have filed an
answer denying the plaintiffs claims and asserting counterclaims based on breach of contract. The parties are currently engaged
in discovery. 

In
January 2021, Joseph Schwartz, Rosie Schwartz and certain companies owned by them filed a third complaint in Illinois state court in
Cook County, Illinois, which has nearly identical claims to the initial federal case, but was limited to claims related to the Kentucky
and Massachusetts properties. The complaint has not been properly served on any of the defendants, and, accordingly, the defendants did
not responded to the complaint. Instead, the defendants filed a motion to quash service of process. On January 11, 2023, the Cook County
Circuit Court entered an order granting such motion, quashing service of process on all defendants. In March 2023, the plaintiffs filed
a new complaint and again attempted to serve it on the defendants. It is the defendants position that service was defective and
they intend to take appropriate steps to challenge the services and to have the complaint again dismissed. 

In
each of these complaints, the plaintiffs asserted claims for fraud, breach of contract and rescission arising out of the defendants alleged
failure to perform certain post-closing obligations under the purchase contracts. We have potential direct exposure for these claims
because the subsidiaries of the Predecessor Company that were named as defendants are now subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership.
Additionally, the Operating Partnership is potentially liable for the claims made against Moishe Gubin, Michael Blisko and the Predecessor
Company pursuant to the provisions of the contribution agreement, under which the Operating Partnership assumed all of the liabilities
of the Predecessor Company and agreed to indemnify the Predecessor Company and its affiliates for such liabilities. We and the named
defendants believe that the claims set forth in the complaints are without merit. The named defendants intend to vigorously defend the
litigation and to assert counterclaims against the plaintiffs based on their failure to fulfill their obligations under the purchase
contracts, interim management agreement, and operations transfer agreements. We believe this matter will be resolved without a material
adverse effect to the Company. 

As noted above, the March
2020 and January 2021 complaints also related to the Predecessor Company s planned acquisition of five properties located in
Massachusetts. A subsidiary of the Predecessor Company purchased loans related to these properties in 2018 for a price of 7.74
million with the expectation that the subsidiaries would acquire title to the properties and the loans would be retired. The
subsidiary subsequently advanced 3.1 million under the loans to satisfy other liabilities related to the properties. The planned
acquisition/settlement with the sellers/owners and/borrowers was not consummated because the underlying tenants of the properties surrendered their licenses to operate healthcare facilities on these properties. 

The Predecessor Company intends
to institute legal proceedings to collect the outstanding amount of these loans and to assert related claims against the sellers and their
principals for the unpaid principal balances as well as protective advances and collection costs. In connection with enforcing their rights,
in July 2022, the Company foreclosed, and (as lender) sold four of the five properties at auction for the total amount of 4.4 million.
In December 2022, the Company took title on the fifth property with an estimated fair value of 1.2 million.

Overview 

Strawberry
Fields REIT, Inc. (the Company is engaged in the ownership, acquisition, financing and triple-net leasing of skilled nursing
facilities and other post-acute healthcare properties. Currently, our portfolio consists of 79 healthcare properties with an aggregate
of 10,351 licensed beds. We hold fee title to 78 of these properties and hold one property under a long-term lease. These properties
are located in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas. We generate substantially all our
revenues by leasing our properties to tenants under long-term leases primarily on a triple-net basis, under which the tenant pays the
cost of real estate taxes, insurance and other operating costs of the facility and capital expenditures. Each healthcare facility located
at our properties is managed by a qualified operator with an experienced management team. 

We
employ a disciplined approach in our investment strategy by investing in healthcare real estate assets. We seek to invest in assets that
will provide attractive opportunities for dividend growth and appreciation in asset value, while maintaining balance sheet strength and
liquidity, thereby creating long-term stockholder value. We expect to grow our portfolio by diversifying our investments by tenant, facility
type and geography. 

We
are entitled to monthly rent paid by the tenants and we do not receive any income or bear any expenses from the operations of such facilities.
As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate annualized average base rent under the leases for our properties was approximately 82.5 million. 

We
elect to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ending December 31, 2022. We are organized
in an UPREIT structure in which we own substantially all of our assets and conduct substantially all of our business through the Operating
Partnership. We are the general partner of the Operating Partnership and as of the date of the report own approximately 12.0 of the
outstanding OP units. 

Recent
Developments 

COVID-19
Update 

The
pandemic caused by the coronavirus known as COVID-19 has not had a material adverse effect on the Company s financial performance,
results of operations, liquidity or access to financing. However, the Company s operations and financial performance are dependent
on the ability of its tenants to meet their lease obligations to the Company. 

To
the Company s knowledge and based on information provided to the Company by our tenants, the financial effects of the pandemic
on the Company s tenants have increased operating costs resulting from the implementation of safety protocols and procedures our
tenants are taking to prevent and mitigate the potential outbreak and spread of COVID-19 at their facilities. Our tenants are also experiencing
labor shortages resulting in limited admissions, reduced occupancy and higher agency expenses. The Company believes that the declines
in occupancy were primarily due to declining referrals as a result of hospitals postponing elective surgeries as well as patients 
concerns regarding the risk of infection from COVID-19. 

32 

As
a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our tenants have received financial support under several government programs. These programs consisted
of forgivable loans under Paycheck Protection Program, grants to operators under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES)
Act in an amount equal to 2 of their historical annual revenues, accelerated payments under Medicare, and increased funding for Medicaid
patients by some state governments. The financial support provisions of the CARES Act expired during 2022. 

The
Company s management does not expect that the discontinuation of these government programs will have a material adverse effect
on the tenants ability to pay rent for four reasons. First, the Company s management believes that most nursing home residents
in the United States have received vaccines for COVID-19, which have been effective in preventing serious illness. Second, occupancy
significantly increased between April 2021 and March 2023. Third, most of the Company s tenants have the ability to maintain profitability
notwithstanding the decrease in revenues because approximately 85 to 90 of their operating costs are variable items (such as labor
costs, food, drugs and supplies, including personal protection equipment and cleaning supplies) that can be reduced when occupancy decreases. 

To
the Company s knowledge, its tenants are complying with all applicable governmental requirements and guidelines for addressing
the risks posed by COVID-19. Although there have been a limited number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 at the facilities operated by the
Company s tenants, to its knowledge, other than our tenants operated under two master leases for a combine six facilities in central
Illinois, these cases have not had a material impact on any of the operators. 

Other
Recent Developments 

On
April 4, 2022, we were notified that the tenants under the master leases for 6 facilities located in central Illinois intended to default
with respect to their lease agreements due to operating losses. The tenants indicated that their operating losses were due in part to
decreased occupancy caused by COVID-19. The tenants are affiliates of Steven Blisko, who is the brother of Michael Blisko, one of our
directors. These leases provided for a combined rent of 225,000 per month, or 2.7 million per year. All payments due under these leases
were paid through mid-June 2022. On July 1, 2022, the Company entered into new lease agreements with an unaffiliated third-party operator
to lease these properties. The new leases have terms of 10 years each and provide for a combined average base rent of 180,000 per month,
or 2.3 million per year over the life of the leases. The Company recognized a loss of approximately 1,075,000 in the second quarter
of 2022 due to the write-off of straight-line rent receivable related to the former leases. 

In
October 2022, the Company extended a line of credit in the amount of 2.5 million to the new tenants for the Southern Illinois properties.
This line of credit is secured by accounts receivable of the tenants. The line of credit bears interest at the greater of the prime rate
or 4 per annum, plus margin of 2.75 . The maturity date of the line of credit is August 31, 2024. 

On
January 3, 2023, the Company acquired the underlying property for 6.0 million, including 1 million in finder fees and 0.7
million in leasehold improvements, which was paid in cash. This property contains a skilled nursing facility with 120 licensed beds
and approximately 34,824 square feet. Concurrently with the closing of the acquisition, we added the property to an existing master
lease with an unaffiliated third-party operator. The lease has an initial term of 10 years, with two 5-year extension options.
The initial annualized base rent is 600,000 with 3 annual rent escalation. In addition, the loan made
in August 2022 to the seller was repaid at closing. 

During
February 2023, the Company issued an additional NIS 40.00 million in par value of Series C Bonds and received a gross
amount of 10.73 million (NIS 38.1 million). The debentures were issued at a price of 95.25 . 

In
February 2023 one of the SNF s owned by the Company in Southern Illinois was closed. The closure was a result of the tenant request
and mainly for efficiency reasons. This SNF is under a master lease with 5 other facilities and the full amount of the rental
payment under the master lease are continuing to be paid. 

33 

As
of the date of this report, none of the Company s tenants are delinquent on the payment of rent, and none of them have requested
the Company to amend the terms of their leases to reduce current or future lease payments. 

Related
Party Tenants 

As
a landlord, the Company does not control the operations of its tenants, including related party tenants, and is not able to cause its
tenants to take any specific actions to address trends in occupancy at the facilities operated by its tenants, other than to monitor
occupancy and income of its tenants, discuss trends in occupancy with tenants and possible responses, and, in the event of a default,
to exercise its rights as a landlord. However, Moishe Gubin, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Michael Blisko, one of our
directors, as the controlling members of 41 of our tenants and related operators, have the ability to obtain information regarding these
tenants and related operators and cause the tenants and operators to take actions, including with respect to occupancy.

Rental
revenues: Rental revenues during 2022 increased by 5.5 million or 6.3 compared to fiscal year 2021 due to the six new
properties acquired in August of 2021. This increase was offset by a one-time loss of 1.1 million in the second quarter of 2022
due to the write-offs of straight-line rent receivables related to certain defaulted leases. Additionally, revenue was increased by
 1.9 million due to additional property taxes being reimbursed by the tenants. 

Depreciation
and Amortization: Increase in depreciation of 1.07 million or 4.4 from fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2022 is primarily due
to 64.1 million of new real estate investments in the third quarter of 2021. 

General
and Administrative Expense: Decrease in general and administrative expenses of 0.3 million or 4.5 during fiscal year 2022
compared to fiscal year 2021 is primarily due to no stock-based compensation expense in 2022. In 2021, 250,000 of stock-based
compensation was recognized. 

Property
and other Taxes: The increase in property taxes of 2.5 million or 23.6 during fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 is
primarily due to increases in real estate taxes on gross leased properties and Tennessee franchise taxes paid in 2022. 

(Credit)
Provision for Doubtful Accounts: During 2022, the Company recognized 5.6 million in income from the successful foreclosure of mortgages
held by the Company on properties located in Massachusetts with respect to loans written off on December 31, 2021. The decrease in the
provision for doubtful accounts of 10.8 million is primarily related to this recovery. 

Interest
expense, net: The decrease in interest expense of 0.8 million or 3.6 from Fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2022 is primarily
related to lower amount of bond principal and decline in total debt. 

Gain
from Sale of Real Estate Investments: There were no gains from the sale of real estate during 2022 because there were no asset dispositions
during this year. 

Foreign
Currency Transaction Loss: Our bond indebtedness is denominated in NIS. As
a result, we are subject to potential foreign currency transaction loss due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to
the New Israel Shekel. In 2022, we recorded a foreign currency transaction loss of 10.9 million in
connection with the repayment of the Series B Bonds in 2022 

Net
Income: The increase in net income from 8.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 to 16.4 million in the year ended
December 31, 2022 is mainly due to increases in rental revenue (net of increase in real estate taxes) and recoveries of provisions made during fiscal year 2021 offset by the
increase in foreign currency transaction losses of 2.2 million, and the absence of the 3.8 million in gain from sale of real
estate investments recorded in 2021. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

To
qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we are required to distribute at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, determined
without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains, to our stockholders on an annual basis. Accordingly,
we intend to make, but are not contractually bound to make, regular quarterly dividends to common stockholders from cash flow from operating
activities. All such dividends are at the discretion of our board of directors. 

As
of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and equivalents of 45.7 million. We also had the ability
to offer additional Series C Bonds from the current outstanding of 55.69 million up to 179 million subject to compliance with covenants
and market conditions. 

35 

Liquidity
is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund and maintain
our assets and operations, make distributions to our stockholders and other general business needs. Our primary sources of cash include
operating cash flows and borrowings. Our primary uses of cash include funding acquisitions and investments consistent with
our investment strategy, repaying principal and interest on any outstanding borrowings, making distributions to our equity holders, funding
our operations and paying accrued expenses. 

Our
long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the costs of acquiring additional healthcare properties and
principal and interest payments on our debt. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital,
including future equity issuances or debt offerings, net cash provided by operations, long-term mortgage indebtedness and other secured
and unsecured borrowings. 

We
may utilize various types of debt to finance a portion of our acquisition activities, including long-term, fixed-rate mortgage loans,
variable-rate term loans and secured revolving lines of credit. As of December 31, 2022, on a consolidated basis, we had total indebtedness
of approximately 456.8 million, consisting of 275.8 million in HUD guaranteed debt, 75.8 million in net Series A Bonds and Series
C Bonds outstanding and 105.2 in commercial mortgages. Under our Bonds and our commercial mortgages, we are subject to continuing covenants,
and future indebtedness that we may incur, may contain similar provisions. In the event of a default, the lenders could accelerate the
timing of payments under the debt obligations, and we may be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources, which may not
be available on attractive terms, or at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition, results
of operations and ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 

Our
debt arrangements may require us to make a lump-sum or balloon payment at maturity. Our ability to make the balloon payments
due under our existing and future indebtedness will depend on our working capital at the time of repayment, our ability to obtain additional
financing or our ability to sell any property securing such indebtedness. At the time the balloon payment is due, we may or may not be
able to refinance the existing financing on terms as favorable as the original bond or loan or sell any related property at a price sufficient
to make the balloon payment. In addition, balloon payments and payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness may leave us with
insufficient cash to pay the distributions that we are required to pay to qualify and maintain our qualification as a REIT. 

Through
2027 there are two balloon payment obligations consisting of a payment of 44.9 million due under the Series C Bonds in 2026 and a payment
of 86.0 million due under our commercial bank term loan due in 2027. We may also obtain additional financing that contains balloon payment
obligations. These types of obligations may materially adversely affect us, including our cash flows, financial condition and ability
to make distributions. 

The
Company believes that its overall level of indebtedness is appropriate for the Company s business in light of its cash flow from
operations and value of its properties and is generally typical for owners of multiple healthcare properties. The Company expects to
generate sufficient positive cash flow from operations to meet its ongoing debt service obligations and the distribution requirements
for maintaining REIT status

Net
cash provided by operating activities increased 6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year
ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase of 8 million in net income. 

Cash
used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily consisted of a net increase in notes receivable of 9.6
million, of which 8.0 million is a result of a note purchased related to our Arkansas properties and a loan of 2 million made to
an unaffiliated nursing home operator in Illinois. The decrease of 48.2 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 is due
to the decrease in real estate purchases partially offset by changes in notes receivables. 

Cash
flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 were primarily comprised of 106 million in principal bond
payments, REIT dividends of 0.6 million, a 10.9 million in distribution to the non-controlling interest holders and a decrease of
 33.2 million in senior debt offset by a 105.0 million new borrowings under a mortgage loan facility. Cash flows generated from
financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 were primarily comprised of 63 million in new bond proceeds and proceeds
from the sale of bonds held by a subsidiary of 1.7 million. These amounts were offset by 22.4 million in principal bond payments,
 17.2 million of repayment of senior debt and payment of preferred dividends by the Predecessor Company of 1.5 million. 

Indebtedness 

Mortgage
Loans Guaranteed by HUD 

As
of December 31, 2022, we had non-recourse mortgage loans of 275.8 million from third party lenders that were guaranteed by HUD. 

Each
loan is secured by first mortgages on certain specified properties, interests in the leases for these properties and second liens on
the operator s assets. In the event of default on any single loan, the loan agreement provides that the applicable lender may require
the tenants for the property securing the loan to make all rental payments directly to the lender. In exchange for the HUD guarantee,
we pay HUD, on an annual basis, 0.65 of the principal balance of each loan as mortgage insurance premium, in addition to the interest
rate denominated in each loan agreement. As a result, the overall average interest rate paid with respect to the HUD guaranteed loans
as of December 31, 2022, was 3.88 per annum (including the mortgage insurance payments). The loans have an average maturity of 25.0
years. 

37 

Commercial
Bank Term Loan 

On
March 21, 2022, the Company closed a mortgage loan facility with a commercial bank pursuant to which the Company borrowed approximately
 105 million. The facility provides for monthly payments of principal based on a 20-year amortization with a balloon payment due in March
2027. The rate is based on the one-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus a margin of 3.5 and a floor of 4 
(as of the December 31, 2022 the rate was 7.68 ). As of December 31, 2022, total outstanding principal amount was 102.39 million. This
loan is collateralized by 21 properties owned by the Company. The loan proceeds were used to repay the Series B Bonds and prepay
commercial loans not secured by HUD guarantees. The Company recognized a foreign currency transaction loss of approximately 10.1 million
in connection with the repayment of the Series B Bonds during the year ended December 31, 2022. 

The
new credit facility financial covenants consist of (i) a covenant that the ratio of the Company s indebtedness to its EBITDA cannot
exceed 8.0 to 1, (ii) a covenant that the ratio of the Company s net operating income to its debt service before dividend distribution
is at least 1.20 to 1.00 for each fiscal quarter as measured pursuant to the terms of the loan agreement (iii) a covenant that the ratio
of the Company s net operating income to its debt service after dividend distribution is at least 1.05 to 1.00 for each fiscal
quarter as measured pursuant to the terms of the loan agreement, and (iii) a covenant that the Company s GAAP equity is at least
 20,000,000. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with the loan covenants. 

Other
Debt 

As
of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had 0 and 1.4 million, respectively, in outstanding amounts due under notes
due to sellers of properties. 

Outstanding
Bond Debt 

As
of December 31, 2022, the Company had outstanding Series A Bonds and Series C Bonds. 

Series
A Bonds 

In
November 2015, Strawberry Fields REIT, Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company BVI Company issued Series A
Bonds in the face amount of New Israeli Shekels NIS 265.2 million 68 million) and received the net amount, after
issuance costs, NIS 251.2 million 64.3 million). During September 2016, the BVI Company issued additional Series A Bonds in the
face amount of NIS 70.0 million 18.6 million) and raised a net amount of NIS 70.8 million 18.8 million). These Series A Bonds
were issued at a premium of 103.6 . During May 2017, the BVI Company issued additional Series A Bonds in the face amount of NIS 39.0
million 10.7 million) and raised a net amount of NIS 40.9 million 11.3 million). These Series A Bonds were issued at a price of
105.9 . 

A
portion of the Series A Bonds have been repurchased by a subsidiary of the BVI Company. As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate principal
amount of the Series A Bonds was NIS 74.9 million 21.2 million). As of December 31, 2022, we held NIS 3.7 million 1.0 million) of
these Bonds that we have repurchased. On July 4, 2022, Standard Poor s upgraded the rating on Bond A from ilA- to ilA, and
interest rate was decreased from 6.9 to 6.4 . 

The
Series A Bonds are traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange Ltd. TASE ). 

Series
C Bonds

Funds
From Operations FFO 

The
Company believes that net income as defined by GAAP is the most appropriate earnings measure. We also believe that funds from
operations FFO ), as defined in accordance with the definition used by the National Association of Real Estate
Investment Trusts NAREIT ), and adjusted funds from operations AFFO are important non-GAAP
supplemental measures of our operating performance. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets
requires straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets
diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other
conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less
informative. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost
depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. FFO is defined as net income, computed in
accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, plus real estate depreciation and amortization. AFFO
is defined as FFO excluding the impact of straight-line rent, above-/below-market leases, non-cash compensation and certain
non-recurring items. For the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we excluded as non-recurring items the amount of 10.9 million
and 8.8 million, respectively, in reclassification of foreign currency transaction losses the Company recorded with respect to
foreign currency fluctuations that the Company realized at the time of bond principal payment. We believe that the use of FFO,
combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of our operating results among investors and makes
comparisons of operating results among REITs more meaningful. We consider FFO and AFFO to be useful measures for reviewing
comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding the applicable items listed above, FFO and AFFO can help
investors compare our operating performance between periods or as compared to other companies. 

While
FFO and AFFO are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of REITs, they do not represent cash flows from operations
or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating
performance. FFO and AFFO also do not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to our real estate assets nor do
they purport to be indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. Further, our computation of FFO and AFFO may not
be comparable to FFO and AFFO reported by other REITs that do not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that
interpret the current NAREIT definition or define AFFO differently than we do. 

The following table reconciles our calculations of FFO and AFFO for the
years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure (in thousands):

Dividend
Plans 

We
are required to pay dividends in order to maintain our REIT status and we expect to make quarterly dividend payments in cash with the
annual dividend amount no less than 90 of our annual REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction
and excluding any net capital gains. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, in the United
States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Management considers accounting estimates or assumptions critical in either of the following cases: 

the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material because of the levels of subjectivity and judgment needed to account for matters
that are highly uncertain and susceptible to change; and 

the effect of the estimates and assumptions is material to the consolidated financial statements. 

Management
believes the current assumptions used to make estimates in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are appropriate and
not likely to change in the future. However, actual experience could differ from the assumptions used to make estimates, resulting in
changes that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity. These
estimates will be made and evaluated on an on-going basis using information that is available as well as various other assumptions believed
to be reasonable under the circumstances. 

The
following presents information about our critical accounting policies including the material assumptions used to develop significant
estimates. Since the Company was recently formed and just completed the formation transactions, certain of these critical accounting
policies contain discussion of judgments and estimates that have not yet been required by management but that it believes may be reasonably
required of it to make in the future. 

40 

Principles
of Consolidation 

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our Operating Partnership and its wholly owned subsidiaries, and all material
intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. 

From
inception, we continually evaluate all of our transactions and investments to determine if they represent variable interests subject
to the variable interest entity, or VIE, consolidation model and then determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary
of its operations. We make judgments about which entities are VIEs based on an assessment of whether (i) the equity investors as a group,
if any, do not have a controlling financial interest, or (ii) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s
activities without additional subordinated financial support. We consolidate investments in VIEs when we are determined to be the primary
beneficiary. This evaluation is based on our ability to direct and influence the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact that
entity s economic performance. 

For
investments not subject to the variable interest entity consolidation model, we will evaluate the type of rights held by the limited
partner(s) or other member(s), which may preclude consolidation in circumstances in which the sole general partner or managing member
would otherwise consolidate the limited partnership. The assessment of limited partners or members rights and their impact
on the presumption of control over a limited partnership or limited liability corporation by the sole general partner or managing member
should be made when an investor becomes the sole general partner or managing member and should be reassessed if (i) there is a change
to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of the limited partners or members, (ii) the sole general partner or member increases
or decreases its ownership in the limited partnership or corporation, or (iii) there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding
limited partnership or membership interests. 

Our
ability to assess correctly our influence or control over an entity at inception of our involvement or on a continuous basis when determining
the primary beneficiary of a VIE affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements. Subsequent evaluations
of the primary beneficiary of a VIE may require the use of different assumptions that could lead to identification of a different primary
beneficiary, resulting in a different consolidation conclusion than what was determined at inception of the arrangement. 

Revenue
Recognition 

We
recognize rental revenue for operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term when collectability is reasonably assured
and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of a leased asset. For assets acquired subject to leases, we recognize
revenue upon acquisition of the asset provided the tenant has taken possession or control of the physical use of the leased asset. If
the lease provides for tenant improvements, we determine whether the tenant improvements, for accounting purposes, are owned by the tenant
or us. When we are the owner of the tenant improvements, the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control
of the physical leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed. 

When
the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements, any tenant improvement allowance funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized
as a reduction of revenue over the lease term. The determination of ownership of the tenant improvements is subject to significant judgment.
If our assessment of the owner of the tenant improvements for accounting purposes were different, the timing and amount of our revenue
recognized would be impacted. 

We
monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and operators on a continuous basis to determine the need for an allowance
for doubtful accounts, including an allowance for operating lease straight-line rent receivables, for estimated losses resulting from
tenant defaults or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments. This evaluation considers industry
and economic conditions, property performance, credit enhancements and other factors. For straight-line rent amounts, our assessment
is based on income recoverable over the term of the lease. We exercise judgment in establishing allowances and consider payment history
and current credit status in developing these estimates. These estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our
consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021 we determined that no allowance was necessary to cover the potential
loss of rent from our tenants. 

41 

Real
Estate Investments 

We
make estimates as part of our allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions (whether an asset acquisition acquired via purchase/leaseback
or a business combination via an asset acquired from the current lessor) to the various components of the acquisition based upon the
relative fair value of each component for asset acquisitions and at fair value of each component for business combinations. In making
estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase prices of acquired real estate, we utilize a number of sources, including
independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property and other market
data. We also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing
activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired. The most significant components of our allocations
are typically the allocation of fair value to land and buildings and, for certain of our acquisitions, in-place leases and other intangible
assets. In the case of the fair value of buildings and the allocation of value to land and other intangibles, the estimates of the values
of these components will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of the property
acquired or the remaining lease term. In the case of the value of in-place leases, including the assessment as to the existence of any
above-or below-market in-place leases, our management makes its best estimates based on the evaluation of the specific characteristics
of each tenant s lease. Factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, market
conditions and costs to execute similar leases. These assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the
remaining lease term for the acquired in-place leases. The values of any identified above-or below-market in-place leases are based on
the present value of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) management s
estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable
term of the lease, or for below-market in-place leases including any bargain renewal option terms. Above-market lease values are recorded
as a reduction of rental income over the lease term while below-market lease values are recorded as an increase to rental income over
the lease term. The recorded values of in-place lease intangibles are recognized in amortization expense over the initial term of the
respective leases. 

We
evaluate each purchase transaction to determine whether the acquired assets meet the definition of a business. Transaction costs related
to acquisitions that are not deemed to be businesses are included in the cost basis of the acquired assets, while transaction costs related
to acquisitions that are deemed to be businesses are expensed as incurred. 

Asset
Impairment 

Real
estate asset impairment losses are recorded when events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset is impaired and the estimated
undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset are less than its carrying amount. Management assesses the impairment of properties
individually and impairment losses are calculated as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of assets to be held and used,
and carrying amount over the fair value less cost to sell in instances where management has determined that we will dispose of the property.
In determining fair value, we use current appraisals or other third-party opinions of value and other estimates of fair value such as
estimated discounted future cash flows. 

Factors
That May Influence Future Results of Operations 

Our
revenues are primarily derived from rents we earn pursuant to the lease agreements we enter into with our tenants. Our tenants operate
in the healthcare industry, generally providing nursing and medical care to patients. The capacity of our tenants to pay our rents is
dependent upon their ability to conduct their operations at profitable levels. We believe that the business environment of the industry
segments in which our tenants operate is generally positive for efficient operators. However, our tenants operations are subject
to economic, regulatory and market conditions that may affect their profitability, which could impact our results of operations. Accordingly,
we actively monitor certain key factors, including changes in those factors that we believe may provide early indications of conditions
that may affect the level of risk in our lease portfolio. 

42 

Key
factors that we consider in underwriting prospective tenants and borrowers and in monitoring the performance of existing tenants include,
but are not limited to, the following: 

the current, historical and projected cash flow and operating margins of each tenant and at each facility; 

the ratio of our tenants operating earnings both to facility rent and to facility rent plus other fixed costs, including debt
costs; 

the quality and experience of the tenant and its management team; 

construction quality, condition, design and projected capital needs of the facility; 

the location of the facility; 

local economic and demographic factors and the competitive landscape of the market; 

the effect of evolving healthcare legislation and other regulations on our tenants profitability and liquidity; 

the payor mix of private, Medicare and Medicaid patients at the facility; and 

whether such tenants are related parties. 

One
of our goals is to reduce our dependence on related party tenants in order to diversify our tenant base. Although we expect to continue
to lease properties to related party tenants in markets in which the related party tenants have substantial experience and operations,
we intend to lease properties in other markets to unrelated tenants if we are able to identify qualified operators. Additionally, we
will consider leasing properties to unrelated parties in markets in which related parties operate if we are able to identify qualified
operators that are willing to lease properties on terms that are no less favorable than those available from related parties. 

We
also actively monitor the credit risk of our tenants. The methods we use to evaluate a tenant s liquidity and creditworthiness
include reviewing certain periodic financial statements, operating data and clinical outcomes data of the tenant. Over the course of
a lease, we also have regular meetings with the facility management teams. Through these means we are able to monitor a tenant s
credit quality. 

Certain
business factors, in addition to those described above that directly affect our tenants, which in turn will likely materially influence
our future results of operations: 

the financial and operational performance of our tenants; 

trends in the cost and availability of capital, including market interest rates, which our prospective tenants may use for their working
capital financing; 

reductions in reimbursements from Medicare, state healthcare programs and commercial insurance providers that may reduce our tenants 
profitability and our lease rates; and 

competition from other financing sources. 

43 

Inflation 

We
are exposed to inflation risk as income from long-term leases are a main source of our cash flows from operations. For our leased properties,
we expect there to be provisions in the majority of our leases that will protect us from the impact of inflation. These provisions may
include rent escalators, and leases that are triple-net. However, due to the long-term nature of the anticipated leases, among other
factors, the leases may not re-set frequently enough to cover inflation. 

ITEM
7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Market
risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other
market changes that affect market sensitive instruments. In pursuing our business and investment objectives, we expect that the primary
market risk to which we will be exposed is interest rate risk. 

We
may be exposed to the effects of interest rate changes primarily as a result of long-term debt used to acquire properties. As of
December 31, 2022, we had 20.2 million net outstanding under our Series A Bonds, which bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.4 per
annum, 55.6 million outstanding under our Series C Bonds, which bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.7 per annum, and 381.0 million
in senior debt notes, of which 105.2 million (23.04 of total debt) bear interest at variable rate equal to one month SOFR plus a
margin. At December 31, 2022, one month SOFR was 4.18 . Assuming no increase in the amount of our
variable interest rate debt, if one-month SOFR increased 100 basis points, our annual cash flow would decrease by approximately
 1,052,000. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows
and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve our objectives, we may borrow at fixed rates or variable rates. We also may enter
into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related
financial instrument. 

In
addition to changes in interest rates, the value of our future investments is subject to fluctuations based on changes in local and regional
economic conditions, change in currency rates between the Israeli Shekel and the U.S. Dollar and changes in the creditworthiness of tenants/operators,
which may affect our ability to refinance our debt if necessary.

9A. Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive and financial officer, is responsible for and
has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed in
our filings under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms, including ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our company s management, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive and financial officer have
concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022 (the end of the period covered by this
Annual Report). 

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

This
report does not include a report of management s assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting or an attestation
report of our independent registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by rules of the SEC for newly public
companies. 

Limitations
on Controls 

Our
system of internal control over financial reporting was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation
of published financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. All internal control
systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide
only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Opinion
on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Strawberry Fields REIT, Inc., and its Predecessor (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income (loss), equity and cash flows,
for the years then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule III (collectively
referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,
and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. 

Supplemental
Information 

Financial
statement schedule III Schedule III has been subjected to audit procedures performed in conjunction with the audit of
the Company s consolidated financial statements. Schedule III is the responsibility of the Company s management. Our audit
procedures included determining whether Schedule III reconciles to the consolidated financial statements or the underlying accounting
and other records, as applicable, and performing procedures to test the completeness and accuracy of the information presented in Schedule
III. In forming our opinion on Schedule III, we evaluated whether Schedule III, including its form and content, is presented in conformity
with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). In our opinion, Schedule III is fairly
stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated financial statements as a whole. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Variable
Interest Entity 

The
Company consolidates the Operating Partnership, a variable interest entity VIE in which the Company is considered the
primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the entity that has (i) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact
the entity s economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the
VIE that could be significant to the VIE. 

Non-Controlling
Interest 

A
non-controlling interest is defined as the portion of the equity in an entity not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the primary
beneficiary. Non-controlling interests are required to be presented as a separate component of equity on a consolidated balance sheet.
Accordingly, the presentation of net income is modified to present the income attributed to controlling and non-controlling interests.
The non-controlling interest on the Company s consolidated balance sheets represents OP units not held by the Company and represents
approximately and of the outstanding OP Units issued by the Operating Partnership as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
The holders of these OP units are entitled to share in cash distributions from the Operating Partnership in proportion to their percentage
ownership of OP units. Net income is allocated to the non-controlling interest based on the weighted-average of OP units outstanding
during the year.

Contingent
revenue is not recognized until all possible contingencies have been eliminated. The Company considers the operating history of the lessee
and the general condition of the industry when evaluating whether all possible contingencies have been eliminated and have historically,
and expect in the future, to not include contingent rents as income until received. The Company follows a policy related to rental income
whereby the Company considers a lease to be non-performing after 60 days of non-payment of past due amounts and does not recognize unpaid
rental income from that lease until the amounts have been received. 

Rental
revenues relating to non-contingent leases that contain specified rental increases over the life of the lease are recognized on the straight-line
basis. Recognizing income on a straight-line basis requires us to calculate the total non-contingent rent containing specified rental
increases over the life of the lease and to recognize the revenue evenly over that life. This method results in rental income in the
early years of a lease being higher than actual cash received, creating a straight-line rent receivable asset included in our accompanying
consolidated balance sheets. At some point during the lease, depending on its terms, the cash rent payments eventually exceed the straight-line
rent which results in the straight-line rent receivable asset decreasing to zero over the remainder of the lease term. The Company assesses
the collectability of straight-line rent in accordance with the applicable accounting standards and reserve policy. If the lessee
becomes delinquent in rent owed under the terms of the lease, the Company may provide a reserve against the recognized straight-line
rent receivable asset for a portion, up to its full value, that the Company estimates may not be recoverable.

All other notes receivable are uncollateralized as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2021 the Company held two uncollateralized
notes receivable for a total amount of million. All of these notes are paid monthly and are current. 

During
2018, the Company undertook to acquire five properties located in Massachusetts through the acquisition of the loans secured by first
mortgages on the properties. In this regard, the Company purchased mortgages from the lenders for the price of million. During
2019, the Company subsequently advanced million under the mortgages to repay other debts related to the properties. The Company
had an informal understanding with the owner that, in exchange for the cancellation of the loans, the owner would transfer title to the
properties to the Company. 

 However,
subsequent to the purchase of the loans but prior to the transfer of the properties, the Company cancelled the planned transfer because
the owner was forced to surrender its licenses to the State of Massachusetts due to cash flow issues. Due to the uncertainty with respect
to the recovery of the Company s investment in the loans, they were fully reserved at December 31, 2021. 

In
July 2022, the Company as lender sold four of the five properties at auction for the total amount of million which is included in
(credit) provision for doubtful accounts in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income (loss). In December
2022 the Company took title on the fifth property with an estimated fair value of million. The Company is in the process of pursuing
collection efforts with respect to the balance outstanding, plans to sell the foreclosed assets and pursue the guarantors of the loans
to recover the unpaid principal balances as well as protective advances and collection costs.

NOTE
8. Commitments and Contingencies (Cont.) 

Contingencies
(Cont.) 

As
noted above, the March 2020 and January 2021 complaints also related to the Predecessor Company s planned acquisition of five
properties located in Massachusetts. Certain subsidiaries of the Predecessor Company purchased loans related to these properties in
2018 for a price of 
million with the expectation that the subsidiaries would acquire title to the properties and the loans would be retired. The
subsidiaries subsequently advanced 
million under the loans to satisfy other liabilities related to the properties. The planned acquisition/settlement with the
sellers/owners and borrowers was cancelled because they were forced to surrender their licenses to operate healthcare facilities on
these properties due to their cash flow issues. In July 2022, the Company as lender sold four of the five properties at auction for
the total amount of 
million. In December 2022 the Company took title on the fifth property. The Company is in the process of pursuing collection efforts
with respect to the balance outstanding and plans to sell the foreclosed property and pursue the guarantors of the loans to recover
the unpaid principal balances as well as protective advances and collection costs. 

shares have
been authorized to be granted under the Plan. 

As
of December 31, 2022, shares were available for grant. shares were issued during the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company
issued shares under the equity incentive plan during the year ended December 31, 2021 and recognized approximately of
expense in connection with these grants. 

. 

As
of December 31, 2022, there were a total of shares of common stock issued in connection with our formation transactions, OP
unit conversions and shares granted to employees and employees of affiliated entities under the equity incentive plan. The outstanding
shares were held by a total of approximately 460 stockholders of record, including certain affiliates of the Company who held 
of these shares. 

At
December 31, 2022 there were OP units outstanding. Under the terms of the Operating Partnership agreement, such holders have
the right to request the redemption of their OP units, in cash. If a holder requests redemption, the Company will have the option of
issuing shares of common stock to the requesting holder instead of cash. In addition, OP unit holders are required to obtain Company
approval prior to the sale or transfer of any or all of such OP unit holders interest. 

In
addition, the Company has reserved a total of shares of common stock that may be issued, at the Company s option, upon
redemption of the OP units outstanding as of December 31, 2022. 

per month, or 
million annually. Default occurred on June 30, 2022, and the Company recognized a loss of 
due to the write-offs of straight-line rent receivables during the year ended December 31, 2022. On July 1, 2022, the Company
entered into new lease agreements with an unaffiliated third-party operator to lease these properties. The new leases have terms of 
years each and provide for a combined average base rent of 
per month, or 
million per year, on average, over the life of the leases. In February 2023 one facility under this master lease was closed. The closure was a result of the tenant request
and mainly for efficiency reasons. This facility is under a master lease with 5 other facilities and the rent payment is continuing with
no interruption and at the same amount. 

In
April 2021, tenants for 13 of our properties located in Arkansas agreed to assign their leases to a group of unaffiliated third parties.
The prior tenants were related parties of the Company. The facilities located on these properties consist of 12 SNFs and 2 ALFs, with
one property housing both a SNF and an ALF. There were no changes to the terms of the existing leases. The assignment of the leases was
subject to the approval of the State of Arkansas, which was received in December 2021. In connection with the lease assignments, the
Company granted the new tenants an option to purchase the properties for an aggregate price of million. These properties are subject
to claims by the prior owners of the properties. These claims did not impact the assignment of the leases, but they may interfere with
the exercise of the purchase option.

DESCRIPTION
OF SECURITIES REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE EXCHANGE ACT 

STRAWBERRY
FIELDS REIT, INC. 

DESCRIPTION
OF STOCK 

The
following is a summary of the material terms of securities of Strawberry Fields REIT, Inc. (referred to herein as we , us ,
 our or our company registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the Exchange Act ). This summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by
reference to, our charter and bylaws and applicable provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law (the MGCL ). We encourage
you to read carefully our charter and bylaws and the applicable provisions of the MGCL for a more complete understanding of our Common
Stock. Each of our charter and bylaws is incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-K to which this exhibit
is filed or incorporated by reference. 

Description
of Capital Stock 

General 

Our
charter provides that we may issue up to 500,000,000 shares of common stock, 0.0001 par value per share, and up to 100,000,000 shares
of preferred stock, 0.0001 par value per share. Our charter authorizes our board of directors to amend our charter to increase or decrease
the aggregate number of authorized shares of common stock or preferred stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series
without stockholder approval. As of the date of this Form 10-K, we had 6,365,856 issued and outstanding shares of common stock, and no
shares of preferred stock was issued and outstanding. 

All
of our outstanding shares of common stock were duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable. 

Under
Maryland law, stockholders generally are not personally liable for our debts or obligations solely as a result of their status as stockholders. 

Common
Stock 

Voting
Rights of Common Stock 

Subject
to the provisions of our charter regarding the restrictions on transfer and ownership of shares of our common stock and except as may
otherwise be specified in the terms of any class or series of common stock, each outstanding share of common stock entitles the holder
to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, including the election of directors, and, except as provided with respect
to any other class or series of capital stock, the holders of shares of common stock will possess the exclusive voting power. There is
no cumulative voting in the election of the Company s directors, which means that the stockholders entitled to cast a majority
of the votes of the outstanding shares of common stock can elect all of the directors then standing for election, and the holders of
the remaining shares will not be able to elect any directors. 

Under
the MGCL, a Maryland corporation generally cannot dissolve, amend its charter, merge, convert, sell all or substantially all of its assets,
engage in a statutory share exchange or engage in similar transactions outside the ordinary course of business unless declared advisable
by a majority of its board of directors and approved by the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least two-thirds of the shares
entitled to vote on the matter unless a lesser percentage (but not less than a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter)
is set forth in the corporation s charter. Our charter provides that these actions (other than certain amendments to the provisions
of our charter related to the removal of directors and the vote required to amend the charter, which requires at least two-thirds of
the votes entitled to be cast) may be taken if declared advisable by a majority of our board of directors and approved by the vote of
stockholders holding at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. However, Maryland law permits a corporation
to transfer all or substantially all of its assets without the approval of the stockholders of the corporation to one or more persons
if all of the equity interests of the person or persons are owned, directly or indirectly, by the corporation. In addition, because assets
may be held by a corporation s subsidiaries, as will be the case with the Company, these subsidiaries may be able to transfer all
or substantially all of such assets without a vote of our stockholders. 

Dividends,
Distributions, Liquidation and Other Rights 

Subject
to the preferential rights of any other class or series of our stock and to the provisions of our charter regarding the restrictions
on transfer of shares of stock, holders of shares of common stock are entitled to receive dividends on such shares of common stock if,
as and when authorized by our board of directors and declared by us out of assets legally available therefor. Such holders are also entitled
to share ratably in the assets of the Company legally available for distribution to our stockholders in the event of our liquidation,
dissolution or winding up after payment or establishment of reserves for all debts and liabilities of the Company and any shares with
preferential rights thereto. 

Holders
of shares of common stock have no preference, conversion, exchange, sinking fund or redemption rights, have no preemptive rights to subscribe
for any securities of the Company and have no appraisal rights. Subject to the preferential rights of any other class or series of our
stock and to the provisions of our charter regarding the restrictions on transfer of shares of stock, shares of common stock have equal
dividend, liquidation and other rights. 

Power
to Reclassify Our Unissued Shares of Stock 

Our
charter authorizes our board of directors to classify and reclassify any unissued shares of common or preferred stock into other classes
or series of shares of stock and to establish the number of shares in each class or series and to set the preferences, conversion and
other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications or terms or conditions
of redemption for each such class or series. As a result, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of shares of preferred
stock that have priority over the shares of common stock with respect to dividends, distributions and rights upon liquidation and with
other terms and conditions that could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that
might involve a premium price for holders of shares of our common stock or otherwise might be in their best interest. No shares of preferred
stock are presently outstanding, and we have no present plans to issue any shares of preferred stock. 

Power
to Increase or Decrease Authorized Stock and Issue Additional Shares of Our Common Stock and Preferred Stock 

Our
charter authorizes our board of directors, with the approval of a majority of the entire board of directors, to amend our charter to
increase or decrease the aggregate number of authorized shares of stock or the number of authorized shares of stock of any class or series
without stockholder approval. We believe that the power of our board of directors to increase or decrease the number of authorized shares
of stock and to classify or reclassify unissued shares of our common stock or preferred stock and thereafter to cause us to issue such
shares of stock will provide us with increased flexibility in structuring possible future financings and acquisitions and in meeting
other needs which might arise. The additional classes or series, as well as the additional shares of stock, will be available for future
issuance without further action by our stockholders, unless such action is required by applicable law, the terms of any other class or
series of stock or the rules of any stock exchange or automated quotation system on which our securities may be listed or traded. Our
board of directors could authorize us to issue a class or series that could, depending upon the terms of the particular class or series,
delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control of the Company that might involve a premium price for our stockholders or
otherwise be in their best interests. 

Restrictions
on Ownership and Transfer 

In
order to qualify as a REIT under the Code, our shares of stock must be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335
days of a taxable year of 12 months (other than the first year for which an election to be a REIT has been made) or during a proportionate
part of a shorter taxable year. Also, not more than 50 of the value of our outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned, directly
or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code to include certain entities) during the last half of a taxable year
(other than the first year for which an election to be a REIT has been made). 

Because
our board of directors believes it is at present essential for us to qualify as a REIT, among other purposes, our charter, subject to
certain exceptions, will contain restrictions on the number of our shares of stock that a person may own. Our charter provides that,
subject to certain exceptions, upon completion of the formation transactions, (i) no person, may beneficially or constructively own more
than 9.8 in value of the aggregate outstanding shares of our common stock, and (ii) no person may beneficially or constructively own
more than 9.8 , in value of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our preferred stock (collectively, the ownership
limit ). 

Our
charter also prohibits any person from: 

beneficially or constructively owning or transferring shares of our capital stock if such ownership or transfer would result in our being
 closely held within the meaning of Section 856(h) of the Code (without regard to whether the ownership interest is held
during the last half of a year); 

transferring shares of our capital stock if such transfer would result in our capital stock being owned by fewer than 100 persons (determined
under the principles of Section 856(a)(5) of the Code); 

beneficially or constructively owning shares of our capital stock to the extent such beneficial or constructive ownership would cause
us to constructively own 9.9 or more of stocks or interest (determined in accordance with Section 856(d)(2)(B) of the Code) of a tenant,
other than TRS, of our real property; 

beneficially or constructively owning or transferring shares of our capital stock if such beneficial or constructive ownership or transfer
would otherwise cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT under the Code, including, but not limited to, as a result of any eligible
independent contractor (as defined in Section 856(d)(9)(A) of the Code) that operations a qualified health care property 
(as defined in Section 856(e)(6)(D)(i) of the Code) on behalf of a TRS failing to qualify as such under the Code; or 

acquiring shares of our capital stock if such acquisition would disqualify us as a REIT under the Code. 

Our
board of directors is authorized to consider the lack of certainty in the provisions of the Code relating to the ownership of stock that
may prevent a corporation from qualifying as a REIT and may make interpretations concerning the ownership limit and attributed ownership
and related matters on as conservative basis as the board of directors deems advisable to minimize or eliminate uncertainty as to our
qualification or continued qualification as a REIT. Our charter does not restrict the authority of the board to take such other action
as it deems necessary or advisable to protect to us and the interests of the stockholders by preservation of our qualification as a REIT
under the Code. 

Our
board of directors, in its sole discretion, may prospectively or retroactively exempt a person from certain of the limits described in
the paragraph above and may establish or increase an excepted holder percentage limit for such person if our board of directors obtains
such representations, covenants and undertakings as it deems appropriate in order to conclude that granting the exemption and/or establishing
or increasing the excepted holder percentage limit will not result in our being closely held under Section 856(h) of the
Code (without regard to whether the ownership interest is held during the last half of a taxable year) or otherwise failing to qualify
as a REIT. Our board of directors may not grant an exemption to any person if that exemption would result in our failing to qualify as
a REIT. Our board of directors may require a ruling from the IRS or an opinion of counsel, in either case in form and substance satisfactory
to our board of directors, in its sole discretion, in order to determine or ensure our status as a REIT. 

Notwithstanding
the receipt of any ruling or opinion, our board of directors may impose such guidelines or restrictions as it deems appropriate in connection
with granting such exemption. In connection with granting a waiver of the ownership limit or creating an exempted holder limit or at
any other time, our board of directors from time to time may increase or decrease the ownership limit, subject to certain exceptions.
A decreased ownership limit will not apply to any person or entity whose percentage of ownership of our stock is in excess of the decreased
ownership limit until the person or entity s ownership of our stock equals or falls below the decreased ownership limit, but any
further acquisition of our stock will be subject to the decreased ownership limit. 

Any
attempted transfer of shares of our capital stock which, if effective, would violate any of the restrictions described above will result
in the number of shares of our capital stock causing the violation (rounded up to the nearest whole share) to be automatically transferred
to a trust for the exclusive benefit of one or more charitable beneficiaries and the purported owner or transferee (the prohibited
owner acquiring no rights in such shares, except that any transfer that results in the violation of the restriction relating
to shares of our capital stock being beneficially owned by fewer than 100 persons will be void ab initio. In either case, the prohibited
owner will not acquire any rights in those shares. The automatic transfer will be deemed to be effective as of the close of business
on the business day prior to the date of the purported transfer or other event that results in the transfer to the trust. Shares held
in the trust will be issued and outstanding shares. The prohibited owner will not benefit economically from ownership of any shares held
in the trust, will have no rights to dividends or other distributions and will have no rights to vote or other rights attributable to
the shares held in the trust. The trustee of the trust will have all voting rights and rights to dividends or other distributions with
respect to shares held in the trust. These rights will be exercised for the exclusive benefit of the charitable beneficiary. Any dividend
or other distribution paid prior to our discovery that shares have been transferred to the trust will be paid by the recipient to the
trustee upon demand. Any dividend or other distribution authorized but unpaid will be paid when due to the trustee. Any dividend or other
distribution paid to the trustee will be held in trust for the charitable beneficiary. Subject to Maryland law, the trustee will have
the authority (i) to rescind as void any vote cast by the prohibited owner prior to our discovery that the shares have been transferred
to the trust and (ii) to recast the vote in accordance with the desires of the trustee acting for the benefit of the charitable beneficiary.
However, if we have already taken irreversible corporate action, then the trustee will not have the authority to rescind and recast the
vote. 

Within
20 days of receiving notice from us that shares of our stock have been transferred to the trust, the trustee will sell the shares to
a person, designated by the trustee, whose ownership of the shares will not violate the above ownership and transfer limitations. Upon
the sale, the interest of the charitable beneficiary in the shares sold will terminate and the trustee will distribute the net proceeds
of the sale to the prohibited owner and to the charitable beneficiary as follows. The prohibited owner will receive the lesser of (i)
the price paid by the prohibited owner for the shares or, if the prohibited owner did not give value for the shares in connection with
the event causing the shares to be held in the trust (e.g., a gift, devise or other similar transaction), the market price (as defined
in our charter) of the shares on the day of the event causing the shares to be held in the trust and (ii) the price per share received
by the trustee (net of any commission and other expenses of sale) from the sale or other disposition of the shares. The trustee may reduce
the amount payable to the prohibited owner by the amount of dividends or other distributions paid to the prohibited owner and owed by
the prohibited owner to the trustee. Any net sale proceeds in excess of the amount payable to the prohibited owner will be paid immediately
to the charitable beneficiary. If, prior to our discovery that shares of our stock have been transferred to the trust, the shares are
sold by the prohibited owner, then (i) the shares shall be deemed to have been sold on behalf of the trust and (ii) to the extent that
the prohibited owner received an amount for the shares that exceeds the amount he or she was entitled to receive, the excess shall be
paid to the trustee upon demand. 

In
addition, shares of our stock held in the trust will be deemed to have been offered for sale to us, or our designee, at a price per share
equal to the lesser of (i) the price per share in the transaction that resulted in the transfer to the trust (or, in the case of a devise
or gift, the market price at the time of the devise or gift) and (ii) the market price on the date we, or our designee, accept the offer,
which we may reduce by the amount of dividends and distributions paid to the prohibited owner and owed by the prohibited owner to the
trustee. We will have the right to accept the offer until the trustee has sold the shares. Upon a sale to us, the interest of the charitable
beneficiary in the shares sold will terminate and the trustee will distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the prohibited owner. 

If
a transfer to a charitable trust, as described above, would be ineffective for any reason to prevent a violation of a restriction, the
transfer that would have resulted in a violation will be void ab initio, and the prohibited owner shall acquire no rights in those shares. 

The
foregoing restrictions on transferability and ownership will not apply if our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our
best interests to attempt to qualify, or to continue to qualify, as a REIT. 

Any
certificate representing shares of our capital stock, and any notices delivered in lieu of certificates with respect to the issuance
or transfer of uncertificated shares, will bear a legend referring to the restrictions described above. 

Any
person who acquires or attempts or intends to acquire beneficial or constructive ownership of shares of our capital stock that will or
may violate any of the foregoing restrictions on transferability and ownership, or any person who would have owned shares of our capital
stock that resulted in a transfer of shares to a charitable trust, is required to give written notice immediately to us, or in the case
of a proposed or attempted transaction, to give at least 15 days prior written notice, and provide us with such other information
as we may request in order to determine the effect of the transfer on our status as a REIT. 

Every
owner of 5 or more (or any lower percentage as required by the Code or the regulations promulgated thereunder) in number or value of
the outstanding shares of our capital stock, within 30 days after the end of each taxable year, is required to give us written notice,
stating his or her name and address, the number of shares of each class and series of shares of our capital stock that he or she beneficially
owns and a description of the manner in which the shares are held. Each of these owners must provide us with additional information that
we may request in order to determine the effect, if any, of his or her beneficial ownership on our status as a REIT and to ensure compliance
with the ownership limits. In addition, each stockholder will upon demand be required to provide us with information that we may request
in good faith in order to determine our status as a REIT and to comply with the requirements of any taxing authority or governmental
authority or to determine our compliance. 

These
ownership limitations could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for shares
of our common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.

Certain
Provisions of Maryland Law and of Our Charter And Bylaws 

Although
the following summary describes certain provisions of Maryland law and the material provisions of our charter and bylaws, it is not a
complete description of our charter and bylaws, copies of which are filed as exhibits to this Form 10-K, or of Maryland law. 

Our
Board of Directors 

Our
charter and bylaws provide that the number of directors of the Company may be established, increased or decreased by our board of directors,
but may not be less than the minimum number required under the MGCL, which is one, or, unless our bylaws are amended, more than fifteen.
We have elected by a provision of our charter to be subject to a provision of Maryland law requiring that, subject to the rights of holders
of one or more classes or series of preferred stock, any vacancy resulting from an increase in the number of directors, or the resignation,
death or removal of a director may be filled only by a majority of the remaining directors, even if the remaining directors do not constitute
a quorum, and any director elected to fill a vacancy will serve for the full term of the directorship in which such vacancy occurred
and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualifies. 

Each
member of our board of directors is elected by our stockholders to serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until his
or her successor is duly elected and qualifies. Holders of shares of our common stock will have no right to cumulative voting in the
election of directors, and directors will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast in the election of directors. Consequently, at
each annual meeting of stockholders, stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast in the election of
directors will be able to elect all of our directors. 

Removal
of Directors 

Our
charter provides that, subject to the rights of holders of one or more classes or series of preferred stock to elect or remove one or
more directors, a director may be removed only for cause (as defined in our charter) and only by the affirmative vote of holders of shares
entitled to cast at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of directors. This provision, when coupled
with the exclusive power of our board of directors to fill vacant directorships, may preclude stockholders from removing incumbent directors
except for cause and by a substantial affirmative vote and filling the vacancies created by such removal with their own nominees. 

Business
Combinations 

Under
the MGCL, certain business combinations (including a merger, consolidation, share exchange or, in circumstances specified
in the statute, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities) between a Maryland corporation and an interested
stockholder (i.e., any person (other than the corporation or any subsidiary) who beneficially owns 10 or more of the voting power of
the corporation s outstanding voting stock after the date on which the corporation had 100 or more beneficial owners of its stock,
or an affiliate or associate of the corporation who, at any time within the two-year period immediately prior to the date in question,
was the beneficial owner of 10 or more of the voting power of the then outstanding stock of the corporation after the date on which
the corporation had 100 or more beneficial owners of its stock) or an affiliate of an interested stockholder, are prohibited for five
years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Thereafter, any such business
combination between the Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder generally must be recommended by the board of directors of
such corporation and approved by the affirmative vote of at least (1) 80 of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding
shares of voting stock of the corporation and (2) two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting stock of the corporation
other than shares held by the interested stockholder with whom (or with whose affiliate) the business combination is to be effected or
held by an affiliate or associate of the interested stockholder, unless, among other conditions, the corporation s common stockholders
receive a minimum price (as defined in the MGCL) for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously
paid by the interested stockholder for its shares. A person is not an interested stockholder under the statute if the board of directors
approved in advance the transaction by which the person otherwise would have become an interested stockholder. The board of directors
may provide that its approval is subject to compliance, at or after the time of approval, with any terms and conditions determined by
it. 

The
statute permits various exemptions from its provisions, including business combinations that are exempted by the board of directors prior
to the time that the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder. As permitted by the MGCL, our board of directors has adopted
a resolution exempting any business combination between us and any other person from the provisions of this statute, provided that the
business combination is first approved by our board of directors (including a majority of directors who are not affiliates or associates
of such persons). However, our board of directors may repeal or modify this resolution at any time in the future, in which case the applicable
provisions of this statute will become applicable to business combinations between us and interested stockholders. 

Control
Share Acquisitions 

The
MGCL provides that holders of control shares of a Maryland corporation acquired in a control share acquisition 
have no voting rights with respect to those shares except to the extent approved by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the
votes entitled to be cast by stockholders entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, excluding votes cast by (1) the person
who makes or proposes to make a control share acquisition, (2) an officer of the corporation or (3) an employee of the corporation who
is also a director of the corporation. Control shares are voting shares of stock which, if aggregated with all other such
shares of stock previously acquired by the acquirer or in respect of which the acquirer is able to exercise or direct the exercise of
voting power (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy), would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing directors
within one of the following ranges of voting power: (1) one-tenth or more but less than one-third, (2) one-third or more but less than
a majority or (3) a majority or more of all voting power. Control shares do not include shares the acquiring person is then entitled
to vote as a result of having previously obtained stockholder approval. A control share acquisition means the acquisition
of issued and outstanding control shares, subject to certain exceptions. 

A
person who has made or proposes to make a control share acquisition, upon satisfaction of certain conditions (including an undertaking
to pay expenses), may compel the board of directors to call a special meeting of stockholders to be held within 50 days of demand to
consider the voting rights of the shares. If no request for a meeting is made, the corporation may itself present the question at any
stockholders meeting. 

If
voting rights are not approved at the meeting or if the acquiring person does not deliver an acquiring person statement as required by
the statute, then, subject to certain conditions and limitations, the corporation may redeem any or all of the control shares (except
those for which voting rights have previously been approved) for fair value determined, without regard to the absence of voting rights
for the control shares, as of the date of the last control share acquisition by the acquirer or of any meeting of stockholders at which
the voting rights of such shares are considered and not approved. If voting rights for control shares are approved at a stockholders
meeting and the acquirer becomes entitled to vote a majority of the shares entitled to vote, all other stockholders may exercise appraisal
rights. The fair value of the shares as determined for purposes of such appraisal rights may not be less than the highest price per share
paid by the acquirer in the control share acquisition. 

The
control share acquisition statute does not apply to, among other things, (1) shares acquired in a merger, consolidation or share exchange
if the corporation is a party to the transaction or (2) acquisitions approved or exempted by the charter or bylaws of the corporation. 

Our
bylaws contain a provision exempting from the control share acquisition statute any acquisition by any person of shares of our stock.
There can be no assurance that such provision will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future by our board of directors. 

Subtitle
8 

Subtitle
8 of Title 3 of the MGCL permits a Maryland corporation with a class of equity securities registered under the Exchange Act and at least
three independent directors to elect to be subject, by provision in its charter or bylaws or a resolution of its board of directors,
without stockholder approval, and notwithstanding any contrary provision in the charter or bylaws, to any or all of five provisions of
the MGCL which provide, respectively, that: 

1.
the corporation s board of directors will be divided into three classes; 

2.
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the votes cast in the election of directors generally is required to remove a director; 

3.
the number of directors may be fixed only by vote of the directors; 

4.
a vacancy on its board of directors be filled only by the remaining directors and that directors elected to fill a vacancy will serve
for the remainder of the full term of the class of directors in which the vacancy occurred; and 

5.
the request of stockholders entitled to cast at least a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting is required for
the calling of a special meeting of stockholders. 

We
have elected by a provision in our charter to be subject to the provisions of Subtitle 8 relating to the filling of vacancies on our
board of directors. In addition, without our having elected to be subject to Subtitle 8, our charter and bylaws already (1) require the
affirmative vote of holders of shares entitled to cast at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast generally in the election
of directors to remove a director from our board of directors, (2) vest in our board of directors the exclusive power to fix the number
of directors and (3) require, unless called by our chairman, our president and chief executive officer or our board of directors, the
request of stockholders entitled to cast not less than a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting to call a special
meeting. Our board of directors is not currently classified. In the future, our board of directors may elect, without stockholder approval,
to classify our board of directors or elect to be subject to any of the other provisions of Subtitle 8. 

Meetings
of Stockholders 

Pursuant
to our bylaws, an annual meeting of our stockholders for the purpose of the election of directors and the transaction of any other business
will be held on a date and at the time and place set by our board of directors. Each of our directors is elected by our stockholders
to serve until the next annual meeting or until his or her successor is duly elected and qualifies under Maryland law. In addition, our
chairman, our president and chief executive officer or our board of directors may call a special meeting of our stockholders. Subject
to the provisions of our bylaws, a special meeting of our stockholders to act on any matter that may properly be considered by our stockholders
will also be called by our secretary upon the written request of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to
be cast at the meeting on such matter, accompanied by the information required by our bylaws. Our secretary will inform the requesting
stockholders of the reasonably estimated cost of preparing and mailing the notice of meeting (including our proxy materials), and the
requesting stockholder must pay such estimated cost before our secretary may prepare and mail the notice of the special meeting. 

Amendments
to Our Charter and Bylaws 

Under
the MGCL, a Maryland corporation generally cannot amend its charter unless approved by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled
to cast at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter unless a lesser percentage (but not less than a majority of
all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter) is set forth in the corporation s charter. Except for certain amendments related
to the removal of directors and the vote required to amend the charter (which must be declared advisable by our board of directors and
approved by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast not less than two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the
matter), our charter generally may be amended only if the amendment is declared advisable by our board of directors and approved by the
affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Our board of directors,
with the approval of a majority of the entire board, and without any action by our stockholders, may also amend our charter to increase
or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series we are authorized to issue. 

Our
board of directors has the exclusive power to adopt, alter or repeal any provision of our bylaws and to make new bylaws. 

Extraordinary
Transactions 

Under
the MGCL, a Maryland corporation generally cannot dissolve, merge, convert, sell all or substantially all of its assets, engage in a
statutory share exchange or engage in similar transactions outside the ordinary course of business unless approved by the affirmative
vote of stockholders entitled to cast at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter unless a lesser percentage (but
not less than a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter) is set forth in the corporation s charter. As permitted
by the MGCL, our charter provides that any of these actions may be approved by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast
a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Many of our operating assets will be held by our subsidiaries, and
these subsidiaries may be able to merge or sell all or substantially all of their assets without the approval of our stockholders. 

Appraisal
Rights 

Our
charter provides that our stockholders generally will not be entitled to exercise statutory appraisal rights. 

Advance
Notice of Director Nominations and New Business 

Our
bylaws provide that, with respect to an annual meeting of stockholders, nominations of individuals for election to our board of directors
and the proposal of other business to be considered by our stockholders at an annual meeting of stockholders may be made only (1) pursuant
to our notice of the meeting, (2) by or at the direction of our board of directors or (3) by any stockholder who was a stockholder of
record at the record date set by our board of directors for the purposes of determining stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting,
at the time of giving of notice and at the time of the meeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting on the election of the individual
so nominated or such other business and who has complied with the advance notice procedures set forth in our bylaws, including a requirement
to provide certain information about the stockholder and its affiliates and the nominee or business proposal, as applicable. 

With
respect to special meetings of stockholders, only the business specified in our notice of meeting may be brought before the meeting.
Nominations of individuals for election to our board of directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors
are to be elected only (1) by or at the direction of our board of directors or (2) provided that the special meeting has been properly
called in accordance with our bylaws for the purpose of electing directors, by any stockholder who was a stockholder of record at the
record date set by our board of directors for the purposes of determining stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, at the time of
giving of notice and at the time of the meeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting on the election of each individual so nominated
and who has complied with the advance notice provisions set forth in our bylaws, including a requirement to provide certain information
about the stockholder and its affiliates and the nominee. 

Anti-Takeover
Effect of Certain Provisions of Maryland Law and Our Charter and Bylaws 

Our
charter and bylaws and Maryland law contain provisions that may delay, defer or prevent a change in control or other transaction that
might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders, including: 

supermajority vote and cause requirements for removal of directors; 

requirement that stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting must act together to make
a written request before our stockholders can require us to call a special meeting of stockholders; 

provisions that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by the remaining directors for the full term of the directorship
in which the vacancy occurred; 

the power of our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to increase or decrease the aggregate number of authorized shares
of stock or the number of shares of any class or series of stock; 

the power of our board of directors to cause us to issue additional shares of stock of any class or series and to fix the terms of one
or more classes or series of stock without stockholder approval; 

the restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock; and 

advance notice requirements for director nominations and stockholder proposals. 

Likewise,
if the resolution opting out of the business combination provisions of the MGCL was repealed, or the business combination is not approved
by our board of directors, or the provision in the bylaws opting out of the control share acquisition provisions of the MGCL were rescinded,
these provisions of the MGCL could have similar anti-takeover effects. 

Exclusive
Forum 

Our
bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland,
or, if that court does not have jurisdiction, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, Northern Division, will
be the sole and absolute forum for (a) any Internal Corporate Claim, as such term is defined in Section 1-101(p) of the MGCL, (b) any
derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf other than actions arising under the federal securities laws, (c) any action asserting
a claim of breach of any duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or to our stockholders, (d) any action
asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of the MGCL or our
charter or bylaws or (e) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers or other employees that is governed
by the internal affairs doctrine and no such action may be brought in any court sitting outside of the State of Maryland or in another
circuit court within the State of Maryland unless we consent in writing to such court. These provisions of our bylaws will not apply
to claims that may be asserted under federal securities laws. 

Limitation
of Liability and Indemnification of Directors and Officers 

Maryland
law permits a Maryland corporation to include in its charter a provision limiting the liability of its directors and officers to the
corporation and its stockholders for money damages, except for liability resulting from (1) actual receipt of an improper benefit or
profit in money, property or services or (2) active and deliberate dishonesty that is established by a final judgment and is material
to the cause of action. Our charter contains a provision that eliminates such liability to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law. 

Our
charter provides for indemnification of our officers and directors against liabilities to the maximum extent permitted by the MGCL, as
amended from time to time. 

The
MGCL requires a corporation (unless its charter provides otherwise, which our charter does not) to indemnify a director or officer who
has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any proceeding to which he or she is made, or threatened to be made,
a party by reason of his or her service in that capacity. The MGCL permits a corporation to indemnify its present and former directors
and officers, among others, against judgments, penalties, fines, settlements and reasonable expenses actually incurred by them in connection
with any proceeding to which they may be made, or threatened to be made, a party by reason of their service in those or other capacities
unless it is established that: 

the act or omission of the director or officer was material to the matter giving rise to the proceeding and (1) was committed in bad
faith or (2) was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty; 

the director or officer actually received an improper personal benefit in money, property or services; or 

in the case of any criminal proceeding, the director or officer had reasonable cause to believe that the act or omission was unlawful. 

However,
under the MGCL, a Maryland corporation may not indemnify for an adverse judgment in a suit by or in the right of the corporation or for
a judgment of liability on the basis that personal benefit was improperly received, unless in either case a court orders indemnification
if it determines that the director or officer is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification, and then only for expenses. In addition,
the MGCL permits a Maryland corporation to advance reasonable expenses to a director or officer upon its receipt of: 

a written affirmation by the director or officer of his or her good faith belief that he or she has met the standard of conduct necessary
for indemnification by the corporation; and 

a written undertaking by the director or officer or on the director s or officer s behalf to repay the amount paid or reimbursed
by the corporation if it is ultimately determined that the director or officer did not meet the standard of conduct. 

Our
charter obligates us, to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law in effect from time to time, to indemnify and, without requiring
a preliminary determination of the ultimate entitlement to indemnification, pay or reimburse reasonable expenses in advance of final
disposition of such a proceeding to: 

any present or former director or officer of the Company who is made, or threatened to be made, a party to the proceeding by reason of
his or her service in that capacity; or 

any individual who, while a director or officer of the Company and at our request, serves or has served as a director, officer, partner,
trustee, member or manager of another corporation, real estate investment trust, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture,
trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise and who is made, or threatened to be made, a party to the proceeding by reason of his
or her service in that capacity. 

Our
charter also permits us to indemnify and advance expenses to any individual who served the Predecessor Company in any of the capacities
described above and to any employee or agent of the Company or our Predecessor. 

We
will enter into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers that provide for indemnification to the
maximum extent permitted by Maryland law. 

REIT
Qualification 

Our
charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election, without approval of our stockholders,
if it determines that it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify, or to continue to qualify, as a REIT.
