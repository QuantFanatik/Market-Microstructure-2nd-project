 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 Certain statements made or incorporated by reference in this Report which are not statements of historical fact, including those under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and elsewhere in this Report, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of, and subject to the protections of, Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. Forward-looking statements include statements with respect to Synovus' beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, targets, expectations, anticipations, assumptions, estimates, intentions and future performance and involve known and unknown risks, many of which are beyond Synovus' control and which may cause Synovus' actual results, performance or achievements or the financial services industry or economy generally, to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. 
 All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. You can identify these forward-looking statements through Synovus' use of words such as believes, anticipates, expects, may, will, assumes, predicts, could, should, would, intends, targets, estimates, projects, plans, potential and other similar words and expressions of the future or otherwise regarding the outlook for Synovus' future business and financial performance and/or the performance of the financial services industry and economy in general. Forward-looking statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of Synovus' management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements in this document. Many of these factors are beyond Synovus' ability to control or predict. These factors include, but are not limited to: 
 (1) competition in the financial services industry, including competition from nontraditional banking institutions such as Fintechs; 
 (2) our ability to realize the expected benefits from our strategic initiatives or other operational and execution goals in the time period expected, which could negatively affect our future profitability; 
 (3) an economic downturn and contraction, including a recession, and the resulting effects on our capital, financial condition, credit quality, results of operations and future growth, including that the strength of the current economic environment could be further weakened by prolonged periods of inflation, current supply chain challenges, and the continued impact of COVID-19;

 (8) changes in the cost and availability of funding due to changes in the deposit market and credit market; 
 (9) restrictions or limitations on access to funds from historical and alternative sources of liquidity could adversely affect our overall liquidity, which could restrict our ability to make payments on our obligations and our ability to support asset growth and sustain our operations and the operations of Synovus Bank; 
 (10) we may be required to make substantial expenditures to keep pace with regulatory initiatives and the rapid technological changes in the financial services industry; 
 (11) the impact of recent and proposed changes in governmental policy, laws and regulations, proposed and recently enacted changes in monetary policy and in the regulation and taxation of banks and financial institutions, or the interpretation or application thereof and the uncertainty of future implementation and enforcement of these regulations, including rising inflationary pressures and interest rate increases and the possibility that the U.S. could default on its debt obligations; 
 (12) our current and future information technology system enhancements and operational initiatives may not be successfully implemented, which could negatively impact our operations; 
 (13) our business relationships with, and reliance upon, third parties that have strategic partnerships with us or that provide key components of our business infrastructure, including the costs of services and products provided to us by third parties, and disruptions in service or financial difficulties with a third-party vendor or business relationship; 
 1 

(14) our enterprise risk management framework, our compliance program, or our corporate governance and supervisory oversight functions may not identify or address risks adequately, which may result in unexpected losses; 
 (15) our asset quality may deteriorate or that our allowance for credit losses may prove to be inadequate or may be negatively affected by credit risk exposures; 
 (16) the ability of our operational framework to identify and manage risks associated with our business, such as credit risk, compliance risk, reputational risk, and operational risk, including by virtue of our relationships with third-party business partners, as well as our relationships with third-party vendors and other service providers; 
 (17) we may be exposed to potential losses in the event of fraud and/or theft, or in the event that a third-party vendor, obligor, or business partner fails to pay amounts due to us under that relationship or under any arrangement that we enter into with them; 
 (18) if economic conditions worsen further or regulatory capital rules are modified, we may be required to undertake initiatives to improve or conserve our capital position; 
 (19) our ability to identify and address cyber-security risks such as data security breaches, malware, "denial of service" attacks, "hacking", and identity theft, a failure of which could disrupt our business and result in the disclosure of and/or misuse or misappropriation of confidential or proprietary information, disruption, or damage of our systems, increased costs, significant losses, or adverse effects to our reputation; 
 (20) the impact on our financial results, reputation, and business if we are unable to comply with all applicable federal and state regulations or other supervisory actions or directives and any necessary capital initiatives; 
 (21) the impact of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic on our assets, business, capital and liquidity, financial condition, prospects, and results of operations; 
 (22) our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could affect our liquidity, including our ability to pay dividends or take other capital actions; 
 (23) our ESG strategies and initiatives, the scope and pace of which could alter our reputation and shareholder, employee, client, and third-party relationships; 
 (24) the continued use, availability, and reliability of LIBOR and the risks related to the transition from LIBOR to any alternate reference rate we may use; 
 (25) we could realize losses if we sell assets and the proceeds we receive are lower than the carrying value of such assets; 
 (26) our ability to obtain regulatory approval to take certain actions, including any dividends on our common stock or preferred stock, any repurchases of common stock, or any other issuance or redemption of any other regulatory capital instruments, as well as any applications in respect to strategic initiatives; 
 (27) we may not be able to identify suitable bank and non-bank acquisition opportunities as part of our growth strategy and even if we are able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities, we may not be able to complete such transactions on favorable terms or realize the anticipated benefits from such acquisitions; 
 (28) our concentrated operations in the Southeastern U.S. make us vulnerable to local economic conditions, local weather catastrophes, public health issues, and other external events; 
 (29) the costs and effects of litigation, investigations, or similar matters, or adverse facts and developments related thereto; 
 (30) the fluctuation in our stock price and general volatility in the stock market; 
 (31) the effects of any damages to our reputation resulting from developments related to any of the items identified above; and 
 (32) other factors and other information contained in this Report and in other reports and filings that we make with the SEC under the Exchange Act, including, without limitation, those found in "Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors" of this Report. 
 For a discussion of these and other risks that may cause actual results to differ from expectations, refer to Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors and other information contained in this Report and our other periodic filings, including quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, that we file from time to time with the SEC. All written or oral forward-looking statements that are made by or are attributable to Synovus are expressly qualified by this cautionary notice. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements since those statements speak only as of the date on which the statements are made. Synovus undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of new information or unanticipated events, except as may otherwise be required by law.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 Overview 
 General 
 Synovus Financial Corp. is a financial services company and a registered bank holding company headquartered in Columbus, Georgia. We provide commercial and consumer banking in addition to a full suite of specialized products and services including private banking, treasury management, wealth management, mortgage services, premium finance, asset-based lending, structured lending, capital markets, and international banking to our clients through our wholly-owned subsidiary bank, Synovus Bank, and other offices in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee. 
 We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Georgia in 1972. Our principal executive offices are located at 1111 Bay Avenue, Suite 500, Columbus, Georgia 31901, and our telephone number at that address is (706) 641-6500. Our common stock is traded on the NYSE under the symbol SNV. At December 31, 2022, we had total consolidated assets of 59.73 billion and total consolidated deposits of 48.87 billion. 
 Additional information relating to our business and our subsidiaries, including a detailed description of our financial results for 2022 and 2021 is contained in "Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in this Report. 
 Banking Operations 
 Synovus conducts its banking operations through Synovus Bank. Synovus Bank is a Georgia state-chartered bank and operates primarily throughout Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee. Synovus Bank offers commercial and consumer services. Our commercial banking services include treasury management, asset management, capital markets services, institutional trust services, and commercial, financial, and real estate loans. Our consumer banking services include accepting customary types of demand and savings deposits accounts; mortgage, installment, and other consumer loans; investment and brokerage services; safe deposit services; automated banking services; automated fund transfers; internet-based banking services; and bank credit and debit card services, including Visa and MasterCard services. At December 31, 2022, Synovus Bank operated 246 branches and 365 ATMs across our footprint. 
 Non-bank Subsidiaries 
 In addition to our banking operations, we also provide various other financial services to our clients through the following direct and indirect wholly-owned non-bank subsidiaries: 
 Synovus Securities, headquartered in Columbus, Georgia, which specializes in professional portfolio management for fixed-income securities, investment banking, the execution of securities transactions as a broker/dealer, asset management, and financial planning services, and the provision of individual investment advice on equity and other securities; and 
 Synovus Trust, headquartered in Columbus, Georgia, which provides trust, asset management, and financial planning services. 
 Business Developments 
 Throughout 2022, Synovus' strategic focus remained on expanding and diversifying the franchise in terms of revenue, profitability, and asset size while maintaining a community banking, relationship-based approach to banking. We made deliberate adjustments to our businesses and business model to drive sustained franchise value while retaining our legacy focus on our people and our clients. We embraced the acceleration of technology and adoption of digital and data capabilities. In addition, Synovus completed the executive leadership transition begun in April 2021 with Kevin S. Blair s succession into the role of Chief Executive Officer and President and culminating in December 2022 with Mr. Blair s succession into the role of Chairman of the Board. This change in leadership occurred while Synovus remained focused on execution of key strategic priorities, including, among others, Synovus Forward. As previously announced, the cost savings and revenue-generating initiatives underpinning Synovus Forward included expense reductions around Synovus third party spend program, branch optimization, back-office staff optimization, an early retirement program, market-based repricing of certain product offerings, deposit repricing, commercial analytics, and digital enhancements. As of December 31, 2022, Synovus had achieved a cumulative pre-tax run rate benefit of approximately 180 million through the Synovus Forward initiative. 
 In 2022, Synovus focused on a streamlined strategic plan centered on growth and performance through four core pillars: reposition for advantage, simplify and streamline, adopt high-tech meets high touch, and enhance talent and culture. Various strategic initiatives supported each of these pillars, with a prioritization on such matters as investing in commercial growth, fortifying consumer banking, optimizing wealth, refreshing the brand, re-imagining the client journey, automating systems and processes, using advanced analytics, enhancing modern core enabled banking products, developing diverse leaders, and 
 3 

establishing a growth based culture. We believe disciplined and continued execution of these core pillars will position us for long-term top quartile performance. 
 Competition 
 The financial services industry is highly competitive and could become more competitive as a result of recent and ongoing legislative, regulatory, and technological changes, and continued consolidation within the financial services industry. Synovus Bank and our wholly-owned non-bank subsidiaries compete actively with national and state banks, savings and loan associations, and credit unions and other nonbank financial intermediaries, including securities brokers and dealers, investment advisory firms, mortgage companies, insurance companies, trust companies, finance companies, leasing companies, and certain governmental agencies, all of which actively engage in marketing various types of loans, deposit accounts, and other financial services. In addition, competition from nontraditional banking institutions, often known as Fintech, continues to increase and accelerate, with consumers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives. The ability of such non-banking financial institutions to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has intensified competition. Because non-banking financial institutions are not subject to many of the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies, they can often operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures. These competitors have been successful in developing products that are in direct competition with or are alternatives to the banking services offered by traditional banking institutions. Our ability to deliver strong financial performance will depend in part on our ability to expand the scope of, and effectively deliver, products and services, which will allow us to meet the changing needs of our clients. However, we often compete with much larger national and regional banks that have more resources than we do to deliver new products and services and introduce new technology to enhance the client experience. See "Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors - Strategic Risk - Competition in the financial services industry may adversely affect our future earnings and growth." 
 As of December 31, 2022, we were the largest bank holding company headquartered in Georgia based on assets. Financial services clients are generally influenced by convenience, quality of service, personal contacts, price of services, and availability of products. We continue to gain traction in most of our key markets, as well as overall markets, as shown in the most recent market share deposit data for FDIC-insured institutions as of June 30, 2022. Additionally, over the last year, we have continued to rationalize our branch network while maintaining and growing market share throughout our footprint. 
 Human Capital Resources 
 Synovus financial performance and strategy rely heavily on our value proposition of relationship-banking delivered through experts committed to delivering an exceptional client experience and to providing value-added advice and financial solutions. As such, Synovus ability to identify, attract, develop, and retain a qualified and skilled workforce across our segments in multiple banking specialties and other areas is central to our growth and delivery of long-term shareholder value. In managing our business, management focuses on a number of human capital measures and objectives including: workforce demographics; compensation and benefits; talent acquisition, development, and retention; diversity, equity, and inclusion; and employee health and safety. Synovus Chief Human Resources Officer, reporting to the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, and President, manages all aspects of the employee experience, including talent acquisition and management, learning and development, and compensation and benefits. From a Board oversight perspective, the Compensation and Human Capital Committee has primary oversight responsibility for Synovus talent development and human capital management strategies. 
 In 2022, the Company s human capital strategy focused on the unique circumstances of our employees including our workforce s changing needs, the increased demand for workplace flexibility, and accelerated transformation of our technology for the management of our workforce through investments in upgraded systems and processes. The Company also responded to an evolving labor market in 2022, including increased competition for talent, labor shortages, and increased labor costs. 
 Workforce Demographics 
 As of December 31, 2022, Synovus had 5,114 employees, including both full-time and part-time employees, all predominately located in our core markets of Georgia, Florida, Alabama, South Carolina, and Tennessee, compared to 4,988 employees at December 31, 2021. By segment, Consumer Banking employed 1,568 employees, Community Banking employed 629 employees, Wholesale Banking employed 341 employees, Financial Management Services employed 773 employees, and Treasury and Corporate Other employed 1,803 employees as of December 31, 2022. 
 Compensation and Benefits 
 Synovus strives to provide competitive compensation and benefits that meet the varying needs of employees, including market-competitive pay, healthcare benefits, short and long term incentive packages, a 401(k) plan with a dollar for dollar company match on employee contributions up to 5 of pay, an employee stock purchase plan, tuition assistance, and wellness and employee assistance programs. Moreover, beginning in January 2023, Synovus enhanced its parental leave policy, providing up to 12 weeks of pay each year for employees. The Company s short and long term incentive programs are aligned with our strategy and key business objectives and are intended to motivate strong performance. Synovus engages in nationally recognized 
 4 

outside compensation salary surveys and utilizes the expertise of a nationally recognized outside executive compensation firm to objectively evaluate our compensation and benefits and benchmark them against industry peers and similarly situated organizations. Synovus periodically reviews compensation and benefits by grade level and position to ensure similar positions are paid comparatively and to ensure that Synovus has a competitive and valuable offering to meet the well-being and needs of our employees. In light of this ongoing work, Synovus increased its minimum wage to 20 per hour in 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2022, total salaries and other personnel expense, which includes all compensation and benefits to our employees, totaled 681.7 million. See "Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Non-interest Expense" of this Report for further discussion of salaries and other personnel expense. 
 Talent Acquisition, Development, and Retention 
 Synovus is committed to attracting and retaining the brightest and best talent. Of the approximately 1,711 open positions filled in 2022, 34 were filled by internal hires. Approximately 18 of our workforce received a promotion in 2022, consisting of 70 women and 38 people of color. Our commitment to our employees has resulted in a long-term workforce, with an average tenure of 8 years of service. We attribute our ability to attract and retain talent to several factors, including impactful work that affects the communities in which our employees live, strong leadership, availability of career advancement opportunities, and competitive and equitable total rewards. 
 Synovus has created internal programs to support the development and retention of our employees, including development programs designed to train our leaders. Employees are provided on demand access to over 1,100 courses spanning leadership, compliance, technical, and professional development. On average, 20 hours of training per employee were completed in 2022. Synovus also supports our employees involvement in external development programs, such as specialty banking schools and other technical training. In support of learning and development for employees, Synovus offers a tuition assistance program for employees seeking undergraduate and graduate degrees and other continuing education programs. 
 Development of Synovus leaders likewise continues to be a priority, and we successfully launched two senior leadership programs in 2022. We launched the first cohort of the Connect Leadership Program, focused on executive leadership readiness with 13 high potential leaders, and Catalyst On-Demand, focused on nine transformational capabilities with 176 senior leaders. We continue to deliver our Ignite First Line Leadership development, with 104 employees completing the program in 2022 and 609 employees completing the program since its inception in 2020. 
 Synovus continued to focus on employee engagement in 2022. The Voice of Team Member action teams identified ten engagement initiatives in 2022, implementing improvements such as the rollout of My Time which encourages employees to set aside one hour per week for personal development and a new Chairman s Synergy Award to celebrate team success. 
 In 2022, we achieved a Great Place to Work designation by the Great Place to Work Institute and were recognized again among Atlanta s Top Workplaces by the Atlanta Journal Constitution and as a Forbes 2022 Best Bank in America. Additionally, our Catalyst On-Demand Leadership Development program received a Bronze Brandon Hall Award for Senior Leadership Development. One of our executive leaders again received national recognition for The Most Powerful Women in Banking from American Banker. 
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
 Synovus is committed to continued improvement in employee diversity, equity, and inclusion at the company. Since 2018 with the launch of a CEO sponsored DEI initiative, we have continued to make progress toward our DEI objectives. As of December 31, 2022, 66 of our employees were women and 30 of our employees were people of color, and we continue to work on improving representation of women and people of color in senior leadership roles. As a result of this continuous effort and focus, as outlined below, representation of women and people of color in senior leadership roles have steadily improved over the last five years with women representing 39 and people of color representing 16 of senior leadership by the end of 2022. Specific to executive leadership, women represent 50 and people of color represent 13 at the end of 2022. Moreover, we expect to continue these improvements by continued work toward our goals of 40 female and 18 people of color representation in senior leadership by the end of 2024. 
 To build and attract a diverse workforce, in 2022, Synovus continued to identify key organizations and partnerships to strengthen our recruiting efforts. We continued to expand our campus recruiting and scholarship programs, executing a comprehensive campus recruitment strategy with a focus on diversity, deepening our relationships with historically black colleges and universities in our markets, hosting a Diversity Symposium as a part of our recruitment efforts, and increasing our focus on military recruitment. To expand our pipeline of candidates, we continued to partner with diverse external professional organizations such as the Latin American Association Unidos in Finance program and leveraged our numerous and varied employee resource groups for internal referrals. We continued our efforts to increase the diversity of our candidate pool and revitalize our internship and accelerated banker recruiting and selection process in 2022, having an intern class that was 45 people of color and 35 women and an accelerated banker class that was 27 people of color and 45 women. 
 5 

As to the existing workforce, in 2022, Synovus continued to focus on foundational progress toward increasing DEI, engaging employee resource groups to assist with talent acquisition, development, and community outreach, increasing our internal dialogue through forums, fireside chats, and listen and learn events. In addition, all of our leadership programs include unconscious bias and/or DEI modules. 
 In 2022, Synovus conducted gender pay analysis which resulted in nominal pay adjustments for 1.5 of the employee base. Results of the analysis were shared with the Compensation and Human Capital Committee. 
 In recognition of our commitment to and focus on DEI, Synovus won a DEI leadership award from the Mortgage Bankers Association in 2022 and was recognized as a 2022 finalist for the DEI Awards by the National Association of Corporate Directors. 
 Employee Health and Safety 
 Synovus is committed to operating in a safe, secure, and responsible manner for the benefit of our employees, clients, and communities. Synovus provides a range of programs to improve the physical, financial, and emotional well-being of our employees, including a range of health and wellness benefits, and strives to create a safe and healthy workplace for all employees. 
 Supervision, Regulation, and Other Factors 
 We are extensively regulated under federal and state law. The following is a brief summary that does not purport to be a complete description of all regulations that affect us or all aspects of those regulations. This discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions described below and is not intended to be an exhaustive description of the statutes or regulations applicable to the Company s and Synovus Bank s business. In addition, proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking industry are frequently raised at both the state and federal levels. The likelihood and timing of any changes in these laws and regulations, and the impact such changes may have on us and Synovus Bank, are difficult to predict. Regulatory agencies may issue enforcement actions, policy statements, interpretive letters, and similar written guidance applicable to us or to Synovus Bank. Changes in applicable laws, regulations, or regulatory guidance, or their interpretation by regulatory agencies or courts may have a material adverse effect on our and Synovus Bank s business, operations, and earnings. 
 Synovus Bank, Synovus Trust, and in some cases, we and our nonbank affiliates, must undergo regular examinations by the appropriate regulatory agency, which will examine for adherence to a range of legal and regulatory compliance responsibilities. A bank regulator conducting an examination has complete access to the books and records of the examined institution. The results of the examination are confidential. Supervision and regulation of banks, their holding companies, and affiliates is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and clients, the DIF of the FDIC, and the U.S. banking and financial system rather than holders of our securities. 
 Regulation of the Company 
 We are registered as a bank holding company with the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act and have elected to be treated as a financial holding company. As such, we are subject to comprehensive supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve and are subject to its regulatory reporting requirements. Federal law subjects bank holding companies, such as the Company, to restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage, and to a range of supervisory requirements. In addition, the GA DBF regulates bank holding companies that own Georgia-chartered banks, such as us, under the bank holding company laws of the State of Georgia. Various federal and state bodies regulate and supervise our non-bank activities including our brokerage, investment advisory, and insurance agency activities. These include, but are not limited to, the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, federal and state banking regulators, and various state regulators of insurance and brokerage activities. 
 Violations of laws and regulations, or other unsafe and unsound practices, may result in regulatory agencies imposing fines or penalties, cease and desist orders, or taking other enforcement actions. Under certain circumstances, these agencies may enforce these remedies directly against officers, directors, employees, and other parties participating in the affairs of a bank or bank holding company. Like all bank holding companies, we are regulated extensively under federal and state law. Under federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to the safety and soundness of insured depository institutions, state banking regulators, the Federal Reserve, and separately the FDIC as the insurer of bank deposits have the authority to compel or restrict certain actions on our part if they determine that we have insufficient capital or other resources, or are otherwise operating in a manner that may be deemed to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices. Under this authority, our regulators can require us or our subsidiaries to enter into informal or formal supervisory agreements, including board resolutions, memoranda of understanding, written agreements, and consent or cease and desist orders pursuant to which we would be required to take identified corrective actions to address cited concerns and to refrain from taking certain actions. 
 6 

If we become subject to and are unable to comply with the terms of any regulatory actions or directives, supervisory agreements or orders, then we could become subject to additional, heightened supervisory actions and orders, possibly including prompt corrective action restrictions and/or other regulatory actions, including prohibitions on the payment of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock. If our regulators were to take such supervisory actions, then we could, among other things, become subject to significant restrictions on our ability to develop any new business, as well as restrictions on our existing business, and we could be required to raise additional capital, dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period of time, or both. The terms of any such action could have a material negative effect on our business, reputation, operating flexibility, financial condition, and the value of our common stock and preferred stock. See Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors - Compliance and Regulatory Risk - We may become subject to supervisory actions and enhanced regulation that could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating flexibility, financial condition, and the value of our common stock and preferred stock of this Report. 
 Activity Limitations 
 As a financial holding company, we are permitted to engage directly or indirectly in a broader range of activities than those permitted for a bank holding company that has not elected to be a financial holding company. Bank holding companies are generally restricted to engaging in the business of banking, managing or controlling banks and certain other activities determined by the Federal Reserve to be closely related to banking. Financial holding companies may also engage in activities that are considered to be financial in nature, as well as those incidental or, if determined by the Federal Reserve, complementary to financial activities. If Synovus Bank ceases to be well capitalized or well managed under applicable regulatory standards, or if Synovus Bank receives a rating of less than satisfactory under the CRA, the Federal Reserve may, among other things, place limitations on our ability to conduct these broader financial activities or, if the deficiencies persist, require us to divest the banking subsidiary or the businesses engaged in activities permissible only for financial holding companies. 
 In addition, the Federal Reserve has the power to order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any nonbanking activity or terminate its ownership or control of any nonbank subsidiary when it has reasonable cause to believe that continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of any bank subsidiary of that bank holding company. As further described below, each of the Company and Synovus Bank is well-capitalized under applicable regulatory standards as of December 31, 2022, and Synovus Bank has an overall rating of Satisfactory in its most recent CRA evaluation. 
 Source of Strength Obligations 
 A bank holding company, such as us, is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank. The term source of financial strength means the ability of a company, such as us, that directly or indirectly owns or controls an insured depository institution, such as Synovus Bank, to provide financial assistance to such insured depository institution in the event of financial distress. The appropriate federal banking agency for the depository institution (in the case of Synovus Bank, this agency is the Federal Reserve) may require reports from us to assess our ability to serve as a source of strength and to enforce compliance with the source of strength requirements by requiring us to provide financial assistance to Synovus Bank in the event of financial distress. If we were to enter bankruptcy or become subject to the orderly liquidation process established by the Dodd-Frank Act, any commitment by us to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of Synovus Bank would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee or the FDIC, as appropriate, and entitled to a priority of payment. In addition, the FDIC provides that any insured depository institution generally will be liable for any loss incurred by the FDIC in connection with the default of, or any assistance provided by the FDIC to, a commonly controlled insured depository institution. Synovus Bank is an FDIC-insured depository institution and thus subject to these requirements. 
 Acquisitions 
 The BHC Act permits acquisitions of banks by bank holding companies, such that we and any other bank holding company, whether located in Georgia or elsewhere, may acquire a bank located in any other state, subject to certain deposit-percentage, age of bank charter requirements, and other restrictions. The BHC Act requires that a bank holding company obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before (i) acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares of any additional bank or bank holding company, (ii) taking any action that causes an additional bank or bank holding company to become a subsidiary of the bank holding company, or (iii) merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company. The Federal Reserve may not approve any such transaction that would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any section of the United States, or the effect of which may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in any section of the country, or that in any other manner would be in restraint of trade unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve is also required to consider: (i) the financial and managerial resources of the companies involved, including pro forma capital ratios; (ii) the risk to the stability of the United States banking or financial 
 7 

system; (iii) the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including performance under the CRA; and (iv) the effectiveness of the company in combatting money laundering. 
 Change in Control 
 Federal law restricts the amount of voting stock of a bank holding company or a bank that a person may acquire without the prior approval of banking regulators. Under the Change in Bank Control Act and the regulations thereunder, a person or group must give advance notice to the Federal Reserve before acquiring control of any bank holding company, such as the Company, or before acquiring control of any FDIC-insured bank, such as Synovus Bank. Upon receipt of such notice, the Federal Reserve may approve or disapprove the acquisition. The Change in Bank Control Act creates a rebuttable presumption of control if a person or group acquires the power to vote 10 or more of our outstanding common stock. The overall effect of such laws is to make it more difficult to acquire a bank holding company and a bank by tender offer or similar means than it might be to acquire control of another type of corporation. Consequently, shareholders of the Company may be less likely to benefit from the rapid increases in stock prices that may result from tender offers or similar efforts to acquire control of other companies. Investors should be aware of these requirements when acquiring shares of our stock. 
 Governance and Financial Reporting Obligations 
 We are required to comply with various corporate governance and financial reporting requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules and regulations adopted by the SEC, the PCAOB, and the NYSE. In particular, we are required to include management and independent registered public accounting firm reports on internal controls as part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K in order to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We have evaluated our controls, including compliance with the SEC rules on internal controls, and have and expect to continue to spend significant amounts of time and money on compliance with these rules. Our failure to comply with these internal control rules may materially adversely affect our reputation, ability to obtain the necessary certifications to financial statements, and the values of our securities. The assessments of our financial reporting controls as of December 31, 2022 are included in this report under Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 
 The Federal Reserve also requires bank holding companies meeting certain asset size thresholds, such as us, to establish and maintain a risk committee of its board of directors and appoint a chief risk officer, each meeting certain requirements. 
 Volcker Rule 
 Section 13 of the BHC Act, commonly referred to as the Volcker Rule, generally prohibits us and our subsidiaries from (i) engaging in certain proprietary trading, and (ii) acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in or sponsoring a covered fund, all subject to certain exceptions. The Volcker Rule also specifies certain limited activities in which we and our subsidiaries may continue to engage and requires us to maintain a compliance program. In 2020, amendments to the proprietary trading and covered funds regulations issued by the federal banking agencies, the SEC, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission took effect, simplifying compliance and providing additional exclusions and exemptions. 
 Incentive Compensation 
 The Dodd-Frank Act required the federal banking agencies and the SEC to establish joint rules or guidelines for financial institutions with more than 1 billion in assets, such as us and Synovus Bank, which prohibit incentive compensation arrangements that the agencies determine to encourage inappropriate risks by the institution. The federal banking agencies issued proposed rules in 2011 and previously issued guidance on sound incentive compensation policies. In 2016, the federal banking agencies and the SEC proposed rules that would, depending upon the assets of the institution, directly regulate incentive compensation arrangements and would require enhanced oversight and recordkeeping. As of December 31, 2022, these rules have not been implemented, although the SEC did adopt final rules implementing the clawback provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2022. We and Synovus Bank have undertaken efforts to ensure that our incentive compensation plans do not encourage inappropriate risks, consistent with three key principles - that incentive compensation arrangements should appropriately balance risk and financial rewards, be compatible with effective controls and risk management, and be supported by strong corporate governance. 
 Other Regulatory Matters 
 We and our subsidiaries are subject to oversight by the SEC, the FINRA, the PCAOB, the NYSE, and various state securities and insurance regulators. We and our subsidiaries have from time to time received requests for information from regulatory authorities in various states, including state attorneys general, securities regulators, and other regulatory authorities concerning our business practices. Such requests are considered incidental to the normal conduct of business. 
 Capital Requirements 
 We and Synovus Bank are required under federal law to maintain certain minimum capital levels based on ratios of capital to total assets and capital to risk-weighted assets. The required capital ratios are minimums, and the Federal Reserve may 
 8 

determine that a banking organization based on its size, complexity, or risk profile must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner. Risks such as concentration of credit risks and the risk arising from non-traditional activities, as well as the institution s exposure to a decline in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates, and an institution s ability to manage those risks, are important factors that are to be taken into account in assessing an institution s overall capital adequacy. The following is a brief description of the relevant provisions of these capital rules and their potential impact on our capital levels. 
 We and Synovus Bank are subject to the following risk-based capital ratios: a CET1 risk-based capital ratio, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, which includes CET1 and additional Tier 1 capital, and a total risk-based capital ratio, which includes Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. CET1 is primarily comprised of the sum of common stock instruments and related surplus net of treasury stock plus retained earnings less certain adjustments and deductions, including with respect to goodwill, intangible assets, mortgage servicing assets, and deferred tax assets subject to temporary timing differences. Additional Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital consists of instruments disqualified from Tier 1 capital, including qualifying subordinated debt and a limited amount of loan loss reserves up to a maximum of 1.25 of risk-weighted assets, subject to certain eligibility criteria. The capital rules also define the risk-weights assigned to assets and off-balance sheet items to determine the risk-weighted asset components of the risk-based capital rules, including, for example, certain high volatility commercial real estate, past due assets, structured securities, and equity holdings. 
 The leverage capital ratio, which serves as a minimum capital standard, is the ratio of Tier 1 capital to quarterly average total consolidated assets net of goodwill, certain other intangible assets, and certain required deduction items. The required minimum leverage ratio for all banks and bank holding companies is 4 . 
 In addition, effective January 1, 2019, the capital rules required a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 above each of the minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements (CET1, Tier 1, and total capital), which is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. These buffer requirements must be met for a bank or bank holding company to be able to pay dividends, engage in share buybacks, or make discretionary bonus payments to executive management without restriction. 
 The FDICIA, among other things, requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to take prompt corrective action regarding depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five regulatory capital tiers: well capitalized , adequately capitalized , undercapitalized , significantly undercapitalized , and critically undercapitalized . A depository institution s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation. FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. The FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive restraints on operations, management, and capital distributions depending on the category in which an institution is classified. Undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve System. In addition, undercapitalized depository institutions may not accept brokered deposits absent a waiver from the FDIC, are subject to growth limitations, and are required to submit capital restoration plans for regulatory approval. A depository institution's holding company must guarantee any required capital restoration plan up to an amount equal to the lesser of 5 of the depository institution's assets at the time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution fails to comply with the plan. Federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution's capital. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. 
 To be well-capitalized, Synovus Bank must maintain at least the following capital ratios: 
 6.5 CET1 to risk-weighted assets; 
 8.0 Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets; 
 10.0 Total capital to risk-weighted assets; and 
 5.0 leverage ratio. 
 The Federal Reserve has not yet revised the well-capitalized standard for bank holding companies to reflect the higher capital requirements imposed under the current capital rules applicable to banks. For purposes of the Federal Reserve s Regulation Y, including determining whether a bank holding company meets the requirements to be a financial holding company, bank holding companies, such as the Company, must maintain a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0 or greater and a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0 or greater to be well-capitalized. Also, the Federal Reserve may require bank holding companies, including the Company, to maintain capital ratios substantially in excess of mandated minimum levels depending upon general economic conditions and a bank holding company s particular condition, risk profile, and growth plans. 
 Failure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have an adverse material effect on our operations or financial condition. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could also result in restrictions on the Company s or Synovus 
 9 

Bank s ability to pay dividends or otherwise distribute capital or to receive regulatory approval of applications or other restrictions on its growth. 
 In 2022, the Company s and Synovus Bank s regulatory capital ratios were above the applicable well-capitalized standards and met the capital conservation buffer. Based on current estimates, we believe that the Company and Synovus Bank will continue to exceed all applicable well-capitalized regulatory capital requirements and the capital conservation buffer in 2023. As of December 31, 2022, the consolidated capital ratios of Synovus and Synovus Bank were as follows: 
 Table 1 Capital Ratios as of December 31, 2022 Synovus Synovus Bank CET1 capital ratio 9.63 10.66 Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio 10.68 10.66 Total risk-based capital ratio 12.54 11.89 Leverage ratio 9.07 9.06 
 See "Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources" and "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10 - Regulatory Capital" of this Report for further information. 
 On August 26, 2020, the federal banking regulators issued a final rule that allowed electing banking organizations that adopted CECL during 2020 to mitigate the estimated effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year phase-in transition perio d. Synovus adopted CECL on January 1, 2020, and Synovus' December 31, 2022 regulatory capital ratios reflect Synovus' election of the five-year transition provision. See "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of this Report for additional information on CECL. 
 Payment of Dividends 
 We are a legal entity separate and distinct from Synovus Bank and our other subsidiaries. Under the laws of the State of Georgia, we, as a business corporation, may declare and pay dividends in cash or property unless the payment or declaration would be contrary to restrictions contained in our Articles of Incorporation, or unless, after payment of the dividend, we would not be able to pay our debts when they become due in the usual course of our business or our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities. In addition, we are also subject to federal regulatory capital requirements that effectively limit the amount of cash dividends that we may pay. 
 The primary sources of funds for our payment of dividends to our shareholders are cash on hand and dividends from Synovus Bank and our non-bank subsidiaries. Various federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends that Synovus Bank may pay. Synovus Bank is a Georgia bank. Under the regulations of the GA DBF, a Georgia bank must have approval of the GA DBF to pay cash dividends if, at the time of such payment: 
 the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total assets is less than 6 ; 
 the aggregate amount of dividends to be declared or anticipated to be declared during the current calendar year exceeds 50 of its net income for the previous calendar year; or 
 its total adversely classified assets in its most recent regulatory examination exceeded 80 of its Tier 1 capital plus its allowance for loan and lease losses. 
 The Georgia Financial Institutions Code also contains restrictions on the ability of a Georgia bank to pay dividends other than from retained earnings without the approval of the GA DBF. As a result of the foregoing restrictions, Synovus Bank may be required to seek approval from the GA DBF to pay dividends. 
 In addition, we and Synovus Bank are subject to various general regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory minimums. The Federal Reserve has indicated that paying dividends that deplete a bank s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. The Federal Reserve has indicated that depository institutions and their holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. 
 Under a Federal Reserve policy adopted in 2009, the board of directors of a bank holding company must consider different factors to ensure that its dividend level is prudent relative to maintaining a strong financial position and is not based on overly optimistic earnings scenarios, such as potential events that could affect its ability to pay, while still maintaining a strong financial position. As a general matter, the Federal Reserve has indicated that the board of directors of a bank holding company should consult with the Federal Reserve and eliminate, defer, or significantly reduce the bank holding company s dividends if: 
 10 

its net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; 
 its prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with its capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or 
 it will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. 
 Regulation of the Bank 
 Synovus Bank, which is a member of the Federal Reserve System, is subject to comprehensive supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve, and is subject to its regulatory reporting requirements, as well as supervision and regulation by the GA DBF. As a member bank of the Federal Reserve System, Synovus Bank is required to hold stock in its district Federal Reserve Bank in an amount equal to 6 of its capital stock and surplus (half paid to acquire stock with the remainder held as a cash reserve). Member banks do not have any control over the Federal Reserve System as a result of owning the stock and the stock cannot be sold or traded. The annual dividend rate for member banks with total assets in excess of 10 billion, including Synovus Bank, is based on a floating dividend rate tied to10-year U.S. Treasuries with the maximum dividend rate capped at 6 . 
 The deposits of Synovus Bank are insured by the FDIC up to applicable limits, and, accordingly, Synovus Bank is also subject to certain FDIC regulations, and the FDIC has backup examination authority and some enforcement powers over Synovus Bank. Synovus Trust, a subsidiary of Synovus Bank that provides trust services, is organized as a national trust bank and thus is subject to supervision and regulation by the OCC. 
 In addition, as discussed in more detail below, Synovus Bank and any other of our subsidiaries that offer consumer financial products and services are subject to regulation and supervision by the CFPB. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are stricter than those regulations promulgated by the CFPB, and state attorneys general are permitted to enforce certain federal consumer financial protection law. 
 Broadly, regulations applicable to Synovus Bank include limitations on loans to a single borrower and to its directors, officers, and employees; restrictions on the opening and closing of branch offices; the maintenance of required capital ratios; the granting of credit under equal and fair conditions; the disclosure of the costs and terms of such credit; requirements to maintain reserves against deposits and loans; limitations on the types of investment that may be made by Synovus Bank; and requirements governing risk management practices. Subject to Federal Reserve approval and certain state filing requirements, Synovus Bank is permitted under federal law to branch on a de novo basis across state lines wherever the laws of that state would permit a bank chartered by that state to establish a branch. 
 Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders 
 Synovus Bank is subject to restrictions on extensions of credit and certain other transactions between Synovus Bank and the Company or any nonbank affiliate. Generally, these covered transactions with either the Company or any affiliate are limited to 10 of Synovus Bank s capital and surplus, and all such transactions between Synovus Bank and the Company and all of its nonbank affiliates combined are limited to 20 of Synovus Bank s capital and surplus. Loans and other extensions of credit from Synovus Bank to the Company or any affiliate generally are required to be secured by eligible collateral in specified amounts. In addition, any transaction between Synovus Bank and the Company or any affiliate are required to be on an arm s length basis. Federal banking laws also place similar restrictions on certain extensions of credit by insured banks, such as Synovus Bank, to their directors, executive officers, and principal shareholders. 
 FDIC Insurance Assessments and Depositor Preference 
 Synovus Bank s deposits are insured by the FDIC s DIF up to the limits under applicable law, which currently are set at 250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category. Synovus Bank is subject to FDIC assessments for its deposit insurance. The FDIC calculates quarterly deposit insurance assessments based on an institution s average total consolidated assets less its average tangible equity, and applies one of four risk categories determined by reference to its capital levels, supervisory ratings, and certain other factors. The assessment rate schedule can change from time to time, at the discretion of the FDIC, subject to certain limits. 
 As of June 30, 2020, the DIF reserve ratio fell to 1.30 , below the statutory minimum of 1.35 . The FDIC, as required under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, established a plan on September 15, 2020 to restore the DIF reserve ratio to meet or exceed the statutory minimum of 1.35 within eight years. On October 18, 2022, the FDIC adopted an amended restoration plan to increase the likelihood that the reserve ratio would be restored to at least 1.35 by September 30, 2028. The FDIC's amended restoration plan increases the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly by 2 bps, beginning in the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. The FDIC could further increase the deposit insurance assessments for certain insured depository institutions, including Synovus Bank, if the DIF reserve ratio is not restored as projected. 
 11 

Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by a bank s federal regulatory agency. In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that, in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution, including those of the parent bank holding company. See "Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Deposits" of this Report for further information. 
 Standards for Safety and Soundness 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to prescribe, by regulation or guideline, operational and managerial standards for all insured depository institutions relating to: (i) internal controls; (ii) information systems and audit systems; (iii) loan documentation; (iv) credit underwriting; (v) interest rate risk exposure; and (vi) asset quality. The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement these required standards. These guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards used to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. Under the regulations, if a regulator determines that a bank fails to meet any standards prescribed by the guidelines, the regulator may require the bank to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance, consistent with deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans. 
 Anti-Money Laundering 
 A continued focus of governmental policy relating to financial institutions in recent years has been combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA PATRIOT Act broadened the application of anti-money laundering regulations to apply to additional types of financial institutions such as broker-dealers, investment advisors, and insurance companies, and strengthened the ability of the U.S. government to help prevent, detect and prosecute international money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The principal provisions of Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act require that regulated financial institutions, including state member banks: (i) establish an anti-money laundering program that includes training and audit components; (ii) comply with regulations regarding the verification of the identity of any person seeking to open an account; (iii) take additional required precautions with non-U.S. owned accounts; and (iv) perform certain verification and certification of money laundering risk for their foreign correspondent banking relationships. Failure of a financial institution to comply with the USA PATRIOT Act s requirements could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. Synovus Bank has augmented its systems and procedures to meet the requirements of these regulations and will continue to revise and update its policies, procedures, and controls to reflect changes required by law. 
 FinCEN has adopted rules that require financial institutions to obtain beneficial ownership information with respect to legal entities with which such institutions conduct business, subject to certain exclusions and exemptions. Bank regulators are focusing their examinations on anti-money laundering compliance, and we continue to monitor and augment, where necessary, our anti-money laundering compliance programs. Banking regulators will consider compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act s money laundering provisions in acting upon merger and acquisition proposals. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and have been active in imposing cease and desist and other regulatory orders and civil money penalties against institutions found to be violating these obligations. Sanctions for violations of the USA PATRIOT Act can be imposed in an amount equal to twice the sum involved in the violating transaction, up to 1 million. On January 1, 2021, Congress passed federal legislation that made sweeping changes to federal anti-money laundering laws, including changes that will be implemented in subsequent years. 
 Economic Sanctions 
 The OFAC is responsible for helping to ensure that U.S. entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties, as defined by various executive orders and acts of Congress. OFAC publishes, and routinely updates, lists of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring, or engaging in terrorist acts, including the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List. If we find a name on any transaction, account, or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, we must undertake certain specified activities, which could include blocking or freezing the account or transaction requested, and we must notify the appropriate authorities. 
 12 

Concentrations in Lending 
 During 2006, the federal bank regulatory agencies released guidance on Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending (the Guidance and advised financial institutions of the risks posed by CRE lending concentrations. The Guidance requires that appropriate processes be in place to identify, monitor, and control risks associated with real estate lending concentrations. Higher allowances for loan losses and capital levels may also be required. The Guidance is triggered when CRE loan concentrations exceed either: 
 total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land of 100 or more of a bank s total risk-based capital; or 
 total reported loans secured by multifamily and nonfarm nonresidential properties and loans for construction, land development, and other land of 300 or more of a bank s total risk-based capital. 
 The Guidance also applies when a bank has a sharp increase in CRE loans or has significant concentrations of CRE secured by a particular property type. We have always had exposures to loans secured by CRE due to the nature of our markets and the borrowing needs of both consumer and commercial clients. We believe our long-term experience in CRE lending, underwriting policies, internal controls, and other policies currently in place, as well as our loan and credit monitoring and administration procedures, are generally appropriate in managing our concentrations as required under the Guidance. 
 Debit Interchange Fees 
 Interchange fees, or "swipe" fees, are fees that merchants pay to credit card companies and card-issuing banks such as Synovus Bank for processing electronic payment transactions on their behalf. The maximum permissible interchange fee that a non-exempt issuer such as Synovus Bank may receive for an electronic debit transaction is the sum of 21 cents per transaction and 5 bps multiplied by the value of the transaction, subject to an upward adjustment of 1 cent if an issuer certifies that it has implemented policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the fraud-prevention standards set forth by the Federal Reserve. In addition, card issuers and networks are prohibited from entering into arrangements requiring that debit card transactions be processed on a single network or only two affiliated networks, and allows merchants to determine transaction routing. 
 Community Reinvestment Act 
 Synovus Bank is subject to the provisions of the CRA, which imposes a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of entire communities where the bank accepts deposits, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The Federal Reserve s assessment of Synovus Bank s CRA record is made available to the public. CRA agreements with private parties must be disclosed and annual CRA reports must be made to the Federal Reserve. A bank holding company will not be permitted to become or remain a financial holding company and no new activities authorized under GLB may be commenced by a holding company or by a bank financial subsidiary if any of its bank subsidiaries received less than a satisfactory CRA rating in its latest CRA examination. Federal CRA regulations require, among other things, that evidence of discrimination against applicants on a prohibited basis and illegal or abusive lending practices be considered in the CRA evaluation. Synovus Bank has a rating of Satisfactory in its most recent CRA evaluation. 
 On September 21, 2020, the Federal Reserve issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking that would modernize and substantially revise the regulations implementing the CRA. On May 5, 2022, the OCC, Federal Reserve, and FDIC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to provide for a coordinated approach to modernize their respective CRA regulations, such that all banks will be subject to the same set of CRA rules. No final rule has been issued, but the rulemaking may affect Synovus Bank's CRA compliance obligations in the future. 
 Privacy, Credit Reporting, and Data Security 
 The GLB generally prohibits disclosure of non-public consumer information to non-affiliated third parties unless the consumer has been given the opportunity to object and has not objected to such disclosure. Financial institutions are further required to disclose their privacy policies to clients annually. Financial institutions, however, will be required to comply with state law if it is more protective of consumer privacy than the GLB. The GLB also directed federal regulators to prescribe standards for the security of consumer information. Synovus Bank is subject to such standards, as well as standards for notifying clients in the event of a security breach. Synovus Bank utilizes credit bureau data in underwriting activities. Use of such data is regulated under the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Regulation V on a uniform, nationwide basis, including credit reporting, prescreening, and sharing of information between affiliates and the use of credit data. The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, which amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act, permits states to enact identity theft laws that are not inconsistent with the conduct required by the provisions of that Act. Clients must be notified when unauthorized disclosure involves sensitive client information that may be misused. On November 18, 2021, the federal banking agencies issued a new rule effective in 2022 that requires banks to notify their primary federal regulator within 36 hours of a computer-security incident that rises to the level of a notification incident. 
 13 

The federal banking regulators regularly issue guidance regarding cybersecurity intended to enhance cyber risk management standards among financial institutions. As a result, financial institutions, like Synovus and Synovus Bank, are expected to establish multiple lines of defense and to ensure their risk management processes address the risk posed by potential threats to the institution. A financial institution s management is expected to maintain sufficient processes to effectively respond and recover the institution s operations after a cyber-attack. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations if a critical service provider of the institution falls victim to this type of cyber-attack. Our information security protocols are designed in part to adhere to the requirements of this guidance. 
 State regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations. Recently, several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and providing detailed requirements with respect to these programs, including data encryption requirements. Many states have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification and data privacy requirements. We expect this trend of state-level activity in those areas to continue and are continually monitoring developments in the states in which our clients are located. 
 Anti-Tying Restrictions 
 In general, a bank may not extend credit, lease, sell property, or furnish any services or fix or vary the consideration for them on the condition that (i) the client obtain or provide some additional credit, property, or services from or to the bank or bank holding company or their subsidiaries or (ii) the client not obtain some other credit, property, or services from a competitor, except to the extent reasonable conditions are imposed to assure the soundness of the credit extended. A bank may, however, offer combined-balance products and may otherwise offer more favorable terms if a client obtains two or more traditional bank products. The law also expressly permits banks to engage in other forms of tying and authorizes the Federal Reserve Board to grant additional exceptions by regulation or order. Also, certain foreign transactions are exempt from the general rule. 
 Consumer Regulation 
 Activities of Synovus Bank are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers. These laws and regulations include, among numerous other things, provisions that: 
 limit the interest and other charges collected or contracted for by Synovus Bank, including rules respecting the terms of credit cards and of debit card overdrafts; 
 govern Synovus Bank s disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; 
 require Synovus Bank to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether it is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the communities it serves; 
 prohibit Synovus Bank from discriminating on the basis of race, creed, or other prohibited factors when it makes decisions to extend credit; 
 govern the manner in which Synovus Bank may collect consumer debts; and 
 prohibit unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices in the provision of consumer financial products and services. 
 Mortgage Regulation 
 The CFPB adopted a rule that implements the ability-to-repay and qualified mortgage provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act (the ATR/QM rule ), which requires lenders to consider, among other things, income, employment status, assets, payment amounts, and credit history before approving a mortgage, and provides a compliance safe harbor for lenders that issue certain qualified mortgages. The ATR/QM rule defines a qualified mortgage to have certain specified characteristics and generally prohibits loans with negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, or terms exceeding 30 years from being qualified mortgages. The rule also establishes general underwriting criteria for qualified mortgages, including that monthly payments be calculated based on the highest payment that will apply in the first five years of the loan and that the borrower have a total debt-to-income ratio that is less than or equal to 43 . While qualified mortgages will generally be afforded safe harbor status, a rebuttable presumption of compliance with the ability-to-repay requirements will attach to qualified mortgages that are higher priced mortgages (which are generally subprime loans). In addition, the securitizer of asset-backed securities must retain not less than 5 of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing the asset-backed securities, unless subject to an exemption for asset-backed securities that are collateralized exclusively by residential mortgages that qualify as qualified residential mortgages. 
 The CFPB has also issued rules to implement requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act pertaining to mortgage loan origination (including with respect to loan originator compensation and loan originator qualifications) as well as integrated mortgage disclosure rules. In addition, the CFPB has issued rules that require servicers to comply with certain standards and practices with regard to error correction; information disclosure; force-placement of insurance; information management policies and procedures; requiring information about mortgage loss mitigation options be provided to delinquent borrowers; providing delinquent borrowers access to servicer personnel with continuity of contact about the borrower s mortgage loan account; and evaluating borrowers applications for available loss mitigation options. These rules also address initial rate adjustment notices 
 14 

for adjustable-rate mortgages, periodic statements for residential mortgage loans, and prompt crediting of mortgage payments and response to requests for payoff amounts. 
 Non-Discrimination Policies 
 Synovus Bank is also subject to, among other things, the provisions of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act, both of which prohibit discrimination based on race or color, religion, national origin, sex, and familial status in any aspect of a consumer or commercial credit or residential real estate transaction. The Department of Justice and the federal bank regulatory agencies have issued an Interagency Policy Statement on Discrimination in Lending that provides guidance to financial institutions in determining whether discrimination exists, how the agencies will respond to lending discrimination, and what steps lenders might take to prevent discriminatory lending practices. The DOJ has increased its efforts to prosecute what it regards as violations of the ECOA and FHA. 
 LIBOR 
 On March 15, 2022, Congress enacted the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the "LIBOR Act") to address references to LIBOR in contracts that: (i) are governed by U.S. law; (ii) will not mature before June 30, 2023; and (iii) lack fallback provisions providing for a clearly defined and practicable replacement for LIBOR. On December 16, 2022, the FRB adopted a final rule to implement the LIBOR Act by identifying benchmark rates based on SOFR that will replace LIBOR in certain financial contracts after June 30, 2023. The final rule identifies replacement benchmark rates based on SOFR to replace overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month, and 12-month LIBOR contracts subject to the LIBOR Act.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 This section highlights the material risks that we currently face. Please be aware that these risks may change over time and other risks may prove to be important in the future. New risks may emerge at any time, and we cannot predict such risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations or the trading price of our securities. 
 Strategic Risk 
 Competition in the financial services industry may adversely affect our future earnings and growth. 
 We operate in a highly competitive environment and our profitability and our future growth depends on our ability to compete successfully based on such factors as pricing, convenience, product offerings, technology, accessibility, quality of service, and client relationships. We face pricing competition for loans and deposits and, in order for us to compete for borrowers and depositors, we may be required to offer loans and deposits on terms less favorable to us, including lower rates on our loans and higher rates on our deposits. Certain of our competitors are larger and have more resources than we do, enabling them to be more aggressive than us in competing across the financial services landscape and investing in new products, technology and services. In addition, the ability of non-bank competitors to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has intensified the competition we face. These non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern us and, therefore, may be able to operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures. Non-bank competitors can also operate in areas or offer certain products that may be considered speculative or risky. This significant competition in making loans and attracting and retaining deposits as well as in providing other financial services may impact our future earnings and growth. 
 Furthermore, the financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory, and technological changes and continued consolidation. 
 While we cannot predict the actions of state or federal legislatures or regulators, there is increasing likelihood that the bank regulatory landscape could shift due to legislation or regulatory action. Any material change to federal or state banking laws, regulations, or enforcement position could result in increased competition or make it more difficult for banks of our size to compete, either broadly or in specific segments of our business. 
 Technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks and smaller banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by larger banks. Competitors adopting new technologies or changes to consumer behaviors or expectations could require us to make significant expenditures to modify or make additions to our current products and services. 
 There has also been increasing consolidation among regional banks similar in size or larger than us resulting in even larger banks. The resulting larger banks, as well as many other banks that are larger than us, may be able to achieve economies of scale due to their size and, as a result, may be able to operate more efficiently than us and also offer a broader range of products and services than we do, as well as better pricing for those products and services. 
 We may not realize the expected benefits from our strategic initiatives and other operational and execution goals, either in whole or in part, which could negatively impact our future profitability. 
 In the current competitive banking environment, overall revenue growth must outpace operating costs, which requires the successful execution of both growth and efficiency initiatives. In addition, we must continue to implement strategies to grow our product and service offerings and keep pace with changing technologies and client expectations in order to realize continued earnings growth and to remain competitive with the other banks and non-bank financial services providers in the markets we serve. We are continuously implementing strategic initiatives to achieve growth, reduce expense, and unlock efficiencies. Our current initiatives include, but are not limited to, building out our Maast digital banking as a service solution, including through our pending investment in Qualpay, Inc., growing our new corporate and investment banking division, developing certain digital asset capabilities and products, and modernizing our core technology infrastructure. While we have realized growth and efficiency gains as a result of current and past initiatives, including the recently completed Synovus Forward initiative, there is no guarantee that these initiatives will be successful in supporting growth or achieving the expected level of future savings and revenue enhancements that we anticipate. Additionally, any new service and product offerings, particularly digital offerings, will compete directly with other Synovus Bank product and service offerings, so any realized revenue from such growth initiatives may correspond to decreased revenue experienced by other Synovus Bank product and service offerings. 
 Furthermore, our strategic initiatives may result in an increase in expense, divert management attention, take away from other opportunities that may have proved more successful, negatively impact operational effectiveness or impact employee morale. In addition, management expects to continue to make strategic investments in technology and talent that are expected to improve our client experience and support future growth which will require an increase in our expenditures. There can be no assurance that we will ultimately realize the anticipated benefits of these strategic initiatives, or that these strategic initiatives 
 16 

will not negatively impact our organization. These initiatives may fail to meet our own or our client s expectations and may fail to keep pace with bank and non-bank competition and we may realize significant losses as a result. 
 Finally, changes to the bank regulatory landscape generally, but particularly with respect to digital product offerings and third-party service providers could negatively impact and undermine the rationale behind several of our initiatives. 
 The implementation of new lines of business, new products and services, and new technologies may subject us to additional risk. 
 We have launched or enhanced a number of lines of business, products and services, and technologies, including, among others, those related to our recent Maast and corporate and investment banking initiatives and our treasury and payments solutions business and asset-based and structured lending capabilities. An important part of our business strategy is to continue these efforts to implement new products, services, and technologies designed to better serve our clients and respond to digitization trends in banking. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business, new products or services, and/or new technologies may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. Additionally, such new products, services, and technologies often increase our reliance on third-party service providers. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business, a new product or service, and/or new technologies. Furthermore, any new line of business, new product or service, and/or new technology could require the establishment of new key controls and other controls and have a significant impact on our existing system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation could have a material adverse effect on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations. 
 We may pursue bank and non-bank acquisition opportunities as they arise. However, even if we identify attractive acquisition opportunities, we may not be able to complete such acquisitions on favorable terms or realize the anticipated benefits from such acquisitions. 
 While we continue to focus on organic growth opportunities, we may pursue attractive bank or non-bank acquisition and consolidation opportunities that arise in our core markets and beyond. The number of financial institutions headquartered in Georgia, Florida, the Southeastern United States, and across the country continues to decline through merger and other consolidation activity. In the event that attractive acquisition opportunities arise, we would likely face competition for such acquisitions from other banking and financial companies, many of which have significantly greater resources and may have more attractive valuations. This competition could either prevent us from being able to complete attractive acquisition opportunities or increase prices for potential acquisitions which could reduce our potential returns, and reduce the attractiveness of these opportunities to us. Furthermore, even if we are able to identify and complete acquisitions, the terms of such acquisitions may not be favorable to us or we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits from such acquisitions. Also, all acquisitions are subject to various regulatory approvals, and if we were unable (or there was a perception that we would be unable) to obtain such approvals for any reason, including due to any actual or perceived capital, liquidity, profitability, or regulatory compliance issues, it would impair our ability to consummate acquisitions. In addition, any acquisition could be dilutive to our earnings and shareholders equity per share of our common stock. 
 Operational Risk 
 Failure to attract and retain employees and the impact of senior leadership transitions may adversely impact our ability to successfully execute our growth and efficiency strategies. 
 Our financial success depends upon our ability to attract and retain diverse, highly motivated, and well-qualified personnel that we rely on to execute all aspects of our business. We face increasingly significant competition in the recruitment of qualified employees at all levels from financial institutions and others. Moreover, the banking industry continues to transform due to technological innovation, increased demand for workplace flexibility, and competition for talent from non-bank financial services providers, and our ability to recruit and retain qualified individuals that bring a diversity of perspective and innovative thinking to our teams is both more difficult and more necessary than ever before. These trends, combined with labor shortages, have resulted in generally increasing labor costs. Such trends may continue in the near term, which may result in further challenges in hiring and retaining employees throughout the organization. We must continually assess and manage how our talent needs change over time and failure to meet such needs may have a negative impact on our ability to compete. 
 In addition, our future growth and the continued diversification of our loan portfolio depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain the right mix of well-qualified employees. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees, our ability to execute our business strategies may suffer and we may be required to substantially increase our overall compensation or benefits to attract and retain such employees. Furthermore, we generally do not have employment agreements in place with our frontline employees, management team, or other key employees and cannot guarantee that our employees will remain with us. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel, especially members of our senior management team, could have a material adverse impact on the business because we would lose their skills, knowledge of the market, and years of 
 17 

industry experience and may have difficulty promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. In addition, the unexpected loss or inability to hire or retain branch-level employees could have a material adverse impact on our ability to increase deposits, generate frontline revenue, and properly service our clients. 
 Furthermore, we have had recent leadership changes and transitions involving our senior leadership team, as previously announced. Such leadership changes can be inherently difficult to manage, and an inadequate transition may cause disruption to our business, including to our relationships with our clients, suppliers, vendors, and employees. It may also make it more difficult for us to hire and retain key employees. In addition, any failure to ensure the effective transfer of knowledge and a smooth leadership transition could hinder our strategic planning, execution, and future performance. 
 The financial services market is undergoing rapid technological changes, and if we are unable to stay current with those changes, we will not be able to effectively compete. 
 The financial services market, including banking services, is undergoing rapid changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services, primarily related to increased digitization of banking services and capabilities. These trends were accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing demand for mobile banking solutions. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to keep pace with these technological changes and to use technology to satisfy and grow client demand for our products and services and to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Our substantial investments in digital banking solutions, technology, and information systems will increase our dependency on third-party service providers and such investments may underperform expectations and could result in unexpected losses. Some of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements and have invested more heavily than us, and will continue to be able to do so, in developing and adopting new technologies, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage. Some of these competitors consist of financial technology providers who are beginning to offer more traditional banking products and may either acquire a bank charter or obtain a bank-like charter, such as the Fintech charter provided by the OCC. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services, be successful in marketing these products and services to our clients, or keep pace with our competitors in this arena. As a result, our ability to effectively compete to retain or acquire new business may be impaired, and our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be adversely affected. 
 We may not be able to successfully implement current or future information technology system enhancements and operational initiatives, which could adversely affect our business operations and profitability. 
 We continue to invest significant resources in our core information technology systems, including by deepening and expanding our use of cloud-based applications, in order to provide functionality and security at an appropriate level, and to improve our operating efficiency and to streamline our client experience. These initiatives significantly increase the complexity of our relationships with third-party service providers and such relationships may be difficult to unwind. We may not be able to successfully implement and integrate such system enhancements and initiatives, which could adversely impact the ability to comply with a number of legal and regulatory requirements, which could result in sanctions from regulatory authorities. In addition, these projects could have higher than expected costs and/or result in operating inefficiencies, which could increase the costs associated with the implementation as well as ongoing operations. Failure to properly utilize system enhancements that are implemented in the future could result in impairment charges that adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations, could result in significant costs to remediate or replace the defective components, and could impact our ability to compete. In addition, we may incur significant training, licensing, maintenance, consulting, and amortization expense during and after implementation, and any such costs may continue for an extended period of time. As such, we cannot guarantee that the anticipated long-term benefits of these system enhancements and operational initiatives will be realized. 
 We rely extensively on information technology systems to operate our business and an interruption or security breach may disrupt our business operations, result in reputational harm, and have an adverse effect on our operations. 
 As a large financial institution, we rely extensively on our information technology systems to operate our business, including to process, record, and monitor a large number of client transactions on a continuous basis. As client, public, and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased, our operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions, and breakdowns. Our business, financial, accounting, data processing systems, or other operating systems and facilities may stop operating properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. For example, there could be sudden increases in client transaction volume; electrical or telecommunications outages; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes, and hurricanes; disease pandemics; events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; and, as described below, cyber-attacks. While we have policies, procedures, and systems designed to prevent or limit the effect of possible failures, interruptions, or breaches in security of information systems and business continuity programs designed to provide services in the case of such events, there is no guarantee that these safeguards or programs will address all of the threats that continue to evolve. 
 18 

We face significant cyber and data security risk that could result in the disclosure of confidential information, adversely affect our business or reputation, and expose us to significant liabilities . 
 As a large financial institution, we are under continuous threat of loss due to the velocity and sophistication of cyber-attacks. This risk continues to increase and attack methods continue to evolve in sophistication, velocity, and frequency and can occur from a variety of sources, such as foreign governments, hacktivists, or other well-financed entities, and may originate from less regulated and remote areas of the world. Furthermore, increasingly common remote working environments for both Synovus and many of our clients has heightened these risks. We continually review the security of our IT systems and make the necessary investments to improve the resiliency of our systems and their security from attack. Nonetheless, there remains the risk that we may be materially harmed by a cyber-attack or information security breach. Further, there is no guarantee that our response to any cyber-attack or system interruption, breach, or failure will be effective to mitigate and remediate the issues resulting from such an event, including the costs, reputational harm, and litigation challenges that we may face as a result. 
 Data privacy laws also continue to evolve, with states increasingly proposing or enacting legislation that relates to data privacy and data protection. We may be required to incur additional expense to comply with these evolving regulations and could face penalties for violating any of these regulations. 
 Two of the most significant cyber-attack risks that we face are e-fraud and loss of sensitive client data. Loss from e-fraud occurs when cybercriminals breach and extract funds directly from client or our accounts. Any loss of sensitive client data that results from attempts to breach our systems, such as account numbers and social security numbers, would present significant reputational, legal, and/or regulatory costs to us. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of the evolving nature and complexity of these threats from cybercriminals and hackers, our plans to continue to provide internet banking and mobile banking channels, and our plans to develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our clients. While we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches to date, we have been the subject of attempted hacking and cyber-attacks and there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such significant losses in the future. 
 The occurrence of any cyber-attack or information security breach could result in material adverse consequences to us including damage to our reputation, the loss of clients, and violations of applicable data privacy laws. We also could face litigation and regulatory action. Litigation or regulatory actions in turn could lead to significant liability or other sanctions, including fines and penalties or reimbursement to clients adversely affected by a security breach. Even if we do not suffer any material adverse consequences as a result of events affecting us directly, successful attacks or systems failures at other large financial institutions could lead to a general loss of client confidence in financial institutions including us. 
 Fraud is an increasing risk for us and for all banks, and as such, we may experience increased losses due to fraud. 
 In 2022, fraud risk increased significantly for us and for all banks. Deposit fraud (check kiting, wire fraud, etc.) and card fraud continue to be significant sources of fraud attempts and loss in our consumer banking business. Moreover, our commercial clients have experienced increased levels of financial fraud risk as well, often requiring our involvement and assistance because of our banking relationship with these clients. The methods used to perpetrate and combat fraud continue to evolve as technology changes and more tools for access to financial services emerge, such as real-time payments. In addition to the cybersecurity risk discussed above, new techniques have made it easier for bad actors to obtain and use client personal information, mimic signatures, and otherwise create false documents that look genuine. Fraud schemes are broad and can include debit card/credit card fraud, check fraud, NSF fraud, mechanical devices attached to ATM machines, social engineering and phishing attacks to obtain personal information, impersonation of our clients through the use of falsified or stolen credentials, employee fraud, information fraud, and other malfeasance. Criminals are turning to new sources to steal personally identifiable information in order to impersonate our clients to commit fraud. 
 Our anti-fraud actions are both preventative (anticipating lines of attack, educating employees and clients, making operational changes) and responsive (remediating actual attacks). We have established policies, processes, and procedures to identify, measure, monitor, mitigate, report, and analyze these risks. We continue to invest in systems, resources, and controls to detect and prevent fraud. There are inherent limitations, however, to our risk management strategies, systems, and controls as they may exist, or develop in the future. We may not appropriately anticipate, monitor, or identify these risks. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses, we may have to expend resources detecting and correcting the failure in our systems, and we may be subject to potential claims from third parties and government agencies. We may also suffer reputational damage. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
 Our regulators require us to report fraud promptly, and regulators often advise banks of new schemes so that the entire industry can adapt as quickly as possible. However, some level of fraud loss is unavoidable, and the risk of loss cannot be eliminated.

If our enterprise risk management framework is not effective at mitigating risk and loss to us, we could suffer unexpected losses and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 
 Our enterprise risk management framework seeks to achieve an appropriate balance between risk and return, which is critical to optimizing shareholder value. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report, and analyze the types of risk to which we are subject, including strategic, market, credit, liquidity, capital, operational, regulatory compliance, litigation, and reputational. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified. For example, the financial and credit crisis and resulting regulatory reform highlighted both the importance and some of the limitations of managing unanticipated risks. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 
 Our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business, and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance. 
 Our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring, and retaining and providing growth opportunities for employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, delivering superior service to our clients, caring about our clients and employees, and investing in our information technology and other systems. If our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees or otherwise, including as a result of operational errors, clerical or record-keeping errors, or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems or a successful cyberattack against us or other unauthorized release or loss of client information, our reputation, business, and our operating results may be materially adversely affected. Damage to our reputation could also negatively impact our credit ratings and impede our access to the capital markets. 
 We rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure. 
 Third parties provide key components of our business operations such as our core technology infrastructure, cloud-based operations, data processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, internet connections, and network access. We have selected these third-party vendors carefully and have conducted the due diligence consistent with regulatory guidance and best practices. While we have ongoing programs to review third party vendors and assess risk, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, issues at a third-party vendor of a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, cyber-attacks and security breaches at a vendor, failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason, or poor performance of services, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our clients and otherwise conduct our business. Financial or operational difficulties of a third-party vendor could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor's ability to serve us. Furthermore, our vendors could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints. Replacing these third-party vendors could also create significant delay and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to our business operations. Our digital services growth initiatives, core technology upgrades, and digital asset initiatives constitute specific increases in third-party risk as such initiatives are distinctly dependent on the performance of our third-party partners. 
 As an issuer of credit and debit cards we are exposed to losses in the event that holders of our cards experience fraud on their card accounts . 
 Our clients regularly use Synovus-issued credit and debit cards to pay for transactions with retailers and other businesses. There is the risk of data security breaches at these retailers and other businesses that could result in the misappropriation of our clients credit and debit card information. We also may nonetheless suffer losses associated with reimbursing our clients for fraudulent transactions on clients card accounts, as well as for other costs related to data security compromise events, such as replacing cards associated with compromised card accounts. In addition, we provide card transaction processing services to some merchant clients under agreements we have with payment networks such as Visa and MasterCard. Under these agreements, we may be responsible for certain losses and penalties if one of our merchant clients suffers a data security breach. 
 Our independent sales organization relationships are complex and may expose us to losses. 
 We maintain relationships with a number of ISOs, which generally act as intermediaries for third party companies that want to develop the capacity to accept payment cards. ISO activities include, among other things, acquiring and issuing functions, soliciting merchants and other clients, soliciting cardholders, underwriting and monitoring, arranging for terminal leases or purchases, account and transaction processing, and client service. We face risks related to our oversight and supervision of the ISO program (including compliance, risk, and reputational monitoring), as well as to the reputation and financial viability of the ISOs with which we do business. Any failure by us to appropriately oversee and supervise our ISO program could damage our reputation, result in regulatory or compliance issues, result in third party litigation, and cause 
 20 

financial losses to us. Further, our ISO program is highly dependent upon the activities and financial viability of our ISO counter-parties, and any negative developments at the ISOs may present financial losses and other risk to us. 
 The costs and effects of litigation, investigations or similar matters involving us or other financial institutions or counterparties, or adverse facts and developments related thereto, could materially affect our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 We may be involved from time to time in a variety of litigation, investigations, inquiries, or similar matters arising out of our business, including those described in Part I - Item 3. Legal Proceedings and "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies" of this Report. Furthermore, litigation against banks tend to increase during economic downturns and periods of credit deterioration which may occur or worsen as a result of the present period of economic uncertainty. The industry's transition away from LIBOR may also increase our litigation risk. 
 We manage these risks through internal controls, personnel training, insurance, litigation management, our compliance and ethics processes, and other means. However, the commencement, outcome, and magnitude of litigation cannot be predicted or controlled with any certainty. We establish reserves for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the losses can be reasonably estimated. We may still incur legal costs for a matter even if we have not established a reserve. In addition, the actual cost of resolving a legal claim may be substantially higher than any amounts reserved for that matter. For those legal matters where the amounts associated with the claims are not probable and the costs cannot be reasonably estimated, Synovus estimates a range of reasonably possible losses. As of December 31, 2022, Synovus' management currently estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses resulting from our outstanding litigation, including, without limitation, the matters described in this Report, is from zero to 5 million in excess of the amounts accrued, if any, related to those matters. This estimated aggregate range is based upon information currently available to us, and the actual losses could prove to be higher. As there are further developments in these legal matters, we will reassess these matters and the estimated range of reasonably possible losses may change as a result of this assessment. In addition, in the future, we may need to record additional litigation reserves with respect to these matters. Further, regardless of how these matters proceed, it could significantly harm our reputation and divert our management's attention and other resources away from our business. 
 Our insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against it and indemnification rights to which we are entitled may not be honored, and any claims asserted against us, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm our reputation. Should the ultimate judgments or settlements in any litigation or investigation significantly exceed our insurance coverage, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, premiums for insurance covering the financial and banking sectors are rising. We may not be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future, nor may we be able to obtain adequate replacement policies with acceptable terms or at historic rates, if at all. 
 Credit and Liquidity Risk 
 Changes in interest rates may have an adverse effect on our net interest income. 
 Net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income that we earn on interest-earning assets and the interest expense that we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, is a major component of our income and our primary source of revenue from our operations. Narrowing of interest rate spreads could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition. We cannot control or predict with certainty changes in interest rates. Regional and local economic conditions, competitive pressures, and the policies of regulatory authorities, including monetary policies of the FRB, affect interest income and interest expense. 
 Beginning in early 2022, in response to growing signs of inflation, the FRB increased interest rates rapidly and made a number of adjustments to monetary policy and liquidity, including quantitative tightening and other balance sheet actions. Further, the FRB has increased the benchmark rapidly and has announced an intention to take further actions to mitigate rising inflationary pressures. Rising interest rates can have a negative impact on our business by reducing the amount of money our clients borrow or by adversely affecting their ability to repay outstanding loan balances that may increase due to adjustments in their variable rates. In addition, as interest rates rise, we may have to offer more attractive interest rates to depositors to compete for deposits, or pursue other sources of liquidity, such as wholesale funds. 
 On the other hand, decreasing interest rates reduce our yield on our variable rate loans and on our new loans, which reduces our net interest income. In addition, lower interest rates may reduce our realized yields on investment securities which would reduce our net interest income and cause downward pressure on net interest margin in future periods. A significant reduction in our net interest income could have a material adverse impact on our capital, financial condition and results of operations. 
 While it is expected that the FRB will continue to increase the target federal funds rate in 2023 to combat recent inflationary trends, we are unable to predict changes in interest rates, which are affected by factors beyond our control, including inflation, deflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, and other changes in financial markets. 
 21 

We have ongoing policies and procedures designed to manage the risks associated with changes in market interest rates and actively manage these risks through hedging and other risk mitigation strategies. However, if our assumptions are wrong or overall economic conditions are significantly different than anticipated, our risk mitigation techniques may be ineffective or costly. 
 Changes in the cost and availability of funding due to changes in the deposit market and credit market may adversely affect our capital resources, liquidity, and financial results. 
 In managing our consolidated balance sheets, we depend on access to a variety of sources of funding to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs, and to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our clients. In addition to core deposits, sources of funding available to us, and upon which we rely as regular components of our liquidity and funding management strategy, include borrowings from the FHLB and brokered deposits. In general, the amount, type, and cost of our funding, including from other financial institutions, the capital markets, and deposits, directly impacts our costs of operating our business and growing our assets and can therefore positively or negatively affect our financial results. A number of factors could make funding more difficult, more expensive, or unavailable on any terms, including, but not limited to, a downgrade in our credit ratings, financial results, changes within our organization, specific events that adversely impact our reputation, disruptions in the capital markets, specific events that adversely impact the financial services industry, counterparty availability, changes affecting our assets, the corporate and regulatory structure, interest rate fluctuations, general economic conditions, and the legal, regulatory, accounting and tax environments governing our funding transactions. Also, we compete for funding with other banks and similar companies, many of which are substantially larger, and have more capital and other resources than we do. 
 In addition to bank level liquidity management, we must manage liquidity at the Parent Company for various needs including potential capital infusions into subsidiaries, the servicing of debt, the payment of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock, and share repurchases. The primary source of liquidity for us consists of dividends from Synovus Bank which are governed by certain rules and regulations of our supervising agencies. Synovus' ability to receive dividends from Synovus Bank in future periods will depend on a number of factors, including, without limitation, Synovus Bank's future profits, asset quality, liquidity, and overall condition. In addition, GA DBF rules and related statutes contain additional restrictions on payments of dividends by Synovus Bank. In particular, the Georgia Financial Institutions Code contains restrictions on the ability of a Georgia bank to pay dividends other than from retained earnings and under other circumstances without the approval of the GA DBF. As a result of these restrictions, Synovus Bank may be required to seek approval from the GA DBF to pay dividends. If Synovus does not receive dividends from Synovus Bank as needed, its liquidity could be adversely affected, and it may not be able to continue to execute its current capital plan to return capital to its shareholders. In addition to dividends from Synovus Bank, we have historically had access to a number of alternative sources of liquidity, including the capital markets, but there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain such liquidity on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. If our access to these traditional and alternative sources of liquidity is diminished or only available on unfavorable terms, then our overall liquidity and financial condition will be adversely affected. 
 If Synovus Bank loses or is unable to grow and retain its deposits, it may be subject to liquidity risk and higher funding costs. 
 The total amount that we pay for funding costs is dependent, in part, on Synovus Bank s ability to grow and retain its deposits. If Synovus Bank is unable to sufficiently grow and retain its deposits at competitive rates to meet liquidity needs, it may be subject to paying higher funding costs to meet these liquidity needs. 
 Synovus Bank competes with banks and other financial services companies for deposits. As a result of monetary policy and the broader market for interest rates and funding, we expect that we may be required to raise rates on our deposits to keep pace with our competition. As a result, we expect that Synovus Bank s funding costs may increase in the near term. Furthermore, if Synovus Bank were to lose deposits, it must rely on more expensive sources of funding. This could result in a failure to maintain adequate liquidity and higher funding costs, reducing our net interest margin and net interest income. In addition, our access to deposits may be affected by the liquidity needs of our depositors. In particular, a substantial majority of our liabilities in 2022 were checking accounts and other liquid deposits, which are payable on demand or upon several days' notice, while by comparison, a substantial majority of our assets were loans, which cannot be called or sold in the same time frame. Moreover, our clients could withdraw their deposits in favor of alternative investments. While we have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances as necessary, we may not be able to replace such funds in the future, especially if a large number of our depositors seek to withdraw their accounts, regardless of the reason. 
 Our allowance for credit losses may not cover actual losses, and we may be required to materially increase our allowance, which may adversely affect our capital, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We derive the most significant portion of our revenue from our lending activities. When we lend money, commit to lend money, or enter into a letter of credit or other contract with a counterparty, we incur credit risk, which is the risk of losses if our borrowers do not repay their loans or our counterparties fail to perform according to the terms of their contracts. We estimate 
 22 

and maintain an allowance for credit losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, representing management's best estimate of life of loan credit losses within the existing portfolio of loans and related unfunded commitments, as described under "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and "Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies - Allowance for Credit Losses" in this Report. The allowance, in the judgment of management, is established to reserve for estimated credit losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires the use of both qualitative and quantitative information, including estimates, assumptions, and quantitative modeling techniques, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans, changes in assumptions regarding a borrower's ability to pay, changes in collateral values, and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may cause the allowance for credit losses to become inadequate and require an increase in the provision for loan losses. 
 We expect that the allowance for credit losses under the CECL standard to be more volatile and as such could have an impact on our results of operations. For a discussion of changes in accounting standards and regulatory capital implications, see Part I - Item 1. Business - Supervision, Regulation, and Other Factors - Capital Requirements. 
 Various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination procedures, periodically review the allowance as well as the supporting methods and processes. Based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination, such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance or additional loan charge offs. An increase in the allowance for credit losses would result in a decrease in net income and capital, and could have a material adverse effect on our capital, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Changes in our asset quality could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Asset quality measures the performance of a borrower in repaying a loan, with interest, on time. While we believe that we manage asset quality through prudent underwriting practices and collection operations, it is possible that our asset quality could deteriorate, depending upon economic conditions and other factors. Our asset quality generally remains strong, but further economic disruption could negatively impact asset quality in future periods, particularly as to those borrowers in certain adversely and disproportionately impacted industries. 
 We could realize losses if we determine to sell non-performing assets and the proceeds we receive are lower than the carrying value of such assets. 
 Distressed asset sales have been a component of our strategy to further strengthen the consolidated balance sheets, improve asset quality, and enhance earnings. We could realize future losses if the proceeds we receive upon dispositions of non-performing assets are lower than the recorded carrying value of such assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations in future periods. Accordingly, we could realize an increased level of credit costs in any period during which we determine to dispose of an increased level of distressed assets. Further, if market conditions deteriorate, this could negatively impact our ability to dispose of distressed assets and may result in higher credit losses on sales of distressed assets. 
 We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our debt and repay maturing debt obligations. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we and our consolidated subsidiaries had 4.11 billion of long-term debt outstanding. Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest or to satisfy our obligations in respect of our debt, to refinance our debt, or to fund capital expenditures will depend on our future financial and operating performance and our ability to maintain adequate liquidity. Prevailing economic conditions (including interest rates), and regulatory constraints, including, among other things, distributions to us from our subsidiaries and required capital levels with respect to our subsidiary bank and financial subsidiaries, business, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, may also affect our ability to meet these needs. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or obtain future borrowings in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt, or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on maturity, and we may not be able to refinance any of our debt when needed on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments in our business, sell assets, seek to obtain additional equity or debt financing, or restructure our debt on terms that may not be favorable to us. 
 We may be unable to pay dividends on our common stock and preferred stock . 
 Holders of our common stock and preferred stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Although we have historically paid a quarterly cash dividend to the holders of our common stock and preferred stock, we are not legally required to do so. Further, the Federal Reserve could decide at any time that paying any dividends on our common stock or preferred stock could be an unsafe or unsound banking practice. The reduction or elimination of dividends paid on our common stock or preferred stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock or preferred stock, as applicable. In addition, if we fail to pay dividends on our preferred 
 23 

stock for six quarters, whether or not consecutive, the holders of such preferred stock shall be entitled to certain rights to elect two directors to our Board of Directors. 
 For a discussion of current regulatory limits on our ability to pay dividends, see "Part I - Item 1. Business - Supervision, Regulation, and Other Factors - Payment of Dividends" and Part I - Item 1A - Risk Factors - Compliance and Regulatory Risk - We may become subject to supervisory actions and enhanced regulation that could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating flexibility, financial condition, and the value of our common stock and preferred stock in this Report for further information. 
 Compliance and Regulatory Risk 
 The fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings. 
 The Federal Reserve Board regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S. Its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments, both of which affect our net interest margin. They can also materially decrease the value of financial assets we hold. Federal Reserve policies may also adversely affect borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans, or could adversely create asset bubbles which result from prolonged periods of accommodative policy. This, in turn, may result in volatile markets and rapidly declining collateral values. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve and other governmental policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. Because of changing conditions in the national and international economies and in the money markets, as well as the result of actions by monetary and fiscal authorities, all of which are beyond our control, it is not possible to predict with certainty future changes in interest rates, deposit levels, loan demand, or the business and results of operations of Synovus and Synovus Bank, or whether changing economic conditions will have a positive or negative effect on operations and earnings. Also, potential new taxes or increased taxes on corporations generally, or on financial institutions specifically, could adversely affect our net income. 
 The banking industry is highly regulated, and the regulatory framework, together with any future legislative or regulatory changes, may have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
 The banking industry is extensively regulated and supervised under both federal and state laws and regulations that are intended primarily for the protection of depositors, clients, federal deposit insurance funds, and the banking system as a whole, not for the protection of our shareholders and creditors. We and Synovus Bank are subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve, the GA DBF, and the CFPB, among others. The laws and regulations applicable to us govern a variety of matters, including permissible types, amounts, and terms of loans and investments we may make, the maximum interest rate that may be charged, the amount of reserves Synovus Bank must hold against deposits it takes, the types of deposits Synovus Bank may accept and the rates it may pay on such deposits, maintenance of adequate capital and liquidity, changes in the control of the company and Synovus Bank, restrictions on dividends, and establishment of new offices by Synovus Bank. We incur significant, recurring costs to comply with all applicable regulations and there is no guarantee that our compliance programs will ensure compliance with all applicable regulations. We must obtain approval from our regulators before engaging in certain activities, and there can be no assurance that any regulatory approvals we may require will be obtained, either in a timely manner or at all. In addition, new technologies could make regulatory compliance more challenging. Remaining compliant and receiving regulatory approvals is dependent on our ability to improve and develop our technological capabilities. Our regulators also have the ability to compel us to, or restrict us from, taking certain actions entirely, such as actions that our regulators deem to constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. Our failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, or regulatory policies and interpretations of such laws and regulations, could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties, or damage to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
 We cannot predict whether new legislation will be enacted and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any regulations, would have on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. These changes may result in increased costs of doing business and decreased revenue and net income, may reduce our ability to effectively compete to attract and retain clients, or make it less attractive for us to continue providing certain products and services. In particular, we expect that the Biden administration will continue to seek to implement a reform agenda. We also expect regulatory bodies such as the CFPB and FDIC to take a more aggressive enforcement stance and increase their focus and scrutiny on all consumer facing financial institutions. Any future changes in federal and state law and regulations, as well as the interpretations and implementations of such laws and regulations and enforcement practices, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including those listed above, impact the regulatory structure under which we operate, significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes, require us to increase our regulatory capital and modify our business strategy, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner, or other ways that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
 24 

We may become subject to supervisory actions and enhanced regulation that could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating flexibility, financial condition, and the value of our common stock and preferred stock. 
 Under federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to the safety and soundness of insured depository institutions, state banking regulators, the Federal Reserve, and separately the FDIC as the insurer of bank deposits, each has the authority to compel or restrict certain actions on our part if any of them determine that we have insufficient capital or are otherwise operating in a manner that may be deemed to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices. In addition to examinations for safety and soundness, we and our subsidiaries also are subject to continuous examination by state and federal banking regulators, including the CFPB, for compliance with various laws and regulations, as well as consumer compliance initiatives. As a result of this regulatory oversight and examination process, our regulators may require us to enter into informal or formal supervisory agreements, including board resolutions, memoranda of understanding, written agreements, and consent or cease and desist orders, pursuant to which we could be required to take identified corrective actions to address cited concerns, or to refrain from taking certain actions. 
 If we become subject to and are unable to comply with the terms of any future regulatory actions or directives, supervisory agreements, or orders, then we could become subject to additional, heightened supervisory actions and orders, possibly including consent orders, prompt corrective action restrictions, and/or other regulatory actions, including prohibitions on the payment of dividends on our common stock and our preferred stock. If our regulators were to take such additional supervisory actions, then we could, among other things, become subject to significant restrictions on our ability to develop any new business, as well as restrictions on our existing business, and we could be required to raise additional capital, discontinue our share repurchase program, dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period of time, or all of the above. The terms of any such supervisory action could have a material negative effect on our business, reputation, operating flexibility, financial condition, and the value of our common stock. 
 We may be required to conserve capital or undertake additional strategic initiatives to improve our capital position due to changes in economic conditions or changes in regulatory capital rules. 
 We and Synovus Bank are required under federal law to maintain certain minimum capital levels based on ratios of capital to total assets and capital to risk-weighted assets. The required capital ratios are minimums, and the Federal Reserve may determine that a banking organization, based on its size, complexity, or risk profile, must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner. Moreover, federal bank regulators have issued a series of guidance and rulemakings applicable to large banks. While many of these do not currently apply to us due to our asset size, these issuances could impact industry capital standards and practices in many potentially unforeseeable ways. While we currently exceed all minimum regulatory capital requirements, are considered well-capitalized under applicable rules, and believe that we maintain an appropriate capital plan, there is no guarantee that we will not need to increase our capital levels in the future. 
 We actively monitor economic conditions, evolving industry capital standards, and changes in regulatory standards and requirements, and engage in regular discussions with our regulators regarding capital at both Synovus and Synovus Bank. As part of our ongoing management of capital, we identify, consider, and pursue additional strategic initiatives to bolster our capital position as deemed necessary, including strategies that may be required to meet regulatory capital requirements. This includes the evaluation of share repurchase programs and dividends. The need to maintain more capital and greater liquidity than may have previously been warranted or intended could limit our business activities, including lending, and our ability to expand, either organically or through future acquisitions, and invest in technology and other growth strategies. It could also result in our taking steps to increase our capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit our ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders. 
 Market and Other General Risk 
 Inflationary pressures and rising prices could negatively impact our business, our profitability, and our stock price. 
 Inflation rose significantly during 2022 to levels not seen for over 40 years. Inflationary pressures are currently expected to continue into 2023. Prolonged periods of rising inflation may impact our profitability by negatively impacting our fixed costs and expenses, including increasing funding costs and expense related to talent acquisition and retention, and negatively impacting the demand for our products and services. Additionally, rising inflation may lead to a decrease in consumer and client purchasing power and negatively affect the need or demand for our products and services. If significant inflation continues, our business could be negatively affected by, among other things, increased default rates leading to credit losses which could decrease our appetite for new credit extensions. These rising inflationary pressures could result in missed earnings and budgetary projections causing our stock price to suffer. 
 Unstable global economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business, financial condition, and operations. 
 We are operating in an uncertain economic environment. The global credit and financial markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruptions, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, 
 25 

declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates, high rates of inflation, and uncertainty about economic stability and a potential recession. The U.S. government's decisions regarding its debt ceiling and the possibility that the U.S. could default on its debt obligations may cause further interest rate increases, disrupt access to capital markets, and deepen recessionary conditions. While our management team continually monitors market conditions and economic factors, throughout our footprint, we are unable to predict the duration or severity of such conditions or factors. If conditions were to worsen nationally, regionally, or locally, then we could see a sharp increase in our total net charge-offs and also be required to significantly increase our allowance for credit losses. Furthermore, the demand for loans and our other products and services could decline. An increase in our non-performing assets and related increases in our provision for loan losses, coupled with a potential decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services, could negatively affect our business and could have a material adverse effect on our capital, financial condition, results of operations, and future growth. Our clients may also be adversely impacted by changes in regulatory, trade (including tariffs), and tax policies and laws, all of which could reduce demand for loans and adversely impact our borrowers' ability to repay our loans. 
 In addition, the financial markets and the global economy may also be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of military conflict, including the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which is increasing volatility in commodity and energy prices, creating supply chain issues and causing instability in financial markets. Sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other countries in response to such conflict could further adversely impact the financial markets and the instability. The specific consequences of the conflict in Ukraine on our business is difficult to predict at this time, but in addition to inflationary pressures affecting our operations and those of our clients and borrowers, we may also experience an increase in cyberattacks against us, our clients and borrowers, service providers, and other third parties. 
 There can be no assurance that further deterioration in markets and confidence in economic conditions will not occur. Our general business strategy may be adversely affected by any such economic downturn or recession, volatile business environment, hostile third-party action, or continued unpredictable and unstable market conditions. The effects of any economic downturn or recession could continue for many years after the downturn or recession is considered to have ended. 
 The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and could continue to adversely impact, Synovus business, financial condition, liquidity, capital, and results of operations. 
 While the level of disruption caused by, and the economic impact of, the COVID-19 pandemic lessened in 2022, there is no assurance that the pandemic will not worsen again, included as a result of the emergence of new strains of the virus, or another health related emergency will not emerge. Any worsening of the pandemic, a new health related emergency, and their effects on the economy could further impact our business, our provision and allowance for credit losses, and the value of certain assets that we carry on our balance sheet such as goodwill. Our clients, business partners, and third-party providers, including those who perform critical services for our business, may also be adversely affected. 
 ESG risks could adversely affect our reputation and shareholder, employee, client, and third party relationships and may negatively affect our stock price. 
 Our business faces increasing public scrutiny related to ESG activities. We risk damage to our brand and reputation if we fail to act responsibly in a number of areas, such as DEI, environmental stewardship, including with respect to climate change, human capital management, support for our local communities, corporate governance, and transparency, or fail to consider ESG factors in our business operations. 
 Furthermore, as a result of our diverse base of clients and business partners, we may face potential negative publicity based on the identity of our clients or business partners and the public s (or certain segments of the public s) view of those entities. Such publicity may arise from traditional media sources or from social media and may increase rapidly in size and scope. If our client or business partner relationships were to become intertwined in such negative publicity, our ability to attract and retain clients, business partners, and employees may be negatively impacted, and our stock price may also be negatively impacted. Additionally, we may face pressure to not do business in certain industries that are viewed as harmful to the environment or are otherwise negatively perceived, which could impact our growth. 
 Additionally, investors and shareholder advocates are placing ever increasing emphasis on how corporations address ESG issues in their business strategy when making investment decisions and when developing their investment theses and proxy recommendations. We may incur meaningful costs with respect to our ESG efforts and if such efforts are negatively perceived, our reputation and stock price may suffer. 
 Climate change could adversely affect our business, affect client activity levels, and damage our reputation. 
 Concerns over the long-term impacts of climate change have led and will to lead to governmental efforts around the world to mitigate those impacts. Consumers and businesses are also changing their behavior and business preferences as a result of these concerns. New governmental regulations or guidance relating to climate change, as well as changes in consumers' and businesses' behaviors and business preferences, may affect whether and on what terms and conditions we will engage in certain activities or offer certain products or services. The governmental and supervisory focus on climate change could also result in 
 26 

our becoming subject to new or heightened regulatory requirements, such as requirements relating to operational resiliency or stress testing for various climate stress scenarios. Any such new or heightened requirements could result in increased regulatory, compliance or other costs, or higher capital requirements. In connection with the transition to a low carbon economy, legislative or public policy changes, and changes in consumer sentiment could negatively impact the businesses and financial condition of our clients, which may decrease revenues from those clients and increase the credit risk associated with loans and other credit exposures to those clients. Our business, reputation, and ability to attract and retain employees may also be harmed if our response to climate change is perceived to be ineffective or insufficient. 
 Furthermore, the long-term impacts of climate change may have a negative impact on our clients and their business. Physical risks include extreme storms that damage or destroy property and inventory securing loans we make, or may interrupt our clients' business operations, putting them in financial difficulty, and increasing the risk of default. Our clients are also facing changes in energy and commodity prices driven by climate change, as well as new regulatory requirements resulting in increased operational costs. 
 As climate risk is interconnected with all key risk types, we continue to embed climate risk considerations into our risk management strategies. Due to the level of uncertainty around climate change, our risk management strategies may not be effective in fully mitigating climate risk exposure. 
 Interest rates on our outstanding financial instruments might be subject to change based on developments related to LIBOR, which could adversely affect our revenue, expense, and the value of our financial instruments. 
 On July 27, 2017, the FCA, which regulates LIBOR, publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. On November 30, 2020, a joint announcement by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the OCC was released and included a statement that the administrator of LIBOR has announced it will consult on its intention to cease the publication of the one week and two month USD LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on December 31, 2021, and the remaining USD LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publications on June 30, 2023. In the U.S., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee has proposed SOFR as the preferred alternative to LIBOR. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash in the overnight U.S. Treasury repurchase market. At this time, various iterations of the SOFR index are being used within the market, as are other indices such as the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield index and the American Financial Exchange's Ameribor index. It is unclear as to the degree to which the market will adopt such non-LIBOR indices or how the industry may transition various products to an accepted alternative to LIBOR. The FRB rules implementing the LIBOR Act, adopted December 16, 2022, will replace LIBOR with benchmark rates based on SOFR in certain financial contracts after June 30, 2023, including U.S. contracts that do not mature before LIBOR ends and that lack adequate "fallback" provisions that would replace LIBOR with a practicable replacement benchmark rate. 
 The transition from LIBOR to another benchmark rate or rates is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In particular, any such transition could: 
 adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on, and the revenue and expense associated with, and the value of Synovus floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives, and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, or other securities or financial arrangements given LIBOR s role in determining market interest rates globally; 
 prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of our preparation and readiness for the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate; 
 result in disputes, litigation, or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language, or the absence of such language, in LIBOR-based instruments, including securities, derivatives, and loans; 
 result in client uncertainty and disputes around how variable rates should be calculated in light of the foregoing, thereby damaging our reputation and resulting in a loss of clients and additional costs to us; and 
 require the transition to or development of appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition Synovus risk management processes from LIBOR-based products to those based on an applicable alternative pricing benchmark. 
 The manner and impact of this transition, as well as the effect of these developments on Synovus funding costs, loan, and investment and trading securities portfolios, asset liability management, and business are uncertain. 
 Our concentrated operations in the Southeastern U.S. make us vulnerable to local economic conditions, local weather catastrophes, public health issues, and other external events, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Our operations are concentrated in the Southeastern U.S. in the states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee. As a result, local economic conditions significantly affect the demand for loans and other products we offer to our clients (including real estate, commercial, and construction loans), the ability of borrowers to repay these loans, and the value of 
 27 

the collateral securing these loans. Economic downturns in these regions could adversely affect our currently performing loans, leading to future delinquencies or defaults and increases in our provision for credit losses. 
 In addition, the occurrence of events such as hurricanes, tropical storms, tornados, winter storms, flooding, and other large-scale weather catastrophes in and along the Gulf and the Atlantic coasts, as well as other parts of the Southeastern U.S., and further public health issues, such as pandemics or other widespread health emergencies, could adversely affect the condition of collateral associated with our loan portfolio, our general financial condition, or the results of our operations. Such areas could be adversely impacted by such events in those regions, the nature and severity of which are difficult to predict. Furthermore, climate change could increase the frequency and severity of these risks. These and other unpredictable external events could have an adverse effect on us in that such events could materially disrupt our operations or the ability or willingness of its clients to access the financial services offered by Synovus. These events could reduce our earnings and cause volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and/or results of operations.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Report. 
 
 Economic Environment and Recent Events 
 The 2022 U.S. economy has been substantially impacted by high inflation that began in the middle of 2021. As a result, the Federal Reserve aggressively tightened monetary policy with the FOMC raising market interest rates 425 bps during 2022, and rates have since increased in early 2023 primarily due to persistent inflation that remains the largest headwind to the U.S. economy. The extent of interest rate increases and the period of time that higher rates will remain in effect depends greatly on the level of inflation and strength of the labor market. 
 Economic uncertainty and market disruptions outside of inflation remain, including geopolitical tensions primarily from Russia s prolonged war in Ukraine, the relationship between the U.S. and China, and to a lesser extent, the lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global supply chains, tourism, business travel, immigration, and labor participation. However, these geopolitical uncertainties have served to strengthen the value of the U.S. dollar as global investors flock to higher quality U.S. assets. 
 U.S. fiscal policy has been expansionary since 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but government support is declining, while leaving a significant federal deficit and a looming Congressional debt ceiling debate in 2023. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law in August 2022, which raises federal revenue by imposing an alternative corporate minimum tax if certain thresholds are met and a non-deductible excise tax on corporate share repurchases, while increasing federal spending to address climate change and reduce prescription drug and healthcare costs for lower-income households and seniors. While the IRA does not have a significant immediate impact on Synovus, it represents a shift from expansionary towards contractionary federal fiscal policy. 
 Despite certain economic headwinds discussed above, with an asset-sensitive balance sheet and our position in Southeast U.S. markets, Synovus believes it is well-positioned to execute on our 2023 outlook outlined below by focusing on productivity gains within our core businesses, continuing to benefit from contributions generated through our new growth initiatives and key talent additions, while maintaining a cautious and resilient risk profile through capital management, deposit generation across all business lines, and overall credit vigilance. 
 Overview of 2022 Financial Results 
 Net income available to common shareholders for 2022 was 724.7 million, or 4.95 per diluted common share, compared to 727.3 million, or 4.90 per diluted common share, in 2021. The year-over-year comparison was impacted by the rising rate environment, as the target Fed Funds rate increased 425 bps in 2022. Strong loan growth in 2022 contributed to a provision for credit losses of 84.6 million compared to provision reversals of 106.3 million in 2021, as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic began to subside, and increased economic uncertainty related to inflationary concerns and geopolitical tensions increased. 
 Net interest income for 2022 was 1.80 billion, up 264.0 million, or 17 , from 1.53 billion in 2021, including 12.6 million in PPP fees during 2022 and 79.2 million in 2021. The net interest margin was 3.34 for 2022, an increase of 33 bps from 3.01 in 2021, aided by higher loan yields from increased market interest rates partially offset by higher deposit and wholesale funding costs. 
 Non-interest revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 409.3 million, down 40.7 million, or 9 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 due primarily to industry-wide lower mortgage banking income and a decline in other non-interest revenue resulting from valuation adjustments on equity method investments partially offset by strong growth in core banking fees (1) and higher wealth revenue (2) . 
 Non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 1.16 billion, an increase of 57.6 million, or 5 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in non-interest expense during 2022 primarily resulted from elevated performance incentives, merit and inflationary wage increases, headcount additions, resumption of normal business activities post-COVID-19, investments in new business initiatives and technology and operations infrastructure spend. 
 At December 31, 2022, total loans, net of deferred fees and costs of 43.72 billion, increased 4.40 billion, or 11 , from December 31, 2021. Growth was primarily in C I and CRE loans, driven by strong commercial production, increased line utilization as well as lower levels of pay-off activity. 
 31 

At December 31, 2022, credit quality metrics remained stable and at or near historical lows with NPA and NPL ratios of 0.33 and 0.29 , respectively, and total past dues of 0.15 , as a percentage of total loans. Net charge-offs for 2022 remained low at 0.13 of average loans, compared to 0.20 in 2021. The ACL at December 31, 2022 totaled 500.9 million, an increase of 31.4 million compared to December 31, 2021, resulting primarily from loan growth and an increase in unfunded commitments, mostly offset by decreased specific reserves and continued positive trends in our credit performance. The ACL to loans coverage ratio was 1.15 at December 31, 2022, a 4 bps decline from December 31, 2021. 
 Total period-end deposits were 48.87 billion at December 31, 2022, down 555.7 million, compared to year-end 2021, impacted by rate-driven outflows and normal client liquidity deployment. O verall deposit costs for 2022 were 38 bps, up 22 bps, compared to 16 bps for 2021, and were impacted by the FOMC's rate hikes in 2022, but also benefited from prudent pricing strategy and an extended lag on deposit pricing. 
 Our CET1 ratio of 9.63 at December 31, 2022 is well in excess of regulatory requirements and increased 13 bps compared to December 31, 2021, as over 70 of organic earnings for 2022 were retained to support core client growth while also returning approximately 30 to our shareholders through our common dividend. The Board recently approved a capital plan that includes a 0.04 increase in the quarterly common stock dividend to 0.38 per share , beginning with the quarterly dividend payable in April 2023, and authorized share repurchases of up to 300 million in 2023. Our capital priorities are focused on supporting core client growth and managing the CET1 ratio within our target operating range of 9.25 to 9.75 .

Critical Accounting Policies 
 The accounting and financial reporting policies of Synovus are in accordance with GAAP and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. Synovus has identified certain of its accounting policies as critical accounting policies, consisting of those related to the accounting for the allowance for credit losses and income taxes. In determining which accounting policies are critical in nature, Synovus has identified the policies that require significant judgment or involve complex estimates. It is management's practice to discuss critical accounting policies with the Board of Directors' Audit Committee on a periodic basis, including the development, selection, implementation, and disclosure of the critical accounting policies. The application of these policies has a significant impact on Synovus consolidated financial statements. Synovus financial results could differ significantly if different judgments or estimates are applied in the application of these policies. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 The ACL is a critical accounting estimate that requires significant judgments and assumptions, which are inherently subjective. The use of different estimates or assumptions could have a significant impact on the provision for credit losses, ACL, financial condition, and results of operations. The economic and business climate in any given industry or market is difficult to gauge and can change rapidly, and the effects of those changes can vary by borrower. 
 In accordance with CECL, the ACL, which includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments, represents management's best estimate of expected losses over the life of loans adjusted for prepayments, and over the life of loan commitments expected to fund. Synovus' loans and unfunded loan commitments are grouped based upon the nature of the loan type and the forecasted PD, adjusted for relevant forecasted macroeconomic factors comprising multiple weighted scenarios representing different plausible outcomes, and LGD, to determine the allowance for the majority of our portfolio. Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loan, adjusted for expected prepayments and curtailments when appropriate. To the extent the lives of the loans in the portfolio extend beyond the period for which a reasonable and supportable forecast can be made (which is two years for Synovus), the Company reverts, on a straight-line basis back to the historical rates over a one-year period. Life-of-loan loss percentages may also be adjusted, as necessary, for certain quantitative and qualitative factors that in management's judgment are necessary to reflect losses expected in the portfolio. These adjustments address inherent limitations in the quantitative model. Loans that do not share risk characteristics are individually evaluated on a loan-by-loan basis with specific reserves, if any, recorded as appropriate. Given the dynamic relationship between macroeconomic variables within an economic forecast, it is difficult to estimate the impact of a change in any one individual variable on the ACL. As a result, when formulating the quantitative estimate management uses a probability-weighted approach that incorporates a baseline forecast, an upside scenario reflecting an accelerated recovery, a downside scenario that reflects adverse economic conditions, and a scenario that assumes consistent slow growth that is less optimistic than the baseline. 
 To illustrate a hypothetical sensitivity analysis, management calculated a quantitative allowance using only the downside scenario. This downside scenario includes a severe deterioration in economic conditions compared to our baseline forecast. The downside forecast assumes a recession starting in the first quarter of 2023, as well as worsening inflation pressures which cause the Fed to raise interest rates higher than currently expected. Our quantitative CECL model is most sensitive to the unemployment rate, which peaks near 8 in the downside scenario, compared to the multi-scenario forecast s weighted average peak of around 5 . Excluding the impact of qualitative considerations, using only the downside forecast scenario would result in a hypothetical increase over our reported ACL of approximately 296 million at December 31, 2022. 
 The sensitivity analysis result does not represent management s view of expected credit losses nor is it intended to estimate future changes in allowance levels for reasons including, but not limited to, the following: 
 management uses a weighted approach applied to multiple economic scenarios for its allowance estimation process; 
 the impact of changes in economic variables are interrelated and nonlinear; therefore, the results of the analysis cannot be extrapolated to additional changes in economic variables; 
 subsequent changes in the mix of portfolio characteristics could materially impact results; 
 potential future government or regulatory intervention could cause results to differ materially from historical relationships between the economic variables and related credit metrics; and 
 the sensitivity analysis does not account for any quantitative or qualitative adjustments incorporated by management as part of its overall allowance framework to reflect losses expected in the portfolio. 
 See "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 3 - Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses" in this Report for additional details.

Income Taxes 
 The calculation of Synovus income tax provision is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments in its determination. As part of Synovus overall business strategy, management must consider tax laws and regulations that apply to the specific facts and circumstances under consideration. As such, the Company is often required to exercise significant judgment regarding the interpretation of these tax laws and regulations, in which Synovus' anticipated and actual liability could significantly vary based upon the taxing authority s interpretation. Specifically, significant estimates in accounting for income taxes relate to the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, estimates of the realizability of deferred tax assets, including income tax credits and NOLs, and the need for a valuation allowance, the calculation of taxable income, the estimation of uncertain tax positions and the determination of temporary differences between book and tax bases. Adjustments to these items may occur due to modifications in tax rates, newly enacted laws, issuance of tax regulations, resolution of items with taxing authorities, alterations to interpretative statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance that affects the Company s tax positions, changes in the Company's tax accounting methods or elections, or other facts and circumstances. Management closely monitors tax developments and the potential timing of these changes in order to evaluate the effect they may have on the Company s overall tax position and the estimates and judgments used in determining the income tax provision and records adjustments as necessary. See "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 16 - Income Taxes" in this Report for additional details. 
 
 DISCUSSION OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Investment Securities Available for Sale 
 The investment securities portfolio consists primarily of high-quality liquid debt securities classified as available for sale. The on-going investment philosophy for the securities portfolio focuses on maintaining a readily accessible source of liquidity while also supporting the income and interest rate risk management objectives of the Company. See "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2 - Investment Securities Available for Sale" in this Report for additional information. 
 The average balance of investment securities available for sale increased to 11.21 billion in 2022 from 9.60 billion in 2021, representing 20.7 and 18.8 , respectively, of average interest earning assets. The portfolio earned a taxable-equivalent yield of 1.87 and 1.46 for 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the estimated fair value of investment securities available for sale as a percentage of their amortized cost was 85.8 and 99.3 , respectively, with net unrealized losses increasing to 1.60 billion from 73.2 million, respectively, due to increases in market interest rates. The investment securities portfolio had a weighted average duration of 5.3 years at December 31, 2022, compared to 3.7 years at December 31, 2021. 
 35 

The calculation of weighted average yields for investment securities available for sale displayed below is based on the amortized cost with effective yields also based upon contractual cash flows. Maturity information is presented based upon contractual maturity which may differ from actual maturity dates as issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

 At December 31, 2022, total loans, net of deferred fees and costs, of 43.72 billion, increased 4.40 billion, or 11 , from December 31, 2021. This included a 384.9 million decline in PPP loans, primarily from forgiveness, and growth primarily in C I and CRE loans, driven by strong commercial production, increased line utilization as well as lower levels of pay-off activity. We expect loan growth in 2023 of 5 to 9 . 
 C I loans remain the largest component of our loan portfolio, representing 50.5 of total loans, while CRE and consumer loans represent 28.9 and 20.6 , respectively. Our portfolio composition is guided by our strategic growth plan, in conjunction with a comprehensive concentration management policy which sets limits for C I, CRE, and consumer loan levels as well as sub-categories therein.

U.S. Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) 
 Synovus participated in the PPP, which is a loan program that originated from the CARES Act. The total balance of all PPP loans, net of unearned fees and costs, was 14.7 million as of December 31, 2022, compared to 399.6 million as of December 31, 2021. The decline of 384.9 million, or 96 , from 2021 was largely due to 378 million in forgiveness. The table below provides additional information on PPP loans.

 Commercial Loans 
 Total commercial loans (which are comprised of C I and CRE loans) at December 31, 2022 were 34.72 billion, or 79.4 , of the total loan portfolio, compared to 30.64 billion, or 77.9 at December 31, 2021. 
 Commercial and Industrial Loans 
 The C I loan portfolio represents the largest category of Synovus' loan portfolio and is primarily comprised of general middle market and commercial banking clients across a diverse set of industries. The following table shows the composition of the C I loan portfolio aggregated by NAICS industry name and code. In accordance with Synovus' lending policy, each loan undergoes a detailed underwriting process which incorporates uniform underwriting standards and oversight in proportion to the size and complexity of the lending relationship. As of December 31, 2022, 94.4 (94.5 excluding PPP loans) of Synovus' C I loans are secured by real estate, business equipment, inventory, and other types of collateral compared to 92.2 (94.1 excluding PPP loans) as of December 31, 2021. C I loans grew 2.44 billion, or 12 , from December 31, 2021, as diverse growth from many of our Wholesale Banking sub-businesses and a slow down in pay-off activity were only slightly offset by a decline in PPP loans primarily due to forgiveness. The growth largely consisted of funded loan production and increased line utilization particularly in the finance and insurance, health care and social assistance, real estate and rental and leasing, manufacturing, and accommodation and food services industries.

 At December 31, 2022, 13.87 billion of C I loans, or 31.8 of the total loan portfolio (including PPP loans of 14.7 million net of unearned fees and costs), represented loans for the purpose of financing commercial, financial, and agricultural business activities. The primary source of repayment on these loans is revenue generated from products or services offered by the business or organization. The secondary source of repayment is the collateral, which consists primarily of equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, time deposits, cash surrender value of life insurance, and other business assets. 
 At December 31, 2022, 8.19 billion of C I loans, or 18.7 of the total loan portfolio, represented loans originated for the purpose of financing owner-occupied properties. The financing of owner-occupied facilities is considered a C I loan even though there is improved real estate as collateral. This treatment is a result of the credit decision process, which focuses on cash flow from operations of the business to repay the debt. The secondary source of repayment on these loans is the underlying real estate. These loans are predominately secured by owner-occupied and other real estate, and to a lesser extent, other types of collateral. 
 Commercial Real Estate Loans 
 CRE loans primarily consist of income-producing investment properties loans. Additionally, CRE loans include 1-4 family properties loans as well as land and development loans. Total CRE loans of 12.65 billion increased 1.64 billion, or 15 , from December 31, 2021 primarily due to growth from funded loan production and construction line utilization, primarily in the multi-family and medical office sectors, as well as a deceleration in pay-off activity. 
 Investment Properties Loans 
 Investment properties loans consist of construction and mortgage loans for income-producing properties and are primarily made to finance multi-family properties, office buildings, hotels, shopping centers, warehouses and other commercial development properties. Total investment properties loans as of December 31, 2022 were 11.64 billion, or 92.0 of the CRE loan portfolio, and 26.6 of the total loan portfolio, up 1.74 billion, or 18 , compared to 9.90 billion, or 89.9 of the CRE loan portfolio, and 25.2 of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2021. All sub-categories experienced growth with the exception of shopping centers, which was down by 251.5 million, or 15 , from December 31, 2021.

 (1) Loan balance in each category expressed as a percentage of total investment properties loans. 
 1-4 Family Properties Loans 
 1-4 family properties loans include construction loans to home builders and commercial mortgage loans related to 1-4 family rental properties and are almost always secured by the underlying property being financed by such loans. These properties are primarily located in the markets served by Synovus. At December 31, 2022, 1-4 family properties loans totaled 616.9 million, or 4.9 of the CRE loan portfolio, and decreased 28.5 million from December 31, 2021. 
 Land and Development Loans 
 Land and development loans include commercial and residential development as well as land acquisition loans and are secured by land held for future development, typically in excess of one year. Properties securing these loans are substantially within markets served by Synovus, and loan terms generally include personal guarantees from the principals. Loans in this portfolio are underwritten based on the LTV of the collateral and the capacity of the guarantor(s). Land and development loans of 389.3 million at December 31, 2022 declined 77.5 million from December 31, 2021. 
 Consumer Loans 
 The consumer loan portfolio consists of a wide variety of loan products offered through Synovus' banking network including first and second residential mortgages, home equity, and consumer credit card loans, as well as both secured and unsecured loans from third-party lending. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, weighted average FICO scores within the residential real estate portfolio based on committed balances were 793 and 792 for home equity and 780 and 777 for consumer mortgages, respectively . 
 Consumer loans at December 31, 2022 increased 325.5 million, or 4 , compared to December 31, 2021. Home equity increased 395.6 million from December 31, 2021, largely due to increased demand for home equity products as property values have increased, and interest rates for home equity products have remained low relative to unsecured consumer financing products. Mortgage loans increased 145.4 million from December 31, 2021 despite lower production, largely due to slower prepayments and refinances as a result of substantial increases in mortgage rates. Other consumer loans decreased 215.0 million from December 31, 2021, as third-party lending payment activity more than offset purchases of 514.5 million.

The table below shows the maturities of loans, net of deferred fees and costs, as of December 31, 2022. Also provided are the amounts due after one year, classified according to the sensitivity in interest rates. Actual repayments of loans may differ from the contractual maturities reflected therein because borrowers have the right to prepay obligations with and without prepayment penalties. Additionally, the refinancing of such loans or the potential delinquency of such loans could create differences between the contractual maturities and the actual repayment of such loans.

Deposits 
 Deposits provide the most significant funding source for interest earning assets. The following table shows the composition of period-end deposits for 2022 and 2021. See Table 13 - Average Balances, Interest, and Yields/Rates in this Report for information on average deposits including average rates paid in 2022, 2021, and 2020.

 Tot al period-end deposits were 48.87 billion at December 31, 2022, down 555.7 million, or 1 , compared to year-end 2021, impacted by rate-driven outflows and normal client liquidity deployment. Core deposits decreased 3.02 billion , or 6 , compared to December 31, 2021 with declines in most categories, mostly offset by a 2.46 billion increase in brokered deposits. On an average basis, total deposits of 48.94 billion were up 1.33 billion, or 3 , compared to the prior year, driven primarily by growth in non-interest-bearing demand deposits as this meaningful component of our overall funding strategy has helped manage our total funding costs in the rising rate environment. O verall deposit costs for 2022 were 38 bps, up 22 bps, compared to 16 bps for 2021, and were impacted by the FOMC's rate hikes of 425 bps in 2022, but also benefited from prudent pricing strategy and an extended lag on deposit pricing. 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, 25.08 billion and 25.91 billion, respectively, of our deposit portfolio was uninsured. The uninsured amounts are estimated based on the methodologies and assumptions used for the Bank's regulatory reporting requirements. 
 The following table shows the portion of time deposits that are uninsured, by remaining time until maturity, at December 31, 2022.

Net Interest Income 
 The following table summarizes the components of net interest income for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, including the tax-equivalent adjustment that is required in making yields on tax-exempt loans and investment securities comparable to taxable loans and investment securities. The taxable-equivalent adjustment is based on a 21 federal income tax rate for the three years shown. 
 Table 12 - Net Interest Income Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2022 2021 2020 Interest income

 Net interest income (interest income less interest expense) is the largest component of total revenue, representing earnings from the primary business of gathering funds from client deposits and other sources, and investing those funds primarily in loans and fixed-income securities. Synovus long-term objective is to manage those assets and liabilities to maximize net interest income while balancing interest rate, credit, liquidity, and capital risks. 
 Net Interest Margin 
 Net interest margin is a measure of the spread between interest earning assets relative to the cost of funding and can be used to assess the efficiency of earnings from balance sheet activities. The net interest margin is affected by changes in interest earning asset yields, the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, the percentage of interest earning assets funded by non-interest-bearing funding sources, and the mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 
 The net interest margin was 3.34 for 2022, an increase of 33 bps from 3.01 in 2021, due primarily to the increase in market interest rates, as the Company's overall asset sensitive position results in a benefit to net interest income in a rising rate environment, in addition to average growth in loans, net of deferred fees and costs, and investment securities available for sale. 2022 also included 12.6 million in PPP fees, a decline of 66.6 million compared to 79.2 million in 2021. The yield on earning assets increased 60 bps to 3.84 from 3.24 in 2021, while the effective cost of funds increased 27 bps to 0.50 from 0.23 in 2021. 
 The primary components of the yield on interest earning assets are loan yields, yields on investment securities, and the yield on balances held with the Federal Reserve Bank. Loan yields increased 49 bps as a result of the FOMC's rate hikes, and yields on investment securities increased 41 bps due primarily to higher reinvestment yield and lower prepayments compared to 2021. The increase in average loans was primarily attributable to growth in commercial production and line utilization in addition to a deceleration in pay-off activity. Earning asset yields were also positively impacted by the decrease in cash balances held with the Federal Reserve Bank as compared to the prior year. 
 The increase in the effective cost of funds during 2022 was primarily driven by increases in market interest rates despite disciplined deposit pricing. 
 
 Earning Assets and Sources of Funds 
 Average total assets for 2022 increased 2.24 billion, or 4 , to 57.61 billion as compared to average total assets of 55.37 billion for 2021. Average interest earning assets increased 3.05 billion, or 6 , in 2022 as compared to the prior year and represented 94.1 of average total assets for 2022, as compared to 92.4 in 2021. The increase in average earning assets resulted primarily from a 3.07 billion increase in average total loans, net of deferred fees and costs, which included a decrease of 1.40 billion in average PPP loans, and a 1.61 billion increase in average investment securities available for sale. These increases were partially offset by a 1.74 billion decrease in average interest-bearing funds held at the Federal Reserve Bank. 
 Average interest-bearing liabilities for 2022 of 34.88 billion increased 1.16 billion, or 3 , from 33.72 billion in 2021. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities resulted largely from a 796.3 million, or 66 , increase in long-term debt primarily from FHLB advances, a 616.2 million increase in brokered deposits, a 466.2 million increase in other short-term borrowings largely due to FHLB advances, and a 326.6 million increase in average interest-bearing demand deposits, partially offset by a 963.3 million, or 27 , decrease in average time deposits largely as a result of rate-driven and normal client liquidity deployment.

Average non-interest bearing demand deposits increased 1.43 billion, or 9 , compared to 2021, as these deposits continue to be a meaningful component of our funding strategy and have helped manage total funding costs in the rising rate environment.

Non-interest Revenue 
 Non-interest revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 409.3 million, down 40.7 million, or 9 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 due primarily to industry-wide lower mortgage banking income, a decline in other non-interest revenue resulting from valuation adjustments on equity method investments, and lower BOLI income from decreased life insurance proceeds partially offset by strong growth in core banking fees (1) and higher wealth revenue (2) . 
 The following table shows the principal components of non-interest revenue.

 153,341 143,058 115,359 10,283 7 
 (1) Core banking fees consist of service charges on deposit accounts, card fees, and other non-interest revenue components including letter of credit fees, ATM fee income, line of credit non-usage fees, gains (losses) from sales of SBA loans, and miscellaneous other service charges. 
 (2) Wealth revenue consists of fiduciary and asset management, brokerage, and insurance revenue. 
 Service charges on deposit accounts, consisting of account analysis fees, NSF fees, and all other service charges, increased during 2022 compared to 2021 . The largest category of service charges, account analysis fees, were 40.1 million for 2022, up 1.4 million, or 4 , from 2021. NSF fees for 2022 and 2021 comprised 32 and 31 , respectively, of service charges on deposit accounts and 7 and 6 , respectively, of total non-interest revenue. All other service charges on deposit accounts, which consist primarily of monthly fees on consumer demand deposits and small business accounts, were 23.1 million for 2022, up 1.8 million, or 8 , compared to 2021. 
 Fiduciary and asset management fees are derived from providing estate administration, personal trust, corporate trust, corporate bond, investment management, financial planning, and family office services. The slight increase in fiduciary and asset management fees for 2022 was driven by solid client acquisition despite headwinds from a decline in the equity markets. 
 Card fees consist primarily of credit card interchange fees, debit card interchange fees, and merchant revenue. Card fees are reported net of certain associated expense items including client loyalty program expense and network expense. Merchant revenue relates to the fees that are charged to merchant clients based on a percentage of their credit or debit card transaction volume amounts. The strong increase in 2022 from 2021 resulted from increased transaction volumes from both consumer and commercial spend activity and account growth as we continue to invest in our Treasury and Payment solutions business as well as higher merchant revenue. 
 Brokerage revenue consists primarily of brokerage commissions as well as advisory fees earned from the management of client assets. The increase in 2022 over 2021 was largely driven by benefits from client activity including movement into short-term investments such as repurchase agreements in the face of challenging equity markets. 
 Mortgage banking income, consisting of net gains on loan origination/sales activities, was significantly lower compared to 2021, driven largely by the continued depressed residential mortgage environment with substantial increases in mortgage rates reducing refinancing and new-purchase volumes and compressing secondary margins. Gains on sale declined 32.8 million as a result of 913.1 million, or 54 , lower loan sales and a 870.8 million, or 54 , decrease in secondary market mortgage production compared to 2021. 
 Capital markets income primarily includes fee income from client derivative transactions. Additionally, capital markets income includes fee income from debt capital market transactions and foreign exchange as well as other miscellaneous income 
 46 

from capital market transactions. The increase for 2022 was primarily a result of a 1.6 million increase in loan syndication arranger fees partially offset by a 834 thousand decrease in fees on client derivative transactions. 
 Income from BOLI, includes increases in the cash surrender value of policies and proceeds from insurance benefits. The decrease in 2022 was driven by a 8.0 million decrease in proceeds from insurance benefits. 
 The main components of other non-interest revenue are fees for letters of credit and unused lines of credit, safe deposit box fees, access fees for ATM use, other service charges and loan servicing fees, income from insurance commissions, earnings on equity method investments, gains (losses) from sales of SBA loans, and other miscellaneous items. 2022 included a 7.0 million write-down on a minority Fintech investment and an 8.5 million decrease compared to 2021 related to unfavorable valuation adjustments on tax-related equity investment partnerships. 2022 also included a 6.9 million reduction in the fair value of non-qualified deferred compensation plan assets (offset in non-interest expense). 
 
 Non-interest Expense 
 Non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 1.16 billion, an increase of 57.6 million, or 5 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in non-interest expense during 2022 primarily resulted from elevated performance incentives, merit and inflationary wage increases, headcount additions, resumption of normal business activities post-COVID-19, investments in new business initiatives and technology and operations infrastructure spend. 
 The following table summarizes non-interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.

 1,157,506 1,099,904 1,179,574 57,602 5 
 Salaries and other personnel expense increased compared to 2021, primarily due to the impacts of elevated performance incentives, merit and inflationary wage increases, and headcount additions partially offset by a reduction in the fair value of the non-qualified deferred compensation liability (offset in non-interest revenue) and lower mortgage production-based commissions. Synovus employees totaled 5,114, up 126, or 3 , from December 31, 2021 as a result of headcount additions in areas associated with strategic revenue growth and certain critical support functions. 
 Net occupancy, equipment, and software expense increased compared to 2021, due primarily to continued investments in technology and operations infrastructure partially offset by savings from branch closures. Synovus Bank operated 246 branches at December 31, 2022, compared to 281 branches at December 31, 2021, following the closing of 36 branches and opening of 1 new branch during 2022. 
 Third-party processing and other services expense includes all third-party core operating system and processing charges as well as third-party loan servicing charges. Third-party processing expense increased compared to 2021, mostly due to enhancements associated with technology and operations infrastructure investments and new business initiatives somewhat offset by higher 2021 expense associated with PPP loan forgiveness. 
 Professional fees increased compared to 2021, primarily from higher consulting fees largely related to new business initiatives, technology and operations infrastructure investments, sustainability strategies for our clients, and increased legal fees from various matters, including new business initiatives and credit-related items. 
 47 

FDIC insurance and other regulatory fees increased compared to 2021, largely due to higher assessment rates primarily driven by asset growth, funding composition, and redemption of Synovus Bank's 2.289 Fixed-to-Floating Rate Senior Notes. In October 2022, the FDIC voted to increase the deposit insurance assessment rate by 2 bps beginning in the first quarter of 2023, which will significantly increase FDIC insurance expense industry-wide in 2023. 
 During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, S ynovus recorded restructuring charges (reversals) of (9.7) million and 7.2 million, respectively, which included 364 thousand and 2.3 million, respectively, of severance charges. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, 4.8 million and 4.6 million, respectively, in lease termination charges and asset impairment charges were recorded related to branch closures and restructuring of corporate real estate as part of a large-scale property optimization program. Asset impairment charges during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were net of 15.4 million and 5.4 million, respectively, in gains on sales of certain building and branch locations, including the sale of real estate facilities in Columbus, Georgia in 2022. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, Synovus recorded 6.0 million in valuation adjustments to the Visa derivative following Visa's announcements to authorize the deposit of funds into its litigation escrow account, which totaled 950 million in 2022. See "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of this Report for additional information on the Visa derivative. 
 On February 10, 2022, Synovus Bank redeemed its 2.289 Fixed-to-Floating Rate Bank Senior Notes of 400 million par value and incurred a 677 thousand loss on early extinguishment of debt. 
 Other operating expense includes advertising, travel, insurance, network and communication, other taxes, subscriptions and dues, other loan and ORE expense, postage and freight, training, business development, supplies, donations, and other miscellaneous expense. The increase over prior year was primarily related to an increase in fraud-related losses and other operational losses, loan expense due to elevated production, resumption of normal business activities post-COVID-19, and increased 2022 advertising expense resulting from the launch of our newly developed brand positioning and campaign. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 Income tax expense was 206.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 228.9 million and 111.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was 21.4 , 23.1 and 22.9 , respectively. The most significant factor of the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2022 compared to the prior year related to changes in the composition of state tax and apportionment rates. 
 Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. At December 31, 2022, net deferred tax assets were 595.3 million compared to 169.1 million at December 31, 2021. 
 Synovus regularly assesses the realizability of its net deferred tax assets based upon all available evidence, both positive and negative. Based upon the assessment, Synovus established a valuation allowance of 19.1 million at December 31, 2022 and 19.0 million at December 31, 2021, on the portion of its federal and state NOLs that are not expected to be utilized prior to expiration in years 2027 through 2042. See "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 16 - Income Taxes" of this Report for additional discussion regarding deferred income taxes. 
 48 

Credit Quality 
 Synovus diligently monitors the quality of its loan portfolio by industry, property type, and geography through a thorough portfolio review process and our analytical risk management tools. At December 31, 2022, credit quality metrics remained stable and at or near historical lows with NPA and NPL ratios of 0.33 and 0.29 , respectively, and total past dues of 0.15 , as a percentage of total loans. Net charge-offs for 2022 remained low at 53.2 million, or 0.13 , of average loans.

Total NPAs as a percentage of total loans, other loans held for sale, ORE and specific other assets declined 7 bps to 0.33 at December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021. NPLs were 128.1 million at December 31, 2022, a 3.0 million, or 2 , decrease from December 31, 2021 .

 Troubled Debt Restructurings 
 At December 31, 2022, TDRs (accruing and non-accruing) were 156.7 million, an increase of 14.6 million, or 10 , compared to December 31, 2021. Accruing TDRs were 146.8 million at December 31, 2022, an increase of 27.0 million, or 23 , compared to December 31, 2021. The mix of accruing TDRs has changed from December 31, 2021 as certain pass-rated loans that met the criteria for removal of TDR designation were offset by accruing substandard loans modified primarily through interest rate concessions previously accounted for under the CARES Act. 
 Accruing TDRs are considered performing because they are performing in accordance with the restructured terms. At December 31, 2022 approximately 99 of accruing TDRs were current compared to 98 at December 31, 2021 . In addition, subsequent defaults on accruing TDRs (defaults defined as the earlier of the TDR being placed on non-accrual status or reaching 90 days past due with respect to principal and/or interest payments within twelve months of the TDR designation) have continued to remain at lower levels with five defaults with a recorded investment of 1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to eight defaults with a recorded investment of 978 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 The table below shows accruing TDRs by risk grade at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

 Non-TDR Modifications due to COVID-19 
 The Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus provided that eligible loan modifications related to COVID-19 may be accounted for under section 4013 of the CARES Act or in accordance with ASC 310-40. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 extended the applicable period of Section 4013 of the CARES Act which allowed banks to elect to not consider loan modifications related to COVID-19 made between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of January 1, 2022, or 60 days after the national emergency ends to borrowers that are current (i.e. less than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019) as TDRs. The regulatory agencies further stated that performing loans granted payment deferrals due to COVID-19 are not considered past due or non-accrual. FASB confirmed the foregoing regulatory agencies' view, that such short-term modifications (e.g., six months) made on a good-faith basis in response to COVID-19 for borrowers who are current are not TDRs. 
 As of December 31, 2021, we provided borrowers who were impacted by COVID-19 with other modifications such as interest-only relief or amortization extensions on less than 2 of total loans. The CARES Act election period ended on January 1, 2022. 
 Past Due Loans 
 As a percentage of loans outstanding, loans 30 or more days past due and still accruing interest were 0.15 at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. As a percentage of loans outstanding, loans 90 days past due and still accruing interest were 0.01 and 0.02 at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These loans are in the process of collection, and management believes that sufficient collateral value securing these loans exists to cover contractual interest and principal payments. 
 Criticized and Classified Loans 
 Our loan ratings are aligned to federal banking regulators' definitions of pass and criticized categories, which include special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss. Substandard accruing and non-accruing loans, doubtful, and loss loans are often collectively referred to as classified. Special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss loans are often collectively referred 
 51 

to as criticized and classified loans. The following table presents a summary of criticized and classified loans. Criticized and classified loans at December 31, 2022 declined 85.9 million, or 8 , compared to December 31, 2021.

 Net Charge-offs 
 Total 2022 net charge-offs were 53.2 million, or 0.13 , of average loans, compared to total net charge-offs of 77.8 million, or 0.20 of average loans in 2021. The following table shows net charge-offs (recoveries) for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.

 Provision for (reversal of) Credit Losses and Allowance for Credit Losses 
 The provision for credit losses of 84.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 included net charge-offs of 53.2 million and compares to a reversal of provision for credit losses of 106.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 that included net charge-offs of 77.8 million. 2022 results reflect a deterioration in the economic outlook for 2023 and 2024 and strong loan growth, while 2021 results benefited from an improvement in the economic outlook as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic began to subside. 10.5 million and 38.6 million, respectively, in reserves were also added as a result of purchases of 514.5 million and 1.62 billion, respectively, of third-party lending loans for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 The ALL of 443.4 million and the reserve for unfunded commitments of 57.5 million, which is recorded in other liabilities, comprise the total ACL of 500.9 million at December 31, 2022. The ACL increased 31.4 million compared to the December 31, 2021 ACL of 469.5 million, which consisted of an ALL of 427.6 million and the reserve for unfunded commitments of 41.9 million. The ACL to loans coverage ratio of 1.15 at December 31, 2022 was 4 bps lower compared to December 31, 2021. The increase in the ACL from December 31, 2021 resulted primarily from loan growth and an increase in the reserve for unfunded commitments, largely due to an increase in both reserve rates and the level of unfunded commitments, mostly offset by decreased specific reserves and continued positive trends in our credit performance.

Capital Resources 
 Synovus and Synovus Bank are required to comply with capital adequacy standards established by our primary federal regulator, the Federal Reserve. Synovus and Synovus Bank measure capital adequacy using the standardized approach under Basel III. At December 31, 2022, Synovus and Synovus Bank's capital levels remained strong and exceeded well-capitalized requirements currently in effect. The following table presents certain ratios used to measure Synovus and Synovus Bank's capitalization. 
 Table 24 - Capital Ratios (dollars in thousands) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 CET1 capital Synovus Financial Corp. 4,926,194 4,388,618 Synovus Bank 5,446,703 4,998,698 Tier 1 risk-based capital Synovus Financial Corp. 5,463,339 4,925,763 Synovus Bank 5,446,703 4,998,698 Total risk-based capital Synovus Financial Corp. 6,415,681 5,827,196 Synovus Bank 6,079,152 5,587,757 CET1 capital ratio Synovus Financial Corp. 9.63 9.50 Synovus Bank 10.66 10.83 Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio Synovus Financial Corp. 10.68 10.66 Synovus Bank 10.66 10.83 Total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets ratio Synovus Financial Corp. 12.54 12.61 Synovus Bank 11.89 12.11 Leverage ratio Synovus Financial Corp. 9.07 8.72 Synovus Bank 9.06 8.86 
 At December 31, 2022, Synovus' CET1 ratio was 9.63 , well in excess of regulatory requirements including the capital conservation buffer of 2.5 . The December 31, 2022 CET1 ratio increased 13 bps compared to December 31, 2021, as over 70 of organic earnings for 2022 were retained to support core client growth while also returning approximately 30 to our shareholders through our common dividend. For more information on regulatory capital requirements, see "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10 - Regulatory Capital" in this Report. In 2023, we will continue to prioritize capital deployment toward client growth and will remain mindful of the evolving economic environment as we manage within our target CET1 ratio range of 9.25 to 9.75 . 
 On January 18, 2023, Synovus announced that its Board of Directors approved a capital plan that includes a 0.04 increase in the quarterly common stock dividend to 0.38 per share , beginning with the quarterly dividend payable in April 2023, and authorized share repurchases of up to 300 million in 2023. 
 On January 20, 2022, Synovus announced that its Board of Directors authorized share repurchases of up to 300 million in 2022, and during the year ended December 31, 2022, Synovus repurchased a total of 13.0 million, or 281 thousand shares, of its common stock, at an average price of 46.17 per share. 
 On August 26, 2020, the federal banking regulators issued a final rule that allowed electing banking organizations that adopted CECL during 2020 to mitigate the estimated effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year phase-in transition period. Synovus adopted CECL on January 1, 2020, and the December 31, 2022 regulatory capital ratios reflect Synovus' election of the five-year transition provision. At December 31, 2022, 43.7 million, or a cumulative 9 bps benefit to CET1, was deferred. For additional information on CECL, see "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in this Report.

Parent Company 
 The Parent Company s net assets consist primarily of its investment in Synovus Bank. The P arent Company s primary uses of cash are for the servicing of debt, payment of dividends to shareholders, and repurchases of common stock. The Parent Company also provides the necessary funds to strengthen the capital of its subsidiaries if needed. These uses of cash are primarily funded by dividends from Synovus Bank, borrowings from external sources, and equity offerings. 
 During 2022, Synovus Bank paid upstream cash dividends to th e Parent Company totaling 350.0 million. D uring 2021, Synovus Bank paid upstream cash dividends to the Parent Company totaling 420.0 million, and during 2020, Synovus Bank and non-bank subsidiaries paid upstream cash dividends to the Parent Company totaling 547.5 million. 
 
 Liquidity 
 Liquidity represents the extent to which Synovus has readily available sources of funding to meet the needs of depositors, borrowers and creditors, to support asset growth, and to otherwise sustain operations of Synovus and its subsidiaries, at a reasonable cost, on a timely basis, and without adverse consequences. ALCO monitors Synovus' economic, competitive, and regulatory environment and is responsible for measuring, monitoring, and reporting on liquidity and funding risk as well as market risk. 
 In accordance with Synovus policies and regulatory guidance, ALCO evaluates contractual and anticipated cash flows under normal and stressed conditions to properly manage the Company's liquidity profile. Synovus places an emphasis on maintaining numerous sources of current and contingent liquidity to meet its obligations to depositors, borrowers, and creditors on a timely basis. Liquidity is generated through various sources, including, but not limited to, maturities and repayments of loans by clients, maturities and sales of investment securities, and growth in core and wholesale deposits. 
 Synovus Bank also generates liquidity through the issuance of brokered certificates of deposit and money market accounts. Synovus Bank accesses these funds from a broad geographic base to diversify its sources of funding and liquidity. Synovus Bank also has the capacity to access funding through its membership in the FHLB system and through the Federal Reserve discount window. At December 31, 2022, based on currently pledged collateral, Synovus Bank had access to FHLB funding of 2.78 billion, subject to FHLB credit policies. Management continuously monitors and maintains appropriate levels of liquidity so as to provide adequate funding sources to manage client deposit withdrawals, loan requests, and other funding demands. 
 In addition to bank level liquidity management, Synovus must manage liquidity at the parent company level for various operating needs including the servicing of debt, the payment of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock, payment of general corporate expense, and potential capital infusions into subsidiaries. The primary source of liquidity for Synovus consists of dividends from Synovus Bank, which is governed by certain rules and regulations of the GA DBF and the Federal Reserve Bank. Synovus' ability to receive dividends from Synovus Bank in future periods will depend on a number of factors, including, without limitation, Synovus Bank's future profits, asset quality, liquidity, and overall condition. In addition, both the GA DBF and Federal Reserve Bank may require approval to pay dividends, based on certain regulatory statutes and limitations. 
 Synovus presently believes that the sources of liquidity discussed above, including existing liquid funds on hand, are sufficient to meet its anticipated funding needs. However, if economic conditions were to significantly deteriorate, regulatory capital requirements for Synovus or Synovus Bank were to increase as the result of regulatory directives or otherwise, or Synovus believes it is prudent to enhance current liquidity levels, then Synovus may seek additional liquidity from external sources. See "Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors - Credit and Liquidity - Changes in the cost and availability of funding due to changes in the deposit market and credit market may adversely affect our capital resources, liquidity and financial results." Furthermore, Synovus may, from time to time, take advantage of attractive market opportunities to refinance its existing debt, redeem its preferred stock, share repurchases, or strengthen its liquidity or capital position. 
 55 

Contractual Cash Obligations 
 The following table summarizes, by remaining maturity, Synovus significant contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2022. Excluded from the table below are certain liabilities with variable cash flows and/or no contractual maturity. See "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies" of this Report for information on Synovus' commitments to extend credit including loan commitments and letters of credit along with obligations related to Synovus' sponsorship of MPS businesses. Additionally, see "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 7 - Deposits" of this Report for information on contractual maturities of time deposits and "Part II - Item 8.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 The measures entitled adjusted non-interest revenue; adjusted non-interest expense; adjusted revenue; adjusted tangible efficiency ratio; adjusted return on average assets; adjusted net income available to common shareholders; adjusted net income per common share, diluted; adjusted return on average common equity; return on average tangible common equity; adjusted return on average tangible common equity; the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio, adjusted pre-provision net revenue (PPNR) ex. PPP revenue, and adjusted PPNR are not measures recognized under GAAP and therefore are considered non-GAAP financial measures. The most comparable GAAP measures to these measures are total non-interest revenue, total non-interest expense, total TE revenue, efficiency ratio-TE, return on average assets, net income available to common shareholders, net income per common share, diluted, return on average common equity, the ratio of total shareholders equity to total assets, and PPNR, respectively. 
 Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful additional information about Synovus to assist management and investors in evaluating Synovus operating results, financial strength, the performance of its business, and the strength of its capital position. However, these non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of operating results or capital position as reported under GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as additional views of the way our financial measures are affected by significant items and other factors, and since they are not required to be uniformly applied, they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures at other companies. Adjusted non-interest revenue and adjusted revenue are measures used by management to evaluate non-interest revenue and total TE revenue exclusive of net investment securities gains (losses) and fair value adjustments on non-qualified deferred compensation. Adjusted non-interest expense and the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio are measures utilized by management to measure the success of expense management initiatives focused on reducing recurring controllable operating costs. Adjusted return on average assets, adjusted net income available to common shareholders, adjusted net income per common share, diluted, and adjusted return on average common equity are measurements used by management to evaluate operating results exclusive of items that management believes are not indicative of ongoing operations and impact period-to-period comparisons. Return on average tangible common equity and adjusted return on average tangible common equity are measures used by management to compare Synovus performance with other financial institutions because it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization, thereby allowing management to evaluate the performance of the business consistently. The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio is used by management to assess the strength of our capital position. Adjusted PPNR ex. PPP revenue is used by management to evaluate pre-provision net revenue exclusive of items that management believes are not indicative of ongoing operations and impact period-to-period comparisons including PPP revenue. Adjusted PPNR is used by management to evaluate PPNR exclusive of items that management believes are not indicative of ongoing operations and impact period-to-period comparisons. The computations of these measures are set forth in the tables below. 
 Management does not provide a reconciliation for forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures where it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the occurrence and the financial impact of various items that have not yet occurred, are out of Synovus control, or cannot be reasonably predicted. For the same reasons, Synovus management is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures provided without the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Market Risk and Interest Rate Sensitivity 
 Market risk reflects the risk of economic loss resulting from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. This risk of loss can be reflected in either diminished market values within the balance sheet or reduced current and potential net income. Synovus most significant market risk is interest rate risk. This risk arises primarily from Synovus core banking activities of extending loans and accepting deposits. 
 Managing interest rate risk is a primary goal of the asset liability management function. Synovus attempts to achieve consistency in net interest income while limiting volatility arising from changes in interest rates. Synovus seeks to accomplish this goal by balancing the maturity and repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities along with the selective use of derivative instruments. The Company manages this exposure in accordance with policies that are established by ALCO and approved by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. ALCO meets periodically and has responsibility for developing asset liability management policies, reviewing the interest rate sensitivity of Synovus, and developing and implementing strategies to improve balance sheet structure and interest rate risk positioning. 
 Synovus measures the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates through the use of simulation modeling. This effort involves assessing the Company's forecasted net interest income profile under various scenarios and over varying time horizons. The results of these simulations aid in measuring the Company's exposures and relative sensitivities, namely to changes in interest rates. The scenarios generally include numerous assumptions, including those related to changes in the balance sheet, interest rates, prepayment trends, and the repricing characteristics of non-contractual deposits. Such assumptions may change through time as a result of a host of factors, including changes in the balance sheet as well as the interest rate environment. The simulation modeling process is performed in a manner consistent with Synovus policies and procedures with results reviewed on an on-going basis by ALCO and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. 
 Within this framework, Synovus has modeled its baseline net interest income forecast assuming a relatively flat interest rate environment with the federal funds rate at the Federal Reserve's current targeted range of 4.25 to 4.50 as of December 31, 2022 and the current prime rate of 7.50 as of December 31, 2022. Synovus has modeled the impact of an immediate change in market interest rates across the yield curve of 100 and 200 bps to determine the sensitivity of net interest income for the next twelve months. As illustrated in the table below, the net interest income sensitivity derived from this simulation suggests that net interest income is projected to increase by 6.4 and 3.1 if interest rates increased by 200 and 100 bps, respectively. Net interest income is projected to decrease by 3.5 and 7.5 if interest rates decreased by 100 and 200 bps, respectively. These results indicate that the Company has an asset sensitive position over the next year, benefiting net interest income if rates rise and decreasing net interest income if rates fall. 
 Table 27 - Twelve Month Net Interest Income Sensitivity Change in Interest Rates (in bps) Estimated Change in Net Interest Income As of December 31, 2022 2021 +200 6.4 14.5 +100 3.1 6.5 -100 (3.5) N/A -200 (7.5) N/A 
 While all of the above estimates are reflective of the general interest rate sensitivity of Synovus, local market conditions, the realized growth and remixing of the balance sheet, as well as the broader macroeconomic environment could all have a significant impact on the both the sensitivity and realized level of net interest income. 
 In addition to assessing net interest income sensitivities, we also perform simulation analyses to assess the sensitivity of our Economic Value of Equity (EVE) relative to changes in market interest rates. EVE is measured based on the discounted present values of assets, liabilities, and derivatives cash flows. Management uses EVE sensitivity as an additional means of measuring interest rate and incorporates this form of analysis within its governance and limits framework. 
 Synovus is also subject to market risk in certain of its fee income business lines. Financial management services revenue, which include trust, brokerage, and asset management fees, can be affected by risk in the securities markets, primarily the equity securities market. A significant portion of the fees in this unit are determined based upon a percentage of asset values. Weaker securities markets and lower equity values have an adverse impact on the fees generated by these operations. Trading account assets, maintained to facilitate brokerage client activity, are also subject to market risk; however, trading activities are limited and subject to risk policy limits. Additionally, Synovus utilizes various tools to measure and manage price risk in its trading portfolio. 
 62 

Mortgage banking income is also subject to market risk. Mortgage loan originations are sensitive to levels of mortgage interest rates and therefore, mortgage banking income can be negatively impacted during a period of rising interest rates. The extension of commitments to clients to fund mortgage loans also subjects Synovus to market risk. This risk is primarily created by the time periods between making the commitment, closing, and delivering the loan. Synovus seeks to minimize its exposure by utilizing various risk management tools, including forward sales commitments and other hedges. 
 Derivative Instruments for Interest Rate Risk Management 
 Synovus utilizes derivative instruments to manage its exposure to various types of structural interest rate risks by executing end-user derivative transactions designated as hedges. Hedging relationships may be designated as either a cash flow hedge, which mitigates risk exposure to the variability of future cash flows or other forecasted transactions, or a fair value hedge, which mitigates risk exposure to adverse changes in the fair market value of a fixed rate asset or liability due to changes in market interest rates. 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Synovus had 5.25 billion and 3.60 billion, respectively, in notional amounts outstanding of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedging instruments to hedge its exposure to contractually specified interest rate risk associated with floating rate loans. 
 As of December 31, 2022, Synovus had 2.23 billion in notional amounts outstanding of receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedging instruments to hedge its exposure to the change in the fair value due to fluctuations in market interest rates for outstanding fixed-rate long-term debt and interest-bearing deposits. 
 LIBOR Transition 
 On March 5, 2021, the FCA confirmed that all LIBOR settings would either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after June 30, 2023 for all remaining US dollar settings. 
 The ARRC proposed SOFR as its preferred rate alternative to LIBOR and proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from LIBOR. Organizations are currently working on industry-wide and company-specific transition plans related to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR. As noted within "Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors" of this Report, Synovus holds instruments that may be impacted by the discontinuance of LIBOR, which include floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives and hedges, and other financial instruments. Synovus established a cross-functional LIBOR transition working group with representation from all business lines, support and control functions, and legal counsel that has 1) assessed the Company's current exposure to LIBOR indexed instruments and the data, systems and processes that were impacted and have been changed as a result; 2) established a detailed implementation plan; 3) formulated communications and learning activities to support clients and colleagues; and 4) developed a formal governance structure for the transition. For the last several years, loan agreement provisions for new and renewed loans included LIBOR fallback language to ensure transition from LIBOR when such transition occurs. All direct exposures resulting from existing financial contracts that mature after 2022 have been inventoried and are monitored on an ongoing basis. The Company discontinued the use of LIBOR as of December 31, 2021, with limited exceptions as permitted by regulatory guidance or internal policies. Synovus has expanded its product offerings and currently offers multiple alternative reference rates to clients including SOFR, BSBY, and Prime indices. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately 10 billion in loans tied to LIBOR that mature after June 30, 2023. Remediation activities are underway to modify or transition existing exposures to the applicable Federal Reserve Board selected replacement rate or to convert the rate under existing fallback language, including the use of the Adjustable Interest (LIBOR) Act, enacted in March 2022, and other relevant legislation.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Board of Directors and Shareholders 
 Synovus Financial Corp.: 
 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Synovus Financial Corp. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 24, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Assessment of the allowance for loan losses for loans held for investment evaluated on a collective basis 
 As discussed in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s allowance for loan losses was 443.4 million as of December 31, 2022, a substantial portion of which relates to loans held for investment evaluated on a collective basis (the collective allowance). The Company estimated the December 31, 2022 collective allowance on a collective (pool) basis for loans grouped with similar risk characteristics based upon the nature of the loan type. The Company estimated the 2022 collective allowance using a discounted cash flow model for each loan group over the contractual term of the loan, adjusted for expected prepayments and curtailments where appropriate. Such model applies the forecasted PD, which is the probability that a borrower will default, adjusted for relevant macroeconomic factors, comprising multiple weighted scenarios representing different plausible outcomes, and LGD, which is the estimate of the amount of net loss in the event of default to the estimated cash flows. To the extent the estimated lives of the loans in the portfolio extend beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast of two years, the Company reverts on a straight-line basis back to the historical loss rates over a one-year period. The resulting life-of-loan loss estimate may be adjusted for certain quantitative and qualitative factors to address uncertainty and limitations in the quantitative model. 
 We identified the assessment of the December 31, 2022 collective allowance as a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment. Specifically, the assessment encompassed the evaluation of the 2022 collective allowance methodology, including the methods and model used to estimate the inputs to the discounted cash flow model including the forecasted 
 64 

PD, portfolio segmentation, the selection of the macroeconomic forecasts and the weighting of each, the selection of macroeconomic factors, the reasonable and supportable forecast period, reversion methodology, and the historical observation period. The assessment also included an evaluation of the significant assumption that quantitative adjustments are necessary to address uncertainty and limitations in the quantitative model. The assessment also included an evaluation of the conceptual soundness and performance of the forecasted PD model. In addition, auditor judgment was required to evaluate the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained. 
 The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the measurement of the 2022 collective allowance estimate, including controls over the: 
 development of the 2022 collective allowance methodology 
 continued use and appropriateness of changes to the forecasted PD model 
 identification and determination of the significant assumptions used in the forecasted PD model, portfolio segmentation, the selection of the macroeconomic forecasts and the weighting of each, the selection of the macroeconomic factors, the reasonable and supportable forecast period, reversion methodology, and the historical observation period 
 development of the quantitative adjustments necessary to address uncertainty and limitations in the quantitative model 
 conceptual soundness and performance of the forecasted PD model 
 analysis of 2022 collective allowance results, trends, and ratios. 
 We evaluated the Company s process to develop the 2022 collective allowance estimate by testing certain sources of data, factors, and assumptions that the Company used, and considered the relevance and reliability of such data, factors, and assumptions. We also involved credit risk professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in: 
 evaluating the Company s 2022 collective allowance methodology for compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles 
 evaluating assumptions made by the Company relative to the selection of the macroeconomic forecasts, including the appropriateness of their weightings and selection of macroeconomic factors, and forecasted PD used in the discounted cash flow model by comparing them to relevant Company-specific metrics and trends and relevant industry practices 
 evaluating the length of the historical observation period, reasonable and supportable forecast period, and the reversion period by comparing to specific portfolio risk characteristics and trends 
 determining whether the loan portfolio is segmented by similar risk characteristics by comparing to the Company s business environment and relevant industry practices 
 assessing the conceptual soundness and performance of the forecasted PD model by inspecting the model documentation to determine whether the model is suitable for its intended use 
 evaluating the significant assumption that quantitative adjustments are necessary to address uncertainty and limitations in the quantitative model and the effect of the quantitative adjustments on the 2022 collective allowance compared with relevant credit risk factors, and consistency with credit trends. 
 We also assessed the sufficiency of the audit evidence obtained related to the collective allowance by evaluating the: 
 cumulative results of the audit procedures 
 qualitative aspects of the Company s accounting practices 
 potential bias in the accounting estimates.

 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

All loan modifications, renewals, and refinances are evaluated for TDR classification. The ALL on a TDR is measured using the same method as all other loans held for investment, except that the original interest rate, and not the rate specified with the restructuring, is used to discount the expected cash flows. Concessions provided by Synovus in a TDR are generally made in order to assist borrowers so that debt service is not interrupted and to mitigate the potential for loan losses. A number of factors are reviewed when a loan is renewed, refinanced, or modified, including cash flows, collateral values, guarantees, and loan structures. Concessions are primarily in the form of providing a below market interest rate given the borrower's credit risk to assist the borrower in managing cash flows, an extension of the maturity of the loan generally for less than , or a period of time generally less than with a reduction of required principal and/or interest payments (e.g., interest only for a period of time). Insignificant delays of principal and/or interest payments, or short-term deferrals, are generally not considered to be financial concessions. Further, it is generally Synovus' practice not to defer principal and/or interest for more than . 
 Non-accruing TDRs may generally be returned to accrual status if there has been a period of performance, usually at least a six-month sustained period of repayment performance in accordance with the agreement. In the fiscal year subsequent to a loan's initial reporting as a TDR, a TDR for a borrower who is no longer experiencing financial difficulty (as evidenced by a period of performance), which yields a market rate of interest at the time of a renewal, and for which no principal was forgiven, is no longer considered a TDR. 
 Concentrations of Credit Risk 
 A substantial portion of the loan portfolio is secured by real estate in markets located throughout Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee. Accordingly, the ultimate collectability of a substantial portion of the loan portfolio is susceptible to changes in market conditions in these areas. 
 Loan Origination Fees and Costs 
 Loan origination fees and direct loan origination costs are deferred and amortized to net interest income over the life of the related loan or over the commitment period as a yield adjustment.

for Synovus), the Company reverts, on a straight-line basis back to the historical rates over a period. 
 Life-of-loan loss percentages may also be adjusted, as necessary, for certain quantitative and qualitative factors that in management's judgment are necessary to reflect losses expected in the portfolio. These adjustments address inherent limitations in the quantitative model including uncertainty and limitations, among others. 
 The above reflects the ALL estimation process for most commercial and consumer sub-pools. In some cases, Synovus may apply other acceptable loss rate models to smaller sub-pools. 
 Loans that do not share risk characteristics are individually evaluated on a loan-by-loan basis with specific reserves, if any, recorded as appropriate. Specific reserves are determined based on two methods: discounted cash flow based upon the loan's contractual effective interest rate or at the fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell if the loan is collateral-dependent. 
 For individually evaluated loans, under the DCF method, resulting expected credit losses are recorded as a specific reserve with a charge-off for any portion of the expected credit loss that is determined not to be recoverable. The reserve is reassessed each quarter and adjusted as appropriate based on changes in estimated cash flows. Additionally, where guarantors are determined to be a source of repayment, an assessment of the guarantee is required. This guarantee assessment would include, but not be limited to, factors such as type and feature of the guarantee, consideration for the guarantor's financial strength and capacity to service the loan in combination with the guarantor's other financial obligations as well as the guarantor's willingness to assist in servicing the loan. 
 For individually evaluated loans, if the loan is collateral-dependent, then the fair value of the loan's collateral, less estimated selling costs, is compared to the loan's carrying amount to determine impairment. Fair value is estimated using appraisals performed by a certified or licensed appraiser. Management also considers other factors or recent developments, such as changes in absorption rates or market conditions at the time of valuation, selling costs and anticipated sales values, taking into account management's plans for disposition, which could result in adjustments to the fair value estimates indicated in the appraisals. The assumptions used in determining the amount of the impairment are subject to significant judgment. Use of different assumptions, for example, changes in the fair value of the collateral or management's plans for disposition could have a significant impact on the amount of impairment. 
 Purchased Loans with Credit Deterioration 
 Purchased loans are evaluated upon acquisition in order to determine if the loan, or pool of loans, has experienced more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination or issuance. In the performance of this evaluation, Synovus considers migration of the credit quality of the loans at origination in comparison to the credit quality at acquisition. 
 Purchased loans classified as PCD are recognized in accordance with ASC 326-20-30, whereby the amortized cost basis of the PCD asset is grossed-up by the initial estimate of credit losses with an offset to the ALL. This acquisition date allowance has no income statement effect. Post-acquisition, any changes in estimates of expected credit losses are recorded through the provision for credit losses. Non-credit discounts or premiums are accreted or amortized, respectively into interest income using the interest method. 
 The accounting treatment for purchased loans classified as non-PCD is the same as loans held for investment as detailed in the above section. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses on Off-balance-sheet Credit Exposures 
 Synovus maintains a separate ACL for off-balance-sheet credit exposures, including unfunded loan commitments, unless the associated obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. This allowance is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets with associated expense recognized as a component of the provision for credit losses on the consolidated statements of income. The reserve for off-balance-sheet credit exposures considers the likelihood that funding will occur and estimates the expected credit losses on resulting commitments expected to be funded over their estimated life using the estimated loss rates on loans held for investment. 
 Commercial Loans - Risk Ratings 
 Synovus utilizes two primary methods for risk assessment of the commercial loan portfolio: SRR Assessment and DRR Assessment. DRR is a statistical model approach to risk rating that includes a PD and a LGD. The SRR model is an expert judgment based model that results in a blended (i.e. single) rating. The single and dual risk ratings are based on the borrowers'

to years, while furniture, equipment, and software are depreciated and amortized over a range of to years. Synovus capitalizes certain costs associated with the acquisition or development of internal-use software. Once the software is ready for its intended use, these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the software s expected useful life over a range of the lesser of contract terms or to years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the remainder of the lease term. Synovus reviews long-lived assets, such as premises and equipment, for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Maintenance and repairs are charged to non-interest expense and improvements that extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized to the asset's carrying value and depreciated. 
 76 

utilizing an accelerated method. The remaining intangible assets are amortized using straight line methods based on the remaining lives of the assets with amortization periods ranging from eight to . Amortization periods for intangible assets are monitored to determine if events and circumstances require such periods to be reduced.

 As of December 31, 2022, Synovus had investment securities in a loss position for less than twelve months and investment securities in a loss position for twelve months or longer. Synovus does not intend to sell investment securities in an unrealized loss position prior to the recovery of the unrealized loss, which may not be until maturity, and has the ability and intent to hold those securities for that period of time. Additionally, Synovus is not currently aware of any circumstances which will require it to sell any of the securities that are in an unrealized loss position prior to the respective securities' recovery of all such unrealized losses. As such, no write-downs to the amortized cost basis of the portfolio were recorded at December 31, 2022. 
 At December 31, 2022, ACL was established for investment securities. Substantially all of the unrealized losses on the securities portfolio were the result of changes in market interest rates compared to the date the securities were acquired rather than the credit quality of the issuers or underlying loans.

 Commercial Real Estate Loans - CRE loans primarily consist of income-producing investment properties loans. Additionally, CRE loans include 1-4 family properties loans as well as land and development loans. Investment properties loans consist of construction and mortgage loans for income-producing properties and are primarily made to finance multi-family properties, hotels, office buildings, shopping centers, warehouses and other commercial development properties. 1-4 family properties loans include construction loans to homebuilders and commercial mortgage loans related to 1-4 family rental properties and are almost always secured by the underlying property being financed by such loans. These properties are primarily located in the markets served by Synovus. Land and development loans include commercial and residential development as well as land acquisition loans and are secured by land held for future development, typically in excess of one year. Properties securing these loans are substantially within markets served by Synovus, and loan terms generally include personal guarantees from the principals. Loans in this portfolio are underwritten based on the LTV of the collateral and the capacity of the guarantor(s). 
 Consumer Loans - The consumer loan portfolio consists of a wide variety of loan products offered through Synovus' banking network including first and second residential mortgages, home equity, and consumer credit card loans, as well as home improvement loans, student, personal, and auto loans from third-party lending ("other consumer loans"). Together, consumer mortgages and home equity comprise the majority of Synovus' consumer loans and are secured by first and second liens on residential real estate primarily located in the markets served by Synovus. The primary source of repayment for all consumer loans is generally the personal income of the borrower(s). 
 Credit Quality Indicators 
 The credit quality of the loan portfolio is reviewed and updated no less frequently than annually using the standard asset classification system utilized by the federal banking agencies. These classifications are divided into three groups: Not Criticized (Pass), Special Mention, and Classified or Adverse rating (Substandard, Doubtful, and Loss) and are defined as follows: 
 Pass - loans which are well protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor (or guarantors, if any) or by the fair value, less cost to acquire and sell in a timely manner, of any underlying collateral. 
 Special Mention - loans which have potential weaknesses that deserve management's close attention. These loans are not adversely classified and do not expose an institution to sufficient risk to warrant an adverse classification. 
 Substandard - loans which are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or by the collateral pledged, if any. Loans with this classification are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 
 Doubtful - loans which have all the weaknesses inherent in loans classified as Substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable on the basis of currently known facts, conditions, and values. 
 Loss - loans which are considered by management to be uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance on the institution's books as an asset, without establishment of a specific valuation allowance or charge-off, is not warranted. Synovus fully reserves for any loans rated as Loss. 
 In the following tables, consumer loans are generally assigned a risk grade similar to the classifications described above; however, upon reaching days and days past due, they are generally downgraded to Substandard and Loss, respectively, in accordance with the FFIEC Retail Credit Classification Policy. Additionally, in accordance with Interagency Supervisory Guidance, the risk grade classifications of consumer loans (consumer mortgages and home equity) secured by junior liens on 1-4 family residential properties also consider available information on the payment status of the associated senior liens with other financial institutions.

 Collateral-Dependent Loans 
 We classify a loan as collateral-dependent when our borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, and we expect repayment to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of collateral. Our commercial loans have collateral that is comprised of real estate and business assets. Our consumer loans have collateral that is substantially comprised of residential real estate. 
 There were no significant changes in the extent to which collateral secures our collateral-dependent loans during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

 The ALL of million and the reserve for unfunded commitments of million, which is recorded in other liabilities, comprise the total ACL of million at December 31, 2022. The ACL increased million compared to the December 31, 2021 ACL of million , which consisted of an ALL of million and the reserve for unfunded commitments of million . The ACL to loans coverage ratio of at December 31, 2022 was bps lower compared to December 31, 2021. The increase in the ACL from December 31, 2021 resulted primarily from loan growth and an increase in the reserve for unfunded commitments, largely due to an increase in both reserve rates and the level of unfunded commitments, mostly offset by decreased specific reserves and continued positive trends in our credit performance. 
 
 The ACL is estimated using a reasonable and supportable forecast period. To the extent the lives of the loans in the portfolio extend beyond the period for which a reasonable and supportable forecast can be made, the Company reverts on a straight-line basis back to the historical rates over a period. Synovus utilizes multiple economic forecast scenarios sourced from a reputable third-party provider that are probability-weighted internally. The current scenarios include a consensus baseline forecast, an upside scenario reflecting an accelerated recovery, a downside scenario that reflects adverse economic conditions, and an additional adverse scenario that assumes consistent slow growth that is less optimistic than the baseline. At December 31, 2022, the unemployment rate is the input that most significantly impacts our estimate. The multi-scenario forecast used in our estimate includes a weighted average unemployment rate of over the forecast period at December 31, 2022, compared to at December 31, 2021.

 Goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change to indicate that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred (i.e., a triggering event). During the fourth quarter of 2022, Synovus completed its annual goodwill impairment evaluation by performing a qualitative assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level. In performing the qualitative assessment, the Company evaluated events and circumstances since the last impairment analysis, recent operating performance including reporting unit performance, changes in market capitalization, changes in the business climate, company-specific factors and trends in the banking industry. The results of the qualitative assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount as of the test date; therefore, the quantitative goodwill impairment tests were deemed unnecessary.

million, or ) million, after tax, in OCI during the year ended December 31, 2022 and million, or thousand, after-tax, in OCI, during the year ended December 31, 2021, related to terminated cash flow hedges, which are being recognized into earnings in conjunction with the effective terms of the original swaps through the third quarter of 2026. Synovus recognized pre-tax income of million and million, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 related to t he amortization o f terminated cash flow hedges. 
 As of December 31, 2022, Synovus expects to reclassify into earnings approximately million in pre-tax loss due to the receipt or payment of interest payments on all cash flow hedges within the next twelve months. Included in this amount is approximately million in pre-tax loss related to the amortization of terminated cash flow hedges. As of December 31, 2022, the maximum length of time over which Synovus is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows is through the first quarter of 2027. 
 Fair value hedging relationships mitigate exposure to the change in fair value of an asset or liability. Synovus has entered into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swap contracts to hedge the change in the fair value due to fluctuations in market interest rates for outstanding fixed-rate long-term debt and interest-bearing deposits. The changes in fair value of the fair value hedges are recorded through earnings with an offset against changes in the fair value of the hedged item within interest expense in the consolidated statements of income. All components of each derivative instrument s gain (loss) are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness. 
 For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recognized in earnings immediately. 
 Client Related Derivative Positions 
 Synovus enters into interest rate swap agreements to facilitate the risk management strategies of certain commercial banking clients. Synovus typically mitigates this risk largely by entering into equal and offsetting interest rate swap agreements with highly rated counterparties. The interest rate swap agreements are free-standing derivatives and are recorded at fair value in other assets or other liabilities on Synovus' consolidated balance sheets. The credit risk to these clients is evaluated and included in the calculation of fair value. Fair value changes including credit-related adjustments are recorded as a component of capital markets income. 
 Counterparty Credit Risk and Collateral 
 Entering into derivative contracts potentially exposes Synovus to the risk of counterparties failure to fulfill their legal obligations, including, but not limited to, potential amounts due or payable under each derivative contract. Notional principal amounts are often used to express the volume of these transactions, but the amounts potentially subject to credit risk are much smaller. Synovus assesses the credit risk of its dealer counterparties by regularly monitoring publicly available credit rating information, evaluating other market indicators, and periodically reviewing detailed financials. Dealer collateral requirements are determined via risk-based policies and procedures and in accordance with existing agreements. Synovus seeks to minimize dealer credit risk by dealing with highly rated counterparties and by obtaining collateral for exposures above certain predetermined limits. Management closely monitors credit conditions within the client swap portfolio, which management deems to be of higher risk than dealer counterparties. Collateral is secured at origination and credit-related fair value adjustments are recorded against the asset value of the derivative as deemed necessary based upon an analysis, which includes consideration of the current asset value of the swap, client risk rating, collateral value, and client standing with regards to its swap contractual obligations and other related matters. Such asset values fluctuate based upon changes in interest rates regardless of changes in notional amounts and changes in client specific risk. 
 Mortgage Derivatives 
 Synovus originates first lien residential mortgage loans for sale into the secondary market. Mortgage loans are sold either individually or in a bulk sale by Synovus on a whole loan servicing-released basis to third-party servicing aggregators for potential conversion into mortgage-backed securities which can be traded in the secondary market or retained on their respective balance sheet. 
 Synovus enters into interest rate lock commitments for residential mortgage loans which commits it to lend funds to a potential borrower at a specific interest rate and within a specified period of time. Interest rate lock commitments that relate to the origination of mortgage loans that, if originated, will be held for sale, are considered derivative financial instruments under applicable accounting guidance. Outstanding interest rate lock commitments expose Synovus to the risk that the price of the mortgage loans underlying the commitments may decline due to increases in mortgage interest rates from inception of the rate lock to the funding of the loan and the eventual commitment for sale into the secondary market. 
 110 

million and million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Synovus had recorded the obligation to return cash collateral of million and , respectively. 
 For derivatives cleared through central clearing houses, the variation margin payments made are legally characterized as settlements of the derivatives. As a result, these variation margin payments are netted against the fair value of the respective derivative contracts on the consolidated balance sheets and related disclosures.

 Synovus invests in certain LIHTC partnerships which are engaged in the development and operation of affordable multi-family housing pursuant to Section 42 of the Code. Additionally, Synovus invests in certain solar energy tax credit partnerships pursuant to Section 48 of the Code and certain new market tax credit partnerships pursuant to section 45D of the Code. Synovus typically acts as a limited partner in these investments and does not exert control over the operating or financial policies of the partnerships and as such, is not considered the primary beneficiary of the partnership. For certain of its LIHTC investments, Synovus provides financing during the construction and development of the properties and is at risk for the funded amount of its equity investment plus the outstanding amount of any construction loans in excess of the fair value of the collateral for the loan, but has no obligation to fund the operations or working capital of the partnerships and is not exposed to losses beyond Synovus investment. Synovus receives tax credits related to these investments which are subject to recapture by taxing authorities based on compliance provisions required to be met at the project level.

 Merchant Services 
 In accordance with credit and debit card association rules, Synovus provides merchant processing services for clients with a contractual arrangement under which certain sales and processing support are provided through an outside merchant services provider with Synovus owning the merchant contract relationship. In addition, Synovus sponsors various third-party MPS businesses that process credit and debit card transactions on behalf of merchants. In connection with these services, a liability may arise in the event of a billing dispute between the merchant and a cardholder that is ultimately resolved in the cardholder's favor. If the merchant defaults on its obligations, the cardholder, through its issuing bank, generally has until six months after the date of the transaction to present a chargeback to the MPS, which is primarily liable for any losses on covered transactions. However, if a sponsored MPS fails to meet its obligations, then Synovus, as the sponsor, could be held liable for the disputed amount. Synovus seeks to mitigate this risk through its contractual arrangements with the MPS and the merchants by withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts and/or obtaining other security. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, Synovus and the sponsored entities processed and settled billion and billion of transactions, respectively. 
 Synovus covered chargebacks related to a particular sponsored MPS during 2019 and 2018 where the MPS s cash reserve account was unavailable to support the chargebacks. The remaining amount, net of reserves, included in other assets and classified in N PAs, was million a s of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. While Synovus has contractual protections to mitigate against loss, repayment of the amounts owed to Synovus will depend in large part upon the continued financial viability and/or valuation of the MPS. 
 Legal Proceedings 
 Synovus and its subsidiaries are subject to various legal proceedings, claims and disputes that arise in the ordinary course of its business. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, Synovus and its subsidiaries are subject to regulatory and governmental examinations, information gathering requests, inquiries and investigations. Synovus, like many other financial institutions, has been the target of legal actions and other proceedings asserting claims for damages and related relief for losses. These actions include mortgage loan and other loan put-back claims, claims and counterclaims asserted by individual borrowers related to their loans, allegations of violations of state and federal laws and regulations relating to banking practices, including putative class action matters. In addition to actual damages, if Synovus does not prevail in such asserted legal actions, credit-related litigation could result in additional write-downs or charge-offs of assets, which could adversely affect Synovus' results of operations during the period in which the write-down or charge-off were to occur. 
 Synovus carefully examines and considers each legal matter, and, in those situations where Synovus determines that a particular legal matter presents loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable, Synovus establishes an appropriate reserve. An event is considered to be probable if the future event is likely to occur. While the final outcome of any legal proceeding is inherently uncertain, based on the information currently available, advice of counsel and available insurance coverage, management believes that the amounts accrued with respect to legal matters as of December 31, 2022 are adequate. The actual costs of resolving legal claims may be higher or lower than the amounts accrued.

to million in excess of the amounts accrued, if any, related to those matters. This estimated aggregate range is based upon information currently available to Synovus, and the actual losses could prove to be lower or higher. As there are further developments in these legal matters, Synovus will reassess these matters, and the estimated range of reasonably possible losses may change as a result of this assessment. Based on Synovus' current knowledge and advice of counsel, management presently does not believe that the liabilities arising from these legal matters will have a material adverse effect on Synovus' consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these legal matters could have a material adverse effect on Synovus' results of operations or financial condition for any particular period.

 Synovus believes the realization of net deferred tax assets (after valuation allowance) at December 31, 2022 is more likely than not based on its history of cumulative profitability as well as expectations of future taxable income, including reversals of taxable temporary differences, in the jurisdictions in which it operates. 
 Synovus expects that a portion of its million of federal and state NOLs, which have carryforward periods ending in tax years 2027 through 2042, will not be realized before their carryforward period lapses and the Company has accordingly established a valuation allowance in the amount of million at December 31, 2022.

major reportable business segments: Wholesale Banking, Community Banking, Consumer Banking, and Financial Management Services with functional activities such as treasury, technology, operations, marketing, finance, enterprise risk, legal, human resources, corporate communications, executive management, among others, included in Treasury and Corporate Other. 
 Business segment results are determined based upon Synovus' management reporting system, which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments. Certain assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense not allocated or attributable to a particular business segment are included in Treasury and Corporate Other. Synovus' third-party lending consumer loans and loans held for sale, PPP loans, as well as Corporate and Investment Banking (CIB) loans are included in Treasury and Corporate Other. The management accounting policies and processes utilized in compiling segment financial information are highly subjective and, unlike financial accounting, are not based on authoritative guidance similar to GAAP. As a result, reported segment results are not necessarily comparable with similar information reported by other financial institutions. 
 The Wholesale Banking business segment serves primarily larger corporate clients and governmental clients by providing commercial lending, capital markets, and deposit services through specialty teams including middle market, CRE, senior housing, national accounts, premium finance, structured lending, healthcare, asset-based lending, public finance, restaurant services, and community investment capital. 
 The Community Banking business segment primarily serves small and medium-sized commercial clients as well as individual private wealth clients using a relationship-based approach. The commercial component of this segment focuses on locally owned and operated businesses. Private wealth services are delivered to the individuals operating the businesses as well as other individuals in the communities in which the Community Bank operates. A comprehensive set of banking products are offered to the client set including a full suite of lending, payments, and depository products as well as financial planning services. 
 The Consumer Banking business segment services individual and small business clients through its branch and ATM network, in addition to digital and telephone channels. This segment primarily provides individuals and small businesses with an array of comprehensive banking products and services including depository accounts, credit and debit cards, payment solutions, goal-based planning, home equity and other consumer loans, and small business lending solutions. 
 The Financial Management Services business segment serves its clients by providing mortgage and trust services and also specializing in professional portfolio management for fixed-income securities, investment banking, the execution of securities transactions as a broker/dealer, asset management, financial planning, and family office services, as well as the provision of individual investment advice on equity and other securities. 
 Synovus uses a centralized FTP methodology to attribute appropriate net interest income to the business segments. The intent of the FTP methodology is to transfer interest rate risk from the business segments by providing matched duration funding of assets and liabilities. The result is to centralize the financial impact, management, and reporting of interest rate risk in the Treasury and Corporate Other function where it can be centrally monitored and managed. Treasury and Corporate Other includes certain assets and/or liabilities managed within that function. Additionally, Treasury and Corporate Other also charges (credits) an internal cost of funds for assets held in (or pays for funding provided by) each business segment. The process for determining FTP is based on a number of factors and assumptions, including prevailing market interest rates, the expected lives of various assets and liabilities, and the Company's broader funding profile.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, Synovus strategically repositioned the investment securities portfolio, which resulted in net gains of million in the Treasury and Corporate Other segment.

 (g) Recapitalization . In the event that Executive receives, with respect to RSUs, any securities or other property (other than cash dividends) as a result of any stock dividend or split, spin-off, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, combination or exchange of shares or a similar corporate change, any such securities or other property received by Executive will likewise be held by Fidelity and be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and will be included in the term RSUs.

 Exhibit 14 

 Synovus Financial Corp. 
 Code of Business Conduct and Ethics 
 
 Table of Contents Purpose 1 Scope 1 Policy 1 Responsibilities 8 Enforcement 9 Review and Revision 9 
 
 Purpose 
 Pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and compliance standards of the New York Stock Exchange and the Securities and Exchange Commission, Synovus Financial Corp. and its subsidiaries (the Company have established the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the Code to cover a wide range of business practices and procedures. 
 
 Scope 
 This Code outlines basic principles to guide all employees and officers of the Company team members ). In addition, all members of the Company s Board of Directors (as well as local advisory directors) directors ), in regard to their Company duties, are responsible for conducting themselves in compliance with the applicable provisions of this Code. The Company desires to engage in and promote honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships, and to comply with all applicable laws. Team members and directors must conduct themselves accordingly and seek to avoid even the appearance of improper conduct. The Code will be provided to all team members and directors and should also be provided to the Company s agents and representatives, including business partners, vendors and consultants. 
 
 This Code of Business Conduct and Ethics has been developed broadly in order to be applicable to the entire Synovus family of companies. Many of our individual companies may also have their own, more specific Codes which will provide team members more detail. If the two Codes have similar provisions, team member conduct will be governed by the more restrictive provision. 
 If a local, state or national law conflicts with any policy in this Code, team members and directors must comply with the law however, if a local custom or policy conflicts with this Code, team members and directors must comply with the Code. 
 
 Policy 
 
 1. Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations 
 
 Obeying the law, both in letter and in spirit, is the foundation on which this Company s ethical standards are built. The financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation by a number of federal and state agencies responsible for the administration and enforcement of a variety of important statutes. The Company is committed to full compliance with these statutes and the rules and regulations promulgated under them by the regulatory agencies. The Company will abide by the highest standards of integrity in our interaction with these agencies. All team members and directors must respect and obey the laws and all applicable rules and 

regulations of the cities, states and countries in which the Company operates. Although team members are not expected to know the details of each law, it is important to know enough to determine when to seek advice from supervisors, managers or other appropriate personnel. 
 
 This Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and additional information is available to every team member online through the Team Member Guide as well as made available to new team members during their orientation. 
 
 2. Conflicts of Interest 
 
 All team members and directors should avoid any action or interest that conflicts or gives the appearance of a conflict with the Company s interests. A conflict of interest exists when a person s private interest interferes in any way with the interests of the Company. A conflict situation can arise when a team member or director takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or her Company work objectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest may also arise when a team member or director, or a member of his or her family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or her position in the Company. 
 
 It is almost always a conflict of interest for a team member to work simultaneously for a competitor, customer or supplier. Team members are not allowed to work for a competitor as an employee, a consultant or a board member. Team members generally should avoid any direct or indirect business connection with the Company s customers, suppliers or competitors, except on behalf of the Company. For this purpose, business connection excludes the retail purchase of consumer goods at prices available to the general public and the ownership of investments of less than 1 of the outstanding equity securities of a publicly-traded company. 
 
 Conflicts of interest are prohibited as a matter of Company policy. Conflicts of interest may not always be straightforward. Team members or directors who have questions about potential areas of conflict should consult their supervisor or the Company s General Counsel s Office, as appropriate. 
 
 For more information, please refer to the Conflict and Your Job section of the Team Member Guide . 
 
 If you are aware of a conflict or potential conflict, you should bring it to the attention of your supervisor, manager or other appropriate personnel or consult the procedures described in Section 12 of this Code. 
 
 3. Insider Trading 
 
 Team members and directors who have access to confidential information are not permitted to use or share that information for stock trading purposes or for any other purpose except the conduct of the Company s business. All non-public information about the Company, its customers, business partners and vendors should be considered confidential information. To use non-public information for personal financial benefit or to tip others who might make an investment decision on the basis of this information is not only unethical but also illegal. The Company s Board of Directors has adopted an Insider Trading Policy that should be reviewed by all team members and directors. Team members or directors who have questions regarding insider trading should consult the Company s General Counsel s Office. 
 
 For more information, please refer to the Insider Trading section of the Team Member Guide . 

4. Corporate Opportunities 
 
 Team members and directors are prohibited from taking for themselves personally, opportunities that are discovered through the use of corporate property, information or position. No team member or director may use corporate property, information, or position for improper personal gain, and no team member or director may compete with the Company directly or indirectly. Team members and directors have a responsibility to the Company to advance its legitimate interests when the opportunity to do so arises. 
 
 5. Competition and Fair Dealing 
 
 This Company seeks to outperform its competition fairly and honestly. The Company seeks competitive advantages through superior performance, never through unethical or illegal business practices. Stealing proprietary information, possessing trade secret information that was obtained without the owner s consent, or inducing such disclosures by past or present employees of other companies is prohibited. Each team member and director should endeavor to respect and deal fairly with the Company s customers, suppliers, competitors and their employees. No team member or director should take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts, or any other intentional unfair-dealing practice. 
 
 The purpose of business entertainment and gifts in a business setting is to create good will and sound working relationships, not to gain unfair advantage with customers. No gift or entertainment should ever be offered, given, provided or accepted by any Company team member, family member of a team member or agent unless it (1) is not a cash gift, (2) is consistent with customary business practices, (3) is not excessive in value, (4) cannot be construed as a bribe or payoff, and (5) does not violate any laws or regulations. 
 
 For more information, please refer to the Dealing Ethically with Customers and Suppliers and the Gifts and Gratuities sections of the Team Member Guide . 
 
 Please discuss with your supervisor any gifts or proposed gifts that you are not certain are appropriate. 
 
 6. Record-Keeping, Accounting, Auditing and Disclosure 
 
 The Company requires honest and accurate recording and reporting of information. 
 
 The Company has established internal control standards and procedures to ensure that assets are protected and properly used and that financial records and reports are accurate and reliable. All team members and directors share responsibility for maintaining and complying with required internal controls. 
 
 All financial reports, accounting records, auditing records, public disclosures, research reports, expense accounts, timesheets and other similar documents must accurately and clearly represent the relevant facts or the true nature of the transactions memorialized therein. Improper, fraudulent or misleading accounting, documentation or financial reporting is contrary to the Company s policy and may be in violation of applicable laws. 
 
 Records should always be retained or discarded according to the Company s record retention policies. In accordance with these policies, in the event of litigation or governmental investigation, consult the Company s General Counsel s Office. 

Please see the procedures described in Section 13 of this Code to report complaints about the Company s accounting, internal controls or auditing matters or concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters. You can report your concerns anonymously or confidentially. 
 
 7. Confidentiality 
 
 Team members and directors must maintain the confidentiality of confidential information entrusted to them by the Company or its customers, except when disclosure is authorized by the General Counsel s Office or required by laws or regulations. Confidential information includes all non-public information that might be of use to competitors, or harmful to the Company or its customers, if disclosed. It also includes information that suppliers and customers have entrusted to the Company as well as team member information. Team members and directors may access and use such confidential and proprietary business information, including information gained while performing their job duties and responsibilities, only for legitimate business purposes and under no circumstances for their personal gain or benefit or to the detriment of the Company. The obligation to preserve confidential information continues even after employment ends. 
 
 For more information, please refer to the Confidentiality section of the Team Member Guide . 
 
 8. Protection and Proper Use of Company Assets 
 
 All team members and directors should endeavor to protect the Company s assets and ensure their efficient use. Theft, carelessness and waste have a direct impact on the Company s profitability. Any suspected incident of fraud or theft should be immediately reported for investigation. Company equipment should not be used for non-Company business, though incidental personal use may be permitted. 
 
 The obligation of team members and directors to protect the Company s assets includes its proprietary information. Proprietary information includes intellectual property such as trade secrets, patents, trademarks and copyrights, as well as business, marketing and service plans, designs, databases, records, salary information and any unpublished financial data and reports. Unauthorized use or distribution of this information violates Company policy. It could also be illegal and result in civil or even criminal penalties. 
 
 9. Restrictions on Political Expenditures and Gifts No Payments to Government Personnel 
 
 Company resources may be used to make political contributions or for other political purposes only if permitted by law and authorized by the Company s Executive Management. 
 
 The U.S. government has a number of laws and regulations regarding business gratuities that may be accepted by U.S. government personnel. The promise, offer or delivery to an official or employee of the U.S. government of a gift, favor or other gratuity in violation of these rules not only violates Company policy but could also be a criminal offense. State and local governments, as well as foreign governments, may have similar rules. The Company General Counsel s Office can provide guidance in this area. 
 
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits giving anything of value, directly or indirectly, to officials of foreign governments or foreign political candidates in order to obtain or retain 

business or secure an improper advantage. It is strictly prohibited to make illegal payments to government officials of any country. 
 
 For more information, please refer to the Foreign Practices section of the Team Member Guide . 
 
 10. Fair Dealing with Team Members 
 
 The Company believes that its strong reputation in the financial services industry is a direct result of the loyalty, commitment and efforts of its team members. The Company endeavors to provide team members with a positive and satisfying environment in which to work. Respect for colleagues and appreciation of the value of individuality are recognized as essential elements of a successful workplace. Open communication is encouraged at all levels. Discrimination or harassment based on age, race, creed, color, national origin, sex, gender, pregnancy, sexual orientation, marital status, religion, veteran status, gender identity, disability, citizenship, military service or obligation, genetic information or on any other basis prohibited by law is not tolerated . 
 
 For more information, please refer to the Our Commitment to You section of the Team Member Guide. 
 
 11. Waivers of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics 
 
 Any waiver of this Code for team members or directors may be made only by the Board of Directors or the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board. Any such request for a waiver shall be in writing and shall be filed with the General Counsel s Office at least 45 days before the meeting of the Board of Directors or the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board at which such request is to be considered. Any such waiver will be promptly disclosed as required by law or stock exchange or other applicable regulation.

In addition, any team member or other individual who participates in an investigation of such conduct is also protected from retaliation. For purposes of this policy, retaliation shall mean any direct or indirect detrimental action against an individual because they engaged in an activity protected by law or by the Code or this policy, including but not limited to termination of employment, discriminatory employment treatment, demotion, suspension, threats or harassment.

 13. Compliance Procedures 
 
 General 
 
 It is every team member s and director s responsibility to ensure prompt and consistent action against violations of this Code. However, in some situations it is difficult to know right from wrong. Since this Code cannot anticipate every situation that will arise, it is important to have a way to approach new questions or problems. The following are steps to keep in mind 
 
 Make sure you have all the facts . In order to reach the right solutions, you must be as fully informed as possible. 
 
 Ask yourself What specifically am I being asked to do Does it seem unethical or improper This will enable you to focus on the specific question you are faced with and the alternatives you have. Use your judgment and common sense if something seems unethical or improper, it probably is. 

Clarify your responsibility and role . In most situations, there is shared responsibility. Are your colleagues informed It may help to get others involved and discuss the problem. 
 
 Discuss the problem with your supervisor . This is the basic guidance for all situations. In many cases, your supervisor will be more knowledgeable about the question and will appreciate being brought into the decision-making process. Remember that, although your supervisor cannot waive the provisions of this Code, it is your supervisor s responsibility to help solve problems including, if appropriate, seeking additional assistance from other Company resources. 
 
 Seek help from other Company resources . In cases where it may not be appropriate to discuss an issue with your supervisor, where your supervisor is not sure of the answers to your questions, or where you do not feel comfortable approaching your supervisor with your questions, discuss it with the Company s Human Resources area. If that also is not appropriate, or if you wish to remain anonymous, call (800) 240-1242, the Company s toll-free Helpline. The Helpline is administered by Navex Global, formerly Pinkerton, an independent, third party administrator who assigns your call a unique identification number that you can refer to during any follow-up calls. The Helpline is staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week for your convenience. 
 
 You may report ethical violations in confidence and without fear of retaliation . If you want your identity to be kept secret, your anonymity will be protected. However, in some circumstances the Company may not be able to conduct an effective investigation should you choose to remain anonymous. The Company does not permit retaliation of any kind against team members for good faith reports of suspected violations of the Code or any Company policy or legal requirement. 
 
 Always ask first, act later . If you are unsure of what to do in any situation, seek guidance before you act . 
 
 Accounting, Internal Controls or Auditing Matters 
 
 You may report complaints about the Company s accounting, internal controls or auditing matters or concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters to the Audit Committee by contacting the General Counsel s Office, or if you wish to remain anonymous, by calling the Company s toll free Helpline at (800) 240-1242. 
 
 All complaints will be referred to members of Synovus Audit Committee of the Board.
