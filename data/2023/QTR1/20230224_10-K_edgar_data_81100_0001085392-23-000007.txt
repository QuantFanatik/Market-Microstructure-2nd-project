PART I 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

General 
 Puget Energy is an energy services holding company incorporated in the state of Washington in 1999. Substantially all of its operations are conducted through its regulated subsidiary, Puget Sound Energy, Inc. (PSE), a utility company. Puget Energy also has a wholly-owned, non-regulated subsidiary, Puget LNG, LLC (Puget LNG), which was formed in 2016 and has the sole purpose of owning, developing and financing the non-regulated activity of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility at the Port of Tacoma, Washington. 
 Puget Energy is owned through a holding company structure by Puget Holdings, LLC (Puget Holdings). All of Puget Energy's common stock is indirectly owned by Puget Holdings. Puget Holdings is owned by a consortium of long-term infrastructure investors including the British Columbia Investment Management Corporation (BCIMC), the Alberta Investment Management Corporation (AIMCo), Ontario Municipal Employee Retirement System (OMERS), PGGM Vermogensbeheer B.V., Macquarie Washington Clean Energy Investment, L.P., and Ontario Teachers Pension Plan Board. Puget Energy and PSE are collectively referred to herein as the Company. 
 
 Corporate Strategy 
 Puget Energy is the direct parent company of PSE, the oldest and largest electric and natural gas utility headquartered in the state of Washington, primarily engaged in the business of electric transmission, distribution and generation and natural gas distribution. Puget Energy s business strategy is to generate stable earnings and cash flow by offering reliable electric and natural gas service in a cost-effective manner through PSE, and be the clean energy provider of choice for its customers. 
 
 Customers and Revenue Overview 
 PSE is a public utility incorporated in the state of Washington in 1960. PSE furnishes electric and natural gas service in a territory covering approximately 6,000 square miles, principally in the Puget Sound region. 
 The following table presents the number of PSE customers for electric and natural gas as of December 31, 2022 and 2021:

 1,217 1,203 1.2 872 865 0.8 
 _______________ 
 1 At December 31, 2022, and 2021, approximately 423,382 and 419,437 customers purchased both electricity and natural gas from PSE, respectively. 
 
 PSE's revenues and associated expenses are not generated evenly throughout the year, primarily due to seasonal weather patterns, varying wholesale prices for electricity and the amount of hydroelectric energy supplies available to PSE, which make quarter-to-quarter comparisons difficult. Weather conditions in PSE's service territory have an impact on customer energy usage and affect PSE's billed revenue and energy supply expenses. While both PSE's electric and natural gas sales are generally greatest during winter months, variations in energy usage by customers occur from season to season and also month to month within a season, primarily as result of weather conditions. PSE normally experiences its highest retail energy sales, and corresponding higher power costs, during the winter heating season in the first and fourth quarters of the year and its lowest sales and corresponding lower power costs in the third quarter of the year. While fluctuations in weather conditions will continue to affect PSE's billed revenue and energy supply expenses from month to month, PSE's decoupling mechanisms for electric and natural gas operations are expected to normalize the impact of weather on operating revenue and net income. 
 7 

Under the decoupling mechanism, the Washington Commission allows PSE to record a monthly adjustment to its electric and natural gas operating revenues related to electric transmission and distribution, natural gas operations and general administrative costs from residential, commercial and industrial customers. For additional information, see Business, "Regulation and Rates" included in Item 1 of this report and Note 4, "Regulation and Rates" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 The following tables present PSE's capital expenditures for the five-year period ended December 31, 2022, and gross utility plant by category and percentages as of December 31, 2022:

Regulation and Rates 
 PSE is subject to the regulatory authority of the following: (i) the FERC with respect to the transmission of electricity, the sale of electricity at wholesale, accounting and certain other matters; and (ii) the Washington Commission as to retail rates, accounting, the issuance of securities and certain other matters. PSE also must comply with mandatory electric system reliability standards developed by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), the electric reliability organization certified by the FERC, whose standards are enforced by the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) in PSE s operating territory. 
 Rate mechanisms include: (i) trackers that typically track specific costs during the previous twelve-month period and (ii) riders that project cost recovery during a forward-looking twelve-month period. Both allow recovery of expenditures outside the process of a full general rate case (GRC).

 General Rate Case Filing 
 PSE filed a GRC which includes a three-year multiyear rate plan with the Washington Commission on January 31, 2022, requesting an overall increase in electric and natural gas rates of 13.6 and 13.0 respectively in 2023; 2.5 and 2.3 , respectively in 2024; and 1.2 and 1.8 , respectively, in 2025. PSE requested a return on equity of 9.9 in all three rate years. PSE requested an overall rate of return of 7.39 in 2023; 7.44 in 2024; and 7.49 in 2025. The filing requests recovery of forecasted plant additions through 2022 as required by Revised Code of Washington (RCW) 80.28.425 as well as forecasted plant additions through 2025, the final year of the multiyear rate plan. In August 2022, three separate partial multiparty settlement agreements were reached. For further details regarding the partial settlement agreements, see Management's Discussion and Analysis, "Regulation of PSE Rates and Recovery of PSE Costs" included in Item 7 of this report. On January 6, 2023, the Washington Commission approved PSE s natural gas rates with an overall increase of 70.8 million or 6.40 in 2023 and 19.5 million or 1.65 in 2024, with the effective date of January 7, 2023. Furthermore, on January 10, 2023, the Washington Commission approved PSE s electric rates with an overall increase of 247.0 million or 10.75 in 2023 and 33.1 million or 1.33 in 2024, with an effective date of January 11, 2023. 
 PSE filed a GRC with the Washington Commission on June 20, 2019, requesting an overall increase in electric and natural gas rates of 6.9 and 7.9 respectively. On July 8, 2020, the Washington Commission issued its order on PSE s 2019 GRC. The ruling provided for a weighted cost of capital of 7.39 or 6.8 after-tax, and a capital structure of 48.5 in common equity with a return on equity of 9.4 . The order also resulted in a combined net increase to electric of 29.5 million, or 1.6 , and to natural gas of 36.5 million, or 4.0 . However, the Washington Commission extended the amortization of certain regulatory assets, PSE s electric decoupling deferral, and PSE s PGA deferral to mitigate the impact of the rate increase in response to the economic uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic. This reduced the electric revenue increase to approximately 0.9 million, or 0.05 and the natural gas increase to 1.3 million, or 0.2 and became effective October 15, 2020 and October 1, 2020, respectively. 
 In July 2021, PSE received a Private Letter Ruling (PLR) from the IRS which concluded that in the 2019 GRC the Washington Commission s methodology for reversing plant-related excess deferred income taxes was an impermissible methodology under the IRS normalization and consistency rules. The PLR required adjustments to PSE's rates to bring PSE back into compliance with IRS rules. In September 2021, the Washington Commission amended its order in accordance with the PLR. The annualized overall rate impact was an increase of 15.8 million, or 0.7 , for electric and 3.1 million, or 0.3 , for natural gas for a total of 18.9 million with rates effective October 1, 2021. This led to a combined annualized net increase to electric rates of 77.1 million, or 3.7 , an increase of 17.5 million above the 59.6 million granted in the revised final order. The order also led to a combined annualized net increase to natural gas rates of 45.3 million, or 5.9 , an increase of 2.4 million above the 42.9 million granted in the revised final order. The Washington Commission maintained adjustments that mitigated the impacts of the rate increases in response to the economic instability created by the COVID-19 pandemic, which reduced the electric revenue increase to approximately 48.3 million, or 2.3 , and the natural gas increase to 4.9 million, or 0.6 .

Power Cost Only Rate Case 
 A power cost only rate case (PCORC) is a limited-scope proceeding to reset power cost rates. In addition to providing the opportunity to reset all power costs, the PCORC proceeding also provides for timely review of new resource acquisition costs and inclusion of such costs in rates at the time the new resource goes into service. To achieve this objective, the Washington Commission is not required to but historically has used an expedited six-month PCORC decision timeline rather than the statutory 11-month timeline for a GRC. In the 2022 GRC settlement, which the Washington Commission accepted with conditions, PSE agreed not to file a PCORC during 2023 and 2024, the two-year rate plan agreed to in the GRC settlement. Per the 2022 GRC Final Order in Docket No. UE-220066, PCORC rates were set to zero as of January 11, 2023. 
 
 Revenue Decoupling Adjustment Mechanism 
 While fluctuations in weather conditions will continue to affect PSE's billed revenue and energy supply expenses from month to month, PSE's decoupling mechanisms assist in mitigating the impact of weather on operating revenue and net income. The Washington Commission has allowed PSE to record a monthly adjustment to its electric and natural gas operating revenues related to electric transmission and distribution, natural gas operations and general administrative costs and fixed production costs from most residential, commercial and industrial customers to mitigate the effects of abnormal weather, conservation impacts and changes in usage patterns per customer. As a result, these electric and natural gas revenues are recovered on a per customer basis regardless of actual consumption levels. PSE's energy supply costs, which are part of the power cost adjustment (PCA) and PGA mechanisms, are not included in the decoupling mechanism. The revenue recorded under the decoupling mechanisms will be affected by customer growth and not actual consumption except for fixed production costs, which are held at the level of cost from the most recent rate proceeding and are not impacted by customer growth. Following each calendar year, PSE will recover from, or refund to, customers the difference between allowed decoupling revenue and the corresponding actual revenue during the following May to April time period. For further details regarding decoupling filings, see Note 4, "Regulation and Rates" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. 
 
 Electric Rate Filings 
 Colstrip Adjustment Rider 
 This schedule implements surcharges and/or credits to collect or pass back the costs incurred or benefits realized associated with Colstrip Power Plant Units 1 2 and 3 4 as authorized in Washington Commission Docket No. UE-220066. Beginning in 2026, only decommissioning and remediation related costs will be included in this Schedule in compliance with the CETA. 
 
 Energy Charge Credit Recovery Adjustment 
 This schedule implements a surcharge to recover certain costs incurred under the electric Schedule 139 Voluntary Long Term Renewable Energy Purchase Rider as authorized in Washington Commission Docket No. UE-220066. The surcharge in this schedule will be updated with each filing that revises the Schedule 139 Energy Charge Credit. 
 
 Rates Not Subject to Refund Rate Adjustment 
 The purpose of this schedule is to recover costs approved during a multiyear rate plan period that are not subject to refund and that are above the level of base rates set in the multiyear rate plan as authorized in Washington Commission Docket No. UE-220066. 
 
 Rates Subject to Refund Rate Adjustment 
 The purpose of this schedule is to charge customers the provisionally approved rates subject to refund approved in a multiyear rate plan, for property granted provisional approval for recovery as authorized in Washington Commission Docket No. UE-220066. PSE will file with the Washington Commission an annual review filing by March 31st each year. 
 
 Transportation Electrification Plan Adjustment Rider 
 This schedule implements surcharges to collect costs incurred associated with the implementation of the Company s Transportation Electrification Plan, and specifically the products and services offered under Schedules 551, 552, 553, 554, 555, 556, 557, 558, 559 and 583. 
 
 Conservation Service Rider 
 The electric conservation rider collects revenue to cover the costs incurred in providing services and programs for conservation. Rates change annually on May 1 to collect the annual budget that started the prior January and to true-up for actual compared to forecast conservation expenditures from the prior year, as well as actual compared to the forecasted load set in rates. 
 
 10 

Federal Incentive Tracker 
 The Federal Incentive Tracker passes through to customers the benefits associated with the wind-related treasury grants. The filing results in a credit back to customers for pass-back of treasury grant amortization and pass-through of interest and any related true-ups. The filing is adjusted annually for new federal benefits, actual versus forecast interest and to true-up for actual load being different than the forecasted load set in rates. Rates change annually on January 1. 
 
 Low Income Program 
 The Low Income Tracker Tariff recovers changes in costs for the low income bill payment assistance program (as approved in Washington Commission Docket No. UE-011570). The annual filing requests these changes through the existing low income program funding mechanism previously approved by the Washington Commission. The mechanism allows PSE to periodically adjust its electric and natural gas rates to reflect changes in actual sales and costs. Rates change annually on October 1. Included in the electric rate effective October 1, 2022, is the recovery of 25.6 million from the COVID-19 bill assistance program established in Docket No. U-200281 and deferred under the accounting petition approved in Docket No. UE-200780. 
 
 Power Cost Adjustment Clause 
 PSE updated its Schedule 95 rates in the Power Cost Adjustment Clause tariff to reflect the transition fee as required by Section 12 of the Special Contract, a non-prescribed commercial/industrial rate contract. Additionally, Schedule 95 rates also include portions of fixed power cost adjustments per the allowed decoupling rate re-allocation resulting from a Special Contract customer becoming a transportation customer as well as small variable power cost adjustments. 
 
 Power Cost Adjustment Mechanism 
 PSE currently has a PCA mechanism that provides for the deferral of power costs that vary from the power cost baseline level of power costs. The power cost baseline levels are set, in part, based on normalized assumptions about weather and hydroelectric conditions. Excess power costs or savings are apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to the graduated scale set forth in the PCA mechanism and will trigger a surcharge or refund when the cumulative deferral trigger is reached. 
 
 Effective January 1, 2017, the following graduated scale is used in the PCA mechanism: 
 
 Company's Share 
 Customers Share Annual Power Cost Variability Over 
 Under 
 Over 
 Under Over or Under Collected by up to 17 million 100 
 100 
 
 Over or Under Collected by between 17 million - 40 million 35 
 50 
 65 
 50 Over or Under Collected beyond 40 + million 10 
 10 
 90 
 90 
 
 Property Tax Tracker 
 The purpose of the property tax tracker is to pass through the cost of all property taxes incurred by the Company. The mechanism acts as a tracker rate schedule and collects the total amount of property taxes assessed. The tracker is adjusted each year in May based on that year's assessed property taxes and true-up from the prior year. 
 
 Residential and Farm Energy Exchange Benefit 
 The residential exchange program passes through the residential exchange program benefits that PSE receives from the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA). Rates change biennially on October 1. 
 
 Natural Gas Rate Filings 
 Distribution Pipeline Provisional Recovery Adjustment 
 This schedule implements surcharges in order to defer the revenues associated with the provisional recovery of 30 million for the four miles of distribution pipe to support proper allocation of the investments in a later filing as authorized in Washington Commission Docket No. UG-220067. 
 
 11 

Rates Not Subject to Refund Rate Adjustment 
 The purpose of this schedule is to recover costs approved during a multiyear rate plan period that are not subject to refund and that are above the level of base rates set in the multiyear rate plan as authorized in Washington Commission Docket No. UG-220067. 
 
 Rates Subject to Refund Rate Adjustment 
 The purpose of this schedule is to charge customers the provisionally approved rates subject to refund approved in a multiyear rate plan, for property granted provisional approval for recovery as authorized in Washington Commission Docket No. UG-220067. 
 
 Natural gas rate filings 
 Conservation Service Rider 
 The natural gas conservation rider collects revenue to cover the costs incurred in providing services and programs for conservation. Rates change annually on May 1 to collect the annual budget that started the prior January and to true-up for actual compared to forecast conservation expenditures from the prior year, as well as actual compared to the forecasted load set in rates. 
 
 Cost Recovery Mechanism for Pipeline Replacement 
 The purpose of the cost recovery mechanism (CRM) is to recover costs related to projects included in PSE's pipeline replacement program plan on file with the Washington Commission with the intended effect of enhancing the safety of the natural gas distribution system. Rates change annually on November 1. In its 2022 GRC, PSE requested and the Washington Commission approved the recovery of its natural gas CRM investments in the multiyear rate plan. Effective January 7, 2023 PSE will no longer use the CRM annual filing to recover these pipeline replacement program investments. 
 
 Property Tax Tracker 
 The purpose of the property tax tracker mechanism is to pass through the cost of all property taxes incurred by the Company. The mechanism removed property taxes from general rates and included those costs for recovery in an adjusting tariff rate. After the implementation, the mechanism acts as a tracker rate schedule and collects the total amount of property taxes assessed. The tracker is adjusted each year in May based on that year's assessed property taxes and true-up from the prior year. 
 
 Purchased Gas Adjustment 
 PSE has a PGA mechanism that allows PSE to recover expected natural gas supply and transportation costs and defer, as a receivable or liability, any natural gas supply and transportation costs that exceed or fall short of this expected natural gas cost amount in PGA mechanism rates, including accrued interest. PSE is authorized by the Washington Commission to accrue carrying costs on PGA receivable and payable balances. A receivable or payable balance in the PGA mechanism reflects an under recovery or over recovery, respectively, of natural gas cost through the PGA mechanism. Rates typically change annually on November 1, although out-of-cycle rate changes are allowed at other times of the year if needed. 
 
 For additional information on electric and natural gas rates, see Management's Discussion and Analysis, "Regulation of PSE Rates and Recovery of PSE Costs" included in Item 7 of this report.

Electric Supply 
 At December 31, 2022, PSE s electric power resources, which include company-owned or controlled resources as well as those under long-term contract, had a total capacity of approximately 6,565 megawatts (MW). In order to meet an extreme winter peak load, PSE may supplement its electric power resources with winter-peaking call options and other instruments. When it is more economical for PSE to purchase power than to operate its own generation facilities, PSE will purchase spot market energy when sufficient transmission capacity is available. 
 The following table shows PSE s electric energy supply resources and energy production for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021: Peak Power Resources At December 31, Energy Production At December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 MW MW MWh MWh Purchased resources: Columbia River PUD contracts 1

Columbia River Electric Energy Supply Contracts 
 During 2022, approximately 16.4 of PSE s energy supply was obtained through long-term contracts with three Washington Public Utility Districts (PUDs) that own and operate hydroelectric projects on the Columbia River (Mid-Columbia). PSE s payments are not contingent upon the projects being operable. 
 For the year ended, December 31, 2022, PSE's portion of the power output of the PUDs projects are set forth below: Company s Annual Share (Approximate) Project Contract Expiration Year License Expiration Year Percent of Output MW Capacity Chelan County PUD: Rock Island Project 2031 2029 30.0 187 Rocky Reach Project 2031 2052 30.0 390 Douglas County PUD: Wells Project 2028 2052 26.4 222 Grant County PUD: Priest Rapids Development 2052 2052 4.8 45 Wanapum Development 2052 2052 4.8 52 Total 896 

Other Electric Supply, Exchange and Transmission Contracts and Agreements 
 PSE purchases electric energy under long-term firm purchased power contracts with other utilities and marketers in the Western region. PSE is generally not obligated to make payments under these contracts unless power is delivered. PSE also has an agreement with Pacific Gas Electric Company (PG E) for 300 MW of seasonal capacity exchange which, on November 14, 2022, PSE submitted a notice of termination with an effective date of December 31, 2027. During and since emerging from its 2001-2004 and 2019-2020 bankruptcy proceedings, PG E delivered on the energy exchange contract and has continued to meet the exchange contract through its current bankruptcy proceedings. 
 PSE began participating in the Energy Imbalance Market (EIM) operated by the California Independent System Operator on October 1, 2016. PSE has committed up to 450 MW of existing BPA transmission for the EIM market. Participation has resulted in reduced costs for PSE customers of approximately 31.1 million in year ended December 31, 2022, enhanced system reliability, integration of variable energy resources, and geographic diversity of electricity demand and generation resources. The calculated benefits represent the annual cost savings of the EIM dispatch compared with a counter-factual dispatch without the EIM. Benefits can take the form of cost savings or revenues or their combination. Benefits include greenhouse gases (GHG) revenue, transfer revenues and flexible ramping revenues. 
 PSE has entered into multiple various-term transmission contracts with other utilities to integrate electric generation and contracted resources into PSE s system. These transmission contracts require PSE to pay for transmission service based on the contracted MW level of demand, regardless of actual use. Other transmission agreements provide actual capacity ownership or capacity ownership rights. PSE s annual charges under these agreements are also based on contracted MW volumes. Capacity on these agreements that is not committed to serve PSE s load is available for sale to third parties. PSE also purchases short-term transmission services from a variety of providers, including the BPA. 
 In 2022, PSE had 5,007 MW and 595 MW of total transmission demand contracted with the BPA and other utilities, respectively. PSE s remaining transmission capacity needs are met via PSE owned transmission assets. 

Natural Gas Supply for Electric Customers 
 PSE purchases natural gas supplies for its power portfolio to meet electrical demand through gas-fired generation. Supplies range from long-term to daily agreements, as turbine fueling varies depending on market heat rates. Purchases are made from a diverse group of major and independent natural gas producers and marketers in the United States and Canada. PSE also enters into financial hedges to manage the cost of natural gas. PSE utilizes natural gas storage capacity and transportation that is dedicated to and paid for by the power portfolio to facilitate increased natural gas supply reliability and intra-day dispatch of PSE s natural gas-fired generation resources. 
 17 

The following table presents the volumes of natural gas for power inventory value as of December 31, 2022 and 2021: 
 At December 31, 2022 2021 Natural gas volumes for power in storage at year end, therms (thousands): Jackson Prairie 5,450 5,237 Plymouth LNG (in LNG form) 1,223 1,552 

Integrated Resource Plans, Resource Acquisition and Development 
 The 2021 Integrated Resource Plan marked a major departure from past Integrated Resource Plans (IRP) due in large part to the passage of CETA. The new electric progress report rules, Washington Administrative Code 480-100-625 Integrated Resource Plan Development and Timing, outlines the requirements for this report. The two-year progress report must be filed at least every two years after the utility files it s IRP. The final 2023 Electric Progress Report will be filed March 31, 2023. For the draft 2023 Progress Report, the cumulative capacity need by year, the capacity shortfalls and surpluses are: 
 
 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Projected MW shortfall/(surplus) (200) 174 465 1,336 1,848 
 
 PSE s current transmission portfolio includes approximately 1,500 MW of firm transmission rights that deliver energy from the Mid Columbia trading hub to the PSE load center. Due to growing regional concerns pertaining to capacity within the short-term market, PSE will phase out its reliance on firm short-term market purchases by over 200 MW per year starting in 2024 until PSE reaches zero reliance by 2029. With the expected elimination of Colstrip units 3 4 from PSE s energy supply portfolio starting in 2026, which removes approximately 370 MW of capacity, and the expiration of PSE s 380 MW coal-transition contract with TransAlta when the Centralia coal plant is retired at the end of 2025, the projected capacity shortfall of 174 MW in 2024 increases to 1,336 MW and 1,848 MW by 2026 and 2027, respectively. The expected capacity needs reflect the mix of energy efficiency programs deemed cost effective in the 2023 Progress Report. As part of the Washington CETA, PSE must achieve sales with renewable or non-emitting resources of at least 80 by 2030 and 100 by 2045. 
 On February 10, 2023 the FERC approved a voluntary regional resource adequacy program that PSE plans to participate in along with other utilities in the Western United States and Canada. The program is intended to help the region anticipate its future power supply needs as natural gas-fired and coal power plants retire and are replaced by variable renewable energy resources such as wind and solar.

NATURAL GAS FOR NATURAL GAS CUSTOMERS AND ELECTRIC CUSTOMERS 
 Natural Gas Supply for Natural Gas Customers 
 PSE purchases a portfolio of natural gas supplies ranging from long-term firm to daily from a diverse group of major and independent natural gas producers and marketers in the United States and Canada (British Columbia and Alberta). PSE also enters into physical and financial hedges to manage volatility in the cost of natural gas. All of PSE s natural gas supply is ultimately transported through the facilities of Northwest Pipeline, LLC (NWP), the sole interstate pipeline delivering directly into PSE s service territory. Accordingly, delivery of natural gas supply to PSE s natural gas system is dependent upon the reliable operations of NWP. 
 For base load, peak management and supply reliability purposes, PSE supplements its firm natural gas supply portfolio by purchasing natural gas in periods of lower demand, injecting it into underground storage facilities and withdrawing it during periods of high demand or reduced supply. Underground storage facilities at Jackson Prairie in western Washington and at Clay Basin in Utah are used for this purpose. Clay Basin withdrawals are used to supplement purchases from the U.S. Rocky Mountain supply region, while Jackson Prairie provides incremental peak-day resources utilizing firm storage redelivery transportation capacity. Jackson Prairie is also used for daily balancing of load requirements on PSE s natural gas system. Peaking needs are also met by using PSE-owned natural gas held in PSE s Tacoma LNG peaking facility and the Gig Harbor satellite LNG peaking facility, both located within its distribution system; as well as interrupting service to customers on interruptible service rates, if necessary. 
 PSE expects to meet its firm peak-day requirements for residential, commercial and industrial markets through its firm natural gas purchase contracts, firm transportation capacity, firm storage capacity and other firm peaking resources. PSE believes it will be able to acquire incremental firm natural gas supply and transportation capacity to meet anticipated growth in the requirements of its firm customers for the foreseeable future. 
 PSE s firm natural gas supply portfolio has flexibility in its transportation arrangements to enable it to achieve savings when there are regional price differentials between natural gas supply basins. The geographic mix of suppliers and daily, monthly and annual take requirements permit some degree of flexibility in managing natural gas supplies during periods of lower demand to minimize costs. Natural gas is marketed outside of PSE s service territory (off-system sales) to optimize resources when on-system customer demand requirements permit and market economics are favorable; the resulting economics of these transactions are reflected in PSE s natural gas customer tariff rates through the PGA mechanism. 
 
 Natural Gas Storage Capacity 
 PSE holds storage capacity in the Jackson Prairie and Clay Basin underground natural gas storage facilities adjacent to NWP s pipeline to serve PSE s natural gas customers. The Jackson Prairie facility is operated and one-third owned by PSE, and is used primarily for intermediate peaking purposes due to its ability to deliver a large volume of natural gas in a short time period. Combined with capacity contracted from NWP s one-third stake in Jackson Prairie, PSE holds firm withdrawal capacity of 453,800 Dekatherm (Dth) per day, and over 9.8 million Dth of storage capacity at the Jackson Prairie facility. Of this total, PSE designates 397,100 Dth per day of the firm withdrawal capacity and over 9.2 million Dth of storage capacity to serve natural gas customers. The location of the Jackson Prairie facility in PSE s market area increases supply reliability and provides significant pipeline demand cost savings by reducing the amount of annual pipeline capacity required to meet peak-day natural gas requirements. 
 Of the remaining Jackson Prairie storage capacity, 56,700 Dth per day of firm withdrawal capacity and 640,600 Dth of storage capacity is currently designated to PSE's power portfolio, increasing natural gas supply reliability and facilitating intra-day dispatch of PSE's natural gas-fired generation resources. 
 The Clay Basin storage facility is a supply area storage facility that provides operational flexibility and price protection. PSE holds 12.9 million Dth of Clay Basin storage capacity and approximately 107,400 Dth per day of firm withdrawal capacity under two long-term contracts with remaining terms of five years and has rights to extend such agreements. 
 
 LNG and Propane-Air Resources 
 LNG and propane-air resources provide firm natural gas supply on short notice for short periods of time. Due to their typically high cost and slow cycle times, these resources are normally utilized as a last resort supply source in extreme peak-demand periods, typically during the coldest hours or days. 
 PSE holds a contract for LNG storage services of 241,700 Dth of PSE-owned natural gas at Plymouth, with a maximum daily deliverability of 70,500 Dth for use of the PSE generation fleet. PSE uses the Plymouth contract as an alternate supply source for natural gas required to serve PSE s generation fleet during peak periods on a daily or intra-day basis. In addition, PSE holds 15,000 Dth/day of firm pipeline capacity from Plymouth for the generation fleet. The balance of the LNG capacity is delivered using firm NWP pipeline transportation service previously acquired to serve PSE s generation fleet. 
 21 

PSE owns and operates an LNG peaking facility in Gig Harbor, Washington, with total storage capacity of 10,600 Dth, which is capable of delivering 2,500 Dth of natural gas per day. 
 
 Tacoma LNG Facility 
 On February 1, 2022, the Tacoma LNG facility at the Port of Tacoma completed commissioning and commenced commercial operations. The Tacoma LNG facility provides peak-shaving services to PSE s natural gas customers, and provides LNG as fuel to transportation customers via Puget Energy's non-regulated subsidiary Puget LNG, particularly in the marine market at a lower cost due to the facility's scale. Pursuant to an order by the Washington Commission, PSE is allocated 43.0 of the capital and operating costs, consistent with the regulated portion of the Tacoma LNG facility, and Puget LNG is allocated the remaining 57.0 of the capital and operating costs. The portion of the Tacoma LNG facility allocated to PSE is subject to regulation by the Washington Commission. In December 2022, the Washington Commission approved and authorized PSE to seek recovery of costs related to the Tacoma LNG Facility concurrent with its 2023 PGA filing. 
 
 Natural Gas Transportation Capacity 
 PSE currently holds firm transportation capacity on pipelines owned by Cascade Natural Gas Company (CNGC), NWP, Gas Transmission Northwest (GTN), Nova Gas Transmission (NOVA), Foothills Pipe Lines (Foothills) and Enbridge Westcoast Energy (Westcoast). GTN, NOVA, and Foothills are all TC Energy Corporation companies. PSE pays fixed monthly demand charges for the right, but not the obligation, to transport specified quantities of natural gas from receipt points to delivery points on such pipelines each day for the term or terms of the applicable agreements. 
 PSE holds approximately 542,900 Dth per day of capacity for its natural gas customers on NWP that provides firm year-round delivery to PSE s service territory. In addition, PSE holds approximately 447,100 Dth per day of seasonal firm capacity on NWP to provide for delivery of natural gas stored at Jackson Prairie to natural gas customers. PSE holds approximately 202,900 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity on NWP to supply natural gas to its electric generating facilities. In addition, PSE holds over 34,200 Dth per day of seasonal firm capacity on NWP to provide for delivery of natural gas stored in Jackson Prairie for its electric generating facilities. PSE s firm transportation capacity contracts with NWP have remaining terms ranging from one to 22 years. However, PSE has either the unilateral right to extend the contracts under the contracts current terms or the right of first refusal to extend such contracts under current FERC rules. 
 PSE s firm transportation capacity for its natural gas customers on Westcoast s pipeline is 135,800 Dth per day under various contracts, with remaining terms of two to three years. PSE has other firm transportation capacity on Westcoast s pipeline, which supplies the electric generating facilities, totaling 88,400 Dth per day, with remaining terms of three years and an option for PSE to renew its rights under the Westcoast contract. PSE has firm transportation capacity for its natural gas customers on NOVA and Foothills pipelines, each totaling approximately 79,000 Dth per day, with remaining terms of three years and an option for PSE to renew its rights on the capacity on NOVA and Foothills pipelines. PSE has other firm transportation capacity on NOVA and Foothills pipelines, which supplies the electric generating facilities, each totaling approximately 41,000 Dth per day, with remaining term of six years. PSE s firm transportation capacity for its natural gas customers on the GTN pipeline, totaling over 77,000 Dth per day, with remaining term of one year and PSE has a first right-of-refusal to extend such contracts under current FERC rules. PSE has other firm transportation capacity on GTN pipeline, which supplies the electric generating facilities, totaling 40,600 Dth per day, with remaining terms of one year. PSE holds 259,000 Dth per day of firm capacity on CNGC to connect generating facilities to the pipeline grid with remaining terms of one year. 
 
 Capacity Release 
 The FERC regulates the release of firm pipeline and storage capacity for facilities which fall under its jurisdiction. Capacity releases allow shippers to temporarily or permanently relinquish unutilized capacity to recover all or a portion of the cost of such capacity. The FERC allows capacity to be released through several methods including open bidding and pre-arrangement. PSE has acquired some firm pipeline and storage service through capacity release provisions to serve its growing service territory and electric generation portfolio. PSE also mitigates a portion of the demand charges related to unutilized storage and pipeline capacity through capacity release. Capacity release benefits derived from the natural gas customer portfolio are passed on to PSE s natural gas customers through the PGA mechanism. 

Energy Efficiency 
 PSE is required under Washington state law to pursue all available electric conservation that is cost-effective, reliable and feasible. PSE offers programs designed to help new and existing residential, commercial and industrial customers use energy efficiently. PSE uses a variety of mechanisms including cost-effective financial incentives, information and technical services to enable customers to make energy efficient choices with respect to building design, equipment and building systems, appliance purchases and operating practices. PSE recovers the actual costs of its electric and natural gas energy efficiency 
 22 

programs through rider mechanisms. However, the rider mechanisms do not provide assistance with gross margin erosion associated with reduced energy sales. To address this issue, PSE received approval in 2017 from the Washington Commission for continuation of electric and natural gas decoupling mechanisms, which mitigates gross margin erosion resulting from the Company's energy efficiency efforts. The decoupling mechanisms, as approved in 2022 GRC Final Order in Dockets No. UE-220066 and UG-220067 commenced January 7, 2023 for natural gas and January 11, 2023 for electric and will remain in place permanently until such time that PSE proposes and the Washington Commission approves to have them discontinued or modified. 

Environment 
 PSE s operations, including generation, transmission, distribution, service and storage facilities, are subject to environmental laws and regulations by federal, state and local authorities. See below for the primary areas of environmental law that have the potential to most significantly impact PSE s operations and costs. 
 
 Air and Climate Change Protection 
 PSE owns numerous thermal generation facilities, including natural gas plants and an ownership percentage of Colstrip. All of the natural gas plants and Colstrip are governed by the Clean Air Act (CAA), and all have CAA Title V operating permits, which must be renewed every five years. This renewal process could result in additional costs to the plants. PSE continues to monitor the permit renewal process to determine the corresponding potential impact to the plants. These facilities also emit GHGs, and thus are also subject to any current or future GHG or climate change legislation or regulation including the Washington State Climate Commitment Act (CCA) and Washington State Clean Energy Transformation Act (CETA). The Colstrip plant represents PSE s most significant source of GHG emissions. 
 
 Species Protection 
 PSE owns hydroelectric plants, wind farms and numerous miles of above ground electric distribution and transmission lines that can be impacted by laws related to species protection. A number of species of fish have been listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), which influences hydroelectric operations, and may affect PSE operations, potentially representing cost exposure and operational constraints. Similarly, there are a number of avian and terrestrial species that have been listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA or are protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act or the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act. Prohibitions and permitting requirements set forth in these statutes and related regulations have the potential to influence operation of our wind farms and above ground transmission and distribution systems. 
 
 Remediation 
 PSE and its predecessors are responsible for environmental remediation at various sites. These include properties currently and formerly owned by PSE (or its predecessors), as well as third-party owned properties where hazardous substances were allegedly generated, transported or released. The primary cleanup laws to which PSE is subject include the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (federal) and, in Washington, the Model Toxics Control Act (state). PSE is also subject to applicable remediation laws in the state of Montana for its ownership interest in Colstrip. Under all of these laws, PSE may be subject to agency orders to carry out site remediation. These laws impose joint and several liability on any current or past owner or operator of a contaminated site, transporters, as well as any entity that generated and disposed of (or arranged for the disposal of) hazardous or other regulated substances at a contaminated site. 
 
 Hazardous and Solid Waste and Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB) Handling and Disposal 
 Related to certain operations, including power generation and transmission and distribution maintenance, PSE must handle and dispose of certain hazardous and solid wastes, including PCB waste from pre-1979 electrical equipment. These actions are regulated by the Solid Waste Disposal Act (as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act), the Toxic Substances Control Act (federal) and hazardous or dangerous waste regulations (state) that impose complex requirements on handling and disposing of regulated substances. 
 
 23 

Water Protection 
 PSE facilities that discharge wastewater or storm water or store bulk petroleum products, and PSE construction projects above a certain threshold are governed by the Clean Water Act (federal and state), which includes the Oil Pollution Act amendments. This includes most generation facilities (and all of those with water discharges and some with bulk fuel storage), and many other facilities and construction projects depending on drainage, facility or construction activities, and chemical, petroleum and material storage. 
 
 Mercury Emissions 
 Mercury control equipment has been installed at Colstrip and has operated at a level that meets the current Montana requirement. Compliance, based on a rolling twelve-month average, was first confirmed in January 2011, and PSE continues to meet the requirement. 
 
 Siting New Facilities 
 In siting new generation, transmission, distribution or other related facilities in Washington, PSE is subject to the State Environmental Policy Act, and may be subject to the federal National Environmental Policy Act if there is a federal nexus, in addition to other possible state laws and local siting, critical area and zoning ordinances. Such facilities may also be subject to federal environmental regulations. These requirements may potentially require mitigation of environmental impacts as well as other measures that can add significant cost to new facilities. 

Recent and Future Environmental Law and Regulation 
 Recent and future environmental laws and regulations have been and may be adopted at a federal, state or local level and may have a significant impact on the cost of PSE operations. PSE monitors legislative and regulatory developments for environmental issues with the potential to alter the operation and cost of our generation plants, transmission and distribution system, and other assets. Described below are the recent, pending and potential future environmental laws and regulations with the most significant potential impacts to PSE s operations and costs. 
 
 Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
 PSE implements both short-term measures and long-term strategies designed to manage GHG emissions in a scientifically sound and responsible fashion. The Company has worked closely with federal, state and local governments on deep decarbonization and the reduction and mitigation of GHG emissions, including passage of CETA and CCA. As a result, the Company announced a goal to be coal free by 2025, net zero carbon emissions for electric and natural gas operations (methane leaks from pipeline system) as well as electric supply by 2030. Further, the Company has an aspirational goal to be net zero by 2045 for natural gas sales and to go beyond reducing PSE's GHG footprint by helping Washington State address GHG emissions from the transportation sector by investing in electric vehicles and developing liquefied natural gas for maritime and commercial transportation. PSE also remains mindful of our customers' expectation of reliable, affordable service. The Company considers the cost of the decarbonization efforts to date, as well as future efforts, in its IRP process, and will continue to engage in climate and GHG policy development. 
 
 PSE's Greenhouse Gas Emission Reporting 
 PSE is required to submit, on an annual basis, a report of its GHG emissions to the state of Washington Department of Ecology including a report of emissions from all individual power plants emitting over 10,000 tons per year of GHGs and from certain natural gas distribution facilities and operations. Emissions exceeding 25,000 tons per year of GHGs from these sources must also be reported to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Capital investments to monitor GHGs from the power plants and in the distribution system are not required at this time. Since 2002, PSE has voluntarily undertaken an annual inventory of its GHG emissions associated with PSE s total electric retail load served from a supply portfolio of owned and purchased resources. 
 The most recent data indicate that PSE s total GHG emissions (direct and indirect) from its electric supply portfolio in 2021 were 9.1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents. Approximately 27.5 of PSE s total GHG emissions (approximately 2.5 million metric tons) are associated with PSE s ownership and contractual interests in Colstrip. Compared to 2020, total emissions increased by 9.0 . This trend is due primarily to an increase in output from Colstrip Units 3 and 4 and an increase in output from the natural gas thermal fleet. PSE s overall emissions strategy continues to demonstrate a concerted effort to manage customers needs with an appropriate balance of new renewable generation, existing generation owned and/or operated by PSE and significant energy efficiency efforts. 
 
 24 

Executive Orders Addressing Environmental Issues 
 President Joseph Biden issued several executive orders in January 2021 that are likely to affect PSE s environmental obligations. The executive orders revoked several existing executive orders and established new federal environmental mandates, including rejoining the Paris Agreement on climate change, which requires commitments to reduce GHG emissions, among other things. 
 
 Inflation Reduction Act 
 On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into public law. The IRA is intended to lower gasoline and electricity prices, increase energy security, and help consumers to afford emission-cutting technologies. In addition, the IRA will provide tax credits for clean electricity sources and renewable technologies, such as solar and wind. As of December 31, 2022, the IRA had no material financial impact on the Company, however the Company continues to assess the potential impacts of the legislation. 
 
 Federal Greenhouse Gas Rules: New and Existing Power Plants 
 The EPA sets rules that apply to both new and existing power plants regarding GHGs. In 2015, the EPA set a final rule regarding New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for the control of carbon dioxide (CO 2 from new power plants that burn fossil fuels under section 111(b) of the CAA. New natural gas power plants can emit no more than 1,000 lbs. of CO 2 /megawatt hour (MWh) which is achievable with the latest combined cycle technology. New coal power plants can emit no more than 1,400 lbs. of CO 2 /MWh. Carbon Dioxide Capture and Sequestration (CCS) was reaffirmed by the EPA in this rule as the best system of emission reductions (BSER). In 2018, due to the high cost and limited geographic availability of CCS, EPA issued a proposed rule that the BSER for newly constructed coal-fired units is the most efficient demonstrated steam cycle in combination with the best operating practices, but did not take action on a final rule nor has EPA proposed to amend the NSPS. In January 2021, EPA issued a framework for determining when standards are appropriate for GHG emissions from stationary source categories under CAA section 111(b)(1)(A). 
 In August 2015, the EPA issued a final rule under Section 111(d) of the CAA, referred to as the Clean Power Plan (CPP), to regulate GHG emissions from existing power plants. The proposed rule includes state-specific goals and guidelines for states to develop plans for meeting these goals. 
 In June 2019, the EPA repealed the CPP rule and finalized the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule, pursuant to Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act as a CPP rule replacement. The ACE rule established emission guidelines for states to develop plans to address GHG emissions from existing coal-fired plants. On January 19, 2021 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) issued an opinion vacating the ACE rule and remanding the rule back to the Agency for further consideration consistent with its opinion, after finding that the Agency had misinterpreted the CAA when adopting the ACE rule. In February 2021, the EPA issued a memorandum notifying states that it will not require the submittal of plans to the EPA under Section 111(d) because the court vacated the ACE rule without reinstating the CPP. 
 The Supreme Court granted review of the D.C. Circuit's decision related to EPA's authority to require generation shifting under the CPP in October 2021 (West Virginia v. EPA). PSE joined a coalition of utilities defending the vacatur of the ACE rule along with EPA, as well as, a coalition of states that includes Washington State. PSE cannot predict either the outcome of this case or its impact on the ACE rule or the CPP rule. Oral argument was held February 28, 2022, and the Supreme Court issued its decision on June 30, 2022, finding that EPA lacked clear congressional authorization to require generation shifting under Section 111(d), but remaining silent as to the appropriate scope of state compliance flexibilities. In response to this decision, on October 3, 2022, the D.C. Circuit recalled its partial mandate vacating the ACE Rule and granted a motion by EPA to hold pending challenges to the ACE Rule in abeyance while EPA develops a replacement rule. PSE cannot predict EPA s timeline for issuing this replacement rule; however, in December 2022, EPA published proposed changes to the Section 111(d) implementing regulations, which will impact EPA s future promulgation of emissions guidelines, including the forthcoming 111(d) rule governing GHG emissions from existing electricity generating units. EPA has indicated that it intends to issue a final rule by April 2023. 
 
 Washington Climate Commitment Act 
 In 2021, the Washington Legislature adopted the CCA, which establishes a GHG emissions cap-and-invest program that caps GHG emissions beginning on January 1, 2023 and makes further reductions to the cap annually through 2050. The Washington Department of Ecology (WDOE) published final regulations to implement the program to implement the program on September 29, 2022, which became effective on October 30, 2022. In general, the program will require covered entities to obtain emission allowances or offset credits for covered emissions and the WDOE provides the annual allowance budget based on the cap. Allowances can be obtained through quarterly auctions, or bought and sold on a secondary market. 
 25 

The CCA regulates PSE both as an electric utility and as a natural gas distribution utility. PSE is required to obtain emission allowances or offset credits for GHG emissions associated with electricity generated in or imported into the state to serve Washington State load, and all electricity generated by Washington State PSE facilities with total annual emissions exceeding 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. As an electric utility subject to Washington s CETA, which is discussed below, PSE will receive emission allowances at no cost through 2050 for direct emissions associated with electricity used to serve Washington State load to mitigate impacts to ratepayers. PSE will also be required to obtain emission allowances for GHG emissions associated with natural gas supplied to customers and any natural gas system associated facilities with emissions that exceed 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. PSE will receive some emission allowances at no cost; the amount will be based on a percentage of baseline emissions (determined from 2015 - 2019 natural gas system related emissions) that will decline to mitigate rate impacts to certain natural gas customers. Offset credit use is limited and the WDOE will reduce the cap proportionally for any offsets used. In the first compliance period, 2023-2026, participating entities can cover up to 5 of their emissions with offset credits, and can cover an additional 3 with credits from projects on federally recognized Tribal lands. In the second compliance period, 2027-2030, the general limit drops to 4 , with an additional 2 from projects on Tribal lands. 
 
 Washington Clean Energy Transformation Act 
 In May 2019, Washington State passed the CETA, which supports Washington's clean energy economy and transitioning to a clean, affordable, and reliable energy future. The CETA requires all electric utilities to eliminate coal-fired generation from their allocation of electricity by December 31, 2025; to be carbon-neutral by January 1, 2030 through a combination of non-emitting electric generation, renewable generation, and/or alternative compliance options; and makes it the state policy that, by 2045, 100 of electric generation and retail electricity sales will come from renewable or non-emitting resources. Clean energy implementation plans are required every four years from each investor-owned utility (IOU). The plan must propose interim targets for meeting the 2045 standard between 2030 and 2045 and describe an actionable plan that the IOU intends to pursue to meet the standard. The Washington Commission may approve, reject or recommend alterations to an IOU s plan. The Company intends to seek recovery of any costs associated with CETA through the regulatory process. 
 
 Regional Haze Rule 
 In January 2017, the EPA provided revisions to the Regional Haze Rule which were published in the Federal Register. Among other things, these revisions delayed new Regional Haze review from 2018 to 2021; however, the end date will remain 2028. In January 2018, the EPA announced that it would revisit certain aspects of these revisions and PSE is unable to predict the outcome. Challenges to the 2017 Regional Haze Revision Rule are being held in abeyance in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, pending resolution of EPA s reconsideration of the rule. 
 
 Coal Combustion Residuals 
 In April 2015, the EPA published a final rule, effective October 2015, which regulates Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR) under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Subtitle D. The CCR rule currently is self-implementing at a federal level, or can be implemented and enforced by a state. The rule addresses the risks from coal ash disposal, such as leaking of contaminants into ground water, blowing of contaminants into the air as dust, and the catastrophic failure of coal ash containment structures by establishing technical design, operation and maintenance, closure and post closure care requirements for CCR landfills and surface impoundments, and corrective action requirements for any related leakage. 
 In addition to the EPA's CCR rule, the operator of Colstrip and the state of Montana in 2012 entered into an Administrative Order of Consent (AOC) that also addresses clean up and closure of CCR units at Colstrip. The CCR rule and the AOC require significant changes to the Company's Colstrip operations and those changes were reviewed by the Company and the plant operator in the second quarter of 2015. PSE had previously recognized a legal obligation under the EPA rules to dispose of ash material at Colstrip in 2003. Due to the CCR rule, additional disposal costs were added to the Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations (ARO). In 2018, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned certain provisions of the CCR rule in 2018 and remanded some of its provisions back to the EPA. As a result of that decision and certain other developments, EPA has continued to work on developing new rules regarding CCR, including establishing a presumptive date of April 11, 2021, for facilities to stop placing coal ash into unlined surface impoundments. In addition, the EPA has proposed a federal permitting program for coal ash disposal units along with the Water Infrastructure Improvement for the Nation Act (WIIN Act). The WIIN Act allows states to develop a state program for the regulation of CCR in lieu of the federal CCR rule, and also authorizes EPA to develop a federal permitting program. Currently, Montana has not applied for a state permit program, and EPA has not yet finalized a federal permitting program.

 Employee Overview 
 At December 31, 2022, PSE had approximately 3,250 full-time equivalent employees. Approximately 970 PSE employees are represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Union (IBEW) or the United Association of Plumbers and Pipefitters (UA). The UA contract was ratified effective December 2021, and will expire September 30, 2025. The IBEW contract was ratified effective April 1, 2020, and will expire March 31, 2026. 
 Puget Energy does not have any employees. PSE's employees provide services to Puget Energy and PSE charges for their salaries and benefits at cost. 
 
 Safety 
 Our safety objective is our foundation: Nobody gets hurt today so that we will feel safe and secure and able to perform at our best. When we re safe, we can achieve our people objective of being a great place to work, with engaged employees who live our values, embrace an ownership culture and are motivated to drive results for our company and our customers. 
 Our workplace safety program puts significant emphasis on education and training, delivering information by multiple means, including articles and videos. Topics cover not only safety around the equipment and conditions employees work in but also day-to-day issues such as ergonomics, mental health, and overall wellness. This ensures compliance with all federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Washington State Division of Occupational Safety and Health rules to ensure PSE provides and remains a safe and healthy working environment for all employees. PSE vehicles, equipment, and construction practices meet all applicable regulations and codes for worker and public safety. An executive-level steering committee oversees employee safety performance and programs. Policies are outlined in a comprehensive manual, which is maintained by PSE s Safety and Health Department. As a way of recognizing the importance of safety, the annual employee incentive is tied to performance on goals for safety. 
 
 Employee Benefits 
 To attract employees that meet the needs of the Company s skilled workforce, the Company offers employee benefits that are a component of the Company s total compensation package. Employee benefits include medical, health and dental insurance, long-term disability insurance, accidental death insurance, and our 401(k) plan. Non-represented and UA-represented employees hired on or after January 1, 2014 along with IBEW-represented employees hired on or after December 12, 2014, have access to the 401(k) plan. The two contribution sources from PSE are below: 
 401(k) Company Matching: non-represented, UA-represented and IBEW-represented employees PSE will match 100 on the first 3.0 of pay contributed and 50.0 on the next 3.0 of pay contributed, such that an employee who contributes 6.0 of pay will receive 4.5 of pay in company match. Company matching will be immediately vested. 
 Company Contribution: UA-represented employees will receive an annual company contribution of 4.0 of eligible pay placed in the Cash Balance retirement plan. Non-represented and IBEW-represented employees will receive an annual company contribution of 4.0 of eligible pay, placed either in the Investment Plan 401(k) plan or in PSE s Cash Balance retirement plan. Non-represented and IBEW-represented employees will make a one-time election within 30 days of hire and direct that PSE put the 4.0 contribution either into the 401(k) plan or into an account in the Cash Balance retirement plan. The Company's 4.0 contribution will vest after three years of service. For additional details see Item 8 (for employees hired prior to January 1, 2014) and Item 11 of this report.

Employee Development 
 The Company offers development opportunities to employees. Some of the programs are: 
 Employee wellness program: PSE maintains a wellness program that offers a wide range of resources and tools at little or no cost to employees and their families, including company sponsored wellness events and ongoing health and wellness communications. The PSE program also includes resources and tools that focus on mental health and wellbeing. 
 Employee engagement: PSE has been conducting the Great Place to Work survey since 2001 in an ongoing effort to create a culture that supports company values and enables PSE to do its best work on behalf of its customers and communities. The Company also conducts periodic pulse surveys to engage employees on relevant topics and provide them with opportunities to inform decisions. 
 Professional development and tuition reimbursement: PSE provides its employees with tools and development resources to enhance their skills and careers at the Company. Employees are encouraged to discuss their professional development and identify interests during one-to-one discussions and annual performance reviews with their supervisors. Employees are provided with learning opportunities that support our diversity, equity and inclusion strategies and create a more inclusive culture. Leadership development is critical to PSE s success and we provide training and support to help leaders more effectively navigate and work in different ways including virtually or in a hybrid workplace. PSE has multiple training programs and modules designed to educate employees on an assortment of health and safety practices and certifications, corporate ethics and compliance, business management, employee relations, environmental awareness, community engagement, and regulatory compliance, and emergency preparation and response. PSE also offers employees a tuition reimbursement program for relevant education opportunities. 
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI): PSE is committed to being our customers clean energy partner of choice and views DEI as an essential aspect of the Company's aspirations. As a result, PSE's employees are critical to creating an inclusive culture and the Company is committed to creating opportunities for engagement and learning from one another. PSE has nine active employee resource groups (ERGs) that are designed for inspiring engagement. ERGs are a benefit for its members and the Company as they create environments for integrating diverse perspectives, provide additional insight into how to solve problems, innovate, and meet customer needs. ERGs also help to build connections with local communities and business partners resulting in strengthened relationships. PSE joined a regional coalition of employers through the Washington Employers of Racial Equity (WERE) pledging our support for the Commitment to Progress. PSE also participates with other member companies of the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) to help shape DEI objectives. PSE currently is in the first phase, assess, of the 10-year process. The assess phase includes the following: (i) embedding the DEI assessment into functional work; (ii) gathering and analyzing data related to our community, customers, people and suppliers; (iii) gathering input from stakeholders; (iv) evaluating WERE and EEI commitments and DEI related efforts and (v) creating a task force to energize PSE ERGs to enhance employee engagement.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 The following risk factors, in addition to other factors and matters discussed elsewhere in this report, should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that Puget Energy and PSE may face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or currently deemed immaterial also may impair PSE s business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, Puget Energy s and PSE s business, results of operations and financial conditions would suffer. 
 
 RISKS RELATING TO PSE s REGULATORY AND RATE-MAKING PROCEDURES 
 PSE's regulated utility business is subject to various federal and state regulations. PSE's regulatory risks include, but are not limited to, the items discussed below. 
 
 The actions of regulators can significantly affect PSE s earnings, liquidity and business activities. The rates that PSE is allowed to charge for its services are the single most important item influencing its financial position, results of operations and liquidity. PSE is highly regulated and the rates that it charges its wholesale and retail customers are determined by both the Washington Commission and the FERC. 
 PSE is also subject to the regulatory authority of the Washington Commission with respect to accounting, operations, the issuance of securities and certain other matters, and the regulatory authority of the FERC with respect to the transmission of electric energy, the sale of electric energy at the wholesale level, accounting and certain other matters. In addition, proceedings with the Washington Commission typically involve multiple stakeholder parties, including consumer advocacy groups and various consumers of energy, who have differing concerns but who have the common objective of limiting rate increases or decreasing rates. Policies and regulatory actions by these regulators could have a material impact on PSE s financial position, results of operations and liquidity. 
 
 PSE s recovery of costs is subject to regulatory review and its operating income may be adversely affected if its costs are disallowed. The Washington Commission determines the rates PSE may charge to its electric retail customers based, in part, on historic costs during a particular test year, adjusted for certain normalizing adjustments. Power costs on the other hand, are normalized for market, weather and hydrological conditions projected to occur during the applicable rate year, the ensuing twelve-month period after rates become effective. The Washington Commission determines the rates PSE may charge to its 
 29 

natural gas customers based on historic costs during a particular test year. Natural gas costs are adjusted through the PGA mechanism, as discussed previously. If in a specific year PSE s costs are higher than the amounts used by the Washington Commission to determine the rates, revenue may not be sufficient to permit PSE to earn its allowed return or to cover its costs. In addition, the Washington Commission has the authority to determine what level of expense and investment is reasonable and prudent in providing electric and natural gas service. If the Washington Commission decides that part of PSE s costs do not meet the standard, those costs may be disallowed partially or entirely and not recovered in rates. For the aforementioned reasons, the rates authorized by the Washington Commission may not be sufficient to earn the allowed return or recover the costs incurred by PSE in a given period. 
 
 PSE is currently subject to a Washington Commission order that requires PSE to share its excess earnings above the authorized rate of return with customers. The Washington Commission previously approved an electric and natural gas decoupling mechanism for the recovery of its delivery-system and fixed production costs, along with a rate plan and earnings sharing mechanism that requires PSE and its customers to share in any earnings in excess of the authorized rate of return. The earnings test is done for each service (electric/natural gas) separately, so PSE would be obligated to share the earnings for one service exceeding the authorized rate of return, even if the other service did not exceed the authorized rate of return. 
 
 The PCA mechanism, by which variations in PSE s power costs are apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to a graduated scale, could result in significant increases in PSE s expenses if power costs are significantly higher than the baseline rate. PSE has a PCA mechanism that provides for recovery of power costs from customers or refunding of power cost savings to customers, as those costs vary from the power cost baseline level of power costs which are set, in part, based on normalized assumptions about weather and hydrological conditions. Excess power costs or power cost savings will be apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to the graduated scale set forth in the PCA mechanism and will trigger a surcharge or refund when the cumulative deferral trigger is reached. As a result, if power costs are significantly higher than the baseline rate, PSE s expenses could significantly increase. 
 
 RISKS RELATING TO PSE s OPERATION 
 
 PSE s cash flow and earnings could be adversely affected by potential high prices and volatile markets for purchased power, recurrence of low availability of hydroelectric resources, outages of its generating facilities or a failure to deliver on the part of its suppliers. The utility business involves many operating risks. If PSE s operating expenses, including the cost of purchased power and natural gas, significantly exceed the levels recovered from retail customers, its cash flow and earnings would be negatively affected. Factors which could cause PSE's purchased power and natural gas costs to be higher than anticipated include, but are not limited to, high prices in western wholesale markets during periods when PSE has insufficient energy resources to meet its energy supply needs and/or purchases in wholesale markets of high volumes of energy at prices above the amount recovered in retail rates due to: 
 Below normal levels of generation by PSE-owned hydroelectric resources due to low streamflow conditions or precipitation; 
 Extended outages of any of PSE-owned generating facilities or the transmission lines that deliver energy to load centers, or the effects of large-scale natural disasters on a substantial portion of distribution infrastructure; and 
 Failure of a counterparty to deliver capacity or energy purchased by PSE. 
 
 PSE s electric generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated operation and maintenance expenses and increased power purchase costs. PSE owns and operates coal, natural gas-fired, hydroelectric, and wind-powered generating facilities. Operation of electric generating facilities involves risks that can adversely affect energy output and efficiency levels or increase expenditures, including: 
 Facility shutdowns due to a breakdown or failure of equipment or processes; 
 Volatility in prices for fuel and fuel transportation; 
 Disruptions in the delivery of fuel and lack of adequate inventories; 
 Regulatory compliance obligations and related costs, including any required environmental remediation, and any new laws and regulations that necessitate significant investments in our generating facilities; 
 Labor disputes; 
 Operator error or safety related stoppages; 
 Terrorist or other attacks (both cyber-based and/or asset-based); and 
 30 

Catastrophic events such as fires, explosions or acts of nature. 
 
 Cyber-attacks, including cyber-terrorism, foreign-state support cyber threats or other information technology security breaches, or information technology failures may disrupt business operations, increase costs, lead to the disclosure of confidential information and damage PSE's reputation. Security breaches of PSE's information technology infrastructure, including cyber-attacks and cyber-terrorism, or other failures of PSE's information technology infrastructure could lead to disruptions of PSE's production and distribution operations, and otherwise adversely impact PSE's ability to safely and effectively operate electric and natural gas systems and serve customers. In addition, an attack on or failure of information technology systems could result in the unauthorized release of customer, employee or Company data that is crucial to PSE's operational security or could adversely affect PSE's ability to deliver and collect on customer bills. Such security breaches of PSE's information technology infrastructure could adversely affect our operations and business reputation, diminish customer confidence, subject PSE to financial liability or increased regulation, expose PSE to fines or material legal claims and liability and adversely affect our financial results. PSE has implemented preventive, detective and remediation measures to manage these risks, and maintains cyber risk insurance to mitigate the effects of these events. Nevertheless, these may not effectively protect all of PSE's systems all of the time. To the extent that the occurrence of any of these cyber-events is not fully covered by insurance, it could adversely affect PSE s financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Natural disasters like wildfires and catastrophic events, including terrorist acts, may adversely affect PSE's business. Events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornadoes, extreme weather events, vandalism, terrorist acts, and other similar occurrences, could damage PSE's operational assets, including utility facilities, information technology infrastructure, distributed generation assets and pipeline assets. Such events could likewise damage the operational assets of PSE's suppliers or customers. These events could disrupt PSE's ability to meet customer requirements, significantly increase PSE's response costs, and significantly decrease PSE's revenues. Unanticipated events or a combination of events, failure in resources needed to respond to events, or a slow or inadequate response to events may have an adverse impact on PSE's operations, financial condition, and results of operations. The availability of insurance covering catastrophic events like wildfires, sabotage and terrorism may be limited or may result in higher deductibles, higher premiums, and more restrictive policy terms. 
 
 PSE is subject to the commodity price, delivery and credit risks associated with the energy markets. In connection with matching PSE's energy needs and available resources, PSE engages in wholesale sales and purchases of electric capacity and energy and, accordingly, is subject to commodity price risk, delivery risk, credit risk and other risks associated with these activities. Credit risk includes the risk that counterparties owing PSE money or energy will breach their obligations for delivery of energy supply or contractually required payments related to PSE's energy supply portfolio. Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, PSE may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements. In that event, PSE s financial results could be adversely affected. Although PSE takes into account the expected probability of default by counterparties, the actual exposure to a default by a particular counterparty could be greater than predicted. 
 
 Costs of compliance with environmental, climate change and endangered species laws are significant and the costs or reduced revenue related to compliance with new and emerging laws and regulations and the occurrence of associated liabilities could adversely affect PSE s results of operations. PSE s operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental issues, including air emissions and climate change, endangered species protection, remediation of contamination, avian protection, waste handling and disposal, decommissioning, water protection and siting new facilities. In addition, recent laws proposed or passed by the State of Washington and various municipalities in PSE's service territory, including Seattle, seek to reduce or eliminate the use of natural gas in various contexts, such as for space and water heating in new commercial and multifamily buildings. As a result of these legal requirements, PSE must spend significant sums of money to comply with these measures including resource planning, remediation, monitoring, analysis, adoption of mitigation measures, use of pollution control equipment, and emissions-related abatement and fees. New environmental laws and regulations affecting PSE s operations or restricting the use of products sold by PSE may be adopted, and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to PSE or its facilities. Compliance with these or other future regulations could require significant expenditures by PSE or reduce revenue and thus adversely affect PSE financially. In addition, PSE may not be able to recover all of its costs for such expenditures through electric and natural gas rates in a timely manner. 
 Under current law, PSE is also generally responsible for any on-site liabilities associated with the environmental condition of the facilities that it currently owns or operates or has previously owned or operated. The occurrence of a material environmental liability or new regulations governing such liability could result in substantial future costs and have a material adverse effect on PSE s results of operations and financial condition. Specific to climate change, Washington State has 
 31 

adopted both renewable portfolio standards and GHG legislation, including CETA and CCA, and PSE anticipates full compliance with these requirements. 
 In 2021, the Washington Legislature adopted the CCA, which establishes a GHG emissions cap-and-invest program that caps GHG emissions beginning on January 1, 2023 and makes further reductions to the cap annually through 2050. The WDOE published final regulations to implement the program on September 29, 2022, which became effective on October 30, 2022. WDOE also indicated that they will have subsequent rulemakings that will build off initial rulemaking as program implementation gets underway and progress with Washington State carbon goals are evaluated. In general, the program will require covered entities to obtain emission allowances or offset credits for covered emissions and the WDOE provides the annual allowance budget based on the cap. Allowances can be obtained through quarterly auctions, or bought and sold on a secondary market. The CCA regulates PSE both as an electric utility and as a natural gas distribution utility. PSE is required to obtain emission allowances or offset credits for GHG emissions associated with electricity generated in or imported into the state to serve Washington State load, and all electricity generated by Washington State PSE facilities with total annual emissions exceeding 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. As an electric utility subject to Washington s CETA, PSE will receive emission allowances at no cost through 2050 for direct emissions associated with electricity used to serve Washington State load to mitigate impacts to ratepayers. PSE will also be required to obtain emission allowances for GHG emissions associated with natural gas supplied to customers and any natural gas system associated facilities with emissions that exceed 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. Based on the rules passed in 2022, there is potential for PSE s compliance with the CCA to result in increased costs to customers or amounts that PSE may not be able to recover through electric and natural gas rates. Potential risks associated with CCA compliance could include: the evolving nature of the CCA rulemaking as indicated by WDOE, market uncertainty based on rule interpretation during implementation, unresolved recovery methodology for CCA s impact on energy costs, company costs, customer rate impacts, and cash, liquidity and credit volatility. 
 
 PSE's inability to adequately develop or acquire the necessary infrastructure to comply with new and emerging laws and regulations could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Potential changes in regulatory standards, impacts of new and existing laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations and those seeking to combat climate change, and the need to obtain various regulatory approvals create uncertainty surrounding our energy resource portfolio. The current abundance of low, stably priced natural gas, together with environmental, regulatory, and other concerns surrounding coal-fired generation resources, fossil fuel infrastructure bans, and energy resource portfolio requirements, including those related to renewables development and energy efficiency measures, create strategic challenges as to the appropriate generation portfolio and fuel diversification mix. 
 In expressing concerns about the environmental and climate-related impacts from continued extraction, transportation, delivery and combustion of fossil fuels including natural gas, environmental advocacy groups and other third parties have in recent years undertaken greater efforts to oppose the permitting and construction of natural gas infrastructure projects. These efforts may increase in scope and frequency depending on a number of variables, including the future course of local, state and federal environmental regulation and the increasing financial resources devoted to these opposition activities. PSE cannot predict the effect that any such opposition may have on our ability to develop and construct natural gas infrastructure projects in the future. 
 
 PSE's operating results fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis and can be impacted by various impacts of climate change. PSE's business is seasonal and weather patterns can have a material impact on its revenue, expenses and operating results. Demand for electricity is greater in the winter months associated with heating. Accordingly, PSE's operations have historically generated less revenue and income when weather conditions are milder in winter. In the event that the Company experiences unusually mild winters, its results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. PSE's hydroelectric resources are also dependent on snow conditions in the Pacific Northwest. 
 
 PSE may be adversely affected by extreme events in which PSE is not able to promptly respond, repair and restart the electric and natural gas infrastructure system. PSE must maintain an emergency planning and training program to allow PSE to quickly respond to extreme events. Without emergency planning, PSE is subject to availability of outside contractors during an extreme event which may impact the quality of service provided to PSE s customers and also require significant expenditures by PSE. In addition, a slow or ineffective response to extreme events may have an adverse effect on earnings as customers may be without electricity and natural gas for an extended period of time. 
 
 PSE depends on its work force and third party vendors to perform certain important services and may be negatively affected by its inability to attract and retain professional and technical employees or the unavailability of vendors. PSE is subject to workforce factors, including but not limited to loss or retirement of key personnel and availability of qualified personnel. PSE s ability to implement a workforce succession plan is dependent upon PSE s ability to employ and retain skilled professional and technical workers. Without a skilled workforce, PSE s ability to provide quality service to PSE s 
 32 

customers and to meet regulatory requirements could affect PSE s earnings. Also, the costs associated with attracting and retaining qualified employees could reduce earnings and cash flows. 
 PSE continues to be concerned about the availability of skilled workers for special complex utility functions. PSE also hires third party vendors to perform a variety of normal business functions, such as power plant maintenance, data warehousing and management, electric transmission, electric and natural gas distribution construction and maintenance, certain billing and metering processes, call center overflow and credit and collections. The unavailability of skilled workers or unavailability of such vendors could adversely affect the quality and cost of PSE s natural gas and electric service and accordingly PSE s results of operations. 
 
 Potential municipalization may adversely affect PSE's financial condition. PSE may be adversely affected if we experience a loss in the number of our customers due to municipalization or other related government action. When a town, city, county, or portion of a county in PSE's service territory establishes its own municipal-owned utility or public utility district, it acquires PSE's assets and takes over the delivery of energy services that PSE provides. Although PSE is compensated in connection with the government entity's acquisition of its assets, any such loss of customers and related revenue could negatively affect PSE's future financial condition. 
 
 Technological developments may have an adverse impact on PSE's financial condition. Advances in power generation, energy efficiency and other alternative energy technologies, such as solar generation, could lead to more wide-spread use of these technologies, thereby reducing customer demand for the energy supplied by PSE which could negatively impact PSE's revenue and financial condition. 
 
 PSE may face risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic and other outbreaks that could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Business disruptions arising from pandemics, such as COVID-19, may adversely affect economic activity within Washington State and the United States of America. Efforts to contain and mitigate such pandemics and/or outbreaks (including, but not limited to, voluntary and mandatory quarantines, vaccination requirements, restrictions on travel, limiting gatherings of people, and reduced operations and extended closures of many businesses and institutions) could materially impact our results of operations, financial condition and ongoing operations. The impacts include but are not limited to: 
 impacting customer demand for electricity and natural gas by our customers, particularly from commercial and industrial customers; 
 reducing the availability and productivity of our employees; 
 reducing the availability and productivity of key contractors and vendors; 
 causing us to experience an increase in costs as a result of our emergency measures, delayed payments from our customers and uncollectible accounts; 
 causing delays and disruptions in the availability of and timely delivery of materials and components used in our operations; 
 causing a deterioration in our financial metrics or the business environment that impacts our credit ratings; 
 causing significant disruption in the financial markets which could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital in the future and cost of capital; 
 resulting in our inability to meet the requirements of the covenants in our existing credit facilities, including covenants regarding the ratio of total debt to total capitalization; and 
 disrupting our ability to meet customer requirements and potentially significantly increase response costs. 
 
 PSE could be adversely affected by disruptions in the global economy and rising geopolitical tensions caused by the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The global economy has been negatively impacted by the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Governments including the U.S., United Kingdom, and European Union imposed import and export controls on certain products and economic sanctions on certain industries and parties in Russia. Further escalation of geopolitical tensions related to the military conflict, including increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade, could result in, among other things, cyberattacks, supply chain disruptions, and increased costs, including energy costs, which may adversely affect our business and supply chain. 
 33 

RISKS RELATING TO PUGET ENERGY'S AND PSE'S FINANCING 
 
 The Company's business is dependent on its ability to successfully access capital. The Company relies on access to internally generated funds, bank borrowings through multi-year committed credit facilities and short-term money markets as sources of liquidity and longer-term debt markets to fund PSE's utility construction program and other capital expenditure requirements of PSE. If Puget Energy or PSE are unable to access capital on reasonable terms, their ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions, including generating capacity, which may be necessary for future growth, could be adversely affected. Capital and credit market disruptions, a downgrade of Puget Energy's or PSE's credit rating or the unavailability of or the imposition of restrictions on borrowings under their credit facilities in the event of a deterioration of financial condition of Puget Energy or PSE may increase Puget Energy's and PSE s cost of borrowing or adversely affect the ability to access one or more financial markets. 
 
 The amount of the Company's debt could adversely affect its liquidity and results of operations. Puget Energy and PSE have short-term and long-term debt, and may incur additional debt (including secured debt) in the future. Puget Energy has access to a multi-year 800.0 million revolving credit facility, secured by substantially all of its assets, which has a maturity date of May 14, 2027. There was 118.6 million outstanding under the facility as of December 31, 2022. Puget Energy's credit facility includes an expansion feature that could, subject to the commitment of one or more lenders, increase the size of the facility to 1.3 billion. PSE also has a separate credit facility, which provides PSE with access to a multi-year 800.0 million revolving credit facility, and includes an expansion feature that could, subject to the commitment of one or more lenders, increase the size of the facility to 1.4 billion. The PSE credit facility matures on May 14, 2027. As of December 31, 2022, no amounts were drawn and outstanding under the PSE credit facility. In addition, Puget Energy has issued 2.0 billion in senior secured notes, whereas PSE, as of December 31, 2022, had approximately 4.8 billion outstanding under first mortgage bonds, pollution control bonds and senior notes. The Company's debt level could have important effects on the business, including but not limited to: 
 Making it difficult to satisfy obligations under the debt agreements and increasing the risk of default on the debt obligations; 
 Making it difficult to fund non-debt service related operations of the business; and 
 Limiting the Company's financial flexibility, including its ability to borrow additional funds on favorable terms or at all. 
 
 A downgrade in Puget Energy s or PSE s credit rating could negatively affect the ability to access capital, the ability to hedge in wholesale markets and the ability to pay dividends. Although neither Puget Energy nor PSE has any rating downgrade provisions in its credit facilities that would accelerate the maturity dates of outstanding debt, a downgrade in the Companies credit ratings could adversely affect the ability to renew existing or obtain access to new credit facilities and could increase the cost of such facilities. For example, under Puget Energy s and PSE s facilities, the borrowing spreads over the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) (or other applicable index) and commitment fees increase if their respective corporate credit ratings decline. A downgrade in commercial paper ratings could increase the cost of commercial paper and limit or preclude PSE s ability to issue commercial paper under its current programs. 
 Any downgrade below investment grade of PSE s corporate credit rating could cause counterparties in the wholesale electric, wholesale natural gas and financial derivative markets to request PSE to post a letter of credit or other collateral, make cash prepayments, obtain a guarantee agreement or provide other mutually agreeable security, all of which would expose PSE to additional costs. 
 PSE may not declare or make any dividend distribution unless on the date of distribution PSE s corporate credit/issuer rating is investment grade, or if its credit ratings are below investment grade, PSE s ratio of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to interest expense for the most recently ended four fiscal quarter periods prior to such date is equal to or greater than 3.0 to 1.0. 
 
 Changes in the method for determining LIBOR and the potential replacement of LIBOR may affect our credit facilities and the interest rates on such borrowings. LIBOR, the London interbank offered rate, is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally. In July 2017, the United Kingdom s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. In November 2020, LIBOR s administrator indicated that US dollar LIBOR will likely continue to be published until June 30, 2023, which would allow time for certain legacy contracts to mature before US dollar LIBOR is no longer available. If the method for calculation of LIBOR changes, if LIBOR is no longer available or if 
 34 

lenders have increased costs due to changes in LIBOR, Puget Energy or PSE may suffer from potential increases in interest rates on any borrowings. In May 2022, Puget Energy and PSE entered into new revolving credit facilities that eliminated LIBOR as the benchmark for floating rate loans and replaced it with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as the new benchmark rate for floating rate loans plus a spread that is based upon Puget Energy s or PSE s credit ratings, respectively. 
 
 Poor performance of pension and postretirement benefit plan investments and other factors impacting plan costs could unfavorably impact PSE s cash flow and liquidity. PSE provides a defined benefit pension plan and postretirement benefits to certain PSE employees and former employees. Costs of providing these benefits are based, in part, on the value of the plan s assets and the current interest rate environment and therefore, adverse market performance or low interest rates could result in lower rates of return for the investments that fund PSE s pension and postretirement benefits plans and could increase PSE s funding requirements related to the pension plans. Changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, may also increase PSE's funding requirements related to the pension plans. Any contributions to PSE s plans in 2023 and beyond as well as the timing of the recovery of such contributions in GRCs could impact PSE s cash flow and liquidity. 
 
 RISKS RELATING TO PUGET ENERGY'S CORPORATE STRUCTURE 
 
 Puget Energy's ability to pay dividends may be limited. As a holding company with no significant operations of its own, the primary source of funds for the repayment of debt and other expenses, as well as payment of dividends to its shareholder, is cash dividends PSE pays to Puget Energy. PSE is a separate and distinct legal entity and has no obligation to pay any amounts to Puget Energy, whether by dividends, loans or other payments. The ability of PSE to pay dividends or make distributions to Puget Energy, and accordingly, Puget Energy s ability to pay dividends or repay debt or other expenses, will depend on PSE s earnings, capital requirements and general financial condition. If Puget Energy does not receive adequate distributions from PSE, it may not be able to meet its obligations or pay dividends. 
 The payment of dividends by PSE to Puget Energy is restricted by provisions of certain covenants applicable to long-term debt contained in PSE s electric and natural gas mortgage indentures. In addition, beginning February 2009, pursuant to the terms of the Washington Commission merger order, PSE may not declare or pay dividends if PSE s common equity ratio calculated on a regulatory basis is 44.0 or below, except to the extent a lower equity ratio is ordered by the Washington Commission. Also, pursuant to the merger order, PSE's ability to declare or make any distribution is limited by its' corporate credit/issuer rating and EBITDA to interest ratio, as previously discussed above. The common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, was 48.1 at December 31, 2022, and the EBITDA to interest expense was 5.0 to 1.0 for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2022. 
 PSE s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the terms of its credit facilities, pursuant to which PSE is not permitted to pay dividends during any Event of Default (as defined in the facilities), or if the payment of dividends would result in an Event of Default, such as failure to comply with certain financial covenants. 
 
 Challenges relating to the operation of the Tacoma LNG facility could adversely affect the Company s operations. The Tacoma LNG facility at the Port of Tacoma, a facility jointly owned by PSE and Puget Energy s subsidiary, Puget LNG, is intended to provide peak-shaving services to PSE s natural gas customers, and to provide LNG as fuel primarily to the maritime market. Puget LNG has entered into one fuel supply agreement with a maritime customer, and is marketing the facility s expected output to other potential customers. Delays in the facility s operation or in its ability to timely deliver fuel to customers could expose Puget LNG to damages under one or more fuel supply contracts, which could unfavorably impact Puget Energy s return on investment. 
 
 GENERAL RISK FACTORS 
 
 The Company may be negatively affected by unfavorable changes in the tax laws or their interpretation. The Company s tax obligations include income, real estate, public utility, municipal, sales and use, business and occupation and employment-related taxes and ongoing audits related to these taxes. Changes in tax law, related regulations or differing interpretation or enforcement of applicable law by the IRS or other taxing jurisdiction could have a material adverse impact on the Company s financial statements. The tax law, related regulations and case law are inherently complex. The Company must make judgments and interpretations about the application of the law when determining the provision for taxes. These judgments may include reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that may be subject to challenge by the 
 35 

taxing authorities. Disputes over interpretations of tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority in examination, upon appeal or through litigation. 
 
 Potential legal proceedings and claims could increase the Company s costs, reduce the Company s revenue and cash flow, or otherwise alter the way the Company conducts business. The Company is, from time to time, subject to various legal proceedings and claims. Any such claims, whether with or without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to defend and could divert management s attention and resources. While management believes the Company has reasonable and prudent insurance coverage and accrues loss contingencies for all known matters that are probable and can be reasonably estimated, the Company cannot assure that the outcome of all current or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the Company and/or its results of operations. 
 
 The Company's costs and expenses could increase as a result of inflationary pressures. Such inflationary pressures could result in increased labor, commodities, materials and supplies, outside services and capital costs, among others, that may not be offset by an increase in revenues, which would adversely affect the Company s results of operations. While regulatory mechanisms exist to mitigate the impacts of inflation on commodity prices, the Company cannot assure that rising inflation will not have an adverse effect on the Company's results of operations.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 Effective in November 2020, the SEC Final Rule Release No. 33-10825, "Modernization of Regulation S-K Items 101, 103, and 105" updated the disclosure threshold for environmental proceedings. Prior to this rule, environmental proceedings to which the government is a party were required to be disclosed if the proceeding was expected to result in sanctions of 100,000 or more. The rule increases the quantitative threshold to 300,000, but also permits registrants to elect a higher threshold, limited to the lesser of 1 million or 1 of consolidated current assets, if the registrant determines that such threshold is more reasonably designed to result in the disclosure of material environmental proceedings. Given the size of the Company's operations, PSE elected a threshold of 1 million.

 Overview 
 
 Puget Energy is an energy services holding company and substantially all of its operations are conducted through its wholly-owned subsidiary PSE, a regulated electric and natural gas utility company. PSE is the largest electric and natural gas utility in the state of Washington, primarily engaged in the business of electric transmission, distribution and generation and natural gas distribution. Puget Energy's business strategy is to generate stable cash flows by offering reliable electric and natural gas service in a cost-effective manner through PSE. Puget Energy also has a wholly-owned non-regulated subsidiary, Puget LNG, LLC (Puget LNG), which has the sole purpose of owning, developing and financing the non-regulated activity of the Tacoma liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility. All of Puget Energy's common stock is indirectly owned by Puget Holdings LLC (Puget Holdings). Puget Holdings is owned by a consortium of long-term infrastructure investors including the British Columbia Investment Management Corporation (BCIMC), the Alberta Investment Management Corporation (AIMCo), Ontario Municipal Employee Retirement System (OMERS), PGGM Vermogensbeheer B.V., Macquarie Washington Clean Energy Investment, L.P., and Ontario Teachers Pension Plan Board. Puget Energy and PSE are collectively referred to herein as the Company. 
 PSE generates revenue and cash flow primarily from the sale of electric and natural gas services to residential and commercial customers within a service territory covering approximately 6,000 square miles, principally in the Puget Sound 
 37 

region of the state of Washington. PSE continually balances its load requirements, generation resources, purchase power agreements, and market purchases to meet customer demand. The Company's external financing requirements principally reflect the cash needs of its construction program, its schedule of maturing debt and certain operational needs. PSE requires access to bank and capital markets to meet its financing needs. 
 Factors affecting PSE's performance are set forth in this Overview section, as well as in other sections of the Management's Discussion and Analysis. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 The following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), as well as return on equity (ROE) excluding unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments (net income plus unrealized losses and/or minus unrealized gains on derivative instruments divided by average common equity) that is considered a non-GAAP financial measure . Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance, financial position or cash flows that includes adjustments that result in a presentation that is not defined by GAAP. The Company believes that its return on average of monthly averages (AMA) equity, also a non-GAAP measure, is a suitable metric for comparing ROE across years and is a relevant metric for assessing and evaluating ROE performance against the Company's authorized regulated ROE. The AMA equity is not intended to represent the regulated equity. PSE's ROE may not be comparable to other companies' ROE measures. Furthermore, this measure is not intended to replace ROE (GAAP net income divided by GAAP average common equity) as an indicator of operating performance. 
 The following table presents PSE s ROE, its return on AMA equity and its authorized regulated ROE for 2022 and 2021: 2022 2021 (Dollars in Thousands) Earnings Average Common Equity Return on Equity Earnings Average Common Equity Return on Equity Return on equity 490,952 4,613,257 10.6 336,063 4,268,420 7.9 Less/Plus: Unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments, after-tax (206,330) (10,890) Plus: Equity adjustments 1 
 (108,984) 104,731 Plus: Impact of average of monthly average (AMA) 127,482 97,767 Return on AMA equity 284,622 4,631,755 6.1 325,173 4,470,918 7.3 Authorized regulated return on equity 2 
 9.4 9.4 
 _______________ 
 1. Equity adjustments are related to removing the impacts of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), subsidiary retained earnings, retained earnings of derivative instruments, and decoupling 24-month revenue reserve. 
 2. The authorized regulated return on equity rate per the approved 2019 GRC is 9.4 for natural gas and electric effective October 1, 2020 and October 15, 2020, respectively. 
 Not meaningful and/or applicable. 
 
 The Company s 2022 return on AMA equity was 6.1 , which is lower than the authorized regulated ROE primarily due to the following: 
 Regulated equity (rate base multiplied by equity percent) was 589.3 million lower than AMA equity for the year ended December 31, 2022. The impact on ROE for this variance was negative 1.2 . The variance was primarily driven by investment in items that do not earn a return or earn a return that is less than the authorized ROE. Such items include investment in construction work in progress and growth in rate base since the last general rate case (GRC). 
 Depreciation expense was 18.0 million higher than the amount allowed in rates on an after-tax basis for the year ended December 31, 2022, for an impact on ROE of negative 0.4 . 
 Operations and maintenance expense, including production operations and maintenance, was 61.5 million higher than the amount allowed in rates on an after-tax basis for the year ended December 31, 2022, for an impact on ROE of negative 1.3 . 
 
 38 

The Company s 2021 return on AMA equity was 7.3 , which is lower than the authorized regulated ROE primarily due to the following: 
 Regulated equity (rate base multiplied by equity percent) was 630.3 million lower than AMA equity for the year ended December 31, 2021. The impact on ROE for this variance was negative 1.3 . The variance was primarily driven by investment in items that do not earn a return or earn a return that is less than the authorized ROE. Such items include investment in construction work in progress and growth in rate base since the last GRC. 
 Depreciation expense was 26.8 million higher than the amount allowed in rates on a pre-tax basis for the year ended December 31, 2021, for an impact on ROE of negative 0.6 . 
 
 Factors and Trends Affecting PSE s Performance 
 PSE s ongoing regulatory requirements and operational needs necessitated the investment of substantial capital in 2022 and will continue to do so in future years. Because PSE intends to seek recovery of such investments through the regulatory process, its financial results depend heavily upon favorable outcomes from that process. The principal business, economic and other factors that affect PSE s operations and financial performance include: 
 The rates PSE is allowed to charge for its services; 
 PSE s ability to recover power costs that are included in rates which are based on volume; 
 Weather conditions, including the impact of temperature on customer load; the impact of extreme weather events on budgeted maintenance costs; meteorological conditions such as snow-pack, stream-flow and wind-speed which affect power generation, supply and price; 
 The effects of climate change, including changes in the environment that may affect energy costs or consumption, increase the Company s costs, or adversely affect its operations; 
 Regulatory decisions allowing PSE to recover purchased power and fuel costs, on a timely basis; 
 PSE s ability to supply electricity and natural gas, either through company-owned generation, purchase power contracts or by procuring natural gas or electricity in wholesale markets; 
 Equal sharing between PSE and its customers of earnings which exceed PSE's authorized rate of return (ROR); 
 Availability and access to capital and the cost of capital; 
 Regulatory compliance costs, including those related to new and developing federal regulations of electric system reliability, state regulations of natural gas pipelines and federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations; 
 Wholesale commodity prices of electricity and natural gas; 
 Increasing capital expenditures with additional depreciation and amortization; 
 Failure to complete capital projects on schedule and within budget or the abandonment of capital projects, either of which could result in the Company s inability to recover project costs; 
 Tax reform, the effect of lower tax rates, and regulatory treatment of excess deferred tax balances on rate base and customer rates; 
 General economic conditions, such as inflation, in PSE's service territory and its effects on customer growth and use-per-customer; 
 Federal, state, and local taxes; 
 Employee workforce factors, including potential strikes, work stoppages, transitions in senior management, and loss or retirement of key personnel and availability of qualified personnel; 
 The effectiveness of PSE s risk management policies and procedures; 
 Cyber security attacks, data security breaches, or other malicious acts that cause damage to the Company s generation and transmission facilities or information technology systems, or result in the release of confidential customer, employee, or Company information; 
 Acts of war or terrorism locally or abroad, or the impact of civil unrest to infrastructure or preventing access to infrastructure and its impact on the supply chain and prices of goods and services; and 
 Risks due to pandemics, including supply shortages, rising costs, disruption to vendor or customer relationships, the potential for reputational harm, the impact of government, business and company closure of facilities, customer or contract defaults, concerns of safety to employees and customers, potential costs due to quarantining of employees and work-from-home policies, and the Company's and vendor staffing levels resulting from vaccination mandates. 
 
 39 

Regulation of PSE Rates and Recovery of PSE Costs 
 PSE's regulatory requirements and operational needs require the investment of substantial capital in 2022 and future years. As PSE intends to seek recovery of these investments through the regulatory process, its financial results depend heavily upon outcomes from that process. The rates that PSE is allowed to charge for its services influence its financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. PSE is highly regulated and the rates that it charges its retail customers are approved by the Washington Commission. The Washington Commission has traditionally required these rates be determined based, to a large extent, on historic test year costs plus weather normalized assumptions about hydroelectric conditions and power costs in the relevant rate year. Incremental customer growth and sales typically have not provided sufficient revenue to cover general cost increases over time due to the combined effects of regulatory lag and attrition. Absent a resolution for the impact of lag and attrition, the Company will need to seek rate relief through a rate case with the Washington Commission. The Washington Commission determines whether the Company's expenses and capital investments are reasonable and prudent for the provision of cost-effective, reliable and safe electric and natural gas service. If the Washington Commission determines that a capital investment is not reasonable or prudent, the costs (including return on any resulting rate base) related to such capital investment may be disallowed, partially or entirely, and not recovered in rates. 
 Washington state law also requires PSE to pursue electric conservation that is cost-effective, reliable and feasible. PSE s mandate to pursue electric conservation initiatives may have a negative impact on the electric business financial performance due to lost margins from lower sales volumes as variable power costs are not part of the decoupling mechanism. The Washington Commission and Washington state law also set natural gas conservation achievement standards for PSE. The effects of achieving these standards will, however, have only a slight negative impact on natural gas business financial performance due to the natural gas business being almost fully decoupled. 
 On May 3, 2021, the Washington Governor signed legislation passed by the state legislature that would require investor-owned utilities to file a multiyear rate plan for two, three, or four years as part of a GRC filed with the Washington Commission on or after January 1, 2022. For the initial rate year, the legislation requires the Washington Commission to ascertain and determine the fair value for rate-making purposes of the property in service as of the date that rates go into effect. Utilities would be bound to the first and second year of a multiyear rate plan and can file for a new rate plan in years three or four. If a company earns greater than a half percent above its authorized rate of return on a regulated basis, revenues above the level must be deferred for funds to customers or another determination by the Washington Commission in a subsequent adjudicative proceeding. The Washington Commission must also set performance measurements to assess a natural gas or electric company operating under a multiyear rate plan. 
 
 General Rate Case Filing 
 2022 GRC 
 PSE filed a GRC which includes a three-year multiyear rate plan with the Washington Commission on January 31, 2022, requesting an overall increase in electric and natural gas rates of 13.6 and 13.0 respectively in 2023; 2.5 and 2.3 , respectively in 2024; and 1.2 and 1.8 , respectively, in 2025. PSE requested a return on equity of 9.9 in all three rate years. PSE requested an overall rate of return of 7.39 in 2023; 7.44 in 2024; and 7.49 in 2025. The filing requested recovery of forecasted plant additions through 2022 as required by Revised Code of Washington (RCW) 80.28.425 as well as forecasted plant additions through 2025, the final year of the multiyear rate plan. 
 In August 2022, three separate partial multiparty settlement agreements were reached. On August 5, 2022, parties filed an unopposed partial multiparty settlement agreement relating to the Voluntary Long Term Renewable Energy Purchase rider, known as Green Direct, resolving the method for calculating the energy credit Green Direct customers receive, among other matters. On August 26, 2022, six of the sixteen parties, including PSE, filed a partial multiparty settlement agreement with the Washington Commission determining that the regulated portion of the Tacoma LNG Facility will be included in rates, as a tracker, beginning November 2023. Also, on August 26, 2022, twelve of the sixteen parties, including PSE, filed a partial multiparty settlement agreement with the Washington Commission for the remaining items in the GRC. The GRC settlement agreement set a two year rate plan instead of a three year plan as originally filed, provided a capital structure of 49.0 equity and 51.0 debt, and a return on equity of 9.4 with an overall rate of return of 7.16 . 
 On December 22, 2022, the Washington Commission issued an order on PSE s 2022 GRC which approved, with conditions, three settlement agreements which cover a two-year period beginning January 1, 2023. The ruling provided for a weighted cost of capital of 7.16 , or 6.62 after-tax, and a capital structure of 49.0 in common equity in 2023 and 49.5 in common equity in 2024, with a return on equity of 9.4 . The order also provided for an update to power costs in 2023 and 2024 and authorizes PSE to seek recovery of the costs related to the Tacoma LNG Facility concurrent with its 2023 PGA filing. PSE is also allowed to file two additional trackers that will request to recover all rate base, depreciation, and operations and maintenance (O M) expenses related to investments under the Company s Clean Energy Implementation Plan (CEIP) and Transportation Electrification Plan. 
 40 

On December 27, 2022 PSE submitted compliance filings, including an update to power costs, and revised tariff sheets to comply with the order. On January 6, 2023, the Washington Commission rejected the compliance filing, in part; and required a revised compliance filing specific to electric rates to remove an additional 135.8 million related to PSE s recovery of projected costs related to the modeling of the Climate Commitment Act s impacts on PSE s use of natural gas and coal-fired resources that had been included as part of PSE's update to power costs in the compliance filing. Per the order, PSE is allowed to either defer the 135.8 million in projected power costs and may submit a request for recovery of those costs either in its 90-day compliance filing for 2024 forecasted power costs or file a petition for Washington Commission review of these costs in a separate proceeding. 
 Natural gas rates became effective on January 7, 2023, resulting in a 70.8 million increase in natural gas base revenue in 2023 and a 19.5 million increase in 2024, representing increases of 6.4 and 1.65 , respectively. On January 10, 2023, the Washington Commission accepted the revised compliance filing with electric rates going into effect on January 11, 2023. The revisions reflected a final base electric revenue increase of 247.0 million in 2023 and 33.1 million in 2024, which represents an increase of 10.75 and 1.33 , respectively. 
 
 2019 GRC 
 PSE filed a GRC with the Washington Commission on June 20, 2019, requesting an overall increase in electric and natural gas rates of 6.9 and 7.9 respectively. On July 8, 2020, the Washington Commission issued its order on PSE s 2019 GRC. The ruling provided for a weighted cost of capital of 7.39 or 6.8 after-tax, and a capital structure of 48.5 in common equity with a return on equity of 9.4 . The order also resulted in a combined net increase to electric of 29.5 million, or 1.6 , and to natural gas of 36.5 million, or 4.0 . However, the Washington Commission extended the amortization of certain regulatory assets, PSE s electric decoupling deferral, and PSE s purchases gas adjustment (PGA) deferral to mitigate the impact of the rate increase in response to the economic uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic. This reduced the electric revenue increase to approximately 0.9 million, or 0.1 and the natural gas increase to 1.3 million, or 0.2 and became effective October 15, 2020 and October 1, 2020, respectively. 
 On August 6, 2020, PSE filed a petition for judicial review with the Superior Court of the State of Washington for King County challenging the portion of the final order that requires PSE to pass back to customers the reversal of plant-related excess deferred income taxes in a manner that may deviate from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) normalization and consistency rules. 
 PSE requested a Private Letter Ruling (PLR) from the IRS regarding this matter. On October 7, 2020, PSE, the Washington Commission and interveners agreed to dismiss the petition for judicial review. The agreement was based on a commitment from the Washington Commission that if the IRS ruling finds that the Washington Commission s methodology for reversing plant-related excess deferred income taxes is impermissible, the Washington Commission would open a proceeding to review and enact the changes required by the IRS ruling. There was approximately 25.6 million in annual revenue requirement related to the 2019 GRC, which PSE requested it be allowed to track and recover. 
 In July 2021, PSE received a Private Letter Ruling (PLR) from the IRS which concluded that in the 2019 GRC the Washington Commission s methodology for reversing plant-related excess deferred income taxes was an impermissible methodology under the IRS normalization and consistency rules. The PLR required adjustments to PSE's rates to bring PSE back into compliance with IRS rules. In September 2021, the Washington Commission amended its order in accordance with the PLR. The annualized overall rate impact was an increase of 15.8 million, or 0.7 , for electric and 3.1 million, or 0.3 , for natural gas for a total of 18.9 million with rates effective October 1, 2021. This led to an overall annualized net increase to electric rates of 77.1 million, or 3.7 , an increase of 17.5 million above the 59.6 million granted in the revised final order. The order also led to an overall annualized net increase to natural gas rates of 45.3 million, or 5.9 , an increase of 2.4 million above the 42.9 million granted in the revised final order. The Washington Commission maintained adjustments that mitigated the impacts of the rate increases in response to the economic instability created by the COVID-19 pandemic, which reduced the electric revenue increase to approximately 48.3 million, or 2.3 , and the natural gas increase to 4.9 million, or 0.6 . 
 For additional information, see Note 4, "Regulation and Rates" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. 
 
 Power Cost Only Rate Case 
 On December 9, 2020, PSE filed its 2020 power cost only rate case (PCORC). The filing proposed an increase of 78.5 million (or an average of approximately 3.7 in the Company's overall power supply costs with an anticipated effective date in June 2021. On February 2, 2021, PSE supplemented the PCORC to update its power costs, leading to a requested increase from 78.5 million to 88.0 million (or an average of approximately 4.1 ). 
 On March 2, 2021, several of the parties to the PCORC reached a multiparty settlement in principle, which was unopposed. The settlement resulted in an estimated revenue increase of 65.3 million or 3.1 . On June 1, 2021, the Washington

Commission issued its Final Order approving and adopting the settlement and authorizing and requiring a power cost update through a compliance filing. On June 17, 2021, PSE filed a compliance filing with the Washington Commission with a revenue increase of 70.9 million or 3.3 due to the update on power costs with rates effective July 1, 2021. 
 The 2022 GRC Order in Docket No. UE-220066, set PCORC rates to zero effective January 11, 2023 and PSE agreed not to file a PCORC during 2023 and 2024, the two-year rate plan agreed to in the GRC settlement. 
 
 Revenue Decoupling Adjustment Mechanism 
 On December 23, 2020, the Washington Commission approved PSE s filing to update Schedule 142 decoupling amortization rates, with an effective date of January 1, 2021, by zeroing out rates still effective past October 15, 2020 on tariff sheet Schedule 142-H, which was replaced by rates on tariff sheet Schedule 142-I effective October 15, 2020. PSE included a true up of the over-collection amounts for the period of October 15, 2020 through December 31, 2020 in PSE s annual May 2021 decoupling filing. 
 On June 1, 2021, the Washington Commission approved a multi-party settlement agreement in PSE's PCORC that was originally filed on December 9, 2020. As part of this settlement agreement, the electric annual fixed power cost allowed revenue was updated to reflect changes in the approved revenue requirement. The changes took effect on July 1, 2021. 
 On September 28, 2021, the Washington Commission approved 2019 GRC filing updated to PLR changes. As part of this filing, the annual electric and gas delivery cost allowed revenue was updated to reflect changes in the approved revenue requirement. The changes took effect on October 1, 2021. 
 On January 6, 2023, the Washington Commission approved the natural gas 2022 GRC filing. As part of this filing the annual gas delivery allowed revenue was updated to reflect changes in the approved revenue requirement. Additionally, the Commission approved the removal of the earnings test from the decoupling mechanism in accordance with RCW 80.28.425(6). The changes took effect on January 7, 2023. 
 On January 10, 2023, the Washington Commission approved the electric 2022 GRC filing. As part of this filing the annual electric delivery and fixed power cost allowed revenue was updated to reflect changes in the approved revenue requirement. Additionally, the Commission approved the removal of the earnings test from the decoupling mechanism in accordance with RCW 80.28.425(6). The changes took effect on January 11, 2023. 
 On December 31, 2022, PSE performed an analysis to determine if electric and natural gas decoupling revenue deferrals would be collected from customers within 24 months of the annual period, per ASC 980. If not, for GAAP purposes only, PSE would need to record a reserve against the decoupling revenue and regulatory asset balance. Once the reserve is probable of collection within 24 months from the end of the annual period, the reserve can be recognized as decoupling revenue. The analysis indicated that electric and natural gas deferred revenue will be collected within 24 months of the annual period; therefore, no reserve adjustment was booked to 2022 electric or natural gas decoupling revenue.

 Power Cost Adjustment Clause 
 PSE updated its Schedule 95 rates in the Power Cost Adjustment Clause tariff to reflect the transition fee as required by Section 12 of the Special Contract, a non-prescribed commercial/industrial rate contract. Additionally, Schedule 95 rates also include portions of fixed power cost adjustments per the allowed decoupling rate re-allocation resulting from a Special Contract customer becoming a transportation customer as well as small variable power cost adjustments. 
 PSE exceeded the 20.0 million cumulative deferral balance in its PCA mechanism in 2020. The surcharging of deferrals can be triggered by the Company when the balance in the deferral account is a credit of 20.0 million or more. During 2020, actual power costs were higher than baseline power costs, thereby creating an under-recovery of 76.1 million. Under the terms of the PCA s sharing mechanism for under-recovered power costs, PSE absorbed 32.1 million of the under-recovered amount, and customers were responsible for the remaining 44.0 million, or 46.0 million including interest. PSE filed to recover the deferred balance in Docket No. UE-210300, and the Washington Commission allowed the recovery effective December 1, 2021. 
 Additionally, PSE exceeded the 20.0 million cumulative deferral balance in its PCA mechanism in 2021. During 2021, actual power costs were higher than baseline power costs; thereby, creating an under-recovery of 68.0 million. Under the terms of the PCA s sharing mechanism for under-recovered power costs, PSE absorbed 31.3 million of the under-recovered amount, and customers were responsible for the remaining 36.7 million, or 38.4 million including interest. On October 27, 2022, the Washington Commission approved PSE's 2021 PCA report that proposes to recover the deferred balance for 2021 PCA period by keeping the current rates and allowing recovery from January 1, 2023 through November 30, 2023.

 ______________ 
 1. The Schedule 95 PCA mechanism rates from the prior year that recover the 2019 imbalance (effective December 1, 2020) have been extending through December 31, 2022 to recover the imbalance attributable to 2020. As of October 27, 2022 in UE-220308 Final Order, the Washington Commission approved to extend PCA imbalance rates to recover the PCA imbalance attributable to 2021 from January 1, 2023 to November 30, 2023. 
 2. The rates for the Electric Special Contract were zeroed out effective July 3, 2020 following the July 2019 through June 2020 period. The actual residual amount resulting at July 31, 2020 were included in the electric Schedule 129 Low Income Program rates that became effective October 1, 2020. 

Power Cost Adjustment Mechanism 
 PSE currently has a power cost adjustment (PCA) mechanism that provides for the deferral of power costs that vary from the power cost baseline level of power costs. The power cost baseline levels are set, in part, based on normalized assumptions about weather and hydroelectric conditions. Excess power costs or savings are apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to the graduated scale set forth in the PCA mechanism and will trigger a surcharge or refund when the cumulative deferral trigger is reached. 
 Effective January 1, 2017, the following graduated scale is used in the PCA mechanism: 
 Company s Share 
 Customers' Share Annual Power Cost Variability Over Under 
 Over Under Over or Under Collected by up to 17 million 100 100 
 Over or Under Collected by between 17 million - 40 million 35 50 
 
 65 50 Over or Under Collected beyond 40 + million 10 10 
 
 90 90 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, in its PCA mechanism, PSE under recovered its allowable costs by 110.1 million of which 74.6 million was apportioned to customers and 1.5 million of interest was accrued on the deferred customer balance. This compares to an under recovery of allowable costs of 68.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, of which 36.7 million was apportioned to customers and accrued 1.7 million interest on the total deferred customer balance.

Purchased Gas Adjustment 
 On October 28, 2021, the Washington Commission approved PSE's request for November 2021 PGA rates in Docket No. UG-210721, effective November 1, 2021. As part of that filing, PSE requested an annual revenue increase of 59.1 million; where PGA rates, under Schedule 101, increase annual revenue by 80.6 million, and the tracker rates under Schedule 106, decrease annual revenue by 21.5 million. 
 The annual 2021 PGA rate increases were in addition to continuing the collection on the remaining balance of 69.4 million under Supplemental Schedule 106B, which were set, in effect, through September 30, 2023 per the 2019 GRC. 
 On October 27, 2022, the Washington Commission approved PSE's request for PGA rates in Docket No. UG-220715, effective November 1, 2022. As part of that filing, PSE requested an annual revenue increase of 155.3 million; where PGA rates, under Schedule 101, increase annual revenue by 142.1 million, and the tracker rates under Schedule 106, increase annual revenue by 13.2 million. 
 On November 15, 2022, the FERC approved a settlement of a counterparty, FERC Docket No. RP17-346. Under the terms, PSE was allocated 24.2 million related to PSE natural gas services which was recorded on December 31, 2022 and included below. The 2022 GRC order requires PSE to amortize the refund in 2023 as a credit against natural gas costs and therefore pass back the refund to customers through the PGA mechanism.

 Other Proceedings 
 Voluntary Long-Term Renewable Energy 
 PSE offers Green Direct to larger customers (aggregated annual loads greater than 10,000-megawatt hours (MWh)) and government customers. The initial resource option offered under this rate schedule is a wind generation facility with the capacity of approximately 136.8 MW, which went into operation on November 7, 2020. The project is fully subscribed and the twenty-one customers under phase 1 of the program began taking service in November 2020. 
 The Washington Commission approved a second phase of the Green Direct product in 2018. The phase 2 project is the 150 MW Lund Hill Solar facility located in Klickitat County, Washington. The solar facility declared full commercial operations on October 19, 2022 and will serve an additional twenty customers who enrolled in 2018. On March 1, 2021, the associated power purchase agreement went into effect under an interim supply agreement for renewable energy delivered to PSE s system; and thus, the phase 2 customers began receiving renewable energy under their agreement on March 1, 2021. All 
 49 

Green Direct customers are now receiving a blend of the phase 1 wind and the renewable energy delivered under the phase 2 power purchase agreement. 
 
 Crisis Affected Customer Assistance Program 
 On April 6, 2020, PSE filed with the Washington Commission revisions to its currently effective electric and natural gas service tariffs. The purpose of this filing was to incorporate into PSE s low-income tariff a new temporary bill assistance program, Crisis Affected Customer Assistance Program (CACAP-1) (Dockets No. UE-200331 and UG-200332), to mitigate the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on PSE s customers. CACAP allowed PSE customers facing financial hardship due to COVID-19 to receive up to 1,000 in bill assistance. The program made available 11.0 million in unspent low income funds from prior years, therefore resulting in no rate impact, and supplemented other forms of financial assistance. CACAP-1 ran from April 13, 2020, to September 30, 2020. 
 On March 28, 2021, the Washington Commission approved PSE s CACAP-2 (Dockets No. UE-210137 and UG-210138). With a program budget of 20.0 million for electric customers and 7.7 million for natural gas customers, CACAP-2, which ran from April 12, 2021, to March 29, 2022, provided up to 2,500 per year in bill assistance for arrearages for each qualifying low-income household. 
 On October 15, 2021, PSE submitted for the Washington Commission s review and approval a Supplemental CACAP (Dockets No. UE-210792 and UG-210793) filing to continue assistance for PSE customers facing financial hardship due to COVID-19. The Washington Commission approved the Supplemental CACAP program to be effective on November 15, 2021. The Supplemental CACAP utilized carry-over funds not expended in any prior years under PSE s Schedule 129 Home Energy Lifeline Program (HELP), with a combined total budget of 34.5 million for both electric and natural gas residential customers (capped at 23.7 million and 10.8 million, respectively). Supplemental CACAP benefits offered to cover a qualifying residential customer s past due balance, up to 2,500. PSE applied the Supplemental CACAP benefits automatically, with an opt-out option, in December 2021. 
 For additional information, see Note 4, "Regulation and Rates" in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. 

Access to Debt Capital 
 PSE relies on access to bank borrowings and short-term money markets as sources of liquidity and longer-term capital markets to fund its utility construction program, to meet maturing debt obligations and other capital expenditure requirements not satisfied by cash flow from its operations or equity investment from its parent, Puget Energy. Neither Puget Energy nor PSE have any debt outstanding whose maturity would accelerate upon a credit rating downgrade. However, a ratings downgrade could adversely affect the Company's ability to refinance existing or issue new long-term debt, obtain access to new or renew existing credit facilities and could increase the cost of issuing long-term debt and maintaining credit facilities. For example, under Puget Energy's and PSE's credit facilities, the borrowing costs increase as their respective credit ratings decline due to increases in credit spreads and commitment fees. If PSE is unable to access debt capital on reasonable terms, its ability to pursue improvements or generating capacity acquisitions, which may be relied on for future growth and to otherwise implement its strategy, could be adversely affected. PSE monitors the credit environment and expects to continue to be able to access the capital markets to meet its short-term and long-term borrowing needs. For additional information, see "Financing Program" included in Item 7 of this report. 
 
 Regulatory Compliance Costs and Expenditures 
 PSE's operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations. These regulations cover electric system reliability, natural gas pipeline system safety and energy market transparency, among other areas. Environmental laws and regulations related to air and water quality, including climate change and endangered species protection, waste handling and disposal (including generation by-products such as coal ash), remediation of contamination and siting new facilities also impact the Company's operations. PSE must spend a significant amount of resources to fulfill requirements set by regulatory agencies, many of which have greatly expanded mandates on measures including resource planning, remediation, monitoring, pollution control equipment and emissions-related abatement and fees. 
 In 2021, the Washington Legislature adopted the Climate Commitment Act (CCA), which establishes a greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions cap-and-invest program that caps GHG emissions beginning on January 1, 2023 and makes further reductions to the cap annually through 2050. The Washington Department of Ecology (WDOE) published final regulations to implement the program on September 29, 2022, which became effective on October 30, 2022. WDOE also indicated that they will have subsequent rulemakings that will build off initial rulemaking as program implementation gets underway and progress with Washington State carbon goals are evaluated. See Part I Item 1 "Recent and Future Environmental Law and Regulation" in this report for further details on the CCA. Based on the rules passed in 2022, there is potential for PSE s compliance with the CCA to result in increased costs to customers or amounts that PSE may not be able to recover through electric and natural gas rates. Potential risks associated with CCA compliance could include: the evolving nature of the CCA rulemaking as indicated by 
 50 

WDOE, market uncertainty based on rule interpretation during implementation, unresolved recovery methodology for CCA s impact on energy costs, company costs, customer rate impacts, and cash, liquidity and credit volatility. 
 Compliance with these or other future regulations, such as those pertaining to climate change, could require significant capital expenditures by PSE and may adversely affect PSE's financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. 

Other Challenges and Strategies 
 Competition 
 PSE s electric and natural gas utility retail customers generally do not have the ability to choose their electric or natural gas supplier; therefore, PSE s business has historically been recognized as a natural and regulated monopoly. However, PSE faces competition from public utility districts and municipalities or efforts by citizens organizing to form such entities that want to establish their own government-owned utility, as a result of which PSE may lose a number of customers. PSE also faces increasing competition for sales to its retail customers through alternative methods of electric energy generation, including solar and other self-generation methods. In addition, PSE s natural gas customers may elect to use heating oil, propane or other fuels instead of using and purchasing natural gas from PSE. 

Results of Operations 
 Puget Sound Energy 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this document. The following discussion provides the significant items that impacted PSE s results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures Electric and Natural Gas Margins 
 The following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as two other financial measures, electric margin and natural gas margin, that are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance, financial position or cash flows that includes adjustments that result in a presentation that is not defined by GAAP. The presentation of electric margin and natural gas margin is intended to supplement an understanding of PSE s operating performance. Electric margin and natural gas margin are used by PSE to determine whether PSE is collecting the appropriate amount of revenue from its customers in order to provide adequate recovery of operating costs, including interest and equity returns. PSE s electric margin and natural gas margin measures may not be comparable to other companies electric margin and natural gas margin measures. Furthermore, these measures are not intended to replace operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance.

Electric Margin 
 Electric margin represents electric sales to retail and transportation customers less the cost of generating and purchasing electric energy sold to customers, including transmission costs to bring electric energy to PSE s service territory. 
 The following chart displays the changes in PSE s electric margin for the years ended December 31, 2021, to December 31, 2022: 
 
 _______________ 
 Includes decoupling cash collections, rate of return excess earnings, and decoupling 24-month revenue reserve. 
 
 2021 compared to 2022 
 Electric Operating Revenue 
 Electric operating revenues increased 289.8 million primarily due to increased retail sales of 150.9 million, sales to other utilities and marketers of 175.1 million, and other decoupling revenue of 5.4 million; partially offset by a decrease in decoupling revenue of 25.0 million and transportation and other revenue of 16.5 million. These items are discussed in detail below: 
 Electric retail sales increased 150.9 million due to an increase of 85.2 million in rates compared to the prior year and an increase of 65.7 million from an increase in retail electricity usage of 2.7 . The increase in rates is primarily due to the tariffs filed pursuant to the Company's 2021 PCORC effective July 1, 2021 and the conservation service rider effective May 1, 2022. See Management's Discussion and Analysis, "Regulation of PSE Rates and Recovery of PSE Costs" included in Item 7 of this report for rate changes. The increase in retail usage was due to an increase in residential and commercial usage of 2.4 and 3.3 , respectively. Residential usage increased due to a 5.5 increase in heating degree days due to lower than normal temperatures, primarily in the 2nd quarter of 2022 and a 6.6 increase in cooling degree days due to higher than normal temperatures, primarily in the 3rd quarter of 2022. The increase in commercial usage was driven by employees returning to work after business shut downs and lack of staffing in 2021 due to COVID-19. 
 53 

Sales to other utilities and marketers increased 175.1 million primarily due to a 109.6 increase in electric wholesale sale price driven by a nationwide increase in natural gas price, that fuel natural gas-fired electric generation, following worldwide natural gas supply constraints along with increased demand from overseas markets. Additionally, wholesale sale volumes increased 1.8 . 
 Decoupling revenue decreased 25.0 million, primarily attributable to a 7.7 million and 17.3 million decrease in delivery and fixed production cost (FPC) deferral revenues, respectively. This was driven mainly by lower allowed revenue per customer and increased usage for delivery deferral revenues as well as increased usage for FPC deferral revenues. This resulted in allowed revenues being lower than actual decoupling deferral revenues by a greater margin in the current year compared to the prior year. 
 Other decoupling revenue increased 5.4 million, primarily due to the amortization of prior year residential delivery overcollections beginning in May 2022. This was partially offset by a 2.0 million decrease related to GAAP alternative revenue program recognition guidelines. As of the year ended December 31, 2021, there were 8.0 million of deferred 2020 GAAP alternative decoupling revenues that were recognized, which was partially offset by 3.0 million in deferred 2021 GAAP alternative decoupling revenues. As of the year ended December 31, 2022, there were 3.0 million of deferred 2021 GAAP alternative decoupling revenues that were recognized. 
 Transportation and other revenue decreased 16.5 million primarily due to no production tax credit (PTC) deferral revenue for the re-purpose of the PTCs in 2022 compared to 45.6 million in 2021 and a decrease of 32.6 million related to the IRS PLR which includes revenue recognition in 2021, see Management's Discussion and Analysis, "Regulation of PSE Rates and Recovery of PSE Costs" included in Item 7 of this report. The decreases were partially offset by an increase in net wholesale non-core natural gas sales of 62.1 million, which was primarily due to a 130.8 million increase in wholesale sales driven by a 2.8 increase in gas sales volume at an average price that was 71.8 higher in 2022 compared to 2021 and a 107.7 million increase in the cost of gas sold, which was also due to a higher average price and increased volumes. Additionally, the increase in the net whole non-core gas sales was also driven by a 39.0 million increase in gas financial hedging gains. 
 
 Electric Power Costs 
 Electric power costs increased 324.6 million primarily due to an increase of 254.2 million of purchased electricity costs, 65.9 million of electric generation fuel costs and a decrease in residential exchange credits of 4.5 million. These items are discussed in detail below: 
 Purchased electricity expense increased 254.2 million due to a 17.0 increase in wholesale electric purchase volumes and a 13.0 increase in average wholesale purchase prices. The increase in volume was driven by a 25.8 increase in Mid-Columbia hydro, increased wind purchase volumes from Golden Hills and Clearwater, which commenced operations in 2022, and Powerex energy purchases that were added in 2022. Purchase volumes increased due to a combination of an increase in load of 1.8 and a decrease in natural gas-fired generation volume of 17.5 , due to lower market heat rates as natural gas prices increased at a higher rate than power prices. The increase in wholesale purchase prices of 13.0 was primarily due to the aforementioned increase in nationwide natural gas prices, which led to increases in all power prices. 
 Electric generation fuel expense increased 65.9 million driven by an 8.1 million increase in Colstrip Units 3 and 4 variable fuel expense due to a 6.1 increase in coal fuel burned and a 12.0 increase in the average price per ton. Additionally, natural gas-fired generation fuel costs increased 57.6 million as unit production costs were 51.2 higher due to higher natural gas prices, as discussed above in sales to other utilities. This increase was partially offset by a 17.5 reduction in natural gas-fired generation volumes driven by lower market heat rates. 
 Residential exchange credits decreased by 4.5 million due to a 0.4 change in the amount of credits to be passed back to customers effective November 1, 2021, see Management's Discussion and Analysis, "Regulation of PSE Rates and Recovery of PSE Costs" included in Item 7 of this report; partially offset by an increase in residential usage of 2.4 as discussed above in electric retail sales. 
 
 54 

Natural Gas Margin 
 Natural gas margin is natural gas sales to retail and transportation customers less the cost of natural gas purchased, including transportation costs to bring natural gas to PSE s service territory. The PGA mechanism passes through increases or decreases in the natural gas supply portion of the natural gas service rates to customers based upon changes in the price of natural gas purchased from producers and wholesale marketers or changes in natural gas pipeline transportation costs. PSE's margin or net income is not affected by changes under the PGA mechanism because over- and under- recoveries of natural gas costs included in baseline PGA rates are deferred and either refunded or collected from customers, respectively, in future periods. 
 The following chart displays the changes in PSE s natural gas margin for the years ended December 31, 2021, to December 31, 2022: 
 
 _______________ 
 Includes decoupling cash collections, rate of return excess earnings, and decoupling 24-month revenue reserve. 
 
 2021 compared to 2022 
 Natural Gas Operating Revenue 
 Natural gas operating revenue increased 142.2 million primarily due to higher retail sales of 149.7 million and transportation and other revenue of 10.6 million. This increase was partially offset by decreased decoupling revenue of 14.3 million and other decoupling revenue of 3.8 million. These items are discussed in the following details: 
 Natural gas retail sales increased 149.7 million due to an increase in rates of 92.8 million and an increase in natural gas load of 5.2 or 56.9 million of natural gas sales. The increase in rates is due to the tariffs filed pursuant to the Company's most recent CRM and PGA effective November 1, 2021 and Conservation rider effective May 1, 2022, see Management's Discussion and Analysis, "Regulation of PSE Rates and Recovery of PSE Costs" included in Item 7 of this report for natural gas rate changes. The increase in load is driven by an increase of commercial and residential usage of 9.2 and 3.5 , respectively. The increase in commercial usage was largely due to employees returning to work after business shut downs and lack of staffing in 2021 due to COVID-19. Residential usage 
 55 

increased due to an 5.5 increase in heating degree days due to lower than normal temperatures, primarily in the 2nd quarter of 2022. 
 Decoupling revenue decreased 14.3 million, primarily attributable to increased usage in 2022 and lower allowed revenue per customer compared to 2021. This resulted in actual natural gas revenues being higher than allowed natural gas revenues in the current period, whereas in 2021, actual revenues were lower than allowed revenues. 
 Other decoupling revenue decreased 3.8 million due to an increase in current period amortization of prior year revenues compared to 2021. This is attributable to increased usage in 2022 as well as increased amortization rates, both of which increase the rate at which deferral revenues are recovered from customers. 
 Transportation and other revenue increased 10.6 million primarily due to LNG return deferral revenue of 18.9 million which started in 2022; partially offset by a decrease of 6.2 million related to the IRS PLR which included revenue recognition in 2021 and amortization of the PLR to offset recovery through rates in 2022, see Management's Discussion and Analysis, "Regulation of PSE Rates and Recovery of PSE Costs" included in Item 7 of this report. 
 
 Natural Gas Energy Costs 
 Purchased natural gas expense increased 102.3 million due to an increase in the PGA rates in November 2021 and an increase in natural gas usage of 5.2 as stated in the natural gas retail sales section above. 
 
 56 

Other Operating Expenses and Other Income (Deductions) 
 The following chart displays the details of PSE's other operating expenses and other income (deductions) for the years ended December 31, 2021, to December 31, 2022: 

2021 compared to 2022 
 Other Operating Expenses 
 Net unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments increased 247.4 million to a net gain of 261.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The primary driver was the change in the weighted average forward prices for electric and natural gas. Specifically, electric prices increased 128.1 resulting in 236.3 million in gain for electric. Natural gas prices increased 5.3 resulting in 117.1 million in gain for natural gas. These gains were partially offset by the net settlement of electric trades that were previously recorded as 24.0 million in gain and natural gas trades previously recorded as 82.0 million in gain. 
 Utility Operations and Maintenance expense increased 35.4 million primarily due to increases of (i) 9.8 million in customer service expenses primarily driven by increased low income assistance; (ii) 6.2 million increase in the non-service cost component of the qualified pension net periodic benefit cost in 2022 compared to 2021; (iii) 5.3 million of other generation maintenance costs due to increased wind turbine maintenance; (iv) 5.0 million in administrative and general expenses due to additional vice presidents, incentive and merit increases and IT costs related to technology growth and resumption of training and travel expenses in 2022 compared to 2021; (v) 4.8 million in Washington Commission filing fees related to GRC filings; and (vi) 2.4 million in miscellaneous distribution operations expenses due to training costs specific to electric operations. 
 Non-utility and other expense decreased 9.0 million primarily due to 12.9 million expenses associated with a 2021 PWI land sale, which was comprised of 11.0 million for the cost of the sale and 1.9 million of selling expenses. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of 3.9 million related to biogas purchase expense. 
 57 

Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 33.2 million primarily driven by: (i) electric amortization decreased by 45.5 million or 51.7 from 2021, primarily driven by 45.6 million less Production Tax Credit (PTC) amortization in 2022 as PSE fully utilized its PTC balance in 2021; (ii) common amortization decreased by 18.4 million or 20.6 from 2021, primarily driven by 25.1 million in net retirements of common technology assets. The Company invested heavily in technology solutions from 2017 - 2019, with a majority of useful lives between 3-5 years; and (iii) natural gas amortization decreased by 6.9 million or 41.6 from 2021, primarily driven by the 5.5 million LNG depreciation expense deferral combined with net retirements of 20.1 million in natural gas technology assets. The decreases were partially offset by (i) conservation amortization increased by 13.8 million due to conservation rider rates effective May 1, 2022, see Management's Discussion and Analysis, "Regulation of PSE Rates and Recovery of PSE Costs" included in Item 7 of this report; (ii) natural gas distribution depreciation increased by 10.7 million or 8.5 from 2021, primarily due to 242.0 million in LNG net additions combined with 175.2 million in net additions in gas distribution assets; (iii) electric distribution depreciation increased a net of 6.4 million or 4.2 from 2021, primarily due to 267.1 million in net additions of electric distribution assets; (iv) electric production depreciation increased a net of 3.3 million or 2.4 from 2021, primarily due to 19.2 million in net additions of electric production assets; and (v) common general plant depreciation increased a net of 2.7 million or 9.6 from 2021, primarily due to 42.1 million in general plant additions offset by 45.0 million in retirements. 
 Taxes other than income taxes increased 25.6 million primarily due to an increase of 13.8 million related to municipal taxes driven by the increase in retail revenue in 2022 as compared to 2021 and 10.1 million related to the state excise tax. 
 
 Other Income, Interest Expense and Income Tax Expense 
 Other income/expense decreased 14.9 million from net other income of 32.0 million in 2021 to 17.1 million in 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by (i) 7.1 million other income decrease due to a change in AMI return deferral per the 2022 GRC; (ii) 6.8 million other income decrease related to the deferred return for Puget LNG, per Washington Commission Docket No. UG-210918; (iii) 3.2 million other expense increase in non-utility write-offs driven by the Colstrip dry ash facilities exclusion from recovery in rate base per the 2022 GRC; and (iv) 3.1 million other income decrease in Washington Commission allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) due to a decrease in Washington Commission AFUDC rates in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. These increases were partially offset by (i) a decrease of 6.2 million in the non-service cost component of the qualified pension net periodic benefit cost for 2022 compared to 2021. 
 Interest expense increased 6.4 million primarily due to an increase of 9.2 million related to the PSE 450.0 million 
 senior secured notes issued on September 15, 2021. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of 2.9 million related to interest expense recognized in conjunction with PSE's deferred compensation liability. 
 Income tax expense increased 36.0 million primarily driven by an increase in pre-tax book income. 
 
 58 

Puget Energy 
 Substantially all the operations of Puget Energy are conducted through its regulated subsidiary, PSE. Puget Energy s results of operation for the years ended December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2022, were as follows: 
 
 2021 compared to 2022 
 Summary Results of Operations 
 Puget Energy s net income increased by 153.6 million, which is primarily attributable to an increase in PSE's net income of 154.9 million and a decrease in interest expense of 20.1 million which is a result of lower interest rates on outstanding debt as Puget Energy repaid 500.0 million of 6.00 notes and issued 500.0 million of senior secured notes at an interest rate of 2.379 in June 2021; and Puget Energy repaid 450.0 million 5.625 notes in April 2022 and issued 450.0 million 4.224 notes in March 2022. Additionally, Puget Energy repaid a 210.0 million term loan in June 2021. For further details, see Note 7, "Long-Term Debt" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. These increases were partially offset by an increase in net loss of 16.0 million at PLNG due to additional operational expenses as PLNG commenced commercial operations in February 2022 and a decrease in income tax benefit of 3.5 million due to an increase in taxable income.

 1. As of December 31, 2022, PSE had a credit facility which provides 800.0 million of short-term liquidity needs and includes a backstop to the Company's commercial paper program. The credit facility matures in May 2027. The credit facility also includes a swingline feature allowing same day availability on borrowings up to 75.0 million and an expansion feature that, upon the banks' approval, would increase the total size of the facility to 1.4 billion. As of December 31, 2022, no loans or letters of credit were outstanding under the credit facility and 357.0 million was outstanding under the commercial paper program. The credit agreement is syndicated among numerous lenders. Outside of the credit agreement, PSE has a 2.3 million letter of credit in support of a long-term transmission contract and had 28.0 million issued under a standby letter of credit in support of natural gas purchases. 
 2. As of December 31, 2022, PSE had a revolving credit facility with Puget Energy in the form of a promissory note to borrow up to 30.0 million. 
 3. As of December 31, 2022, Puget Energy had a revolving senior secured credit facility totaling 800.0 million, which matures in May 2027. The revolving senior secured credit facility is syndicated among numerous lenders. The revolving senior secured credit facility also has an expansion feature that, upon the banks' approval, would increase the size of the facility to 1.3 billion. As of December 31, 2022, there was 118.6 million drawn and outstanding under the Puget Energy credit facility, of which 34.3 million was classified as long-term debt and 84.3 million was classified as short-term debt. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company's financial condition. 
 
 Utility Construction Program 
 The Company s construction programs for generating facilities, the electric transmission system, the natural gas and electric distribution systems and the Tacoma LNG facility are designed to meet regulatory requirements, support customer growth and to improve energy system reliability. The Company's capital expenditures were 18.6 million higher than forecasted amounts for 2022. The increase was primarily due to (i) higher storm and weather related outage emergent response; (ii) accelerated thermal generation maintenance and (iii) technology expenditures related to compliance with the Climate Commitment Act, project management, and check-processing software. Construction expenditures, excluding equity allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC), totaled 1.0 billion in 2022. Presently planned utility construction expenditures, excluding equity AFUDC, are as follows: 
 
 Capital Expenditure Projections (Dollars in Millions) 2023 2024 2025 Total energy delivery, technology and facilities expenditures 1,146.7 1,311.9 1,304.2 
 
 The program is subject to change based upon general business, economic and regulatory conditions. Utility construction expenditures and any new generation resource expenditures may be funded from a combination of sources, which may include cash from operations, short-term debt, long-term debt and/or equity. PSE s planned capital expenditures may result in a level of spending that will exceed its cash flow from operations. As a result, execution of PSE s strategy is dependent in part on continued access to capital markets.

 Year Ended December 31, 2022, compared to 2021 
 Cash generated from operations decreased by 102.9 million, including a net income increase of 154.9 million. The following are significant factors that impacted PSE's cash flows from operations: 
 Cash flow adjustments resulting from non-cash items decreased 215.3 million primarily due to: (i) a 247.4 million change from a net unrealized gain on derivative instruments of 13.8 million to a net unrealized gain on derivative instruments of 261.2 million, (ii) a decrease in depreciation and amortization of 47.0 million, and (iii) a deferral of return and depreciation expenses for PSE's share of Tacoma LNG investment of 12.1 million. The decreases were partially offset by: (i) a 45.6 million change in PTC utilization, (ii) a 24.5 million change related to recognition of regulatory asset in 2021 as a result of the IRS PLR that concluded the EDIT methodology included in rates following the 2019 GRC order was impermissible, (iii) increased conservation amortization of 13.8 million, and (iv) deferred taxes of 6.5 million. For further discussion, see "Other Operating Expenses" in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis. 
 Cash flows resulting from changes in working capital decreased 86.1 million primarily due: (i) a cash outflow of 155.8 million in account receivable as its balance increased 252.3 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 compared to an increase of 96.5 million during the same period of 2021; the increase was related to higher wholesale sales of natural gas in November and December of 2022 driven by lower temperatures and higher wholesale prices, (ii) higher balances in materials and supplies and fuel and natural gas inventory increased cash outflows by 23.9 million and 23.1 million respectively, and (iii) increased tax payments of 43.1 million as the result of higher profit in 2022 compared to 2021 and increased Washington state property and utility taxes. The cash outflows were partially offset by (i) an increase in accounts payable of 136.6 million, which was driven by higher sales volumes and increased wholesale energy prices, (ii) higher accrued salary and wages of 7.2 million, (iii) higher short-term accrual for the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan of 4.7 million, (iv) increased annual Washington Commission filing fee payables of 5.9 million, and (v) lower prepayment balances of 5.2 million. 
 Cash flows resulting from regulatory assets and liabilities increased 36.3 million primarily due to: (i) a 19.6 million cash inflow was related to changes in deferral of storm excess costs, (ii) a 26.1 million increase in low income program as result of accrued higher cost in 2021 to assist pandemic (COVID-19) affected families, (iii) lower expenses and higher amortization led to an increase of 14.5 million cash inflow in property tax tracker, (iv) amortizing IRS PLR deferral balances contributed an addition of 14.3 million cash inflow, see Management's Discussion and Analysis, "Regulation of PSE Rates and Recovery of PSE Costs" included in Item 7 of this report. The cash inflows were partially offset by a year-over-year change in power cost adjustment receivable, which was relatively flat in 2021, 3.3 million), and 32.6 million higher in 2022, resulting in a net cash outflow of 35.9 million.

Cash flow resulting from purchased gas adjustment increased 7.5 million, which was driven by an increase in allowed PGA recovery that exceeded the increase in actual gas cost in 2022 compared to 2021. Increased natural gas prices and higher sales volume led to a 93.1 million increase in actual gas costs in 2022 compared to 2021. Meanwhile, the total amount of allowed PGA recovery in 2022 increased 100.6 million compared to 2021. The combined effect led to year-over-year cash inflow.

 Year Ended December 31, 2022, compared to 2021 
 Cash generated from operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, in addition to the changes discussed at PSE above, increased by 46.0 million compared to the same period in 2021, which includes a net income decrease of 1.4 million. The remaining change was primarily impacted by the factors explained below: 
 Non-cash items increased 18.4 million primarily due to an increase of 12.6 million in deferred taxes and an increase in amortization and depreciation of 5.5 million. 
 Changes in cash flow resulting from working capital increased 27.6 million primarily due to: (i) a 13.8 million increase due to the change in PSE's intercompany account receivable and account payable balances with Puget LNG and Puget Energy, which are eliminated upon consolidation of Puget Energy, (ii) changes in tax payable added 15.1 million cash inflow, (iii) cash inflow of 3.5 million driven by reduction of accrued interest expense as result of lower interest rates on debt, as Puget Energy repaid 500.0 million of 6.00 notes and issued 500.0 million of senior secured notes at an interest rate of 2.379 in June, 2021. Additionally, Puget Energy used an equity contribution from Puget Equico to pay off a 210.0 million term loan in June, 2021. The cash inflows were partially offset by cash outflow of 3.9 million as result of Puget LNG commenced commercial operations in February 2022 and accrued 3.9 million in account receivable as of December 31, 2022. 

Financing Program 
 The Company s external financing requirements principally reflect the cash needs of its construction program, its schedule of maturing debt and certain operational needs. The Company anticipates refinancing the redemption of bonds or other long-term borrowings with its credit facilities and/or the issuance of new long-term debt. Access to funds depends upon factors such as Puget Energy s and PSE s credit ratings, prevailing interest rates and investor receptivity to investing in the utility industry, Puget Energy and PSE. The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity through its credit facilities and access to capital markets to fund its needs over the next twelve months. 
 Proceeds from PSE s short-term borrowings and sales of commercial paper are used to provide working capital and the interim funding of utility construction programs. Puget Energy and PSE continue to have reasonable access to the capital and credit markets. 
 Proceeds from PSE s short-term borrowings and sales of commercial paper are used to provide working capital and the interim funding of utility construction programs. Puget Energy and PSE continue to have reasonable access to the capital and credit markets. As a result of the prolonged economic stresses of the COVID-19 pandemic and recent inflationary pressures, the company continues to closely monitor cash receipts from customers and any impacts on the Company s liquidity which may affect its ability to fund safe, reliable, and dependable service for our customers. 
 63 

As a result of the 2019 GRC outcome and the continuing negative impacts of tax reform on the Company's cash flows, Puget Energy and PSE's credit rating metrics were negatively impacted. In response to the 2019 GRC order, Moody's released an issuer comment stating the GRC outcome was credit negative but took no formal credit rating action. On July 23, 2020, S P placed Puget Energy and PSE on CreditWatch with negative implications due the rate case outcome, but later revised to negative outlook. Fitch affirmed Puget Energy and PSE ratings but changed its outlook from stable to negative. On May 27, 2021, S P revised Puget Energy s and PSE s ratings from negative to stable outlook. On June 1, 2021, Fitch also revised its outlook for PE and PSE to stable. Both actions were a result of the passage and signing into law of Washington Senate Bill 5295 which allows for multi-year rate plans and reduction of regulatory lag, as well as other actions taken by management to increase revenue via available rate recovery methods and management of internal expenses. Despite these actions, the rating agencies noted that a lack of sufficient regulatory rate relief over the relative near term could result in negative ratings implications. Although neither Puget Energy nor PSE have any debt whose maturity would be accelerated upon a ratings downgrade, a credit rating downgrade may increase the cost of borrowing for Puget Energy and PSE in future long-term financings or under their existing credit facilities. Any increase in the cost of borrowing may negatively impact Puget Energy and PSE's future results of operations and could negatively impact their future liquidity, access to debt capital resources and financial condition. Additionally, a ratings downgrade could impact the Company's ability to issue dividends, see Dividend Payment Restriction below for further details. A downgrade to Puget Energy and PSE's credit ratings would not impact debt covenants under our existing credit facilities nor would it impact other contracts, as neither include credit rating triggering event clauses. A credit rating decrease for PSE could result in increased cash collateral required for commodity contracts, which would adversely affect PSE's liquidity. Management continually monitors the credit rating environment for both Puget Energy and PSE, but cannot predict with certainty the actions credit agencies may take, if any, in response to weaker near term credit metrics, regulatory and rate recovery uncertainties, and management's efforts to contain the growth of capital and operating expenditures. Containing the growth of capital and operating expenditures will be limited, over the near term, due to continuing strategic and risk mitigation imperatives and the necessity of providing safe, reliable and resilient service levels to customers, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 For information on Puget Energy and PSE dividends, long-term debt and credit facilities, see Note 5, Dividend Payment Restrictions, Note 7, Long-term Debt and Note 8, Liquidity Facilities and Other Financing Arrangements to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. 
 
 Debt Restrictive Covenants 
 The type and amount of future long-term financings for PSE may be limited by provisions in PSE's electric and natural gas mortgage indentures. 
 PSE s ability to issue additional secured debt may also be limited by certain restrictions contained in its electric and natural gas mortgage indentures. Under the most restrictive tests, at December 31, 2022, PSE could issue: 
 Approximately 1.9 billion of additional first mortgage bonds under PSE s electric mortgage indenture based on approximately 3.2 billion of electric bondable property available for issuance, subject to an interest coverage ratio limitation of 2.0 times net earnings available for interest (as defined in the electric utility mortgage), which PSE exceeded at December 31, 2022; and 
 Approximately 1.0 billion of additional first mortgage bonds under PSE s natural gas mortgage indenture based on approximately 1.7 billion of natural gas bondable property available for issuance, subject to a combined natural gas and electric interest coverage test of 1.75 times net earnings available for interest and a natural gas interest coverage test of 2.0 times net earnings available for interest (as defined in the natural gas utility mortgage), both of which PSE exceeded at December 31, 2022. 
 At December 31, 2022, PSE had approximately 8.6 billion in electric and natural gas rate base to support the interest coverage ratio limitation test for net earnings available for interest. 
 
 Shelf Registrations 
 On March 10, 2022, Puget Energy filed an S-3 Registration statement under which it may issue up to 1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes secured by Puget Energy's assets. As of the date of this report, 550.0 million was available to be issued. The shelf registration will expire in March 2025. 
 In August 2022, PSE filed an S-3 shelf registration statement under which it may issue up to 1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes secured by first mortgage bonds. As of the date of this report, 1.4 billion was available to be issued. The shelf registration will expire in August 2025.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements. Management believes the following accounting policies are particularly important to the financial statements and require the use of estimates, assumptions and judgment to describe matters that are inherently uncertain. 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Operating utility revenue is recognized when the basis of service is rendered, which includes estimated unbilled revenue. PSE's estimate of unbilled revenue is based on a calculation using meter readings from its automated meter reading system. The estimate calculates unbilled usage at the end of each month as the difference between the customer meter readings on the last day of the month and the last customer meter readings billed during the month less unbilled revenues recorded in the prior month. The "current" month unbilled usage is then priced at published rates for each schedule to estimate the unbilled revenues by customer. 
 Certain revenues from PSE's electric and natural gas operations are subject to a revenue decoupling mechanism under which PSE's actual energy delivery revenues related to electric transmission and distribution, natural gas operations and general administrative costs are compared with authorized revenues allowed under the mechanism. The mechanism mitigates volatility in revenue due to weather and gross margin erosion related to energy efficiency. Any differences are deferred to a regulatory asset for under recovery or a regulatory liability for over recovery. Revenues associated with power costs under the PCA mechanism and PGA rates are excluded from the decoupling mechanism. 
 As defined by ASC 980, Regulated Operations (ASC 980), the decoupling mechanism is an alternative revenue program that allows billings to be adjusted for the effects of weather abnormalities, conservation efforts or other various external factors. PSE adjusts these billings in the future in response to these effects to collect additional revenues provided under the decoupling mechanism. Once billing of additional revenues under the decoupling mechanism is permitted, the additional revenue can be recognized when the following criteria specified by ASC 980 are met: (i) the program is established by an order from the Washington Commission that allows for automatic adjustment of future rates, (ii) the amount of additional revenues for the period is objectively determinable and is probable of recovery and (iii) the additional revenues will be collected within 24 months following the end of the annual period in which they are recognized. PSE meets the criteria to recognize revenue under the decoupling mechanism. The Company will not record any decoupling revenue that is expected to take longer than 24 months to collect following the end of the annual period in which the revenues would have otherwise been recognized. Once determined to be collectible within 24 months, any previously non-recorded amounts will be recorded. 
 For further discussion regarding revenue recognition, see Note 3, "Revenue", to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. 
 
 Regulatory Accounting 
 As a regulated entity of the Washington Commission and the FERC, PSE prepares its financial statements in accordance with the provisions of ASC 980. The application of ASC 980 results in differences in the timing and recognition of certain revenue and expenses in comparison with businesses in other industries. The rates that are charged by PSE to its customers are based on cost base regulation reviewed and approved by the Washington Commission and the FERC. Under the authority of these commissions, PSE has recorded certain regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31, 2022, in the amount of 896.4 million and 1,961.1 million, respectively, and regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31, 2021, of 952.5 million and 1,709.5 million, respectively. Such amounts are amortized through a corresponding liability or asset account, respectively, with no impact to earnings. PSE expects to fully recover its regulatory assets and liabilities through its rates. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, PSE would be required to write off these regulatory assets and liabilities. In addition, if PSE determines that it no longer meets the criteria for continued application of ASC 980, PSE could be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities related to those operations not meeting ASC 980 requirements. 
 Also encompassed by regulatory accounting and subject to ASC 980 are the PCA and PGA mechanisms. The PCA and PGA mechanisms mitigate the impact of commodity price volatility upon the Company and are approved by the Washington Commission. The PCA mechanism provides for a sharing of costs that vary from baseline rates over a graduated scale. For further discussion regarding the PCA mechanism, see Management's Discussion and Analysis, "Regulation of PSE Rates and Recovery of PSE Costs" included in Item 7 of this report. The increases and decreases in the cost of natural gas supply are reflected in customer bills through the PGA mechanism. PSE expects to fully recover/refund these regulatory balances through its rates. However, both mechanisms are subject to regulatory review and approval by the Washington Commission on a periodic basis. 
 
 65 

Derivatives 
 ASC 815 requires that all contracts considered to be derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value unless the contracts qualify for an exception. The Company enters into derivative contracts to manage its energy resource portfolio and interest rate exposure including forward physical and financial contracts and swaps. Some of PSE s physical electric supply contracts qualify for the normal purchase normal sale (NPNS) exception to derivative accounting rules. Generally, NPNS applies to contracts with creditworthy counterparties, for which physical delivery is probable and in quantities that will be used in the normal course of business. Power purchases designated as NPNS must meet additional criteria to determine if the transaction is within PSE s forecasted load requirements and if the counterparty owns or controls energy resources within the Western Interconnection to allow for physical delivery of the energy. PSE may enter into financial fixed contracts to economically hedge the variability of certain index-based contracts. Those contracts that do not meet the NPNS exception are marked-to-market to current earnings in the statements of income. Natural gas derivative contracts qualify for deferral under ASC 980 due to the PGA mechanism. 
 PSE values derivative instruments based on daily quoted prices from an independent external pricing service. The Company regularly confirms the validity of pricing service quoted prices (e.g. Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy) used to value commodity contracts to the actual prices of commodity contracts entered into during the most recent quarter. When external quoted market prices are not available for derivative contracts, PSE uses a valuation model that uses volatility assumptions relating to future energy prices based on specific energy markets and utilizes externally available forward market price curves. All derivative instruments are sensitive to market price fluctuations that can occur on a daily basis. The Company is focused on commodity price exposure and risks associated with volumetric variability in the natural gas and electric portfolios. PSE is not engaged in the business of assuming risk for the purpose of speculative trading. The Company economically hedges open natural gas and electric positions to reduce both the portfolio risk and the volatility risk in prices. The exposure position is determined by using a probabilistic risk system that models 250 simulations of how the Company s natural gas and power portfolios will perform under various weather, hydrological and unit performance conditions. 
 For additional information, see Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk," Note 10, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" and Note 11, "Fair Value Measurements" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. 
 
 Environmental Remediation 
 The Company is subject to federal and state requirements for protection of the environment, including those for discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. A potentially responsible party has joint and several liability under existing U.S. environmental laws. In instances where we have been designated a potentially responsible party by the Environmental Protection Agency or state environmental agency, we are potentially liable for the cost of remediating contamination at current work sites and former work sites. Such sites include former manufactured gas plants operated by PSE predecessors, such as Gas Works Park on the shore of Lake Union in Seattle, or contaminated facilities with other connections to PSE predecessors, such as the location of a long-defunct creosote manufacturer which had purchased waste products from PSE predecessors, the Quendall Terminals site on Lake Washington in Renton, Washington. In each case, PSE assesses, based on in-depth studies, expert analyses and legal reviews, our environmental remediation obligations related to contaminated sites, including assessments of ranges and probabilities of recoveries from other responsible parties and/or insurance carriers. PSE develops a range of reasonably estimable costs that includes a low and high end of a range for all remediation sites for which we have sufficient information. There are some potential remediation obligations where the costs of remediation cannot be reasonably estimated. Liabilities are recorded based on the best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible costs expected to be incurred to remediate sites. It s possible that costs are incurred in excess of the recorded amounts because of changes in laws and/or regulations, higher than expected costs and/or the discovery of new or additional contamination. The Company believes a significant portion of its past and future environmental remediation costs are recoverable from insurance companies, from third parties or from customers under a Washington Commission order. 
 For additional information see Note 4, "Regulation and Rates" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. 
 
 Fair Value 
 ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). However, as permitted under ASC 820, the Company utilizes a mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point price between bid and ask prices) as a practical expedient for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value. The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable. The Company primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements as it believes that 
 66 

this approach is used by market participants for these types of assets and liabilities. Accordingly, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. For further discussion on market risk, see Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" in this report. 
 
 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 
 PSE has a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees of PSE. PSE recognized qualified pension expense of 14.7 million and 21.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Of these amounts, approximately 48.3 and 48.7 were included in utility operations and maintenance expense in 2022 and 2021, respectively, and the remaining amounts were capitalized. For the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, Puget Energy recognized incremental qualified pension income of 8.7 million and 10.4 million, respectively. In 2023, it is expected that PSE and Puget Energy will recognize pension income of 0.4 million and incremental qualified pension income of 3.5 million, respectively. 
 PSE has a SERP and recognized pension and other postretirement benefit expenses of 4.7 million and 4.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, Puget Energy recognized incremental income of 0.2 million and 0.2 million, respectively. In 2023, it is expected that PSE and Puget Energy will recognize pension expense of 2.4 million and incremental pension income of 0.1 million, respectively. 
 PSE also has other limited postretirement benefit plans. PSE recognized income of 0.1 million and 0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, Puget Energy recognized incremental expense of 0.1 million in both years. In 2023, it is expected that PSE and Puget Energy will recognize expense of 0.1 million and incremental expense of 0.1 million, respectively. 
 The Company s pension and other postretirement benefits income or expense depend on several factors and assumptions, including plan design, timing and amount of cash contributions to the plan, earnings on plan assets, discount rate, expected long-term rate of return, mortality and health care cost trends. Changes in any of these factors or assumptions will affect the amount of income or expense that the Company records in its financial statements in future years and its projected benefit obligation. The Company has selected an expected return on plan assets based on a historical analysis of rates of return and the Company s investment mix, market conditions, inflation and other factors. The Company s accounting policy for calculating the market-related value of assets is based on a five-year smoothing of asset gains or losses measured from the expected return on market-related assets. This is a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over five years. The same manner of calculating market-related value is used for all classes of assets and is applied consistently from year to year. During 2022, the Company made cash contributions of 18.0 million to the qualified defined pension plan. Management is closely monitoring the funding status of its qualified pension plan. At December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company s qualified pension plan was 69.3 million overfunded and 63.6 million overfunded as measured under GAAP, or 111.8 and 107.6 funded, respectively. As of January 1, 2023, the plan's estimated funded ratio, as calculated under guidelines from The Pension Protection Act of 2006 and considering temporary interest rate relief measures approved by Congress, was more than 100 . The aggregate expected contributions and payments by the Company to fund the pension plan, SERP and other postretirement plans for the year ending December 31, 2023, are expected to be at least 18.0 million, 3.5 million and 0.3 million, respectively. 
 The discount rate used in accounting for pension and other benefit obligations increased from 3.00 in 2021 to 5.60 in 2022. The discount rate used in accounting for pension and other benefit expense increased from 2.70 in 2021 to 3.00 in 2022. The rate of return on plan assets for qualified pension benefits remains unchanged at 6.50 in both 2021 and 2022. The rate of return on plan assets for other benefits was 7.00 in both 2021 and 2022.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Energy Portfolio Management 
 PSE maintains energy risk policies and procedures to manage risks inherent to participating in wholesale energy markets that may have related effects on credit, tax, accounting, financing and liquidity. The nature of operating generation and distribution facilities, obtaining transmission service, securing fuel and other necessary services, and energy market participation generally is such that there is continuous exposure to various risks including market, asset reliability, operational, liquidity, model, and counterparty credit risk. PSE s Energy Risk Management Committee establishes PSE s risk management policies and procedures, and is responsible for reviewing risk tolerances and limits, establishing delegations of authority, maintaining systemic and procedural adequacy of control system, and monitoring compliance. The Energy Risk Management Committee is comprised of certain PSE officers and is overseen by the PSE Board of Directors. 
 PSE's objective is to minimize commodity price exposure and risks associated with volumetric variability in the natural gas and electric portfolios to ensure physical energy supplies are available to serve retail customer loads while managing portfolio risks to limit undesired impacts and optimizing the capacity value of energy supply assets. It is not engaged in the business of assuming risk for the purpose of speculative trading. PSE hedges open natural gas and electric positions to reduce both the portfolio risk and the volatility risk in prices. 
 PSE's energy risk portfolio management function monitors and manages these risks using analytical models and tools including a probabilistic risk system that models 250 simulations of how PSE s natural gas and power portfolios will perform under various weather, hydroelectric and unit performance conditions. Based on the analytics from all of its models and tools, PSE enters into forward physical electric and natural gas purchase and sale agreements, fixed-for-floating swap contracts, and commodity options to manage its electric and natural gas portfolio risks. The forward physical electric and natural gas contracts are both fixed and variable (at index). To fix the price of wholesale electricity and natural gas, PSE may enter into fixed-for-floating swap (derivative) contracts. PSE also utilizes natural gas options as an additional hedging instrument to 
 68 

increase the hedging portfolio's flexibility to react to commodity price fluctuations while also allowing for participation in low price commodity markets. 
 The following table presents the fair value of the Company s energy derivatives instruments, recorded on the balance sheets: 
 
 Puget Energy and Puget Sound Energy December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (Dollars in Thousands) Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Electric portfolio: Current 267,811 79,668 61,291 50,979 Long-term 69,892 7,452 13,538 34,445 Total Electric Portfolio 337,703 87,120 74,829 85,424 Natural gas portfolio: Current 319,218 45,308 66,919 12,330 Long-term 24,729 10,914 12,659 6,520 Total Natural Gas Portfolio 343,947 56,222 79,578 18,850 Total derivatives 681,650 143,342 154,407 104,274 
 
 At December 31, 2022, the Company had total assets of 681.7 million and total liabilities of 143.3 million related to derivative contracts used to hedge the supply and cost of electricity and natural gas to serve PSE customers. As the gains and losses in the electric portfolio are realized, they will be recorded as either purchased power costs or electric generation fuel costs under the PCA mechanism. Any fair value adjustments relating to the natural gas business have been deferred in accordance with ASC 980, due to the PGA mechanism, which passes the cost of natural gas supply to customers. As the gains and losses on the hedges are realized in future periods, they will be recorded as natural gas costs under the PGA mechanism. 
 A hypothetical 10.0 increase or decrease in market prices of natural gas and electricity would change the fair value of the Company s derivative contracts by 85.2 million. 
 
 The change in fair value of the Company's outstanding energy derivative instruments from December 31, 2021, through December 31, 2022, is summarized in the table below: 
 Puget Energy and Puget Sound Energy Energy Derivative Contracts Gain (Loss) (Dollars in Thousands) December 31, 2022 Fair value of contracts outstanding at December 31, 2021 50,133 Contracts realized or otherwise settled during 2022 (357,980) Change in fair value of derivatives 846,155 Fair value of contracts outstanding at December 31, 2022 538,308 
 
 The fair value of the Company's outstanding derivative instruments at December 31, 2022, based on pricing source and the period during which the instrument will mature, is summarized below:

For further details regarding both the fair value of derivative instruments and the impacts such instruments have on current period earnings, see Note 10, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" and Note 11, "Fair Value Measurements" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. 
 
 Contingent Features and Counterparty Credit Risk 
 PSE is exposed to credit risk primarily through buying and selling electricity and natural gas to serve customers. Credit risk is the potential loss resulting from a counterparty s non-performance under an agreement. PSE manages credit risk with policies and procedures for, among other things, counterparty analysis and measurement, monitoring and mitigation of exposure. 
 PSE has entered into commodity master arrangements with its counterparties to mitigate credit exposure to those counterparties. PSE generally enters into the following master arrangements: WSPP, Inc. (WSPP) agreements which standardize physical power contracts in the electric industry; International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreements which standardize financial natural gas and electric contracts; and North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB) agreements which standardize physical natural gas contracts. PSE believes that entering into such agreements reduces the credit risk exposure because such agreements provide for the netting and offsetting of monthly payments as well as right of set-off in the event of counterparty default. It is possible that volatility in energy commodity prices could cause PSE to have material credit risk exposures with one or more counterparties. If such counterparties fail to perform their obligations under one or more agreements, PSE could suffer a material financial loss. In order to mitigate concentrated credit risk with a subset of counterparties, PSE enters into cleared transactions on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) for power futures contracts and ICE NGX for natural gas supply contracts. 
 Where deemed appropriate, and when allowed under the terms of the agreements, PSE may request collateral or other security from its counterparties to mitigate the potential credit default losses. Criteria employed in this decision include, among other things, the perceived creditworthiness of the counterparty and the expected credit exposure. As of December 31, 2022, PSE held approximately 775.8 million in standby letters of credit or limited parental guarantees and had seven counterparties with unlimited parental guarantees, in support of various electric and natural gas transactions. The Company monitors counterparties for significant swings in credit default rates, credit rating changes by external rating agencies, ownership changes or financial distress. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 80.4 of the Company's total energy portfolio exposure was entered into with investment grade counterparties which, in the majority of cases, do not require collateral calls on the contracts. Counterparty credit risk may impact PSE's decisions on derivative accounting treatment. 
 Should a counterparty file for bankruptcy, which would be considered a default under master arrangements, PSE may terminate related contracts. Derivative accounting entries previously recorded would be reversed in the financial statements. PSE would compute any terminations receivable or payable, based on the terms of existing master agreements. The Company computes credit reserves at a master agreement level by counterparty. The Company considers external credit ratings and market factors, such as credit default swaps and bond spreads, in determination of reserves. The Company recognizes that external ratings may not always reflect how a market participant perceives a counterparty s risk of default. The Company uses both default factors published by Standard Poor s and factors derived through analysis of market risk, which reflect the application of an industry standard recovery rate. The Company selects a default factor by counterparty at an aggregate master agreement level based on a weighted-average default tenor for that counterparty s deals. The default tenor is determined by weighting the fair value and contract tenors for all deals by counterparty and arriving at an average value. The default factor used is dependent upon whether the counterparty is in a net asset or a net liability position after applying the master agreement levels. 
 The Company applies the counterparty's default factor to compute credit reserves for counterparties that are in a net asset position. The Company calculates a non-performance risk on its derivative liabilities by using its estimated incremental borrowing rate over the risk-free rate. Credit reserves are netted against unrealized gain (loss) positions. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was in a net asset position with the majority of counterparties, so the default factors of counterparties did not have a significant impact on reserves for the period. The majority of the Company's derivative contracts are with financial institutions and other utilities operating within the Western Electricity Coordinating Council. PSE also transacts power futures contracts on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), and natural gas contracts on the ICE NGX platform. Execution of contracts on ICE requires the daily posting of margin calls as collateral through a futures and clearing agent. As of December 31, 2022, PSE had cash posted as collateral of 23.2 million related to contracts executed on the ICE platform. In August 2022, PSE entered into a standby letter of credit agreement with TD Bank allowing standby letter of credit postings of up to 50.0 million as a condition of transacting on the ICE NGX platform. As of December 31, 2022, PSE had 33.0 million in cash posted with ICE NGX and 28.0 million issued under the standby letter of credit agreement. PSE did not trigger any collateral requirements with any of its counterparties nor were any of PSE's counterparties required to post collateral resulting from credit rating downgrades during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022.

Interest Rate Risk 
 The Company believes its interest rate risk primarily relates to the use of short-term debt instruments, variable-rate leases and anticipated long-term debt financing needed to fund capital requirements. The Company manages its interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt of various maturities. The Company utilizes internal cash from operations, borrowings under its commercial paper program, and its credit facilities to meet short-term funding needs. Short-term obligations are commonly refinanced with fixed-rate bonds or notes when needed and when interest rates are considered favorable. 
 The following table presents the carrying value and fair value of Puget Energy and Puget Sound Energy's long-term debt instruments: 
 Long-Term Debt Instruments December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (Dollars in Thousands) Carrying Amount Fair Value Carrying Amount Fair Value Puget Energy 6,663,373 6,184,097 6,203,766 7,803,196 Puget Sound Energy 4,786,765 4,379,010 4,784,719 6,145,639 
 
 For further details regarding Puget Energy and Puget Sound Energy debt instruments, see Note 7, "Long-Term Debt" and Note 11, "Fair Value Measurements" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. 
 From time to time, PSE may enter into treasury locks or forward starting swap contracts to hedge interest rate exposure related to an anticipated debt issuance. The ending balance in other comprehensive income (OCI) related to the forward starting swaps and previously settled treasury lock contracts at December 31, 2022, was a net loss of 4.2 million after-tax and accumulated amortization. This compares to an after-tax loss of 4.6 million in OCI as of December 31, 2021. All financial hedge contracts of this type are reviewed by an officer, presented to the Board of Directors, or a committee of the Board, as applicable and are approved prior to execution. PSE had no treasury locks or forward starting swap contracts outstanding at December 31, 2022. 
 The Company may also enter into swap instruments or other financial hedge instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with these debts. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had no outstanding interest rate swap instruments.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Board of Directors and Shareholder of Puget Energy, Inc. 
 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited the consolidated financial statements, including the related notes and financial statement schedules, of Puget Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company as listed in the accompanying index (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 
 Basis for Opinions 
 
 The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 74 

Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Accounting for the Effects of Regulatory Matters 
 
 As described in Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded 904.3 million of regulatory assets and 2,025.5 million of regulatory liabilities as of December 31, 2022. Management accounts for the Company s regulated operations in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board s (FASB) accounting guidance for regulated operations, which requires deferral of certain costs or losses that would otherwise be charged to expense, if it is probable that future rates will permit recovery of such costs. The FASB s accounting guidance for regulated operations similarly requires deferral of revenues or gains that are expected to be returned to customers in the future. This accounting is appropriate as long as rates are established by or subject to approval by independent third-party regulators; rates are designed to recover the specific enterprise s cost of service; and in view of demand for service, it is reasonable to assume that rates set at levels that will recover costs can be charged to and collected from customers. As disclosed by management, the regulatory assets and liabilities are expected to be fully recovered through the Company s rates. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, management would be required to write off the regulatory assets and liabilities. In addition, if management determines that it no longer meets the criteria for continued application of the FASB s accounting guidance for regulated operations, management could be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities related to those operations not meeting the FASB s requirements. 
 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Company s accounting for the effects of regulatory matters is a critical audit matter is the high degree of effort in performing audit procedures and evaluating audit evidence obtained related to the continued application of regulatory accounting and accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities. 
 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management s assessment of the continued application of regulatory accounting and management s review and application of regulatory proceedings. These procedures also included, among others, (i) evaluating the reasonableness of management s judgments regarding the continued application of regulatory accounting and the probability of recovery of the capital investments and regulatory assets and settlement of regulatory liabilities; (ii) testing existing regulatory assets and liabilities and; (iii) assessing the appropriateness of the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Evaluating the continued application of regulatory accounting and the accounting for new and existing regulatory assets and liabilities involved examining the Company s correspondence with regulators, pending regulatory proceedings, and the provisions and formulas outlined in rate orders to assess the impact on the amounts recognized.

 square miles, primarily in the Puget Sound region. Puget Energy also has a wholly-owned non-regulated subsidiary, Puget LNG, LLC (Puget LNG), which has the sole purpose of owning, developing and financing the non-regulated activity of the Tacoma liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility. PSE and Puget LNG are considered related parties with similar ownership by Puget Energy. Therefore, capital and operating costs that are incurred by PSE and allocated to Puget LNG are related party transactions by nature. 
 In 2009, Puget Holdings, LLC (Puget Holdings), owned by a consortium of long-term infrastructure investors, completed its merger with Puget Energy (the merger). As a result of the merger, all of Puget Energy s common stock is indirectly owned by Puget Holdings. The acquisition of Puget Energy was accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805), as of the date of the merger. ASC 805 requires the acquirer to recognize and measure identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value as of the merger date. 
 The consolidated financial statements of Puget Energy reflect the accounts of Puget Energy and its subsidiaries. PSE s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PSE and its subsidiary. Puget Energy and PSE are collectively referred to herein as the Company . The consolidated financial statements are presented after elimination of all significant intercompany items and transactions. PSE s consolidated financial statements continue to be accounted for on a historical basis and do not include any ASC 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805) purchase accounting adjustments. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

 Tacoma LNG Facility 
 In February 2022, the Tacoma LNG facility at the Port of Tacoma completed commissioning and commenced commercial operations. In December 2019, the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency (PSCAA) issued the air quality permit for the facility, and the Pollution Hearings Control Board of Washington State upheld the approval following extended litigation. The Tacoma LNG facility provides peak-shaving services to PSE s natural gas customers, and provides LNG as fuel to transportation customers, particularly in the marine market at a lower cost due to the facility's scale. 
 Pursuant to an order by the Washington Commission, PSE will be allocated approximately of common capital and operating costs, consistent with the regulated portion of the Tacoma LNG facility. The remaining of common capital and operating costs of the Tacoma LNG facility will be allocated to Puget LNG. Per this allocation of costs, million of non-utility plant and million of construction work in progress related to Puget LNG's portion of the Tacoma LNG facility is reported in the Puget Energy "Other property and investments" financial statement line item as of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. Additionally, million, million, and million of operating costs are reported in the Puget Energy "Non-utility expense and other" financial statement line item in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Additionally, million and million of plant in service and construction work in progress related to PSE s portion of the Tacoma LNG facility is reported in the PSE Utility plant - Natural gas plant financial statement line item as of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively, as PSE is a regulated entity.

. Effective October 1, 2020 for natural gas and October 15, 2020 for electric the authorized AFUDC rate is . 
 The Washington Commission authorized the Company to calculate AFUDC using its allowed rate of return. To the extent amounts calculated using this rate exceed the AFUDC calculated rate using the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) formula, PSE capitalizes the excess as a deferred asset, crediting other income. The deferred asset is being amortized over the average useful life of PSE s non-project electric utility plant which is approximately years. 
 
 million, million and million for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The Company reports the collection of such taxes on a gross basis in operation revenue and as expense in taxes other than income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. 
 PSE's electric and natural gas operations contain a revenue decoupling mechanism under which PSE's actual energy delivery revenues related to electric transmission and distribution, natural gas operations and general administrative costs are compared with authorized revenues allowed under the mechanism. The mechanism mitigates volatility in revenue and gross margin erosion due to weather and energy efficiency. Any differences in revenue are deferred to a regulatory asset for under recovery or regulatory liability for over recovery under alternative revenue recognition standard. Revenue is recognized under this program when deemed collectible within 24 months based on alternative revenue recognition guidance. Decoupled rate increases are effective May 1 of each year subject to a soft rate cap of total revenue for decoupled rate schedules, where rate cap is applied to under-collected revenue and any over-collected revenues are passed back to customers at 100 . Any excess under-recovered revenue above the rate cap will be included in the following year's decoupled rate and the Company will only be able to recognize revenue below the rate cap of total revenue for decoupled rate schedules. For revenue deferrals exceeding the annual rate cap of total revenue for decoupled rate schedules, the Company will assess the excess amount to determine its ability to be collected within 24 months per GAAP rules. The soft rate cap test, which limits the amount of revenues PSE can collect in its annual filings, is for natural gas customers and for electric customers. The Company will not record any decoupling revenue that is expected to take longer than 24 months to collect following the end of the annual period in which the revenues would have otherwise been recognized. Once determined to be collectible within 24 months, any previously non-recognized amounts will be recognized. Revenues associated with energy costs under the power cost adjustment (PCA) mechanism and purchased gas adjustment (PGA) mechanism are excluded from the decoupling mechanism.

of operation. Before the 2017 GRC, the tax savings from these credits were intended to be refunded by PSE to its customers when monetized, used on the income tax return, through its revenue requirement as initially approved by the Washington Commission. As the Company had not generated taxable income with which to monetize the credits, they had not been refunded to customers. Amounts to be refunded have been recorded as a regulatory liability with an offsetting reduction to revenue as it was intended to be refunded through the revenue requirement. A deferred tax asset and reduction to deferred tax expense were also recorded for the regulatory liability. These entries resulted

 Revenue at PSE is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract or tariff with our customers are satisfied. Performance obligations are satisfied generally through performance of PSE's obligation over time or with transfer of control of electric power, natural gas, and other revenue from contracts with customers. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods and services. 
 
 Electric and Natural Gas Retail Revenue 
 Electric and natural gas retail revenue consists of tariff-based sales of electricity and natural gas to PSE's customers. For tariff contracts, PSE has elected the portfolio approach practical expedient model to apply the revenue from contracts with customers to groups of contracts. The Company determined that the portfolio approach will not differ from considering each

 If the Company determines that it no longer meets the criteria for continued application of ASC 980, the Company would be required to write-off its regulatory assets and liabilities related to those operations not meeting ASC 980 requirements. Discontinuation of ASC 980 could have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. 
 In accordance with guidance provided by ASC 410, Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations (ARO), PSE reclassified from accumulated depreciation to a regulatory liability million and million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, for the cost of removal of utility plant. These amounts are collected from PSE s customers through depreciation rates. 
 
 General Rate Case Filing 
 PSE filed a general rate case (GRC) which includes a multiyear rate plan with the Washington Commission on January 31, 2022, requesting an overall increase in electric and natural gas rates of and respectively in 2023; and , respectively in 2024; and and , respectively, in 2025. PSE requested a return on equity of in all three rate years. PSE requested an overall rate of return of in 2023; in 2024; and in 2025. The filing requests recovery of forecasted plant additions through 2022 as required by Revised Code of Washington (RCW) 80.28.425 as well as forecasted plant additions through 2025, the final year of the multiyear rate plan. 
 On January 6, 2023, the Washington Commission approved PSE s natural gas rates in its compliance filing with an overall increase of million or in 2023 and million or in 2024, with an effective date of January 7, 2023. On January 10, 2023, the Washington Commission approved PSE s electric rates in its compliance filing with an overall increase of million or in 2023 and million or in 2024 with an effective date of January 11, 2023. 
 PSE filed a GRC with the Washington Commission on June 20, 2019, requesting an overall increase in electric and natural gas rates of and respectively. On July 8, 2020, the Washington Commission issued its order on PSE s 2019 GRC. The ruling provided for a weighted cost of capital of or after-tax, and a capital structure of in common equity with a return on equity of . The order also resulted in a combined net increase to electric of million, or , and to natural gas of million, or . However, the Washington Commission extended the amortization of certain regulatory assets, PSE s electric decoupling deferral, and PSE s PGA deferral to mitigate the impact of the rate increase in response to the economic uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic. This reduced the electric revenue increase to approximately million, or and the natural gas increase to million, or and became effective October 15, 2020 and October 1, 2020, respectively. 
 101 

million, or , for electric and million, or , for natural gas for a total of million with rates effective October 1, 2021. This led to a combined annualized net increase to electric rates of million, or , an increase of million above the million granted in the revised final order. The order also led to a combined annualized net increase to natural gas rates of million, or , an increase of million above the million granted in the revised final order. The Washington Commission maintained adjustments that mitigated the impacts of the rate increases in response to the economic instability created by the COVID-19 pandemic, which reduced the electric revenue increase to approximately million, or , and the natural gas increase to million, or . 
 
 Power Cost Only Rate Case 
 On December 9, 2020, PSE filed its 2020 power cost only rate case (PCORC). The filing proposed an increase of million (or an average of approximately in the Company's overall power supply costs with an anticipated effective date in June 2021. On February 2, 2021, PSE supplemented the PCORC to update its power costs, leading to a requested increase from million to million (or an average of approximately ). 
 On March 2, 2021, several of the parties to the PCORC reached a multiparty settlement in principle, which was unopposed. The settlement resulted in an estimated revenue increase of million or . On June 1, 2021, the Washington Commission issued its Final Order approving and adopting the settlement and authorizing and requiring a power cost update through a compliance filing. On June 17, 2021, PSE filed a compliance filing with the Washington Commission with a revenue increase of million or due to the update on power costs with rates effective July 1, 2021. Per the 2022 GRC Final Order in Docket No. UE-220066, PCORC rates were set to as of January 11, 2023 and PSE agreed not to file a PCORC during 2023 and 2024, the rate plan agreed to in the GRC settlement. 
 
 Revenue Decoupling Adjustment Mechanism 
 On July 8, 2020, the Washington Commission issued the final order in Dockets No. UE-190529 and UG-190530, which instructed PSE to extend the collection of amortization balances for electric decoupling delivery and fixed power cost sections originally filed through the annual May 2020 decoupling filing. The extension requires PSE to move amortization balances for electric decoupling as of August 31, 2020 to be collected from customers for a two-year period, instead of the originally approved one-year period. Additionally, through approving the electric cost of service, the final order approved the re-allocation of decoupling balances from Schedule 40 to the remaining electric decoupling groups. 
 On December 23, 2020, the Washington Commission approved PSE s filing to update Schedule 142 decoupling amortization rates, with an effective date of January 1, 2021, by zeroing out rates still effective past October 15, 2020 on tariff sheet Schedule 142-H, which was replaced by rates on tariff sheet Schedule 142-I effective October 15, 2020. PSE included a true up of the over-collection amounts for the period of October 15, 2020 through December 31, 2020 in PSE s annual May 2021 decoupling filing. 
 On June 1, 2021, the Washington Commission approved the multi-party settlement agreement which was filed within PSE s PCORC filing. As part of this settlement agreement, the electric annual fixed power cost allowed revenue was updated to reflect changes in the approved revenue requirement. The changes took effect on July 1, 2021. 
 On September 28, 2021, the Washington Commission approved 2019 GRC filing updated to PLR changes. As part of this filing, the annual electric and gas delivery cost allowed revenue was updated to reflect changes in the approved revenue requirement. The changes took effect on October 1, 2021. 
 On January 6, 2023, the Washington Commission approved the natural gas 2022 GRC filing. As part of this filing the annual gas delivery allowed revenue was updated to reflect changes in the approved revenue requirement. Additionally, the Commission approved the removal of the earnings test from the decoupling mechanism in accordance with RCW 80.28.425(6). The changes took effect on January 7, 2023. 
 On January 10, 2023, the Washington Commission approved the electric 2022 GRC filing. As part of this filing the annual electric delivery and fixed power cost allowed revenue was updated to reflect changes in the approved revenue requirement. Additionally, the Commission approved the removal of the earnings test from the decoupling mechanism in accordance with RCW 80.28.425(6). The changes took effect on January 11, 2023. 
 On December 31, 2022, PSE performed an analysis to determine if electric and natural gas decoupling revenue deferrals would be collected from customers within 24 months of the annual period, per ASC 980. If not, for GAAP purposes only, PSE would need to record a reserve against the decoupling revenue and regulatory asset balance. Once the reserve is probable of collection within 24 months from the end of the annual period, the reserve can be recognized as decoupling revenue. The 
 102 

reserve adjustment was booked to 2022 electric and natural gas decoupling revenue. This compares to million of electric deferred revenue not being collected within 24 months of the annual period in 2021; therefore, a reserve adjustment was booked to 2021 electric decoupling revenue. Natural gas deferred revenue would be collected within 24 months of the annual period; therefore reserve adjustment was booked to 2021 natural gas decoupling revenue. 
 
 Power Cost Adjustment Mechanism 
 PSE currently has a PCA mechanism that provides for the deferral of power costs that vary from the power cost baseline level of power costs. The power cost baseline levels are set, in part, based on normalized assumptions about weather and hydroelectric conditions. Excess power costs or savings are apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to the graduated scale set forth in the PCA mechanism and will trigger a surcharge or refund when the cumulative deferral trigger is reached. 
 Over or Under Collected by between 17 million - 40 million 
 Over or Under Collected beyond 40 + million 

For the year ended December 31, 2022, in its PCA mechanism, PSE under recovered its allowable costs by million of which million was apportioned to customers and million of interest was accrued on the deferred customer balance. This compares to an under recovery of allowable costs of million, for the year ended December 31, 2021, of which million was apportioned to customers and accrued million of interest on the total deferred customer balance. 
 
 Power Cost Adjustment Clause 
 On July 8, 2020, the Washington Commission issued the final order in Dockets No. UE-190529 and UG-190530, which instructed PSE to remove Schedule 95 collection on decoupling allowed rates for Special Contracts, which are included in allowed rates under the Decoupling Schedule 142 effective October 15, 2020. 
 PSE exceeded the million cumulative deferral balance in its PCA mechanism in 2020. The surcharging of deferrals can be triggered by the Company when the balance in the deferral account is a credit of million or more. During 2020, actual power costs were higher than baseline power costs; thereby, creating an under-recovery of million. Under the terms of the PCA s sharing mechanism for under-recovered power costs, PSE absorbed million of the under-recovered amount, and customers were responsible for the remaining million, or million including interest. PSE filed to recover the deferred balance in Docket No. UE-210300, and the Washington Commission allowed the recovery effective December 1, 2021. 
 Additionally, PSE exceeded the million cumulative deferral balance in its PCA mechanism in 2021. During 2021, actual power costs were higher than baseline power costs, thereby creating an under-recovery of million. Under the terms of the PCA s sharing mechanism for under-recovered power costs, PSE absorbed million of the under-recovered amount, and customers were responsible for the remaining million, or million including interest. On October 27, 2022, the Washington Commission approved PSE's 2021 PCA report that proposes to recover the deferred balance for 2021 PCA period by keeping the current rates and allowing recovery from January 1, 2023 through November 30, 2023. 
 
 Purchased Gas Adjustment Mechanism 
 On October 28, 2021, the Washington Commission approved PSE's request for PGA rates in Docket No. UG-210721, effective November 1, 2021. As part of that filing, PSE requested an annual revenue increase of million; where PGA rates, under Schedule 101, increase annual revenue by million, and the tracker rates under Schedule 106, decrease annual revenue by million. Those annual 2021 PGA rate increases were set in addition to continuing the collection on the remaining balance of million under Supplemental Schedule 106B, which were set, in effect, through September 30, 2023 per the 2019 GRC.

 Get to Zero Depreciation Deferral 
 On April 10, 2019, PSE filed an accounting petition with the Washington Commission, requesting authorization to defer depreciation expense associated with Get To Zero (GTZ) projects that were placed in service after June 30, 2018. The GTZ project consists of a number of short-lived technology upgrades. The depreciation expense associated with the GTZ projects with lives of years or less that were placed in service after June 30, 2018, were deferred beginning May 1 per the petition request. For the year ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, PSE deferred million and million of depreciation expense for GTZ, respectively. In addition to the deferral of depreciation expense, PSE had also requested to defer carrying charges on the GTZ deferral, to be calculated utilizing the FERC quarterly rate of return. The 2022 GRC final order authorized recovery of all remaining GTZ depreciation and carrying charge balances as of December 2022. Finally, all GTZ deferrals ended as of December 2022. 
 
 Crisis Affected Customer Assistance Program 
 On April 6, 2020, PSE filed with the Washington Commission revisions to its currently effective electric and natural gas service tariffs. The purpose of this filing was to incorporate into PSE s low-income tariff a new temporary bill assistance program, Crisis Affected Customer Assistance Program (CACAP-1) (Dockets No. UE-200331 and UG-200332), to mitigate the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on PSE s customers. CACAP-1 allowed PSE customers facing financial hardship due to COVID-19 to receive up to in bill assistance. The program made available million in unspent low income funds from prior years, therefore resulting in rate impact, and supplemented other forms of financial assistance. CACAP-1 ran from April 13, 2020, to September 30, 2020. 
 On March 28, 2021, the Washington Commission approved PSE s CACAP-2 (Dockets No. UE-210137 and UG-210138). With a program budget of million for electric customers and million for natural gas customers, CACAP-2, which ran from April 12, 2021, to March 29, 2022, provided up to per year in bill assistance for arrearages for each qualifying low-income household. 
 On October 15, 2021, PSE submitted for the Washington Commission s review and approval a Supplemental CACAP (Dockets No UE-210792 and UG-210793) filing to continue assistance for PSE customers facing financial hardship due to COVID-19. The Washington Commission approved the Supplemental CACAP program to be effective on November 15, 2021. The Supplemental CACAP utilized carry-over funds not expended in any prior years under PSE s Schedule 129 Home Energy Lifeline Program (HELP), with a combined total budget of million for both electric and natural gas residential customers (capped at million and million, respectively). Supplemental CACAP benefits offered to cover a qualifying residential customer s past due balance, up to . PSE applied the Supplemental CACAP benefits automatically, with an opt-out option, in December 2021.

 In June 2019, Talen, the plant operator of Colstrip Units 1 and 2, announced a plan to shut down as of December 31, 2019. The Company retired Colstrip 1 2 from Utility Plant and transferred the unrecovered plant amount of million to regulatory assets, offset by depreciation as included in base rates until the 2019 GRC became effective in October 2020. Consistent with the GRC settlement in 2017, monetization of the PTCs will fund the following: (i) Colstrip Community Transition Fund, (ii) unrecovered Colstrip plant and (iii) incurred decommissioning and remediation costs for Colstrip. At December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the unrecovered plant for Colstrip 1 2 was fully offset with PTCs. 
 On September 2, 2022, PSE and Talen Energy reached an agreement to transfer PSE's ownership interest in Colstrip Units 3 and 4 to Talen Energy on December 31, 2025. Management evaluated Colstrip Units 3 and 4 and determined that the applicable held for sale accounting criteria were not met as of December 31, 2022. As such, Colstrip Units 3 and 4 are classified as Electric Utility Plant on the Company's balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 Asset Retirement Obligation 
 The Company has recorded liabilities for steam generation sites, combustion turbine generation sites, wind generation sites, distribution and transmission poles, natural gas mains, liquefied natural gas storage sites, and leased facilities where disposal is governed by ASC 410-20 Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations" (ARO). The Company records its ARO liabilities for its electric transmission and distribution poles as well as gas distribution mains aligned with its underlying asset data with future estimates of retirements. 
 For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Company reviewed the estimated remediation costs at Colstrip and determined change was warranted for the Colstrip ARO liability for Colstrip Units 1 and 2 and Colstrip Units 3 and 4. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, the Company reviewed the estimated remediation costs at Colstrip and decreased the Colstrip ARO liability by million for Colstrip Units 1 and 2, and million for Colstrip Units 3 and 4. The 2021 decrease to Colstrip 1 and 2 is primarily due to remediation plans approved by the Montana Department of Environmental Quality under a 2012 settlement between the plant operator and the state for the remaining sites at Colstrip. The plant operator previously contested the approved plan for Colstrip Units 1 and 2 under the defined process in the settlement with the state and reached a settlement agreement regarding the ability to still present another option under the settlement terms and conditions. The Company had previously recorded these incremental costs in 2020 for remediation work on the older ponds under ASC 410-20 Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations" and ASC 410-30 Environmental Remediation". For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company also recorded relief of ARO and environmental remediation liability of million and million, respectively. 
 In addition, the Company recorded Tacoma LNG facility ARO liability of million and million for PSE and million and million for Puget LNG as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The 2022 and 2021 increases to the Tacoma LNG facility ARO liabilities are primarily due to continued construction of the plant. In 2022, the ARO liability associated with the Tacoma LNG facility was fully recorded as construction was essentially complete and commissioning activities are on-going.

 1. Asset retirement obligations include million and million for Puget LNG held only at Puget Energy as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. 
 
 The Company has identified the following obligations, as defined by ASC 410, ARO, which were not recognized because the liability for these assets cannot be reasonably estimated at December 31, 2022: 
 A legal obligation under Federal Dangerous Waste Regulations to dispose of asbestos-containing material in facilities that are not scheduled for remodeling, demolition or sales. The disposal cost related to these facilities could not be measured since the retirement date is indeterminable; therefore, the liability cannot be reasonably estimated; 
 An obligation under Washington state law to decommission the wells at the Jackson Prairie natural gas storage facility upon termination of the project. Since the project is expected to continue as long as the Northwest pipeline continues to operate, the liability cannot be reasonably estimated; 
 An obligation to pay its share of decommissioning costs at the end of the functional life of the major transmission lines. The major transmission lines are expected to be used indefinitely; therefore, the liability cannot be reasonably estimated; 
 A legal obligation under Washington state environmental laws to remove and properly dispose of certain under and above ground fuel storage tanks. The disposal costs related to under and above ground storage tanks could not be measured since the retirement date is indeterminable; therefore, the liability cannot be reasonably estimated; 
 An obligation to pay decommissioning costs at the end of utility service franchise agreements to restore the surface of the franchise area. The decommissioning costs related to facilities at the franchise area could not be measured since the decommissioning date is indeterminable; therefore, the liability cannot be reasonably estimated; and 
 A potential legal obligation may arise upon the expiration of an existing FERC hydropower license if the FERC orders the project to be decommissioned, although PSE contends that the FERC does not have such authority. Given the value of ongoing generation, flood control and other benefits provided by these projects, PSE believes that the potential for decommissioning is remote and cannot be reasonably estimated.

 . PSE's hedging strategy includes a risk-responsive component for the core natural gas portfolio, which utilizes quantitative risk-based measures with defined objectives to balance both portfolio risk and hedge costs. 
 PSE's energy risk portfolio management function monitors and manages these risks using analytical models and tools. In order to manage risks effectively, PSE enters into forward physical electric and natural gas purchase and sale agreements, fixed-for-floating swap contracts, and commodity call/put options. Currently, the Company does not apply cash flow hedge accounting, and therefore records all mark-to-market gains or losses through earnings. 
 The Company manages its interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt with varied maturities. The Company utilizes internal cash from operations, borrowings under its commercial paper program, and its credit facilities to meet short-term funding needs. The Company may enter into swap instruments or other financial hedge instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with these debts.

 2. Balance sheet classification: Current and Long-term Unrealized loss on derivative instruments. 
 3. All fair value adjustments on derivatives relating to the natural gas business have been deferred in accordance with ASC 980, Regulated Operations, due to the PGA mechanism. The net derivative asset or liability and offsetting regulatory liability or asset are related to contracts used to economically hedge the cost of physical gas purchased to serve natural gas customers. 
 Electric portfolio derivatives consist of electric generation fuel of million One Million British Thermal Units (MMBtus) and purchased electricity of million megawatt hours (MWhs) at December 31, 2022, and million MMBtus and million MWhs at December 31, 2021. 
 
 It is the Company's policy to record all derivative transactions on a gross basis at the contract level without offsetting assets or liabilities. The Company generally enters into transactions using the following master agreements: WSPP, Inc. (WSPP) agreements, which standardize physical power contracts; International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreements, which standardize financial natural gas and electric contracts; and North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB) agreements, which standardize physical natural gas contracts. The Company believes that such agreements reduce credit risk exposure because such agreements provide for the netting and offsetting of monthly payments as well as the right of set-off in the event of counterparty default. The set-off provision can be used as a final settlement of accounts which extinguishes the mutual debts owed between the parties in exchange for a new net amount.

 The Company is exposed to credit risk primarily through buying and selling electricity and natural gas to serve its customers. Credit risk is the potential loss resulting from a counterparty's non-performance under an agreement. The Company manages credit risk with policies and procedures for, among other things, counterparty credit analysis, exposure measurement, and exposure monitoring and mitigation. 
 The Company monitors counterparties for significant swings in credit default swap rates, credit rating changes by external rating agencies, ownership changes or financial distress. Where deemed appropriate, the Company may request collateral or other security from its counterparties to mitigate potential credit default losses. Criteria employed in this decision include, among other things, the perceived creditworthiness of the counterparty and the expected credit exposure. 
 It is possible that volatility in energy commodity prices could cause the Company to have material credit risk exposure with one or more counterparties. If such counterparties fail to perform their obligations under one or more agreements, the Company could suffer a material financial loss. However, as of December 31, 2022, approximately of the Company's energy portfolio exposure, excluding normal purchase normal sale (NPNS) transactions, is with counterparties that are rated investment grade by rating agencies and are either rated below investment grade or not rated by rating agencies. The Company assesses credit risk internally for counterparties that are not rated by the major rating agencies. 
 The Company computes credit reserves at a master agreement level by counterparty. The Company considers external credit ratings and market factors in the determination of reserves, such as credit default swaps and bond spreads. The Company recognizes that external ratings may not always reflect how a market participant perceives a counterparty's risk of default. The Company uses both default factors published by Standard Poor's and factors derived through analysis of market risk, which reflect the application of an industry standard recovery rate. The Company selects a default factor by counterparty at an aggregate master agreement level based on a weighted average default tenor for that counterparty's deals. The default tenor is determined by weighting the fair value and contract tenors for all deals for each counterparty to derive an average value. The default factor used is dependent upon whether the counterparty is in a net asset or a net liability position after applying the master agreement levels. 
 The Company applies the counterparty's default factor to compute credit reserves for counterparties that are in a net asset position. The Company calculates a non-performance risk on its derivative liabilities by using its estimated incremental borrowing rate over the risk-free rate. Credit reserves are netted against unrealized gain (loss) positions. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was in a net liability position with the majority of counterparties, so the default factors of counterparties did not have a significant impact on reserves for the period. The majority of the Company's derivative contracts are with financial institutions and other utilities operating within the Western Electricity Coordinating Council. PSE also transacts power futures contracts on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), and natural gas contracts on the ICE NGX exchange platform. Execution of contracts on ICE requires the daily posting of margin calls as collateral through a futures and clearing agent. As of December 31, 2022, PSE had cash posted as collateral of million related to contracts executed on the ICE platform. In August 2022, PSE entered into a standby letter of credit agreement with TD Bank allowing standby letter of credit postings of up to million as a condition of transacting on the ICE NGX platform. As of December 31, 2022, PSE had million in cash posted with ICE NGX and million issued under the standby letter of credit agreement. PSE did not trigger any collateral requirements with any of its counterparties nor were any of PSE's counterparties required to post collateral resulting from credit rating downgrades during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022.

 1 The valuation techniques, unobservable inputs and ranges are the same for asset and liability positions. 
 
 The significant unobservable inputs listed above would have a direct impact on the fair values of the above instruments if they were adjusted. Consequently, significant increases or decreases in the forward prices of electricity or natural gas in isolation would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value for Level 3 assets and liabilities. Generally, interrelationships exist between market prices of natural gas and power. As such, an increase in natural gas pricing would potentially have a similar impact on forward power markets. At December 31, 2022, a hypothetical increase or decrease in market prices of natural gas and electricity would change the fair value of the Company's derivative portfolio, classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy, by million. 
 
 Long-Lived Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
 Puget Energy records the fair value of its intangible assets in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, (ASC 360). The fair value assigned to the power contracts was determined using an income approach comparing the contract rate to the market rate for power over the remaining period of the contracts incorporating non-performance risk. Management also incorporated certain assumptions related to quantities and market presentation that it believes market participants would make in the valuation. The fair value of the power contracts is amortized as the contracts settle. 
 ASC 360 requires long-lived assets to be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. One such triggering event is a significant decrease in the forward market prices of power. 
 Puget Energy evaluated the triggering event criteria in ASC 360 during 2022 and 2021 and determined there was indication of impairment of its power purchase contracts.

Company matching will be immediately vested. 
 2. Company Contribution: For UA-represented employees will receive an annual company contribution of of eligible pay placed in the Cash Balance retirement plan. Non-represented and IBEW-represented employees will receive an annual company contribution of of eligible pay, placed either in the Investment Plan 401(k) plan or in PSE s Cash Balance retirement plan. Non-represented and IBEW-represented employees will make a one-time election within 30 days of hire and direct that PSE put the contribution either into the 401(k) plan or into an account in the Cash Balance retirement plan.

Effective January 1, 2014 for non-represented employees, and December 12, 2014 for employees represented by the IBEW, newly hired or rehired employees receive annual employer contributions of of eligible play each year into the cash balance formula of the defined benefit pension or 401k plan account. PSE also has a non-qualified Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) for certain key senior management employees that closed to new participants in 2019. Effective 2019, PSE has an officer restoration benefit for new officers who join PSE or are promoted, such that company contributions under PSE s applicable tax-qualified plan, which otherwise would have been credited if not for IRS limitations, are credited at of earnings to an account with the Deferred Compensation Plan. 
 In addition to providing pension benefits, PSE provides legacy group health care and life insurance benefits (Other Benefits) for certain retired employees. These benefits are provided principally through an insurance company. The insurance premiums, paid primarily by retirees, are based on the benefits provided during the prior year. On June 11, 2019, the Company's Welfare Benefits Committee approved the termination of the Plan effective December 31, 2019, and the creation of a Retiree Health Reimbursement Account (HRA) Plan effective January 1, 2020. 
 Puget Energy's retirement plans were remeasured as a result of the merger in 2009, which represents the difference between Puget Energy and PSE's retirement plans.

 The Company has selected the expected return on plan assets based on a historical analysis of rates of return and the Company s investment mix, market conditions, inflation and other factors. The expected rate of return is reviewed annually based on these factors. The Company s accounting policy for calculating the market-related value of assets for the Company s retirement plan is based on a smoothing of asset gains (losses) measured from the expected return on market-related assets. This is a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over five years. The same manner of calculating market-related value is used for all classes of assets, and is applied consistently from year to year. 
 Puget Energy s pension and other postretirement benefits income or costs depend on several factors and assumptions, including plan design, timing and amount of cash contributions to the plan, earnings on plan assets, discount rate, expected long-term rate of return, and mortality trends. Changes in any of these factors or assumptions will affect the amount of income or expense that Puget Energy records in its financial statements in future years and its projected benefit obligation. Puget Energy has selected an expected return on plan assets based on a historical analysis of rates of return and Puget Energy s investment mix, market conditions, inflation and other factors. As required by merger accounting rules, market-related value was reset to market value effective with the merger. 
 The discount rates were determined by using market interest rate data and the weighted-average discount rate from the FTSE Pension Discount Curve (formerly known as the Citigroup Pension Liability Index Curve). The Company also takes into account in determining the discount rate the expected changes in market interest rates and anticipated changes in the duration of the plan liabilities. The Company's projected benefit obligation for pension plans experienced an actuarial gain of million in 2022. This is primarily due to the increase in the discount rate used in measuring the benefit obligation.

 ASC 715, Compensation Retirement Benefits (ASC 715) directs companies to provide additional disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. The objectives of the disclosures are to disclose the following: (i) how investment allocation decisions are made, including the factors that are pertinent to an understanding of investment policies and strategies; (ii) major categories of plan assets; (iii) inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets; (iv) effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) on changes in plan assets for the period; and (v) significant concentrations of risk within plan assets. 
 ASC 820 allows the reporting entity, as a practical expedient, to measure the fair value of investments that do not have readily determinable fair values on the basis of the net asset value per share of the investment if the net asset value of the investment is calculated in a matter consistent with ASC 946, Financial Services Investment Companies . The standard requires disclosures about the nature and risk of the investments and whether the investments are probable of being sold at amounts different from the net asset value per share.

 The following discussion provides information regarding the methods used in valuation of the various asset class investments held for the pension and other postretirement benefit plans. 
 Mutual funds classified as Level 1 securities have pricing inputs that are based on unadjusted prices in an active market. Principal markets for equity prices include published exchanges such as NASDAQ and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Mutual fund assets not included in the fair value hierarchy are privately held funds. These funds are not actively traded and utilize net asset value (NAV) as a practical expedient to measure fair value. 
 Common stock investments are traded in active markets on national and international securities exchanges and are valued at closing prices on the last business day of each period presented. They are classified as Level 1 securities. 
 Corporate and some government debt securities are valued using pricing models maximizing the use of observable inputs for similar securities. This includes basing value on yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings. Some government debt securities have quoted prices such as certain treasury securities and are classified as Level 1 securities.

 The Company calculates its deferred tax assets and liabilities under ASC 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740). ASC 740 requires recording deferred tax balances, at the currently enacted tax rate, on assets and liabilities that are reported differently for income tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. The utilization of deferred tax assets requires sufficient taxable income in future years. ASC 740 requires a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. PSE fully utilized its PTC balance in 2021 and had carryforwards at the end of 2021. Puget Energy s net operating loss carryforwards expire from 2029 through 2037. Net operating losses generated in 2018 and thereafter have no expiration date. valuation allowance has been provided for net operating loss carryforwards. 
 
 Unrecognized Tax Benefits 
 The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions under ASC 740, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements. ASC 740 requires the use of a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. First, a tax position should only be recognized when it is more likely than not, based on technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon challenge by the taxing authorities and taken by management to the court of last resort. Second, a tax position that meets the recognition threshold should be measured at the largest amount that has a greater than 50.0 likelihood of being sustained. 
 As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company had material unrecognized tax benefits. As a result, interest or penalties were accrued for unrecognized tax benefits during the year. 
 The Company has open tax years from 2019 through 2022. The Company classifies interest as interest expense and penalties as other expense in the financial statements.

 ownership interest in Colstrip Units 1 and 2 and a interest in each of Colstrip Units 3 and 4, which are coal-fired generating units located in Colstrip, Montana. PSE has accelerated the depreciation of Colstrip Units 3 and 4 to December 31, 2025 as part of the 2019 GRC. The 2017 GRC repurposed PTCs and hydro-related treasury grants to recover unrecovered plant costs and to fund and recover decommissioning and remediation costs for Colstrip Units 1 through 4. On September 2, 2022, PSE and Talen Energy reached an agreement to transfer PSE's ownership interest in Colstrip Units 3 and 4 to Talen Energy on December 31, 2025. Management evaluated Colstrip Units 3 and 4 and determined that the applicable held for sale accounting criteria were not met as of December 31, 2022. As such, Colstrip Units 3 and 4 are classified as Electric Utility Plant on the Company's balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. 
 Consistent with a June 2019 announcement, Talen permanently shut down Units 1 and 2 at the end of 2019 due to operational losses associated with the Units. Colstrip Units 1 and 2 were retired effective December 31, 2019. The Washington Clean Energy Transformation Act requires the Washington Commission to provide recovery of the investment, decommissioning, and remediation costs associated with the facilities that are not recovered through the repurposed PTCs and hydro-related treasury grants. The full scope of decommissioning activities and costs may vary from the estimates that are available at this time. 
 On May 19, 2021, PSE along with the Colstrip owners, Avista Corporation, PacifiCorp and Portland General Electric Company filed a lawsuit against the Montana Attorney General challenging the constitutionality of Montana Senate Bill 266. On October 13, 2021, the United States District Court for the District of Montana issued a preliminary injunction finding it likely that Senate Bill 266 unconstitutionally violates the Commerce Clause and Contract Clause of the United States Constitution. Since then, a motion for summary judgment was filed requesting a permanent injunction against enforcement of Senate Bill 266. On September 29, 2022, the magistrate judge in the District Court proceeding issued a recommendation to the presiding U.S. District Court Judge that a permanent injunction against enforcement of Senate Bill 266 be granted. On October 18, 2022, the U.S. District Court Judge accepted in full the magistrate judge recommendation for a permanent injunction against enforcement of Senate Bill 266.

 of the Company s energy output was obtained at an average cost of approximately per Kilowatt Hour (kWh) through long-term contracts with of the Washington Public Utility Districts (PUDs) that own hydroelectric projects on the Columbia River. The purchase of power from the Columbia River projects is on a pro rata share basis under which the Company pays a proportionate share of the annual debt service, operating and maintenance costs and other expenses associated with each project, in proportion to the contractual share of power that PSE obtains from that project. In these instances, PSE s payments are not contingent upon the projects being operable; therefore, PSE is required to make the payments even if power is not delivered. These projects are financed substantially through debt service payments and their annual costs should not vary significantly over the term of the contracts unless additional financing is required to meet the costs of major maintenance, repairs or replacements, or license requirements. The Company s share of the costs and the output of the projects is subject to reduction due to various withdrawal rights of the PUDs and others over the contract lives.

ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
 
 Puget Sound Energy 
 Executive Compensation 
 
 Compensation and Leadership Development Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
 The members of the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee (referred to as the Committee) of the Boards of Directors (referred to as the Board) of Puget Energy and PSE (referred to as the Company) are named in the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee Report. No members of the Committee were officers or employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries during 2022, nor were they formerly Company officers or had any relationship otherwise requiring disclosure. Each member meets the independence requirements of the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). 
 
 Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
 This section provides information about the compensation program for the Company s named executive officers (Named Executive Officers) who are included in the Summary Compensation Table below. For 2022, the Company s Named Executive Officers and titles were: 
 Mary E. Kipp, President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO); 
 Kazi Hasan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (CFO); 
 Allan (Wade) Smith, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, effective July 18, 2022; 
 Margaret F. Hopkins, Senior Vice President Shared Services and Chief Information Officer; 
 Andy Wappler, Senior Vice President and Chief Customer Officer; and 
 Steve R. Secrist, former Senior Vice President, General Counsel, Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer who retired effective December 1, 2022. 
 
 This section also includes a discussion and analysis of the overall objectives of our compensation program and each element of compensation the Company provides to its Named Executive Officers. 
 
 Compensation Program Objectives 
 The Company s executive compensation program has two main objectives: 
 Support sustained Company performance by attracting, retaining and motivating talented people to run the business. 
 Align incentive compensation payments with the achievement of short and long-term Company goals. 
 
 The Committee is responsible for developing and monitoring an executive compensation program and philosophy that achieves the foregoing objectives. In performing its duties, the Committee obtains information and advice on various aspects of the executive compensation program from its independent executive compensation consultant, Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC (Meridian). The Committee recommends to the Board for approval both the salary level for our CEO, based on information provided by Meridian and other relevant factors described below, and the salary levels for the other executives, based on recommendations from our CEO. The Committee also recommends to the Board for approval the annual and long-term incentive compensation plans for the executives, the setting of performance goals and the determination of target and actual awards under those plans, based on the compensation information provided by Meridian and other relevant factors. 
 
 In 2022, the Company used the following strategies to achieve the objectives of our executive compensation program: 
 Design and deliver a competitive total compensation opportunity. To attract, retain and motivate a talented executive team, the Company believes that total pay opportunity should be competitive with companies of similar size, revenue, industry and scope of operations. As described below in the discussion of Role of Market Data, the Committee, with the support of Meridian, annually compares executive compensation levels to external market data from similar companies in our industry and generally targets each element of target total direct compensation (base salary and target annual and long-term incentive award opportunities) to the 50th percentile of the market data with variations by individual executive, as appropriate. The Company also recognizes the importance of providing retirement income. As such, the Committee reviews our retirement programs and provides benefits that are competitive with our peers. 
 145 

Place a significant portion of each executive s target incentive compensation at risk to align executive compensation with Company financial and operating performance. Under its pay for performance philosophy, the Company maintains an incentive compensation program that supports the Company s business strategy and aligns executive interests with those of investors and customers. The Committee believes that a significant portion of each executive s compensation should be at risk and earned based on achievement relative to annual and long-term performance goals. For example, 77 of the target 2022 compensation of our CEO, Ms. Kipp, was considered at risk compensation. By establishing goals, monitoring results, and rewarding achievement of goals, the Company seeks to focus executives on actions that will improve Company performance and enhance investor value, while also retaining key talent. The Committee annually evaluates and establishes the performance goals and targets for our annual and long-term incentive programs. 
 Oversee the Company s talent management process to ensure that executive leadership continues uninterrupted by executive retirements or other personnel changes. The CEO leads talent reviews for leadership succession planning through meetings and discussions with her executive team. Each executive conducts talent reviews of senior employees that report to him or her and who have high potential for assuming greater responsibility in the Company. Utilizing evaluations and assessments, the Committee and the Board annually review these assessments of executive readiness, the plans for development of the Company s key executives, and progress made on these succession plans. The Committee and the Board directly participate in discussion of succession plans for the position of CEO. 
 
 Compensation Philosophy 
 The target total compensation package is designed to provide executives with appropriate incentives that are competitive with the comparator groups described below and motivate the achievement of current operational performance and customer service goals as well as the long-term objective of enhancing investor value. The Company does not have a specific policy regarding the mix of compensation elements, although long-term incentive awards consistently comprise the largest portion of each executive s incentive pay. 
 As a matter of philosophy, all three components of target total direct compensation are generally targeted within a competitive range of the 50th percentile of industry practice, recognizing that the Company operates in a highly competitive regional market. Individual executive pay position may vary from the 50 th percentile as influenced by the factors below. Actual executive compensation depends significantly on Company performance results, and can result in below or above targeted levels. 
 Individual pay adjustments are reviewed annually relative to the 50th percentile of national peer market pay, while also considering other factors, such as the executive s recent performance, experience level, company performance, competitive pay in our region, retention of top talent and internal pay equity. Notwithstanding the median philosophy, the Company may choose to target an executive s compensation above or below the 50th percentile of national peer market pay when that individual has a role with greater or lesser responsibility than the best comparison job, in response to regional market pressures, or when our executive s experience differs from that typically found in the market. 

146 

Role of Market Data 
 The Company uses market data compiled by Meridian to inform its pay decisions on base salary, target annual incentives and target long-term incentive awards. Market data is obtained from both industry-specific surveys and proxy statements of public companies selected for inclusion in the Company s custom executive compensation peer group. The market survey data were sourced from a select cut from the Willis Towers Watson 2021 Energy Services Survey, comprised of utility and other companies similar in size and scope of operations to PSE. Based on Meridian's evaluation and its discussion with the Committee, five companies of similar scope were added to the 2021 peer group, while one was removed to ensure a broad comparison group. The 26 companies in the custom market survey cut for 2022 pay decisions are shown below: 
 Custom Survey Peer Group 

1. Allete 10. Evergy 19. PNM Resources 2. Alliant Energy 11. Eversource Energy 20. Portland General Electric 3. Ameren 12. Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. 21. PPL 4. Atmos Energy 13. NiSource 22. South Jersey Industries 5. Avista 14. Northwestern Energy 23. Southwest Gas 6. Black Hills 15. Oncor 24. Spire 7 CenterPoint 16. OGE Energy 25. UGI 8 Cleco 17. ONE Gas 26. WEC Energy Group 9. CMS Energy 18. Pinnacle West Capital 
 Added to the 2021 peer group. Avangrid was removed from the 2021 peer group. 
 
 The market survey data from the companies above were supplemented with proxy statement data for select positions in the Company s executive compensation peer group, which was comprised of 15 companies, all but one of which overlapped with companies included in the market survey data. At the time of the benchmarking study, the median revenue of the executive compensation peers was 3.5 billion, which was comparable to PSE s annual revenues of 3.5 billion. The proxy peer group was reviewed by Meridian to assess the continued relevancy of the companies and did not change from last year.

 Compensation Program Elements 
 The Company s executive compensation program encompasses a mix of base salary, annual and long-term incentive compensation, retirement programs, health and welfare benefits and a limited number of perquisites. Since the Company is not publicly listed and does not grant equity awards to its executives, it relies on a mix of fixed and variable cash-based compensation elements to achieve its compensation objectives. 
 
 Base Salary 
 We recognize that it is necessary to provide executives with a fixed amount of regularly paid compensation that provides a balance to other at-risk pay elements. Base salaries are reviewed annually by the Committee based on its compensation philosophy, internal pay equity considerations and considerations specific to an individual such as an executive s expertise, level of performance, experience in the role and contribution relative to others in the organization. 
 
 147 

Base Salary Adjustments for 2022 
 The Committee reviewed the base salaries of the Named Executive Officers in early 2022 and recommended base salary adjustments to the Board, except for Mr. Smith, whose salary was approved at hire in July 2022. The Committee also reviewed salaries during 2022 based on market pressures and the promotion of Mr. Hasan to Executive Vice President and recommended base salary increases. The Board approved the Committee s salary recommendations as shown in the table below. The adjustments were effective March 1, 2022 except for Ms. Kipp s and Mr. Hasan s who also received additional adjustments effective August 2022. Base salaries for 2022 generally remained at the 50th percentile of market among the comparator group.

 2022 Annual Incentive Compensation 
 All PSE employees, including the Named Executive Officers, are eligible to participate in an annual incentive program referred to as the Goals and Incentive Plan . The plan is designed to incent our employees to achieve both (i) desired annual financial results, measured by EBITDA, and (ii) pre-established goals based on both a service quality commitment to customers and an employee safety measure. EBITDA was selected as a performance goal because it provides a financial measure of cash flows generated from the Company s annual operating performance. 
 For 2022, the Company s service quality commitment was measured by performance against nine Service Quality Indicators (SQIs) covering three broad categories, set forth below. These are the same SQIs for which the Company is accountable to the Washington Commission. The Company's annual report to the Washington Commission and our customers describes each SQI, how it is measured, the Company s required level of achievement, and performance results. The Company s service quality report cards are available at www.PSE.com/PerformanceReportCards. 
 The SQIs for 2022 were the same as those in 2021 and were as follows: 
 Customer Satisfaction (3 SQIs) - Customer satisfaction with the customer care center, natural gas field services and number of Washington Commission complaints. 
 Customer Service (1 SQI) - Calls answered live within 60 seconds by the customer care center. 
 Operations Services (5 SQIs) - Gas emergency response, electric emergency response, non-storm outage duration as measured by the System Average Interruption Disruption Index (SAIDI), non-storm outage frequency, and on-time appointments. 
 
 The employee safety performance measure reflects the Company s continued commitment to employee safety. The safety performance measure contains three targets which must all be satisfied for the safety measure to be treated as met. The three employee safety targets for 2022 were: 
 All employees attend a monthly safety meeting in a box presentation, or complete the same content online, featuring employees from across PSE discussing their jobs and efforts to ensure the health and safety of themselves, their coworkers and our customers. The target completion rate is no less than 95 . 
 All employees complete training videos to help reduce musculoskeletal injuries in the field, officer and at home. The target completion rate is no less than 95 . 
 All employees complete an online mental health training course. The target completion rate is no less than 95 . 
 Annual incentive funding is decreased if a SQI is not achieved. The employee safety measure functions similarly to the nine SQIs in determining the funding of the annual incentive plan. That is, if the safety measure is not achieved, annual incentive funding will be decreased by 10 , in the same way as a missed SQI. 
 In 2022, 100 funding for the annual incentive plan required (i) achievement of 10 out of 10 customer service and safety measures (all nine SQIs and achievement of the safety measure) and (ii) target EBITDA performance. Eight of the ten 
 148 

customer service and safety measures were met, and EBITDA finished at 98.4 of target, so funding was less than 100 , as described further below. 
 
 2022 Annual Incentive Plan Results 
 For 2022, achievement of the corporate goals under the annual incentive plan was at 98.4 of target for EBITDA. PSE EBITDA was 1,293.6 million, and SQI and safety achievement was 8 out of 10, leading to a funding level for 2022 of 73.5 for the annual incentive plan for the Named Executive Officers. 
 
 Funding levels for 2022 at maximum, target, and threshold are shown in the table below: Annual Incentive Performance Payout Scale and Actual Performance Performance Measure (Dollars in Millions)

 _______________ 
 Combined SQI and Safety results of 6/10 or better and minimum EBITDA of 1,183.5 million are required for any annual incentive pay out funding 
 SQI and Safety results below 10/10 reduce funding (e.g., 9/10=90 , 8/10=80 , 7/10=70 
 
 No bonus is earned unless at least the threshold EBITDA and SQI and safety goals are achieved. The achievement of threshold performance results in a 30 of target bonus payout. The maximum incentive payable for exceptional performance in this plan is two times each Named Executive Officer's target incentive. 
 An executive s individual award amount can be increased or decreased based on an assessment by the CEO (or the Board in the case of the CEO) of the executive s individual and team performance results. After considering performance on individual and team goals, adjustments were made by the CEO for individual performance of certain Named Executive Officers below CEO in 2022. The adjustments for individual performance are noted in the "Bonus" column of the Summary Compensation table and did not materially change the amounts resulting from 2022 achievement of the corporate goals. The Board approved the incentive amounts shown below (inclusive of adjustments for performance for each Ms. Kipp and Mr. Hasan), which will be paid in March 2023:

 Long-Term Incentive Compensation 
 Long-term incentive compensation opportunities are designed to align the interests of executives with those of our investors, provide competitive pay opportunities, support a customer-focused utility, reward long-term performance and promote retention. Long term incentive plan (LTI Plan) grants are denominated and paid in cash, if at least threshold performance measures are met over a three-year performance cycle. 
 Long-term incentive payments are based on achievement of a Return on Equity (ROE) metric, subject to achievement of a threshold EBITDA goal. Under this goal, EBITDA during the applicable three-year performance cycle must meet or exceed 90 of target EBITDA for a payment to occur. Assuming the EBITDA threshold is met, the grant cycles are funded based on 
 149 

the three-year average ROE metric. ROE reflects the income earned on our equity investment. The LTI Plan payments ultimately paid may range from 0 to 200 of target, depending on performance. 
 The Committee recommends for Board approval a targeted LTI grant value in dollars for each executive. The targeted LTI grant value is determined by evaluating LTI grant values provided to similarly situated executives at comparable companies (using the previously discussed survey and peer group data) as well as other relevant executive-specific factors. The Company generally does not consider previously granted awards or the level of accrued value from prior or other programs when making new LTI Plan grants. 
 Executives generally must be employed on the last day of the performance cycle to receive a cash payment under the LTI Plan, except in the event of retirement, disability or death. 
 
 2022-2024 Long-Term Incentive Plan Target Awards 
 Consistent with prior years, target LTI Plan awards for the 2022-2024 performance cycle were denominated in dollars, taking into account the executive's level of responsibility within the Company and the corresponding market data. Ms. Kipp s target LTI Plan grant was increased to 3,700,000 to align with market pay levels. Target LTI Plan award amounts for the 2022-2024 performance cycle are shown in the following table.

 The 2020-2022 performance cycle has now ended. Amounts payable as a result of award vesting are shown in the following table: 
 Performance on the ROE component of the grant finished at 80 of target, which was below the plan s threshold for funding. The Committee recommended and the Board approved a payment at 110 of target funding level, in recognition of the initial targets being set prior to the COVID global pandemic and the impact that had on business and regulatory conditions.

 1 Target LTI Plan incentive is the dollar target level set in 2020. 
 2 In connection with Mr. Hasan's commencement of employment in 2021, he was eligible to participate in the 2020-2022 performance cycle at a target amount that reflected reduced participation during the performance cycle but was intended to incentivize performance following commencement of employment. In connection with Mr. Smith s commencement of employment in 2022, he was granted retention incentives described in the Other Compensation section below. He did not receive a grant in the 2020-2022 LTIP performance cycle. 
 
 150 

In connection with Mr. Secrist s retirement, he was eligible to receive a pro-rated portion of his LTI grants for the 2020-2022, 2021-2023 and 2022-2024 performance cycles in accordance with the LTI Plan in the amounts of 505,389, 233,641 and 134,260, respectively, paid in March 2023. 
 
 Retirement Plans Executive Retirement Plans and Retirement Plan 
 The Company maintains executive retirement plans to attract and retain executives by providing a benefit that is coordinated with the tax-qualified Retirement Plan for Employees of Puget Sound Energy, Inc. (Retirement Plan). Without the addition of the executive retirement plans, these executives would receive lower percentages of replacement income during retirement than other employees. All the Named Executive Officers participated in executive retirement plans during 2022, Ms. Hopkins and Mr. Wappler participate in the SERP and Ms. Kipp, Mr. Hasan and Mr. Smith participate in the Officer Restoration Benefit, as part of the Deferred Compensation Plan for Key Employees. Mr. Secrist participated in the SERP until his departure in 2022. Additional information regarding the SERP, Officer Restoration Benefit and the Retirement Plan is shown in the 2022 Pension Benefits table. 
 
 Deferred Compensation Plan 
 The Named Executive Officers are eligible to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan for Key Employees (Deferred Compensation Plan). The Deferred Compensation Plan provides eligible executives an opportunity to defer up to 100 of base salary, annual incentive bonuses and earned LTI Plan awards, plus receive additional Company contributions made by PSE into an account that has three investment tracking fund choices. The funds mirror performance in major asset classes of bonds, stocks, and an interest crediting fund that changes rates quarterly. The Deferred Compensation Plan is intended to allow the executives to defer current income, without being limited by the Internal Revenue Code contribution limitations for 401(k) plans and therefore have a deferral opportunity similar to other employees as a percentage of eligible compensation. The Company contributions are also intended to restore benefits not available to executives under PSE s tax-qualified plans due to Internal Revenue Code limitations on compensation and benefits applicable to those plans. Additional information regarding the Deferred Compensation Plan is shown in the 2022 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table. 
 
 Post-Termination Benefits 
 The Committee periodically reviews existing change in control and severance arrangements for the peer group companies. Based on this information, the Committee has determined not to extend such arrangements to current and newly hired executives. No executive officers have employment agreements that would provide severance benefits. Certain compensation programs, such as the LTI Plan, have provisions that would apply in the event of a change in control. 
 The Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control section describes the current post-termination arrangements with the Named Executive Officers as well as other plans and arrangements that would provide benefits on termination of employment or a change in control, and the estimated potential incremental payments upon a termination of employment or change in control based on an assumed termination or change in control date of December 31, 2022. 
 
 Other Compensation 
 The Company also provides the Named Executive Officers with benefits and limited perquisites. To attract qualified candidates, the Company may provide certain payments to executives in connection with an offer of employment, including payments to offset their relocation expenses. 
 In connection with his offer of employment in 2021, Mr. Hasan is eligible to receive a retention bonus of 250,000 in each of March 2022 and March 2023, subject to continued employment. 
 In connection with his offer of employment, Mr. Smith was eligible to receive a signing bonus of 900,000 and a relocation payment of 150,000, grossed up for taxes, to assist with moving expenses. Both amounts must be repaid if Mr. Smith resigns or is terminated for cause within 24 months of employment. Subject to continued employment, Mr. Smith is eligible to receive a retention bonus of 630,000 in March 2023, 150,000 in July 2023 (after one year of service) and 1,260,000 in December 2026. Mr. Smith is also eligible to participate in the 2021-2023 performance cycle under the LTI Plan based on a target grant of 945,000 in addition to participation in the 2022-2024 performance cycle for which disclosure is provided above. 
 The current executives participate in the same group health and welfare plans as other employees. Company vice presidents and above, including the Named Executive Officers, are eligible for additional disability and life insurance benefits. The executives are also eligible to receive reimbursement for financial planning, tax preparation and legal services up to an annual limit. The reimbursement for financial planning, tax preparation and legal services is provided to allow executives to concentrate on their business responsibilities. These perquisites generally do not make up a significant portion of executive 
 151 

compensation and did not exceed 10,000 in total for each Named Executive Officer in 2022. Executives are taxed on the value of the perquisites received, with no corresponding gross-up by the Company. 
 
 Relationship among Compensation Elements 
 A number of compensation elements increase in absolute dollar value as a result of increases to other elements. Base salary increases translate into higher dollar value opportunities for annual incentives, because the plan operates with a target award set as a percentage of base salary. Base salary increases also increase the level of retirement benefits, as do actual annual incentive plan payments. Some key compensation elements are excluded from consideration when determining other elements of pay. Retirement benefits exclude LTI Plan payments in the calculation of qualified retirement (pension and 401(k)) and SERP benefits. 
 
 Impact of Accounting and Tax Treatment of Compensation 
 The accounting treatment of compensation generally has not been a significant factor in determining the amounts of compensation for our executive officers. However, the Company considers the tax impact of various program designs to balance the potential cost to the Company with the benefit/value to the executive. As a result of changes in federal tax law effective in 2018, the Company is now subject to IRS section 162(m). Section 162(m) limits the tax deductibility of compensation paid to certain executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers, to 1 million per year. Notwithstanding the new tax law, the Company does not expect to make changes in its executive compensation program designs and retains the discretion to pay compensation that may not qualify for a tax deduction. 
 
 Risk Assessment 
 A portion of each executive s total direct compensation is variable, at risk and tied to the Company s financial and operational performance to motivate and reward executives for the achievement of Company goals. The Company s variable pay program helps executives focus on interests important to the Company and its investors and customers and creates a record of their results. In structuring its incentive programs, the Company also strives to balance and moderate risk to the Company from such programs: individual award opportunities are defined and subject to limits, goal funding is based on collective company performance, annual incentive awards are balanced by long-term incentive awards that measure performance over three years, performance targets are based on management s operating plan (which includes providing good customer service), and all incentive awards to individual executives are subject to discretionary review by management, the Committee and/or the Board. As a result, the Committee and the Board believe that the programs design do not have risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company and also provide appropriate incentive opportunities for executives to achieve Company goals that support the interests of our investors and customers. 
 
 Compensation and Leadership Development Committee Report

 1. As described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the 2022 Goals and Incentive Plan had dual funding triggers in 2022 of 1,183.5 million EBITDA and SQI performance of 6/10. Payment would be 0 if either trigger is not met. The threshold estimate assumes 1,183.5 million EBITDA and SQI/Safety measure performance at 6/10. The target estimate assumes 1,315.0 million EBITDA and SQI/Safety measure performance at 10/10. The maximum estimate assumes 1,775.3 million EBITDA or higher and SQI/Safety measure performance at 10/10. The award for Mr. Smith was pro-rated for time worked in 2022 per the plan. 
 2. As described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, LTI Plan grants for the 2022-2024 performance cycle were allocated 100 to a ROE component subject to achievement of an EBITDA threshold goal. 
 3. In connection with Mr. Smith s commencement of employment, he was eligible to participate in the LTI Plan for the performance cycle indicated, but at a reduced participation level, as described in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis.". 
 4. Mr. Secrist received full grants on the grant dates in the amounts shown, but upon retirement had earned pro-rate portions per the plans, in the amounts shown in the Summary Compensation Table for 2022.

2022 Pension Benefits 
 The Company and its affiliates maintain two pension plans: the Retirement Plan and the SERP, in addition to an Officer Restoration Benefit as part of the Deferred Compensation Plan. The following table provides information for the participating Named Executive Officers regarding the actuarial present value of the executive s accumulated benefit and years of credited service under the Retirement Plan and the SERP. The present value of accumulated benefits was determined using interest rate and mortality rate assumptions consistent with those used in the Company s financial statements. Each of the Named Executive Officers participates in both plans, except Ms. Kipp and Mr. Hasan, who participate just in the Officer Restoration Benefit (which is reported separately below) and Mr. Smith who participates in the Retirement Plan and the Officer Restoration Benefit.

 _______________ 
 1. The amounts reported in this column for each executive were calculated assuming no future service or pay increases. Present values were calculated assuming no pre-retirement mortality or termination. The values under the Retirement Plan and the SERP are the actuarial present values as of December 31, 2022, of the benefits earned as of that date and payable at normal retirement age (age 65 for the Retirement Plan and age 62 for the SERP). Future cash balance interest credits are assumed to be 4.0 annually. The discount assumption is 5.60 , and the post-retirement mortality assumption is based on the 2023 417(e) unisex mortality table. Annuity benefits are converted to lump sum amounts at retirement based on assumed future 417(e) segment rates of 1.41 , 3.09 , and 3.58 (the 24-month average of the underlying rates as of September 2022), except that payments assumed to occur during 2023 use segment rates in effect for 2023 (this does not apply to any Named Executive Officers this year). These assumptions are consistent with the ones used for the Retirement Plan and the SERP for financial reporting purposes for 2022. In order to determine the change in pension values for the Summary Compensation Table, the values of the Retirement Plan and the SERP benefits were also calculated as of December 31, 2021, for the benefits earned as of that date using the assumptions used for financial reporting purposes for 2021. These assumptions included assumed cash balance interest credits of 4.0 , a discount assumption of 3.00 and post-retirement mortality assumption based on the 2022 417(e) unisex mortality table. Annuity benefits were converted to lump sum amounts at retirement based on assumed future 417(e) segment rates of 1.07 , 2.68 , and 3.36 (the 24-month average of the underlying rates as of September 2021). Other assumptions used to determine the value as of December 31, 2021, were the same as those used for December 31, 2022. 
 2. As described in footnote 1 above, the amounts reported for the SERP in this column are actuarial present values, calculated using the actuarial assumptions used for financial reporting purposes. These assumptions are different from those used to calculate the actual amount of benefit payments under the SERP (see text below for a discussion of the actuarial assumptions used to calculate actual payment amounts). The following table shows the estimated lump sum amount that would be paid under the SERP to each SERP-eligible Named Executive Officer at age 62 (without discounting to the present), calculated as if such Named Executive Officer had terminated employment on December 31, 2022. Each SERP-eligible Named Executive Officer was vested in his or her SERP benefits as of December 31, 2022.

 3. Ms. Kipp, Mr. Hasan and Mr. Smith do not have SERP benefits as that plan was closed prior to their joining PSE. Ms. Kipp and Mr. Hasan do not have a Retirement Plan benefit, as upon hire, each elected to have their 4 company retirement contribution made to their 401(k) accounts. Based on service through December 31, 2022 these 401(k) accounts had values of: Ms. Kipp, 40,932; Mr. Hasan, 20,105; and Mr. Smith, 10,500. Ms. Kipp, Mr. Hasan and Mr. Smith also participate in the Officer Restoration Benefit Plan as described below, with vesting after three years of service. The value of these Officer Restoration accounts based on service through December 31, 2022 are: Ms. Kipp, 127,426; and Mr. Hasan, 20,294, Mr. Smith's first Officer Restoration account contribution will be made in 2023. 
 4. As a result of retirement on December 1, 2022, Mr. Secrist received a SERP lump sum in the amount of 4,855,525, calculated per the plan and paid according to Mr. Secrist's payment election. 
 
 Retirement Plan 
 Under the Retirement Plan, the Company's eligible employees hired prior to January 1, 2014 (prior to December 12, 2014, in the case of IBEW-represented employees), including the participating Named Executive Officers, accrue benefits in accordance with a cash balance formula, beginning on the later of their date of hire or March 1, 1997. Under this formula, for each calendar year after 1996, age-weighted pay credits are allocated to a bookkeeping account (a Cash Balance Account) for each participant. The pay credits range from 3 to 8 of eligible compensation. Non-represented and UA-represented employees hired on or after January 1, 2014, and IBEW-represented employees hired on or after December 12, 2014, will receive pay credits equal to 4 (rather than the age-based pay credit described above), which non-represented and IBEW-represented employees may choose to have contributed to the Company s 401(k) plan, rather than credited under the Retirement Plan. Eligible compensation generally includes base salary and bonuses (other than bonuses paid under the LTI Plan and signing, retention and similar bonuses), up to the limit imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. For 2022, the limit was 305,000. For 2023, the limit is 330,000. In addition, as of March 1, 1997, the Cash Balance Account of each participant who was participating in the Retirement Plan on March 1, 1997, was credited with an amount based on the actuarial present value of that participant s accrued benefit, as of February 28, 1997, under the Retirement Plan s previous formula. Amounts in the Cash Balance Accounts are also credited with interest. The interest crediting rate is 4 per year or such higher amount as PSE may determine. For 2022 and 2023, the annual interest crediting rate was 4 . 
 A participant s Retirement Plan benefit generally vests upon the earlier of the participant s completion of three years of active service with Puget Energy, PSE or their affiliates or attainment of age 65 (the Retirement Plan s normal retirement age) while employed by the Company or one of its affiliates. Normal retirement benefit payments begin to a vested participant as of the first day of the month following the later of the participant s termination of employment or attainment of age 65 (employees designated as casual employees by PSE and who have reached age 65 or employees who have applied for long-term disability and have reached age 65 may commence benefits without terminating employment). However, a vested participant may elect to have his or her benefit under the Retirement Plan paid, or commence to be paid, as of the first day of any month commencing after the date on which his or her employment with Puget Energy, PSE and their affiliates terminates. If benefit payments commence prior to the participant s attainment of age 65, then the amount of the monthly payments will be reduced for early commencement to reflect the fact that payments will be made over a longer period of time. This reduction is subsidized - that is, it is less than a pure actuarial reduction. The amount of this reduction is, on average, 0.30 for each of the first 60 months, 0.33 for each of the second 60 months, 0.23 for each of the third 60 months and 0.17 for each of the fourth 60 months that the payment commencement date precedes the participant s 65th birthday. Further reductions apply for each additional month that the payment commencement date precedes the participant s 65th birthday. As of December 31, 2022, all the Named Executive Officers, except Ms. Kipp, Mr. Hasan and Mr. Smith were vested in their benefits under the Retirement Plan and, hence, would be eligible to commence benefit payments upon termination. 
 The normal form of benefit payment for unmarried participants is a straight life annuity providing monthly payments for the remainder of the participant s life, with no death benefits. The straight life annuity payable on or after the participant's normal retirement age is actuarially equivalent to the balance in the participant s Cash Balance Account as of the date of distribution. For married participants, the normal form of benefit payment is an actuarially equivalent joint and 50 survivor annuity with a pop-up feature providing reduced monthly payments (as compared to the straight life annuity) for the remainder of the participant s life and, upon the participant s death, monthly payments to the participant s surviving spouse for the remainder of the spouse s life in an amount equal to 50 of the amount being paid to the participant. Under the pop-up feature, if the participant s spouse predeceases the participant, the participant s monthly payments increase to the level that would have been provided under the straight life annuity. In addition, the Retirement Plan provides several other annuity payment options and a lump sum payment option that can be elected by participants. All payment options are actuarially equivalent to the straight life annuity. However, in no event will the amount of the lump sum payment be less than the balance in the participant s Cash Balance Account as of the date of distribution (in some instances the amount of the lump sum 
 157 

distribution may be greater than the balance in the Cash Balance Account due to differences in the mortality table and interest rates used to calculate actuarial equivalency). 
 If a vested participant dies before his or her Retirement Plan benefit is paid, or commences to be paid, then the participant s Retirement Plan benefit will be paid to his or her beneficiary(ies). If a participant dies after his or her Retirement Plan benefit has commenced to be paid, then any death benefit will be governed by the form of payment elected by the participant. 
 
 Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan 
 The SERP provides a benefit to participating Named Executive Officers that supplements the retirement income provided to the executives by the Retirement Plan. The Company closed the SERP plan to new participants as of August 1, 2019, but existing officer participants continue to accrue benefits in the plan. All the Named Executive Officers hired (or promoted to officer) prior to 2019 participate in the SERP. A participating Named Executive Officer s SERP benefit generally vests upon the executive s completion of five years of participation in the SERP and attainment of age 55 while employed by the Company or any of its affiliates. However, SERP participants as of December 31, 2012 who have not yet attained age 55, have been exempted from the age 55 vesting requirement. All the participating Named Executive Officers with SERP eligibility are vested in their SERP benefits. 
 The monthly benefit payable under the SERP to a Named Executive Officer (calculated in the form of a straight life annuity payable for the executive s lifetime commencing at the later of the executive s date of termination or attainment of age 62) is equal to (i) below minus the sum of (ii) and (iii) below: 
 i. One-twelfth (1/12) of the executive s highest average earnings times the executive s years of credited service (not in excess of 15) times 3-1/3 . For purposes of the SERP, highest average earnings means the average of the executive s highest three consecutive calendar years of earnings. The three consecutive calendar years must be among the last ten calendar years completed by the executive prior to his or her termination. Prior to December 31, 2012, a participant's highest average earnings was not required to be calculated based on a three consecutive year basis. Executives participating in the SERP as of December 31, 2012 will have their highest average earnings on that date preserved as a minimum value for highest average earnings in the future. Earnings for this purpose include base salary and annual bonus, but do not include long-term incentive compensation. An executive will receive one year of credited service for each consecutive 12-month period he or she is employed by the Company or its affiliates. If an executive becomes entitled to disability benefits under PSE s long-term disability plan, then the executive s highest average earnings will be determined as of the date the executive became disabled, but the executive will continue to accrue years of credited service until he or she begins to receive SERP benefits. 
 ii. The monthly amount payable (or that would be payable) under the Retirement Plan to the executive in the form of a straight life annuity commencing as of the first day of the month following the later of the executive s date of termination or attainment of age 62, including amounts previously paid or segregated pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order. 
 iii. The actuarially equivalent monthly amount payable (or that would be payable) to the executive as of the first day of the month following the later of the executive s date of termination or attainment of age 62 from any pension-type rollover accounts within the Deferred Compensation Plan (including the annual cash balance restoration account). These accounts are described in more detail in the 2022 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation section. 
 Normal retirement benefits under the SERP generally are paid or commence to be paid within 90 days following the later of the Named Executive Officer s termination of employment or attainment of age 62. Except as provided below, SERP benefits are normally paid in a lump sum that is equal to the actuarial present value of the monthly straight life annuity benefit. In lieu of the normal form of payment, an executive may elect to receive his or her SERP benefit in the form of monthly installment payments over a period of two to 20 years, in a straight life annuity or in a joint and survivor annuity with a 100 , 75 , 50 or 25 survivor benefit. All payment options are actuarially equivalent to the straight life annuity. An executive may also elect to have his or her SERP benefit transferred to the Deferred Compensation Plan and paid in accordance with his or her elections under that plan. 
 An executive may elect to have his or her SERP benefit paid, or commence to be paid, upon termination of employment after attaining age 55 but prior to attaining age 62. The SERP benefit of any executive who receives such early retirement benefits will be reduced by 1/3 for each month that the early commencement date precedes the beginning of the month coincident with or next following the date on which the executive attains age 62. 
 If a participating Named Executive Officer dies while employed by Puget Energy, PSE or any of their affiliates or after becoming vested in his or her SERP benefit, but before his or her SERP benefit has commenced to be paid, then the executive s surviving spouse will receive a lump sum benefit equal to the actuarial equivalent of the survivor benefit such spouse would have received under the joint and 50 survivor annuity option. This amount will be calculated assuming the executive would have commenced benefit payments in that form on the first day of the month following the later of his or her death or attainment of age 62, with any applicable reductions for early commencement if the executive dies before age 62. If the 
 158 

executive is not married, then no death benefit will be paid. If an executive dies after his or her SERP benefit has commenced to be paid, then any death benefit will be governed by the form of payment elected by the executive. 
 
 Officer Restoration Benefit 
 The Officer Restoration Benefit provides a benefit to participating officers that supplements the retirement income provided to the executives. Executives participating in the SERP are not eligible for this benefit. Ms. Kipp, Mr. Hasan and Mr. Smith participate in the benefit and those Company contributions under PSE s applicable tax-qualified plan that would otherwise have been earned, if not for IRS limitations, are credited by the Company to an account for each within the Deferred Compensation Plan.

 Deferred Compensation Plan 
 The Named Executive Officers are eligible to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan and may defer up to 100 of base salary, annual incentive compensation and LTI Plan payments. In addition, each year, executives are eligible to receive Company contributions under the Deferred Compensation Plan to restore benefits not available to them under the Company's tax-qualified plans due to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The annual investment plan restoration amount equals the additional matching and any other employer contribution under the 401(k) plan that would have been credited to an electing executive s 401(k) plan account if the Internal Revenue Code limitations were not in place and if deferrals under the Deferred Compensation Plan were instead made to the 401(k) plan. The annual cash balance restoration amount equals the 
 159 

actuarial equivalent of any reductions in an executive s accrued benefit under the Retirement Plan due to Internal Revenue Code limitations or as a result of deferrals under the Deferred Compensation Plan. An executive must generally be employed on the last day of the year to receive these Company contributions, unless he or she retires or dies during the year in which case the Company will contribute a prorated amount. 
 The Named Executive Officers choose how to credit deferred amounts among three investment tracking funds. The tracking funds mirror performance in major asset classes of bonds, stocks, and a money market index. For participants with deferrals prior to 2012, an interest crediting fund was available; however this does not apply to any of 2022 s Named Executive Officers. The tracking funds differ from the investment funds offered in the 401(k) plan. The 2022 calendar year returns of these tracking funds were: 
 
 Vanguard Total Bond Market Index 
 (13.15) Vanguard 500 Index 
 (18.15) Vanguard Money Market Index 
 1.55 
 
 The Named Executive Officers may change how deferrals are allocated to the tracking funds at any time. Changes generally become effective as of the first trading day of the following calendar quarter. 
 The Named Executive Officers generally may choose how and when to receive payments under the Deferred Compensation Plan from available alternatives. There are three types of in-service withdrawals. First, an executive may choose an interim payment of deferred amounts by designating a plan year for payment at the time of his or her deferral election. The interim payment is made in a lump sum within 60 days after the last day of the designated plan year, which must be at least two years following the plan year of the deferral. Second, an in-service withdrawal may also be made to an executive upon a qualifying hardship event and demonstrated need. Third, only with respect to amounts deferred and vested prior to 2005, the executive may elect an in-service withdrawal for any reason by paying a 10 penalty. Payments upon termination of employment depend on whether the executive is then eligible for retirement. If the executive's termination occurs prior to his or her retirement date (generally the earlier of attaining age 62 or age 55 with five years of credited service), the executive will receive a lump sum payment of his or her account balance. If the executive s termination occurs after his or her retirement date, the executive may choose to receive payments in a lump sum or via one of several installment options (fixed amount, specified amount, annual or monthly installments, of up to 20 years). 
 
 Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control 
 The Estimated Potential Incremental Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control table below reflects the estimated amount of incremental compensation payable to each of the Named Executive Officers in the event of (i) a change in control; (ii) an involuntary termination without cause or for good reason in connection with a change in control; (iii) retirement; (iv) disability; or (v) death. 
 Certain Company benefit plans provide incremental benefits or payments in the event of certain terminations of employment. The only benefit payable to the Named Executive Officers solely upon a change in control is accelerated vesting of LTI Plan awards, under certain conditions, as described below. 
 
 Disability and Life Insurance Plans 
 If a Named Executive Officer s employment terminates due to disability or death, the executive or his or her estate will receive benefits under the PSE disability plan or life insurance plan available generally to all salaried employees. These disability and life insurance amounts are not reflected in the table below. The Named Executive Officer is also eligible to receive supplemental disability and life insurance. The supplemental monthly disability coverage is 65 of monthly base salary and target annual incentive pay, reduced by (i) amounts receivable under the PSE disability plan generally available to salaried employees and (ii) certain other income benefits. The supplemental life insurance benefit is provided at two times base salary and target annual incentive bonus if the executive dies while employed by PSE with a reduction for amounts payable under the applicable group life insurance policy. 
 
 LTI Plan Awards 
 If a Named Executive Officer s employment terminates due to disability or death, the executive or his or her estate will be paid a pro-rata portion of LTI Plan awards that were granted in a prior year. In the case of retirement at normal retirement age or approved early retirement, pro-rata LTI Plan awards will be paid in the first quarter following the year of retirement, based on performance through the prior year. In the event of a change in control in which awards are not assumed or substituted, 
 160 

outstanding LTI Plan awards will be paid on a pro-rata basis at the higher of (i) target performance or (ii) actual performance achieved during the performance cycle ending with the fiscal quarter that precedes the change in control. 
 
 Employment Agreements 
 PSE has no employment agreements with any executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers. 
 
 Estimated Potential Incremental Payments upon Termination or Change in Control 
 The amounts shown in the table below assume that the termination of employment of a Named Executive Officer or a change in control was effective as of December 31, 2022. The amounts below are estimates of the incremental amounts that would be paid out to the Named Executive Officer upon a termination of employment or a change in control. Actual amounts payable can only be determined at the time of a termination of employment or a change in control. Mr. Secrist was not employed as of as of December 31, 2022 and is not included in the table. The pro-rated LTI Plan amounts payable to him in connection with his retirement pursuant to the terms of the LTI Plan are disclosed in the Details of All Other Compensation section of the Summary Compensation Table, which aggregate amount was 873,290.

Chief Executive Officer Pay Ratio 
 We are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation for our Chief Executive Officer in accordance with SEC Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. 
 For 2022, our last completed fiscal year: 
 The annual total compensation of our CEO reported in the 2022 Summary Compensation Table, was 4,760,931. 
 The median of the annual total compensation of all our employees (excluding our CEO) was 126,400. 
 
 As a result, for 2022 the ratio of annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer to the median of our annual total compensation of all employees was 38:1. 
 We identified our median employee by examining the total cash compensation we paid during 2022 to all individuals, excluding our CEO, who were employed by us on December 31, 2022, which totaled approximately 3,250 individuals, all located in the United States (as reported in Item 1. Business), including employees, whether employed on a full-time, part-time or seasonal basis. Total cash compensation consisted of base salary, overtime, paid time off and annual incentives as reflected in our payroll records. We consistently applied this compensation measure and did not make any assumptions, adjustments, or estimates with respect to total cash compensation. We believe that the use of total cash compensation for all employees is a consistently applied compensation measure because it includes all major compensation elements available to employees. 
 After identifying the median employee based on total cash compensation for 2022, we calculated annual total compensation for such employee for 2022 using the same methodology we use for our named executive officers as set forth in the 2022 Summary Compensation Table in accordance with the requirements of Item 402 (c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K. Annual total compensation for 2022 for our median employee included annual salary, annual incentives, and company contributions towards benefits including retirement. Annual total compensation for 2022 for our CEO consists of the amount reported in the "Total" column of our 2022 Summary Compensation Table. 
 
 Director Compensation for Fiscal Year 2022 
 The following table sets forth information regarding compensation paid by the Company to the directors named in the table who received compensation from the Company in 2022 for service as directors. We refer to these directors as non-employee directors. Directors who are employed by the Company or by the Company s investor-owners are not paid separately for their service and thus are not named in the table below. The directors who are employed by the Company s investor-owners are: Grant Hodgkins, Jean-Paul Marmoreo, Chris Parker, Aaron Rubin, Martijn Verwoest, and Steven Zucchet. 
 As described in further detail below, the Company s non-employee director compensation program in 2022 consisted of quarterly retainer cash fees of 42,500. Additional quarterly retainer amounts associated with serving as Chair of the Board, chairing Board committees, serving on the Audit Committee and meeting fees were also paid in cash.

 Non-employee Director Compensation Program 
 The 2022 non-employee director compensation program is based on the principles that the level of non-employee director compensation should be based on Board and committee responsibilities and should be competitive with comparable companies. 
 The 2022 compensation program for non-employee directors was as follows: 
 1. A base cash quarterly retainer fee of 42,500; 
 2. A 1,600 per meeting fee 800 for telephonic) will be paid when the number of Board or Committee meetings exceed six per year (not applicable to Asset Management Committee calls). 
 162 

In 2022, non-employee directors were paid the following additional cash quarterly retainer fees: 
 1. Independent Board Chairman, 13,750; 
 2. Chair of the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee, 3,750; 
 3. Chair of the Governance Committee, 3,750; 
 4. Chair of the Business Planning Committee, 3,750 
 5. Chair of the Audit Committee, 3,750; and 
 6. Each member of the Audit Committee other than the chair, 1,000. 
 
 Non-employee directors were reimbursed for actual travel and out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with their services. Non-employee directors are eligible to participate in the Company s matching gift program on the same terms as all Puget Energy employees. Under this program, the Company matches up to a total of 500 a year in contributions by a director to non-profit organizations that have Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 501(c)(3) tax exempt status and are located in and served the people of PSE s service territory in Washington State. 
 
 Deferral of Compensation 
 Non-employee directors may choose to elect to defer all or a part of their cash fees under the Company s Deferred Compensation Plan for non-employee directors. Non-employee directors may allocate these deferrals into one or more measurement funds, which include an interest crediting fund, an equity index fund and a bond index fund. Non-employee directors are permitted to make changes in measurement fund allocations quarterly.

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 
 
 Transactions with Related Persons 
 Our Boards of Directors have adopted a written policy for the review and approval or ratification of related person transactions. Under the policy, our directors and executive officers are expected to disclose to our Chief Compliance Officer the material facts of any transaction that could be considered a related person transaction promptly upon gaining knowledge of the transaction. A related person transaction is generally defined as any transaction required to be disclosed under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K, the SEC s related person transaction disclosure rule. 
 
 Any transaction reported to the Chief Compliance Officer will be reviewed according to the following procedures: 
 1. If the Chief Compliance Officer determines that disclosure of the transaction is not required under the SEC s related person transaction disclosure rule, the transaction will be deemed approved and will be reported to the Audit Committee. 
 2. If disclosure is required, the Chief Compliance Officer will submit the transaction to the Chair of the Audit Committee who will review and, if authorized, will determine whether to approve or ratify the transaction. The Chair is authorized to approve or ratify any related person transaction involving an aggregate amount of less than 1.0 million or when it would be impracticable to wait for the next Audit Committee meeting to review the transaction. 
 3. If the transaction is outside the Chair s authority, the Chair will submit the transaction to the Audit Committee for review and approval or ratification. 
 
 When determining whether to approve or ratify a related person transaction, the Chair of the Audit Committee or the Audit Committee, as applicable, will review relevant facts regarding the related person transaction, including: 
 1. The extent of the related person s interest in the transaction; 
 2. Whether the terms are comparable to those generally available in arm's length transactions; and 
 3. Whether the related person transaction is consistent with the best interests of the Company. 
 
 If any related person transaction is not approved or ratified, the Committee may take such action as it may deem necessary or desirable in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. 
 
 Board of Directors and Corporate Governance 
 Independence of the Board 
 The Boards of Puget Energy and PSE have reviewed the relationships between Puget Energy and PSE (and their respective subsidiaries) and each of their respective directors. Based on this review, the Boards have determined that of the members constituting the Boards, Scott Armstrong and Barbara Gordon (members of the Boards of both Puget Energy and PSE) and Diana Rakow (member of the Board of PSE) are independent under the NYSE corporate governance listing standards and also meet the definition of an Independent Director under the Company s Amended and Restated Bylaws. Under the Amended and Restated Bylaws of Puget Energy and PSE, an Independent Director is a director who: (i) shall not be a member of Puget Holdings (referred to as a Holdings Member) or an affiliate of any Holdings Member (including by way of being a member, stockholder, director, manager, partner, officer or employee of any such member), (ii) shall not be an officer or employee of PSE, (iii) shall be a resident of the state of Washington, and (iv) if and to the extent required with respect to any specific director, shall meet such other qualifications as may be required by any applicable regulatory authority for an independent director or manager. The Company s definition of "Independent Director" is available in the Corporate Governance Guidelines at www.pugetenergy.com. 
 In making these independence determinations, the Boards have established a categorical standard that a director s independence is not impaired solely as a result of the director, or a company for which the director or an immediate family member of the director serves as an executive officer, making payments to PSE for power or natural gas provided by PSE at rates fixed in conformity with law or governmental authority, unless such payments would automatically disqualify the director under the NYSE s corporate governance listing standards. The Boards have also established a categorical standard that a director s independence is not impaired if a director is a director, employee or executive officer of another company that makes payments to or receives payments from Puget Energy, PSE or any of their affiliates, for property or services in an amount 
 165 

which is less than the greater of 1.0 million or one percent of such other company s consolidated gross revenue, determined for the most recent fiscal year. These categorical standards will not apply, however, to the extent that Puget Energy or PSE would be required to disclose an arrangement as a related person transaction pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K. 
 The Boards considered all relationships between its directors and Puget Energy and PSE (and their respective subsidiaries), including some that are not required to be disclosed in this report as related-person transactions. Mr. Armstrong and Ms. Rakow serve (or served) as directors or officers of, or otherwise have/had a financial interest in entities that make payments to PSE for energy services provided to those entities at tariff rates established by the Washington Commission. These transactions fall within the first categorical independence standard described above. Because these relationships either fall within the Boards' categorical independence standards or involve an amount that is not material to the Company or the other entity, the Boards have concluded that none of these relationships, in isolation, impair the independence of the applicable directors. 
 
 Executive Sessions 
 Non-management directors meet in executive session on a regular basis, generally on the same date as each scheduled Board meeting. Mr. Armstrong, who is not a member of management, presides over the executive sessions. Interested parties may communicate with the non-management directors of the Board through the procedures described in Item 10, "Directors, Executives Officers and Corporate Governance" of Part III of this Form 10-K under the section Communications with the Board.

 The Audit Committee of the Company has adopted policies for the pre-approval of all audit and non-audit services provided by the Company s independent registered public accounting firm. The policies are designed to ensure that the provision of these services does not impair the firm s independence. Under the policies, unless a type of service to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm has received general pre-approval, it will require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee. In addition, any proposed services exceeding pre-approved cost levels will require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee. 
 The annual audit services engagement terms and fees, as well as any changes in terms, conditions and fees relating to the engagement, are subject to specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee. In addition, on an annual basis, the Audit Committee grants general pre-approval for specific categories of audit, audit-related, tax and other services, within specified fee levels, that may be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm. With respect to each proposed pre-approved service, the independent registered public accounting firm is required to provide detailed back-up documentation to the Audit Committee regarding the specific services to be provided. Under the policies, the Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of their members. The member or members to whom such authority is delegated shall report any pre-approval decision to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. The Audit Committee does not delegate responsibilities to pre-approve services performed by the independent registered public accounting firm to management. For 2022 and 2021, all audit and non-audit services were pre-approved.
