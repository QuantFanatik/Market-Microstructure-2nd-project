 PART I 
 
 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 
 OVERVIEW OF BUSINESS 
 General 
 TEP and its predecessor companies have served the greater Tucson metropolitan area for 130 years. TEP was incorporated in the State of Arizona in 1963. TEP is a regulated electric utility company serving approximately 443,000 retail customers. TEP s service territory covers 1,155 square miles and includes a population of over one million people in Pima County, as well as parts of Cochise County. TEP's principal business operations include generating, transmitting, and distributing electricity to its retail customers. In addition to retail sales, TEP sells electricity, transmission, and ancillary services to other utilities, municipalities, and energy marketing companies on a wholesale basis. TEP is subject to comprehensive state and federal regulation. The regulated electric utility operation is TEP's only segment. 
 TEP is a wholly-owned subsidiary of UNS Energy, a utility services holding company. UNS Energy is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Fortis, whose principal executive offices are located in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. 
 Regulated Utility Operations 
 TEP delivers electricity to retail customers in southern Arizona. TEP owns or has contracts for natural gas, coal-fired, and renewable generation resources to provide electricity. This electricity, together with electricity purchased in the wholesale market, is delivered over transmission lines which are part of the Western Interconnection, a regional grid in the United States. The electricity is then transformed to lower voltages and delivered to customers through TEP's distribution system. 
 FERC Regulation and Rates 
 The FERC regulates portions of utility accounting practices and rates of TEP, including rates and services for electric transmission and wholesale power sales in interstate commerce. The FERC establishes rates that allow a utility to recover transmission related costs. 
 FERC Rates 
 TEP has a forward-looking OATT formula rate, which updates annually and allows for timely recovery of transmission related costs and an opportunity to earn a reasonable return on its investment. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. 
 ACC Regulation and Rates 
 TEP operates under a certificate of public convenience and necessity as regulated by the ACC, under which TEP is obligated to provide electricity service to customers within its service territory. The ACC establishes rates that are designed to allow a regulated utility recovery of its cost of providing services and an opportunity to earn a reasonable return on its investment. 
 The ACC regulates rates charged to retail customers, the siting of generation facilities and transmission systems, the issuance of securities, transactions with affiliated parties, and other utility matters. The ACC also enacts other regulations and policies that can affect TEP's business decisions and accounting practices. 
 Renewable Energy Standard 
 The ACC s RES requires Arizona regulated utilities to supply an increasing percentage of their retail sales from renewable generation sources each year until renewable retail sales represent at least 15 by 2025. The RES also requires that DG account for 30 of the renewable energy requirement. Arizona utilities are required to file an annual RES implementation plan for review and approval by the ACC. TEP currently plans to meet these requirements through a combination of utility-owned resources, PPAs, and customer-sited DG. In 2022, the percentage of retail kWh sales attributable to the RES was approximately 24 , exceeding the 2022 requirement of 12 . 
 Energy Efficiency Standard 
 Under the EE Standards, the ACC requires electric utilities to implement cost-effective programs to reduce customers' energy consumption. As of December 31, 2022, TEP s cumulative annual energy savings was approximately 24 .

Table of Contents 

 See Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Factors Affecting Results of Operations and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding RES and EE Standards. 
 ACC Rates 
 Retail Rates are generally established in rate case proceedings. TEP's last rate case proceeding was finalized in 2020. As a result of past regulatory decisions, TEP has cost recovery mechanisms that allow for more timely recovery of certain costs between rate case proceedings. These mechanisms are generally reset annually through separate filings with the ACC. TEP's cost recovery mechanisms include: 
 PPFAC a usage-based charge or credit that reflects changes in energy costs that are not recovered through base rates established in a rate case. 
 REST a usage-based charge that recovers the cost of complying with the RES. 
 DSM a usage-based charge that recovers the cost of complying with the EE Standards. 
 LFCR a usage-based charge that partially offsets the revenue TEP loses when customers reduce their bills as a result of energy efficiency programs and DG system installations. 
 ECA a usage-based charge that recovers certain costs incurred at TEP's generation facilities to comply with environmental regulations. 
 TEAM a usage-based charge or credit used to pass through certain income tax effects to retail customers, which may include impacts of post-test year tax law changes. 
 TCA a usage-based charge or credit that allows TEP to reflect changes in costs related to investments and expenses included in TEP's FERC OATT formula rate. 
 See Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Factors Affecting Results of Operations and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on TEP's 2022 Rate Case and cost recovery mechanisms.

 (1) Increase primarily due to an increase in sales to certain long-term wholesale customers. 
 (2) Decrease due to the retirement of coal-fired generation and Gila River Unit 2 replacing the generation to serve retail load in 2019. 
 Retail Customers 
 TEP provides electric utility service to a diverse group of residential, commercial, industrial, and public sector customers. Major industries served include copper mining, cement manufacturing, defense, healthcare, education, military bases, and governmental entities. TEP s retail sales are influenced by several factors including economic conditions, seasonal weather patterns, DSM initiatives and the increasing use of energy-efficient products, and customer-sited DG. 
 Local, regional, and national economic factors impact the growth in the number of customers in TEP s service territory. In each of the past five years, TEP s average number of retail customers increased by approximately 1 . TEP expects the number of retail customers to increase at a rate of approximately 1 in 2023 based on the estimated population growth in its service territory. 
 TEP s retail sales volume in 2022 was 8,810 GWh, which is a decrease of 1 from 2018 levels. During the past five years, decreased sales volumes due to variation in weather and state requirements to promote energy efficiency and DG have been tempered by customer growth. 
 In 2020, due to changes in consumer and business behavior in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a decrease in energy usage by commercial and industrial customers. Due to stay-at-home orders and the adoption of work from home practices, along with record heat in 2020, there was an offsetting increase in energy usage by residential customers starting in the second quarter of 2020. In 2021 and 2022, usage began to return to pre-COVID-19 pandemic patterns. 
 See Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Factors Affecting Results of Operations of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding COVID-19 pandemic impacts. 
 Wholesale Customers 
 TEP s utility operations include the wholesale marketing of electricity to other utilities and power marketers. Wholesale sales transactions are made on both a firm and interruptible basis. A firm contract requires TEP to supply power on demand (except 
 3 

Table of Contents 

 under limited emergency circumstances), while an interruptible contract allows TEP to stop supplying power under defined conditions. 
 Generally, TEP commits to future sales based on expected generation capability, forward prices, and generation costs using a diversified portfolio approach to provide a balance between long-term, mid-term, and spot power sales. 
 Long-Term Wholesale Sales 
 Contracts for long-term wholesale sales cover periods of one year or greater. TEP typically uses its own generation to serve the requirements of its long-term wholesale customers. 
 TEP's primary long-term wholesale sale contracts are presented in the table below: Counterparty Contracts Expire December 31, Navajo Tribal Utility Authority 2023 TRICO Electric Cooperative 2024 Navopache Electric Cooperative 2041 
 Short-Term Wholesale Sales 
 Certain contracts for short-term wholesale sales cover periods of less than one year and obligate TEP to sell capacity or power at a fixed price. TEP also engages in short-term wholesale sales by selling power in the daily or hourly markets at fluctuating spot market prices and making other non-firm power sales. The majority of TEP's revenues from short-term wholesale sales are passed through to TEP s retail customers offsetting fuel and purchased power costs. TEP uses short-term wholesale sales as part of its hedging strategy to reduce customer exposure to fluctuating power prices. 
 Energy Imbalance Market 
 In 2019, TEP signed an agreement with the California Independent System Operator indicating its intent to begin participating in the EIM, which TEP subsequently entered in May 2022. Participation in the EIM is voluntary and available to all balancing authorities in the western United States. In order to participate in the EIM, TEP must continue to demonstrate resource adequacy through a combination of owned or contracted resources. TEP's participation in the EIM: (i) reduces costs to serve customers through more efficient dispatch of a larger and more diverse pool of resources; (ii) allows for more effective integration of renewables; and (iii) enhances reliability through improved system utilization and responsiveness. These benefits are expected to be sustained over the life of TEP's participation in the EIM.

 TEP is the primary electric service provider to retail customers within its service territory and operates under a certificate of public convenience and necessity as regulated by the ACC. 
 In 2018, the ACC opened rulemaking dockets to evaluate possible modifications to various clean energy policies including existing renewable energy and energy efficiency goals, integrated resource planning, and retail competition for generation services. In 2019 and 2020, the ACC discussed draft rules related to retail electric competition; however, draft rules have not been officially proposed. In August 2021, a company filed an application with the ACC requesting a certificate of public convenience and necessity that would grant them the authority to provide competitive electric generation service to customers in TEP's service territory. In April 2022, legislation was signed into law that repealed statutes supporting statewide implementation of retail electric competition. The ACC has not yet determined whether to consider the application in light of this legislation. If the ACC chooses to consider this application, TEP would intervene in the matter and oppose the request. 
 Wholesale Customers 
 TEP engages in long-term wholesale sales to optimize its generation resources. As a result of its wholesale power activity, TEP competes with other utilities, power marketers, and independent power producers in wholesale markets.

 (2) Iron Horse has 2 MW of capacity accompanied by 10 MW of battery storage. Payments for battery storage are accounted for as variable lease costs. 
 (3) The commercial operation dates (CODs) were originally set for 2022 and 2023 for Babacomari North and South, respectively. The contracts were subsequently resubmitted through the ASRFP and, if selected, updated CODs will be finalized. 
 Purchased Power 
 TEP purchases power from other utilities and power marketers. TEP may enter into contracts to purchase: (i) power under long-term contracts to serve retail load and long-term wholesale contracts; (ii) capacity or power during periods of planned outages or for peak summer load conditions; and (iii) power for resale to certain wholesale customers under load and resource management agreements. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K related to purchased power commitments. 
 TEP typically uses its generation, supplemented by purchased power, to meet the summer peak demands of its retail customers. TEP hedges a portion of its total energy price exposure with forward priced contracts. Certain of these contracts are at a fixed price per MWh and others are indexed to natural gas prices. TEP also purchases power in the daily and hourly markets: (i) to meet higher than anticipated demands; (ii) during periods of generation outages; or (iii) when doing so is more economical than generating its own power. 
 TEP is a member of a regional reserve-sharing organization and has reliability and power-sharing relationships with other utilities. These relationships allow TEP to call upon other utilities during emergencies, such as generation facility outages and system disturbances, which reduces the amount of reserves TEP is required to carry as a participant in the regional reserve-sharing organization. 
 Peak Demand and Future Resources 
 Peak Demand (in MW) 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 Retail Customers 2,273 2,427 2,467 2,367 2,413 
 In 2022, TEP's generation and purchased resources were sufficient to meet total retail and long-term wholesale peak demand, while maintaining a reserve margin in compliance with reliability criteria set forth by the Western Electricity Coordinating Council, a regional entity with delegated authority from NERC. 
 Peak demand occurs during the summer months due to the cooling requirements of retail customers in TEP s service territory. Retail peak demand varies from year-to-year due to weather, energy conservation, DG, economic conditions, and other factors. The decrease in retail peak demand in 2022 compared to the previous four years was primarily due to less extreme heat during peak load. Additionally, the impacts of remote work as a result of COVID-19 in 2021 and 2020 increased peak demand for residential customers in each of those years. 
 Forecasted retail peak demand for 2023 is 2,429 MW compared with actual peak demand of 2,273 MW in 2022. TEP s 2023 estimated retail peak demand is based on weather patterns observed over a 10-year period and other factors, including estimates of customer usage. TEP believes that existing generation capacity and PPAs are sufficient to meet the expected demand and reserve margin requirements in 2023. 
 Future Resources 
 TEP's strategy on future resources is to continue its transition from carbon-intensive sources to a more sustainable energy portfolio, while maintaining reliability and ensuring rate affordability for its customers. 
 In June 2020, TEP filed its 2020 IRP, which outlines its plan through 2035 to meet its electric demand while transitioning to a more sustainable energy portfolio. The plan includes a goal to reduce carbon emissions by 80 compared to 2005 by 2035. The IRP proposes to achieve this goal by reducing the Company's dependency on coal-fired generation over the next decade while developing new renewable energy projects like Oso Grande, Raptor Ridge, and energy storage projects to meet electric demand. In February 2022, the ACC acknowledged TEP s IRP and found it to be reasonable and in the public interest. 
 In 2020, ACC staff issued a NOPR based on clean energy rules approved by the ACC. In June 2021, these rules were modified by amendments and sent back through the formal rulemaking process, resulting in ACC staff issuing a new NOPR in December 2021. The rules would have required affected utilities to, among other provisions, reduce carbon emissions below certain baseline levels, and would have also repealed the existing RES and EE Standards. In January 2022, the ACC rejected the new rules, effectively ending the rule-making process.

 Coal Supply 
 The coal used for generation is low-sulfur, bituminous or sub-bituminous coal sourced from mines in Arizona and New Mexico. The table below provides information on the existing coal contracts that supply TEP's generation facilities. The average cost of coal per MMBtu, including transportation, was 2.65 in 2022, 2.48 in 2021, and 2.37 in 2020.

 (1) In November 2022, TEP amended and extended its existing coal sales agreement for the supply of coal for Springerville Unit 1 through 2027 and Unit 2 through 2031. 
 The coal supplies for Springerville Units 1 and 2 are transported approximately 200 miles by railroad from northwestern New Mexico. TEP expects to have access to coal supplies to fulfill the estimated requirements for each of the Springerville units over their respective remaining life. 
 Coal-Fired Generation Facilities Operated by Others 
 TEP also participates in a jointly-owned coal-fired generation facility at Four Corners. Four Corners, which is operated by APS, is a mine-mouth generation facility located adjacent to the coal reserves. TEP expects coal reserves available to this jointly-owned generation facility to be sufficient for the remaining life of the station.

 Natural Gas Supply 
 The table below provides information on the natural gas transportation agreements that deliver natural gas to TEP's generation facilities. The average cost of natural gas per MMBtu, including transportation, was 8.35 in 2022, 5.38 in 2021, and 2.19 in 2020. The increase in cost in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to an increase in natural gas prices resulting from increased demand and limited transportation capacity caused by constrained natural gas pipelines. The increase in cost in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to an increase in natural gas prices as a result of a severe winter storm in the southwestern United States in February 2021.

 Transmission and Distribution 
 TEP's distribution and transmission facilities are located in Arizona and New Mexico. These facilities are located on property owned by: (i) TEP; (ii) public entities; (iii) private entities; and (iv) Indian Nations. TEP's transmission and distribution systems included approximately 2,232 miles of transmission lines and 7,910 miles of distribution lines as of December 31, 2022. 
 TEP's transmission facilities transmit the output from TEP s electric generation facilities to the Tucson area and power markets. The transmission system is part of the Western Interconnection, which includes the interconnected transmission systems of 14 western states, two Canadian provinces, and parts of Mexico. TEP's transmission system, together with contractual rights on other systems, enables TEP to integrate and access generation resources to meet its energy load requirements. 
 
 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 
 The EPA regulates, or has the authority to regulate, the amount of sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), nitrogen oxide (NO x ), carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), particulate matter, mercury, and other by-products produced by generation facilities. TEP may incur added costs to comply with future changes in federal and state environmental laws, regulations, and permit requirements at its generation facilities. Environmental laws and regulations are subject to a range of interpretations, which may ultimately be resolved by the courts. Because these laws and regulations continue to evolve, TEP is unable to predict the impact of the changing laws and regulations on its operations and consolidated financial results. TEP expects the recovery of the cost of environmental compliance through Retail Rates. 
 Refer to Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources of this Form 10-K for additional information related to environmental laws and regulations as well as environmental compliance capital expenditures.

 HUMAN CAPITAL 
 As of December 31, 2022, TEP had 1,675 employees, of which approximately 749 were represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local No. 1116 (IBEW). The collective bargaining agreement between the IBEW and TEP expired in July 2022, with wages in effect through December 2022. The IBEW and TEP extended the collective bargaining agreement through June 30, 2023, including a wage increase. Full negotiations are ongoing. TEP also engages with independent contractors in the ordinary course of its business, as necessary. 
 Culture 
 TEP strives to create a positive environment for its employees through various initiatives consistent with its values. The Company believes that the foundation for a diverse and inclusive work environment starts with the Executive Officers and Board of Directors' active involvement in tracking the Company's goals and objectives. TEP's business strategy represents a commitment to help employees thrive by adapting to change, investing in continuous learning, and promoting collaboration, inclusion, and diversity, while deepening the Company's safety culture. 
 TEP's compliance team and Board of Directors review the Company's Code of Ethics and Business Conduct (Code) annually and make updates based on direct feedback from employees. The Code serves as TEP's ethical compass and expressly states that the Company will not tolerate certain behaviors including: (i) retaliation; (ii) discrimination; (iii) harassment; or (iv) abuse 
 9 

Table of Contents 

 of positions of trust for personal gain. The Code is intended to help TEP create a safe and respectful workplace where employees feel valued and secure. 
 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 
 Diversity, equity, and inclusion are an integral part of TEP s vision and values. TEP values an inclusive culture and the unique contributions, perspectives, and experiences of its employees. TEP continues to identify and focus on behaviors that build strong and positive relationships at work to support an environment of thriving employees. TEP incorporates diversity, equity, and inclusion metrics into its annual goals, and aligns these metrics with business objectives. 
 Business Resource Groups 
 The Company supports employee participation in Business Resource Groups (BRG), which are voluntary, employee-led groups that have established missions, goals, and practices that support career development and employee engagement and align with TEP's business priorities. Participants share ideas and issues to help promote an inclusive, equitable, and respectful workplace. Examples of BRGs that provide professional networking opportunities at TEP include: 
 Veterans in Energy dedicated to: (i) building relationships between its members; (ii) providing support and mentorship for military veterans and families; and (iii) promoting engagement and retention of military veteran employees. 
 Women in Energy dedicated to: (i) inspiring women in their professional growth; (ii) developing leadership qualities in women; and (iii) promoting engagement of women and diverse representation and thought. 
 Workforce Pipeline 
 TEP's workforce pipeline initiatives center on attracting, engaging, and developing a diverse workforce. Many of these efforts are specifically geared towards investing in: (i) students from historically underserved backgrounds from elementary schools through post-graduate studies; (ii) individuals with disabilities; and (iii) military veterans. 
 TEP is a Troops to Energy Jobs employer that works with the Center for Energy Workforce Development to match military skills with open positions in a variety of fields within the Company. TEP has sponsored numerous military internships for separating or retiring service members in partnership with Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, among other military bases. As of December 31, 2022, 11 of TEP's employees were military veterans.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 The business and financial results of TEP are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth below. These risks and uncertainties fall primarily into five major categories: revenues, regulatory, environmental, financial, and operational. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to TEP or that are not currently believed by TEP to be material may also negatively impact TEP s business and financial results. 
 REVENUES 
 A significant decrease in the demand for electricity in TEP's service area would negatively impact retail sales and adversely affect results of operations, net income, and cash flows at TEP. 
 National and local economic conditions have a significant impact on customer growth and overall retail sales in TEP s service area. TEP anticipates an annual customer growth rate of 1 for the next five years. 
 Research and development activities are ongoing for new technologies that produce power and/or reduce power consumption, such as renewable energy resources, including energy storage and customer-sited DG, energy-efficient products, and control systems. Continued development and use of these technologies and compliance with the ACC's EE Standards and RES continue to have a negative impact on TEP s use per customer and overall retail sales. TEP's use per customer declined by an average of 1 per year from 2018 through 2022. 
 The revenues, results of operations, and cash flows of TEP are seasonal and are subject to weather conditions and customer usage patterns, which are beyond the Company s control. 
 Retail Sales 
 TEP earns the majority of its operating revenue and net income in the third quarter because retail customers increase their air conditioning usage during the summer. Conversely, first quarter net income is limited by relatively mild winter weather in TEP's retail service territory. Unseasonably co ol summers or warm winters may reduce customer usage, negatively affecting operating revenues, cash flows, and net income by reducing sales. 
 Production Tax Credits 
 Electricity generated from TEP's wind-powered facility depends heavily on wind conditions, turbine availability, and transmission capacity. If such conditions are unfavorable, the facility s electricity generation and associated PTCs may be reduced, negatively affecting cash tax payments and net income. 
 TEP is dependent on a small number of customers for a significant portion of future revenues. A reduction in the electricity sales to these customers would negatively affect results of operations, net income, and cash flows at TEP. 
 TEP s ten largest customers represented 10 of total revenues in 2022. TEP sells electricity to mines, military installations, and other large commercial and industrial customers. Retail sales volumes and revenues from these customers could decline as a result of, among other things: global, national, and local economic conditions; curtailments of customer operations due to unfavorable market conditions; military base reorganization or closure decisions by the federal government; the effects of energy efficiency; or the decision by customers to self-generate all or a portion of their energy needs. A reduction in retail kWh sales by any one of TEP s ten largest customers would negatively affect the Company's results of operations, net income, and cash flows. 
 11 

Table of Contents 

 REGULATORY 
 TEP's business is significantly impacted by government legislation, regulation and oversight. TEP's inability to recover its costs, earn a reasonable return on its investments, or comply with current regulations would negatively affect its results of operations, net income, and cash flows. 
 TEP's financial condition is influenced by how regulatory authorities, including the ACC and the FERC, establish the rates TEP can charge customers and authorize rates of return, common equity levels, and the amount of costs that may be recovered from TEP customers. The Company's ability to timely obtain rate adjustments that provide TEP with the opportunity to earn authorized rates of return depends upon timely regulatory action under applicable statutes and regulations and cannot be guaranteed. 
 ACC The ACC is a constitutionally created body composed of five elected commissioners and has jurisdiction over rates for retail customers. Commissioners are elected state-wide for staggered four-year terms and are limited to serving two consecutive terms. As a result, the composition of the ACC, and therefore its policies, are subject to change every two years. 
 FERC The FERC has jurisdiction over rates for electric transmission in interstate commerce and rates for wholesale sales of electric power, including terms and prices of transmission services and sales of electricity at wholesale. 
 Owners and operators of bulk power systems, including TEP, are subject to mandatory reliability standards developed and enforced by NERC and subject to the oversight of the FERC. Compliance with modified or new reliability standards may subject TEP to higher operating costs and increased capital costs. Failure to comply with the mandatory reliability standards could subject TEP to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties. 
 Changes made to legislation, regulation, or regulatory structure could negatively affect TEP's results of operations, net income, and cash flows. 
 TEP incurs costs to comply with legislative and regulatory requirements and initiatives, including those relating to clean energy requirements, the deployment of distributed energy resources, and implementation of programs for demand response, customer energy efficiency, and electric vehicles. Initiatives or changes to existing requirements have occurred and could arise again in the future through legislative, regulatory, or other initiatives (including ballot initiatives) on either a federal or state level. 
 TEP's ability to recover costs, including its investments, associated with legislative and regulatory initiatives will, in large part, depend on the final form of legislative or regulatory requirements. Further increases to rates could negatively affect the affordability of the rates charged to customers, which may negatively affect TEP s results of operations, net income, and cash flows . In past years, the ACC staff has discussed draft rules for retail competition for generation services. These rules have not been officially proposed, but if such rules were adopted, retail competition could have a negative impact on the Company's results of operations, net income, and cash flows. 
 ENVIRONMENTAL 
 TEP is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that may increase its cost of operations or expose it to environmental-related litigation and liabilities. 
 Numerous federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations affect present and future operations. Those laws and regulations include rules regarding air emissions of conventional pollutants and GHGs, water use, wastewater discharges, solid waste, hazardous waste, and management of CCR. Policy initiatives, such as environmental justice that considers disproportionately adverse environmental impacts on vulnerable communities, may also impact operations. 
 We have incurred costs in connection with environmental compliance, and we anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future. These laws and regulations can contribute to higher capital expenditures and operating expenses, particularly resulting from enforcement efforts focused on existing generation facilities and compliance standards related to new and existing generation facilities. These laws and regulations generally require TEP to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, authorizations, and other approvals. Both public officials and private individuals may seek to enforce applicable environmental laws and regulations and policies. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or address certain policies, may result in litigation, the imposition of fines, penalties, and requirements by regulatory authorities for costly equipment upgrades. 
 Existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised, and new environmental laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to the Company's facilities. Increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions from revised or additional regulation could have a negative effect on TEP's results of operations, particularly if those costs are not timely and 
 12 

Table of Contents 

 fully recoverable from TEP customers. TEP s obligation to comply with these laws and regulations as a participant or owner in regulated facilities like Springerville and Four Corners, coupled with the financial impact of future climate change legislation, other environmental regulations and policies, and other business considerations, could jeopardize the economic viability of these generation facilities. Additionally, these regulations may jeopardize continued generation facility operations or the ability of individual participants to meet their obligations and willingness to continue their participation in these facilities potentially resulting in an increased operational cost for the remaining participants. 
 TEP also is contractually obligated to pay a portion of the environmental reclamation costs incurred at generation facilities in which it has a minority interest and is obligated to pay similar costs at the mines that supply these generation facilities. While TEP has recorded the portion of its costs that can be determined at this time, the total costs for final reclamation at these sites are unknown and could be substantial. 
 FINANCIAL 
 Additional early closures of TEP's coal-fired generation facilities could result in TEP recognizing regulatory impairments or increased cost of operations if recovery of TEP's remaining investments in such facilities and the costs associated with additional early closures are not permitted through rates charged to customers. 
 TEP's remaining coal-fired generation facilities may close before the end of their useful lives in response to economic conditions and/or changes in regulation, including any future changes to the ACC's energy rules and/or environmental regulations. If any additional coal-fired generation facilities from which TEP obtains power are closed prior to the end of their useful lives, TEP may need to seek regulatory recovery of the remaining net book value and could incur added expenses relating to accelerated depreciation and amortization, decommissioning, reclamation, and cancellation of long-term coal contracts of such generation facilities. As of December 31, 2022, the net book value of TEP's in service coal-fired generation facilities was 1.0 billion. 
 Volatility or disruptions in the financial markets, rising interest rates, or unanticipated financing needs, could increase TEP's financing costs, limit access to the credit or bank markets, affect the Company's ability to comply with financial covenants in debt agreements, and increase TEP's pension funding obligations. Such outcomes may negatively affect liquidity and TEP's ability to carry out the Company's financial strategy. 
 We rely on access to bank and capital markets as a significant source of liquidity and for capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flows from TEP's operations. Market disruptions such as those experienced in the financial crises of 2008, 2009, and 2020 in the United States and abroad may increase the Company's cost of borrowing or negatively affect TEP's ability to access sources of liquidity needed to finance the Company's operations and satisfy its obligations as they become due. These disruptions may include turmoil in the financial services industry, including substantial uncertainty surrounding particular lending institutions and counterparties with which we do business, increases in interest rates in response to inflationary pressures, unprecedented volatility in the bank and capital markets, and general economic downturns in TEP's utility service territory. If TEP is unable to access credit at reasonable rates, or if the Company's borrowing costs dramatically increase, TEP's ability to finance its operations, meet debt obligations, and execute its financial strategy could be negatively affected. Increases in short-term interest rates would increase the cost of borrowings under TEP's credit facility. 
 In addition, unfavorable market conditions have and could continue to negatively affect the market value of assets held in its pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans and may increase the amount and accelerate the timing of required future funding contributions. 
 Changes in power flows in TEP's service territory could require us to redeem or defease some or all of the tax-exempt bonds issued for the Company's benefit, which could result in increased financing costs. 
 TEP has financed a portion of utility plant assets with the proceeds of industrial development revenue bonds issued by a governmental authority. Interest on these bonds is, subject to certain exceptions, excluded from gross income for federal tax purposes. This tax-exempt status is based, in part, on continued use of the assets for the local furnishing of power within TEP s two-county retail service area. 
 As of December 31, 2022, there were outstanding approximately 91 million aggregate principal amount of tax-exempt bonds that financed local furnishing facilities, callable at par on or after March 1, 2023. Depending on changes that may occur to the regional generation mix in the desert southwest, to the regional bulk transmission network, or to the demand for retail power in TEP s local service area, it is possible that TEP would no longer qualify as a local furnisher of power within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code. If TEP could no longer qualify as a local furnisher of power, TEP s tax-exempt local furnishing bonds could be subject to mandatory early redemption by TEP or defeasance to the earliest redemption date, and TEP could be

 required to pay additional amounts if interest on such bonds was no longer tax-exempt. In addition, the cost of any debt to refinance could be at a higher rate. 
 OPERATIONAL 
 The operation of generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems involves risks and uncertainties that could result in reduced generation capability or unplanned outages that could negatively affect TEP s results of operations, net income, and cash flows. 
 The operation of generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems involves certain risks and uncertainties, including equipment breakdown or failures, fires and other hazards, lower than expected levels of efficiency or operational performance, and/or disruptions in operations due to union strikes or a labor shortage. Governmental actions and other circumstances that cause continued global supply chain challenges including lead time impacts, price volatility, and other market trends, have and could continue to increase the risk that TEP s operations could be negatively impacted and/or TEP s capital spending could increase. If TEP s generation facilities or transmission and distribution systems operate below expectations, TEP s operating results could be negatively affected and/or TEP's capital spending could be increased. 
 In addition, as coal-fired generation facilities are closed, the economic viability of coal mines and coal suppliers may be jeopardized. To date, several coal suppliers have declared bankruptcy and coal mines have been closed. As additional coal-fired generation facilities are closed, the availability of sufficient coal supplies could decrease and prices may increase, which could, in turn, negatively affect the viability of our remaining coal-fired generation facilities. 
 The operation of generation facilities and transmission systems on tribal lands may create operational and financial risks for TEP that, if realized, could negatively affect TEP s results of operations, net income, and cash flows. 
 Certain jointly-owned facilities and portions of TEP's transmission lines are located on tribal lands pursuant to leases, land easements, or other rights-of-way that are effective for specified periods. TEP is unable to predict the final outcomes of pending and future approvals by the applicable sovereign governing bodies with respect to the cost of renewals and continued access to these leases, land easements, and rights-of-way. If pending and future approvals are not obtained and if continued access to the facilities is not granted, it could negatively affect TEP's results of operations, net income, and cash flows. 
 TEP receives power from certain generation facilities that are jointly-owned with, or operated by, third parties. Therefore, TEP may not have the ability to affect the management or operations at such facilities which could negatively affect TEP s results of operations, net income, and cash flows. 
 Certain of the generation facilities from which TEP receives power are jointly-owned with, or operated by, third parties. TEP does not have the sole discretion to affect the management or operations at such facilities. As a result of this reliance on other operators, TEP may not be able to ensure the proper management of the operations and maintenance of such generation facilities. Further, TEP may have limited ability to determine how best to manage the changing economic conditions or environmental requirements that may affect such facilities. A divergence in the interests of TEP and the co-owners or operators, as applicable, of such facilities could negatively impact the business and operations of TEP. 
 The effects of climate change may create operational and financial risks for TEP that, if realized, could negatively affect TEP's results of operations, net income, and cash flows. 
 Climate change impacts regional and global weather conditions and results in extreme weather events, including high temperatures, severe thunderstorms, drought, and wildfires. Changes in weather conditions and extreme weather have occurred in the Western United States and have affected TEP's transmission and distribution systems. Such conditions could impact TEP's service territory, lead to service outages, and/or cause business interruptions, which cause increased capital expenditures and operating expenses. There can be no assurance that physical utility assets will successfully withstand severe weather conditions. In addition, changes in weather conditions or extreme weather events outside of TEP's service territory have and could again result in higher insurance premiums and other costs. These occurrences negatively impact TEP's business and operations, leading to a negative impact on TEP's results of operations, net income, and cash flows. 
 TEP is subject to seasonal capacity shortfalls which could result in an inability to reliably serve load requirements and could negatively affect TEP s results of operations, net income, and cash flows. 
 Increased capacity scarcity in the Western region may result in the inability to meet customer demand. Conditions that could cause a capacity shortfall include but are not limited to: an extreme weather event, regulatory policy, fuel supply shortages related to constrained natural gas pipelines or coal delivery interruptions, coal mine or natural gas well field outages, increased customer demand, unplanned outages, including extensions of planned outages due to equipment failures or other complications, and/or the retirement of generation resources. These conditions may contribute to market price volatility and

 increased difficulty in procuring market energy. An inability to serve load requirements could negatively affect TEP s results of operations, net income, and cash flows. 
 TEP is subject to physical attacks which could have a negative impact on the Company's business and results of operations. 
 TEP s generation, transmission, and distribution assets are critical to the provision of electric service to our customers, stability of the bulk electric system, and provide the framework for our service infrastructure. TEP is facing a heightened risk of physical attacks on the Company's electric assets. The Company's electric generation, transmission, and distribution assets are geographically dispersed and are often in rural or unpopulated areas which makes it especially difficult to adequately detect, defend from, and respond to such attacks. The Company relies on the continued operation of these assets, which are part of an interconnected regional electrical grid. Any significant interruption of these assets could prevent the Company from fulfilling its critical business functions including delivering energy to customers. Security threats continue to evolve and adapt. Such attempts could be motivated by a desire to disrupt utility operations or seek financial gain. TEP, the energy industry, and our third-party vendors have been subject to, and will likely continue to be subject to, attempts to disrupt operations through physical security attacks and breaches. Such events or the threat of such events may increase costs associated with heightened security requirements. Despite implementation of security measures, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to prevent such disruptions. 
 If, despite TEP's security measures, a significant physical attack occurred, the Company could: (i) have operations disrupted, including a disruption to the stability of the bulk electric system, and/or property damaged; (ii) experience loss of revenues, response costs, and other financial loss; and (iii) be subject to increased regulation, litigation, and damage to the Company's reputation. Any of these outcomes could have a negative impact on TEP's business and results of operations. 
 TEP is subject to cyber-attacks which could have a negative impact on the Company's business and results of operations. 
 Cybercrime, which includes the use of malware, computer viruses, and other means for disruption or unauthorized access has increased in frequency, scope, and potential impact in recent years. The Company experiences inherent technological risk due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism, and other types of data security breaches. The Company's utility business requires access to sensitive customer data, including personal and credit information, in the ordinary course of business. The Company relies on the continued operation of sophisticated digital information technology systems and network infrastructure to operate the utility as part of an interconnected regional electrical grid. TEP's operations technology systems face a heightened risk of cyber-attack due to the critical nature of such infrastructure. 
 TEP's information technology systems and network infrastructure have been subject to, and will likely continue to be subject to, cyber-attacks from foreign or domestic sources attempting to gain unauthorized access to information and/or information systems through computer viruses and phishing attempts either directly or indirectly through its material vendors or related third parties. Such attempts could be motivated by a desire to disrupt utility operations or seek financial gain. 
 If, despite TEP's security measures, a significant cybersecurity event or data breach occurred, the Company could: (i) have operations disrupted, have customer information stolen, and experience general business system and process interruption or compromise, including that which prevents TEP from servicing customers, collecting revenues or recording, processing and/or reporting financial information correctly; (ii) experience loss of revenues, response costs, and other financial loss; and (iii) be subject to increased regulation, litigation, and damage to the Company's reputation. Any of these outcomes could have a negative impact on TEP's business and results of operations. 
 GENERAL RISK FACTORS 
 Changes in tax regulation may negatively affect the results of operations, net income, and cash flows of TEP. 
 The Company is subject to taxation by the various taxing authorities at the federal, state and local levels where it does business. Legislation or regulation could be enacted by any of these governmental authorities, which could affect the Company s tax positions. The IRA was enacted on August 16, 2022. TEP is currently assessing the overall impacts of this legislation and interpretive guidance from tax authorities relating thereto. Legislative and/or regulatory changes have and could continue to impact our results of operations, net income, and cash flows. 
 The failure to attract, retain, and manage an appropriately qualified workforce could negatively impact TEP s business and results of operations. 
 TEP s business is dependent on its ability to attract, retain, and manage qualified personnel, including key executive officers and skilled professional and technical employees and contractors. Certain events and conditions, such as an aging workforce 
 15 

Table of Contents 

 without available replacements, a shift in employee expectations with respect to compensation and flexible work arrangements, the unavailability of contract resources, and the ongoing need to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with union employees, may lead to significant operating challenges, including lack of resources, loss of knowledge base, time required for skill development, and labor disruptions. If TEP is unable to successfully attract, retain, and manage an appropriately qualified workforce, its business and results of operations could be negatively affected. 
 The widespread outbreak of an illness, communicable disease, or any other public health crisis could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 TEP could be negatively impacted by the widespread outbreak of an illness, communicable disease, or any other public health crisis that results in economic and trade disruptions, including the disruption of global supply chains. The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the economy on a global, national, and local level, disrupted global supply chains, and created volatility and disruption of financial markets. Responses from governmental authorities and companies to reduce the spread of the pandemic affected economic activity through various containment measures including, among others, business closures, work stoppages, quarantine and work-from-home guidelines, limiting capacity at public spaces and events, vaccination requirements, and/or restrictions of global and regional travel. 
 Another outbreak of an illness, a communicable disease, or any other public health crisis, and any resulting impacts, such as an extended period of global supply chain and/or economic disruption, labor shortages, or government-mandated actions in response to such public health crisis could materially affect TEP s business, results of operations, access to sources of liquidity, and financial condition. 

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS 
 None. 

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES 
 TEP's corporate headquarters is owned by TEP and located in Tucson, Arizona. Operational support facilities for Tucson operations are owned by TEP and located in Tucson, Arizona. 
 TEP has land easements for transmission facilities related to San Juan, Four Corners, and Navajo located on tribal lands of the Zuni, Navajo, and Tohono O odham Nations. Four Corners and Navajo are located on properties held under land easements from the United States and under leases from the Navajo Nation. TEP, in conjunction with PNM and Samchully Power Utilities 1 LLC, holds an undivided ownership interest in the property on which Luna is located. 
 TEP s rights under various land easements and leases may be subject to defects such as: 
 possible conflicting grants or encumbrances due to the absence of, or inadequacies in, the recording laws or record systems of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian Nations; 
 possible inability of TEP to legally enforce its rights against adverse claims and the Indian Nations without Congressional consent; or 
 failure or inability of the Indian Nations to protect TEP s interests in the land easements and leases from disruption by the U.S. Congress, Secretary of the Interior, or other adverse claims. 
 These possible defects have not interfered, and are not expected to materially interfere, with TEP s interest in and operation of its facilities. 
 TEP's rights under land easements expire at various times and renewal action by the applicable tribal or federal agencies are required. The ultimate cost of renewal for certain of the rights-of-way for the Company's transmission lines is uncertain. The principal owned generation, distribution, and transmission facilities of TEP are described in Part I, Item 1. Business, Overview of Business and such descriptions are incorporated herein by reference.

 OUTLOOK AND STRATEGIES 
 Our financial performance and outlook are affected by many factors, including: (i) global, national, regional, and local economic conditions; (ii) volatility in the financial markets; (iii) environmental laws, regulations, and policies; and (iv) other regulatory and legislative actions. Our plans and strategies include: 
 Achieving constructive outcomes in our regulatory proceedings that will provide us: (i) recovery of our full cost of service and an opportunity to earn an appropriate return on our rate base investments; and (ii) updated rates that provide more accurate price signals and a more equitable allocation of costs to our customers. 
 Continuing our transition from carbon-intensive sources to a more sustainable energy portfolio, while providing reliability and rate stability for our customers, mitigating environmental impacts, complying with regulatory requirements, leveraging and improving our existing utility infrastructure, and maintaining financial strength. Our goal is to reduce carbon emissions by 80 and to supply more than 70 of our energy to retail customers from renewable resources by 2035. In May 2022, Fortis set a goal to achieve net-zero direct GHG emissions by 2050. The establishment of this additional target reinforces Fortis' commitment, along with that of its subsidiaries, to decarbonize over the long-term, while preserving customer reliability and affordability. These goals may be impacted by various federal and state energy policies, including policies currently under consideration. 
 Focusing on our core utility business through operational excellence, promoting economic development in our service territory, investing in infrastructure to ensure reliable service, and maintaining a strong community presence. 
 Performance - 2022 Compared with 2021 
 We reported net income of 217 million in 2022 compared with 201 million in 2021. The increase of 16 million, or 8 , was primarily due to: 
 21 million in higher retail revenue primarily due to higher usage as a result of more favorable weather and increased LFCR revenue; 
 17 million in higher margin from wholesale transactions primarily due to an increase in sales volume; and 
 19 

Table of Contents 

 10 million in higher transmission related revenue impacted by favorable market conditions. 
 The increase was partially offset by: 
 12 million in lower AFUDC due to a decrease in eligible construction expenditures primarily as a result of Oso Grande being placed in service in May 2021; 
 11 million decrease in the value of investments used to support certain post-employment benefits as a result of unfavorable market conditions; 
 6 million in higher base operations and maintenance expenses primarily due to an increase in outside services expense and employee wages expense; partially offset by lower remote plant expenses due to the shutdown of San Juan Unit 1 in June 2022; and 
 5 million in higher depreciation and amortization expense due to an increase in asset base. 
 
 FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Several factors affect our current and future results of operations. The most significant factors are related to regulatory matters, generation resource strategy, and weather patterns. 
 Regulatory Matters 
 We are subject to comprehensive regulation. The discussion below contains material developments in those matters. 
 2022 Rate Case 
 In June 2022, we filed a general rate case with the ACC based on a test year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Our key 2022 Rate Case proposals are described below: 
 a 136 million net increase in retail revenues comprised of the following components: 
 a non-fuel retail revenue increase of 159 million over test year non-fuel retail revenues; 
 a 66 million increase in fuel-related retail revenues, offset by a 71 million reduction in PPFAC revenues; and 
 changes in certain adjustor mechanisms, including DSM, ECA, and RES, which result in an 18 million reduction in revenues. 
 a 7.31 return on original cost rate base of 3.6 billion, which includes a cost of equity of 10.25 and an average cost of debt of 3.82 ; 
 a capital structure for rate making purposes of approximately 54 common equity and 46 long-term debt; and 
 a RTM adjustor that is designed to provide more timely recovery of our clean energy investments and replace the ECA. 
 We requested new rates to be implemented by September 1, 2023. We cannot predict the timing or outcome of this proceeding. 
 2020 ACC Phase 2 Proceedings 
 In 2020, the ACC issued a rate order for new rates and established a second phase of our rate case to address the impact on certain communities due to the closures of fossil-based generation facilities (Phase 2). In 2021, the ACC staff opened a generic docket related to this matter and in January 2022, the ACC issued an order delaying Phase 2 until after the completion of the generic docket. In January 2023, the ACC closed Phase 2 and ordered that just and equitable transition issues be considered as part of the 2022 Rate Case. 
 Energy Imbalance Market 
 In 2019, we signed an agreement with the California Independent System Operator indicating our intent to begin participating in the EIM that we subsequently entered in May 2022. The EIM is a real-time energy market intended to resource low-cost energy to serve real-time consumer demand across a wide geographic area. Participation in the EIM is voluntary and available to all balancing authorities in the western United States. In order to participate in the EIM, we must continue to demonstrate 
 20 

Table of Contents 

 resource adequacy through a combination of owned or contracted resources. Our participation in the EIM: (i) reduces the costs to serve customers through a more efficient dispatch of a larger and more diverse pool of resources; (ii) allows for more effective integration of renewables; and (iii) enhances reliability through improved system utilization and responsiveness. These benefits are expected to be sustained over the life of our participation in the EIM. 
 2022 Final FERC Rate Order 
 In 2019, we filed a proposal with the FERC requesting a forward-looking formula rate intended to allow for a timely recovery of transmission-related costs. The FERC issued an order approving our proposed OATT revisions effective August 1, 2019, subject to refund and further proceedings. As part of the 2022 Final FERC Rate Order, the FERC established hearing and settlement procedures. In December 2021, the settlement agreement was filed with the FERC. In March 2022, the FERC approved the settlement agreement. 
 Provisions of the settlement agreement include, but are not limited to: 
 replacing our stated transmission rates with a single forward-looking formula rate; 
 a 9.79 return on equity; and 
 elimination of transmission rates that are bifurcated between high-voltage and lower-voltage facilities, as well as elimination of the bifurcated loss factor. 
 Increased rates charged under the 2022 Final FERC Rate Order were subject to refund and deferred as a regulatory liability. In 2022, TEP returned all amounts in excess of the rates approved in the settlement agreement previously deferred as a regulatory liability. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. 
 Other FERC Matters 
 In January 2021, the FERC notified us that it was commencing an audit with the intent to evaluate our compliance with: (i) the accounting requirements of the Uniform System of Accounts; and (ii) the reporting requirements of the FERC Form 1 Annual Report and Supplemental Form 3-Q Quarterly Financial Reports. The audit covers the period of January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2021. On November 4, 2022, the FERC published without prejudice the final audit report with its findings and recommendations. We accepted the findings therein and submitted compliance items related to the audit in January 2023. We do not expect a material financial impact from the results of the audit. 
 Generation Resource Strategy 
 Our long-term strategy is to continue our shift from carbon-intensive sources to a more sustainable energy portfolio including expanding renewable energy resources while reducing reliance on coal-fired generation resources. In 2020, we filed our 2020 IRP with the ACC, which provides details on our long-term strategy. 
 In February 2022, the ACC acknowledged our 2020 IRP, and found it to be reasonable and in the public interest. Our 2020 IRP calls for us to reduce our carbon emissions by 80 and to supply more than 70 of our energy to retail customers from renewable resources by 2035. In April 2022, we issued an ASRFP, which requests new wind and solar generation, energy storage systems, and other resources such as energy efficiency resources. As part of the ASRFP, we received and are evaluating bids for all resource types. 
 Our existing coal-fired generation fleet faces a number of uncertainties affecting the viability of continued operations, including changing state and federal law and energy policies, competition from other resources, fuel supply and land lease contract extensions, environmental regulations, and, for jointly-owned facilities, the willingness of other owners to continue their participation. Given this uncertainty, we plan to exit all ownership interests in coal-fired generation facilities over the next decade. We will seek regulatory recovery for amounts that would not otherwise be recovered, if any, as a result of these actions. The execution of our 2020 IRP is dependent on obtaining regulatory recovery in future rate proceedings. We filed the 2022 Rate Case with the ACC in June 2022. 
 Renewable Energy Projects 
 In 2021 and 2022, additional renewable energy projects were added to our resource portfolio increasing our total renewable nominal generation capacity, including PPAs and owned utility-scale generation, to over 700 MW.

 Oso Grande 
 Production Tax Credits 
 PTCs are per-kWh federal tax credits earned for electricity generated using qualified energy resources, which can be claimed for a 10-year period once a qualifying facility is placed in service. In May 2021, Oso Grande, a qualified energy resource, was placed in service. While costs associated with operating the facility are recorded throughout the year, PTCs are recognized through the effective tax rate provision and are primarily recognized in the third quarter due to weather patterns that contribute to seasonal fluctuations in taxable earnings. We recorded approximately 19 million and 7 million in PTCs related to Oso Grande in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The IRS published PTC rate for electricity produced by a qualified facility using wind was 0.026 for 2022 and 0.025 for 2021. 
 Contractual Provisions 
 If actual availability of the Oso Grande wind turbines is below a contractually established availability factor, we are entitled to liquidated damages to partially offset incremental operations and maintenance costs incurred. We recorded reductions related to Oso Grande liquidated damages in Operations and Maintenance on the Consolidated Statements of Income of 3 million and 2 million in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The PTCs and liquidated damages will mostly offset the operating expenses of Oso Grande, which is not currently reflected in base rates. 
 Electricity generated from Oso Grande depends heavily on wind conditions. If such conditions vary from our estimates, the project s electricity generation and associated PTCs may be substantially different than forecasted. 
 Arizona Energy Policy 
 In 2018, the ACC opened rulemaking dockets to evaluate integrated resource planning and retail competition for generation services. In 2019 and 2020, the ACC discussed draft rules related to retail electric competition, but such rules have not been officially proposed. In 2021, a company filed an application with the ACC requesting a certificate of public convenience and necessity that would grant it the authority to provide competitive electric generation service to customers in our service territory. In April 2022, legislation was signed into law that repealed statutes supporting statewide implementation of retail electric competition. The ACC has not yet determined whether to consider the application in light of this legislation. 
 Weather Patterns 
 Changing weather patterns and other factors cause seasonal fluctuations in sales of power. Our summer peaking load occurs during the third quarter of the year when cooling demand is higher, which results in higher revenue during this period. By contrast, lower sales of power occur during the first and fourth quarters of the year due to mild winter weather in our retail service territory. Seasonal fluctuations affect the comparability of our results of operations. 
 COVID-19 Pandemic Impact 
 The COVID-19 pandemic caused changes in consumer and business behavior and disrupted economic activity in our service territory. As the pandemic abates and conditions evolve, we continue to evaluate and assess protocols and plans and monitor our workforce, customers, suppliers, and operations. We have not experienced a material impact to our results of operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 Interest Rates 
 See Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk of this Form 10-K for information regarding interest rate risk and its impact on earnings. 
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Significant drivers of TEP's results of operations that do not have a significant impact on net income include: 
 Cost Recovery Mechanisms TEP records operating revenue related to cost recovery mechanisms that allow for more timely recovery of fuel and purchase power costs and certain operations and maintenance costs between rate case proceedings. These mechanisms, which include PPFAC, REST, DSM, and TEAM are generally reset annually through separate filings with the ACC. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on cost recovery mechanisms. 
 22 

Table of Contents 

 Short-Term Wholesale Sales Revenues related to short-term wholesale sales are primarily related to ACC jurisdictional generation assets and are returned to retail customers by offsetting revenues against fuel and purchased power costs eligible for recovery through the PPFAC cost recovery mechanism. 
 Springerville Units 3 and 4 Operations and maintenance expenses related to Springerville Units 3 and 4 are reimbursed by Tri-State, the lessee of Springerville Unit 3, and SRP, the owner of Springerville Unit 4, through participant billings recorded in Operating Revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
 The following discussion provides the significant items that affected TEP's results of operations for the year ended 2022 compared to 2021 presented on a pre-tax basis. 
 Operating Revenues 
 The following table provides a disaggregation of Operating Revenues: Years Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) (in millions) 2022 2021 Percent 2020 Percent Operating Revenues Retail 1,140 1,088 4.8 1,039 4.7 Wholesale, Long-Term 99 54 83.3 34 58.8 Wholesale, Short-Term (1)

 (1) Revenues associated with derivatives are primarily returned to retail customers by offsetting the fuel and purchase power costs eligible for recovery through the PPFAC mechanism similar to short-term wholesale sales. As a result, revenues associated with derivatives, other than those specifically associated with long-term contracts, are included in Wholesale, Short-Term in the table above. 
 TEP reported Operating Revenues of 1,808 million in 2022 compared with 1,593 million in 2021. The increase of 215 million, or 13 , was primarily due to: 
 92 million in higher short-term wholesale sales primarily due to an increase in price; partially offset by a decrease in volume; 
 52 million in higher retail revenue primarily due to higher PPFAC cost recoveries as a result of a higher PPFAC rate and higher usage due to more favorable weather; 
 45 million in higher long-term wholesale sales primarily due to an increase in sales volume; 
 19 million in higher other revenue primarily due to an increase in: (i) LFCR revenues as a result of a rate adjustment; (ii) TCA revenues related to true-ups; and (iii) market prices related to our natural gas transportation asset management agreement; and 
 12 million in higher transmission related revenue impacted by favorable market conditions.

The customer count is based on the number of active service agreements at the end of each period. Management uses this count to monitor the growth of retail customers. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Fuel and Purchased Power Expense 
 TEP reported Fuel and Purchased Power expense of 771 million in 2022 compared with 606 million in 2021. The increase of 165 million, or 27 , was primarily due to: 
 105 million in higher fuel costs primarily due to an increase in natural gas prices; partially offset by a decrease in Gas-Fired Generation volumes; 
 37 million decrease in PPFAC eligible costs deferred as a regulatory asset for future recovery; and 
 19 million in higher transmission costs due to an increase in transmission purchases.

 (6) In February 2021, a severe winter storm in the southwestern United States drove increased energy demand, limited the availability of natural gas to fuel generation facilities, and increased the cost of natural gas and purchased power. In June 2021, the market price for purchased power increased significantly due to high demand resulting from higher than normal temperatures. In 2022, natural gas prices continued to increase due to extreme weather and limited transportation capacity caused by constrained natural gas pipelines. 
 (7) This metric represents cost as cents per kWh for renewable and non-renewable purchased power. This number is calculated as purchased power cost divided by Purchased Power (kWh) for each respective form of purchased power. Management uses this metric to compare and monitor the costs of renewable and non-renewable purchased power. 
 Operations and Maintenance Expense 
 TEP reported Operations and Maintenance expense of 405 million in 2022 compared with 397 million in 2021. The increase of 8 million, or 2 , was primarily due to: 
 15 million in higher outside services expense and employee wages expense; and 
 3 million in higher REST and DSM expenses primarily due to higher program expenses, including customer rebates. 
 25 

Table of Contents 

 The increase was partially offset by: 
 8 million in lower operations expense related to the retirement of San Juan Unit 1 in June 2022; and 
 4 million in lower reimbursable maintenance expense related to Springerville Unit 4 planned outages in 2021, not recurring in 2022. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense 
 TEP reported Depreciation and Amortization expense of 251 million in 2022 compared with 246 million in 2021. The increase of 5 million, or 2 , was primarily due to an increase in asset base; partially offset by the retirement of San Juan Unit 1. 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 TEP reported Other Expense of 67 million in 2022 compared with 49 million in 2021. The increase of 18 million, or 37 , was primarily due to: 
 14 million in lower AFUDC primarily due to a decrease in eligible construction expenditures as a result of Oso Grande being placed in service in May 2021; and 
 11 million decrease in the value of investments used to support certain post-employment benefits as a result of unfavorable market conditions. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Liquidity 
 Any extended period of economic disruption could affect our business and financial conditions, and access to sources of liquidity. Cash flows vary during the year with cash flows from operations typically being the lowest in the first quarter of the year and highest in the third quarter due to TEP's summer peaking load. We face market risks associated with fluctuations in commodity prices, which can temporarily affect our cash flows prior to recovery through regulatory mechanisms. We cannot project the future level of commodity prices or their volatility. We use our revolving credit as needed to fund our business activities. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity under the 2021 Credit Agreement to meet short-term working capital needs and to provide credit enhancement as necessary under energy procurement and hedging agreements. The availability and terms under which we have access to external financing depend on a variety of factors, including our credit ratings and conditions in the bank and capital markets. 
 Available Liquidity (in millions) December 31, 2022 Cash and Cash Equivalents 16 Amount Available under Revolving Credit Agreement (1)

 (1) The 2021 Credit Agreement provides for revolving credit commitments with swingline and LOC sublimits of 15 million and 50 million, respectively, and a maturity date of October 2026. See Access to Credit Agreement below. 
 Future Liquidity Requirements 
 We expect to meet all of our short-term and long-term financial obligations and other anticipated cash out flows for the foreseeable future. These obligations and anticipated cash outflows include but are not limited to: (i) dividend payments; (ii) debt maturities; (iii) employee benefit obligations; and (iv) known commitments and other contractual obligations including forecasted capital expenditures. 
 See Part II, Item 7A.

 Not meaningful 
 (1) Calculated on rounded data and may not correspond exactly to amounts on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash flows provided by operating activities increased by 81 million in 2022 compared with 2021 primarily due to: (i) higher retail revenue primarily due to higher PPFAC cost recoveries as a result of a higher PPFAC rate, higher sales due to more favorable weather, and increased LFCR revenue; (ii) changes in working capital related to the timing of billing collections and cash collateral deposits received from counterparties due to high natural gas forward prices; and (iii) higher margin from wholesale transactions primarily due to an increase in sales volumes. 
 The increase was partially offset by higher base operations and maintenance expenses primarily due to an increase in outside services expense and employee wages expense; partially offset by lower remote plant expenses due to the shutdown of San Juan Unit 1 in June 2022. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash flows used for investing activities decreased by 39 million in 2022 compared with 2021 primarily due to a decrease in cash paid for capital expenditures in 2022. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash flows provided by financing activities decreased by 53 million in 2022 compared with 2021 primarily due to: (i) a decrease in equity contributions from UNS Energy; (ii) an increase in dividends declared and paid to UNS Energy; and (iii) lower proceeds from credit facility borrowings, net of repayments. 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Short-Term Investments 
 Our short-term investment policy governs the investment of excess cash balances. We periodically review and update this policy in response to market conditions. As of December 31, 2022, TEP had no short-term investments. 
 Access to Credit 
 We have access to working capital through our credit agreement with lenders. 
 Amounts borrowed from the 2021 Credit Agreement are used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. LOCs will be issued from time to time to support energy procurement, hedging transactions, and other business activities. As of December 31, 2022, there was 245 million available under the 2021 Credit Agreement, which reflects no outstanding borrowings and a 5 million LOC issued with fees that accrue at a rate of 1.025 per annum. 
 See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding our 2021 Credit Agreement .

 Debt Financing 
 We use debt financing to meet a portion of our capital needs and lower our overall cost of capital. Our cost of capital is also affected by our credit ratings. In December 2020, the ACC issued an order granting TEP financing authority that took effect January 1, 2021. The order provides authority through December 2025 for: (i) a maximum amount of long-term debt outstanding not to exceed 2.9 billion; (ii) parent equity contributions up to 700 million; and (iii) credit facilities not to exceed 300 million in the aggregate. In May 2022, we filed a Form S-3 with the SEC. 
 TEP has, from time to time, refinanced or repurchased portions of its outstanding debt before scheduled maturity. Depending on market conditions, we may refinance other debt issuances or repurchase debt. 
 In June 2022, TEP redeemed at par prior to maturity 16 million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate tax-exempt bonds bearing interest at a rate of 4.50 per annum. 
 In March 2022, TEP redeemed at par prior to maturity 177 million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate tax-exempt bonds bearing interest at a rate of 4.50 per annum. 
 In February 2022, TEP issued and sold 325 million aggregate principal amount of 3.25 senior unsecured notes due May 2032 with proceeds used to redeem debt and for general corporate purposes. 
 We anticipate issuing long-term debt in the first quarter of 2023, and plan to amend the 2021 Credit Agreement to provide for the transition to SOFR-based borrowings before the end of the second quarter of 2023. 
 Credit Ratings 
 Credit ratings affect our access to capital markets and supplemental bank financing. As of December 31, 2022, credit ratings from S P Global Ratings and Moody s Investors Service for our senior unsecured debt were A- and A3, respectively. 
 Our credit ratings depend on a number of factors, both quantitative and qualitative, and are subject to change at any time. The disclosure of these credit ratings is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold TEP securities. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other ratings. 
 The 2021 Credit Agreement contains pricing based on our credit ratings. A change in TEP s credit ratings can cause an increase or decrease in the amount of interest we pay on our borrowings, and the amount of fees we pay for LOCs and unused commitments. 
 Debt Covenants 
 Under certain agreements, should TEP fail to maintain compliance with covenants, lenders could accelerate the maturity of all amounts outstanding. As of December 31, 2022, TEP was in compliance with these covenants. 
 We do not have any provisions in any of our debt agreements that would cause an event of default or cause amounts to become due and payable in the event of a credit rating downgrade. 
 Contributions from Parent 
 TEP received no equity contributions from UNS Energy in 2022 and received an equity contribution of 50 million in 2021. The proceeds provided additional liquidity to TEP and were used for investments in generation, transmission, and distribution assets. 
 Dividends Declared and Paid to Parent 
 TEP declared and paid 100 million in dividends to UNS Energy in 2022 and 63 million in 2021. 
 Master Trading Agreements 
 TEP conducts its wholesale marketing and risk management activities under certain master trading agreements. Under these agreements, TEP may be required to post credit enhancements in the form of cash or LOCs due to exposures exceeding unsecured credit limits established for TEP based on changes in: (i) contract values; (ii) our credit ratings; or (iii) material changes in our creditworthiness. As of December 31, 2022, TEP had no cash posted as collateral to provide credit enhancement related to our wholesale marketing or risk management activities.

 Capital Expenditures 
 TEP's routine capital expenditures include funds used for customer growth, system reinforcement, replacements and betterments, and costs to comply with environmental rules and regulations. TEP is prioritizing capital projects to mitigate supply chain risk particularly in view of heightened geopolitical instability and global supply chain challenges. In 2022, total capital expenditures of 458 million included: (i) investments in distribution and transmission assets including initial payments for the construction of the Vail to Tortolita 230kV transmission line and a payment for a transmission right of way; and (ii) final payments in the Raptor Ridge project. In 2021, total capital expenditures of 499 million included: (i) investments in distribution and transmission assets; and (ii) 10 million in payments for the Oso Grande project. 
 Our forecasted capital expenditures presented below exclude amounts for AFUDC equity and other non-cash items: Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Generation Facilities: Renewable Energy (1)

 (2) Investments in transmission capacity and distribution system reliability. 
 (3) Includes cost for information technology, fleet, facilities, and communication equipment. 
 These estimates are subject to continuing review and adjustment. Actual capital expenditures may differ from these estimates due to fluctuations in business and market conditions, including inflationary pressures, construction schedules, labor shortages and/or labor strikes, possible early plant closures, changes in generation resources, environmental requirements, state or federal regulations, new or changing commitments, and other factors. We expect to pay for forecasted capital expenditures with internally generated funds and external financings, which may include issuances of long-term debt, other borrowings, or equity contributions. 
 Income Tax Position 
 Under the terms of the tax sharing agreement with UNS Energy, we received net refunds of 5 million in 2022 and made net payments of 7 million in 2021 related to federal income tax returns. Future payment obligations are subject to change and are not expected to have a significant impact on our operating cash flows. 
 Inflation Reduction Act 
 On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the IRA into law. The IRA did not result in any immediate financial statement impacts for the Company. However, the legislation enacted a new corporate AMT of 15 that will be effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. We expect to be subject to the new AMT based on our status as a member of a foreign-parented multinational group. 
 
 Environmental Matters 
 The EPA has the authority to regulate the amount of SO 2 , NO x , CO 2 , particulate matter, mercury and other by-products produced by generation facilities. We may incur additional costs to comply with future changes in federal and state environmental laws, regulations, and permit requirements at our generation facilities. Environmental laws and regulations are subject to a range of interpretations, which may ultimately be resolved by the courts. Because these laws and regulations continue to evolve, we are unable to predict the impact they may have on our operations and consolidated financial results. Complying with these changes may reduce operating efficiency and increase capital and operating costs. TEP expects recovery of the costs of environmental compliance through cost recovery mechanisms and Retail Rates. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on the Broadway-Pantano site. 
 We capitalized 2 million in 2022 and 3 million in 2021 in costs incurred to comply with environmental rules and regulations. 
 29 

Table of Contents 

 In addition, we recorded operations and maintenance expenses related to environmental compliance of 6 million in each of 2022 and 2021. We expect environmental compliance related capital expenditures of 2 million in each of 2023 and 2024 and 1 million in each of 2025, 2026 and 2027. TEP will request recovery from its customers of the costs of environmental compliance through cost recovery mechanisms and Retail Rates. 
 Regional Haze Regulations 
 The EPA's Regional Haze rule requires emission reductions from certain industrial facilities emitting air pollutants that reduce visibility in national parks and wilderness areas. The rule calls for states to establish goals and emission reduction strategies for improving visibility in these areas. States must submit these goals and strategies to the EPA for approval in the form of a SIP and must review and submit revisions to the SIP on a periodic basis. 
 In December 2016, the EPA signed a final rule that, among other things, changed the submittal date for the next Regional Haze SIP revisions from 2018 to 2021. The ADEQ began to develop a control strategy with a focus on making reasonable progress toward the national visibility goal. In July 2019, the ADEQ notified TEP that Sundt Unit 3 and Springerville Units 1 and 2 had been selected for potential emissions controls evaluation. 
 TEP conducted the potential emissions controls evaluation, commonly referred to as the four factor analysis, for both facilities. These evaluations were submitted to the ADEQ in March 2020 for the agency's use in developing the revised SIP. The ADEQ submitted the revised SIP to the EPA in August 2022. The EPA issued a letter to the ADEQ finding Arizona's SIP revision complies with the completeness criteria outlined in the rule. By statute, the EPA has one year from the completeness determination to take action on Arizona's SIP revision. Based on current Regional Haze requirement timeframes, TEP anticipates that compliance strategies, if any, will likely be required to be implemented two years after the ADEQ's submission of the revised SIP to the EPA. TEP cannot predict the outcome of these matters at this time but will continue to work with the ADEQ to determine compliance strategies as needed. 
 Greenhouse Gas Regulation 
 In August 2015, the EPA issued the CPP limiting CO 2 emissions from existing and new fossil fuel-based generation facilities. The CPP established state-level CO 2 emission rates and mass-based goals that applied to fossil fuel-based generation. 
 In June 2019, the EPA repealed the CPP and issued the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule, establishing new emission guidelines for existing coal-fired generation facilities based on the Best System of Emission Reduction (BSER) for GHG emissions. The BSER for GHG emissions from existing coal-fired generation facilities is defined as Heat-Rate Improvements that can be applied at the source. The states would then use these emission guidelines to establish state performance standards, considering source specific factors such as the remaining useful life of an individual unit. 
 In 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit: (i) vacated the EPA's repeal of the CPP and remanded it back to the EPA for further consideration (the vacatur was later stayed by the court); and (ii) vacated and remanded the ACE rule. Certain petitioners, defending the repeal of the CPP, filed petitions for an order requesting that the U.S. Supreme Court review the decision of the lower court. The U.S. Supreme Court granted the petitions, consolidated the cases, and issued an opinion in June 2022 concerning the scope of the EPA's authority to regulate GHG emissions from existing coal-fired generation facilities under the Clean Air Act in June 2022. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed the D.C. Circuit and remanded the cases back for further proceedings consistent with the June 2022 opinion. In September 2022, the EPA announced the opening of a non-rulemaking docket for public comments on the EPA's efforts to reduce GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-based generation facilities. Comments may be submitted to the EPA on or before March 27, 2023. 
 TEP cannot predict the outcome of these matters at this time, but will continue to monitor legal challenges, legislative efforts, and administrative rulemakings. 
 Coal Combustion Residuals Regulation 
 In April 2015, the EPA issued a final rule requiring the disposal of coal ash and other CCR to be managed as a solid waste under Subtitle D of the RCRA for disposal in landfills and/or surface impoundments. Our share of costs to comply with the CCR rule at Four Corners is estimated to be 3 million. This includes estimated costs for corrective action for two CCR units at the facility. APS, the operating agent of Four Corners, began an assessment of corrective measures in 2019, and completed the assessment in 2022. The proposed final remedy was presented to the public in August 2022, and a final remedy report is being prepared. 
 30 

Table of Contents 

 Since these regulations were finalized, the EPA has taken steps to further modify the rule. The following are pending rulemakings: 
 In December 2016, Congress approved the WIIN Act, which gave the EPA authority to either authorize states to establish their own permit program under RCRA for implementing regulation of CCR or issue federal permits in states without a program and on tribal lands. In accordance with the WIIN Act, the EPA proposed to establish a federal CCR permit program on February 20, 2020. Public comment on the EPA's proposal closed in August 2020. 
 In March 2018, the EPA proposed to add boron to the list of constituents that trigger corrective action requirements to remediate groundwater impacted by CCR disposal activities. In a separate proposal dated August 14, 2019, the EPA acknowledged that if it finalizes the addition of boron it will need to establish an alternative risk-based groundwater protection standard for boron, as boron does not have a Maximum Contaminant Level. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the EPA has not taken final action on these proposals. As a result, TEP cannot predict the outcome or timing of the proposed rulemakings. 
 Effluent Limitation Guidelines 
 In 2015, as part of the Clean Water Act, the EPA published the final Steam Electric Power Generating category Effluent Limitation Guidelines and Standard rule, revising standards and limitations for coal-fired generation wastewater discharges. The rule established new or additional ELGs for wastewater discharges associated with fly ash, bottom ash, flue gas desulfurization, flue gas mercury control, and gasification of fuels such as coal and petroleum coke. With the exception of Four Corners, none of TEP's coal-fired generation facilities are subject to the rule. 
 In response to legal challenges, the EPA revised the ELGs and issued a final rule on August 31, 2020, which became effective December 14, 2020. The final rule revised requirements for flue gas desulfurization wastewater and bottom ash transport water (BATW). To comply with the revised ELGs prior to the December 31, 2023, regulatory compliance date, APS will install and operate a BATW recycle system at Four Corners. Additionally, APS filed a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permit modification request in January 2021. APS has been working with the EPA on the permit modification, including the establishment of compliance dates for the evaluation and testing of the BATW recycle system, and the establishment of interim discharge limits for operations between 2023 and 2025. TEP cannot predict the timing or final outcome of the permitting effort at this time. Our share of the cost to comply with the revised ELGs at Four Corners is estimated to be 3.3 million. 
 National Pollution Discharge Elimination System Permit 
 Several environmental non-governmental organizations (Petitioners) sought review of the EPA s September 2019 issuance of Four Corners current National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permit from the EPA Environmental Appeals Board (EAB) in November 2019. The EAB denied the petition in September 2020. In May 2022, the Petitioners, APS, and the EPA executed a settlement agreement. The EPA has procured a contractor to conduct the surface water sampling program as outlined in the settlement agreement. The sampling program was finalized in December 2022. TEP cannot predict the timing or outcome of the surface water sampling program, but we do not expect this matter to have a material impact on our financial statements. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to apply accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements and related notes. Management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. Additional information on TEP s other significant accounting policies can be found in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K . 
 Accounting for Regulated Operations 
 We account for our regulated electric operations in accordance with accounting standards that allow the actions of our regulators, the ACC and the FERC, to be reflected in our financial statements. Regulator actions may cause us to capitalize certain costs that would be recorded as an expense, or in AOCI, in the current period by unregulated companies. We evaluate regulatory assets and liabilities each period and believe future recovery or settlement is probable. Our assessment includes consideration of recent rate orders, historical regulatory treatment of similar costs, and changes in the regulatory and political environment. If management's assessment is ultimately different than actual regulatory outcomes, the impact on our results of operations, financial position, and future cash flows could be material. 
 31 

Table of Contents 

 As of December 31, 2022, regulatory liabilities net of regulatory assets in the balance sheet totaled 118 million. There are no current or expected changes in the regulatory environment that impact our ability to apply accounting guidance for regulated operations. If we conclude in a future period that our operations no longer meet the criteria in this guidance, we will record our pension and other postretirement plan regulatory assets or liabilities in AOCL and recognize other regulatory assets and liabilities on the income statement. The impact of this change would be material to our financial statements. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding regulatory matters. 
 Plant Asset Depreciable Lives 
 TEP has significant investments in electric generation, transmission, and distribution assets. We calculate depreciation expense based on our estimate of the useful lives of our plant assets and estimated net removal costs. The ACC approves depreciation rates for all generation, distribution, and general plant assets. Depreciation rates for these assets cannot be changed without the ACC's approval. TEP's transmission assets are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC. The useful lives of plant assets are further detailed in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Changes to depreciation estimates resulting from a change of estimated service life or removal costs could have a significant impact on the amount of depreciation expense recorded in the income statement. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding depreciation rates. 
 Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations 
 GAAP requires us to record the fair value of a liability for a legal obligation to retire a long-lived tangible asset in the period in which the liability is incurred. This includes obligations resulting from conditional future events. We incur legal obligations as a result of environmental regulations imposed by state and federal regulators, contractual agreements, and other factors. To estimate the liability, management must use judgment and assumptions in determining or estimating: (i) whether a legal obligation exists to remove assets; (ii) the probability of a future event for a conditional obligation; (iii) the fair value of the cost of removal; (iv) when final removal will occur; and (v) the credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates to be used to discount the future liabilities. Changes that may arise over time with regard to our judgment and assumptions will change amounts recorded in the future as expense for AROs. Upon initial recognition of a legal liability, costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and amortized over the useful life of the related asset. Accretion of the liability and amortization of the asset are recorded as a regulated asset to be recovered through depreciation rates. 
 TEP identified legal obligations to retire generation facilities specified in land leases for its jointly-owned Four Corners, Navajo and San Juan facilities. Four Corners and Navajo reside on land leased from the Navajo Nation. The provisions of the Four Corners' lease require the lessees to remove the facilities at Four Corners upon request of the Navajo Nation at expiration of the lease. TEP is currently incurring costs to remove facilities at Navajo at the request of the Navajo Nation. TEP also has certain environmental obligations at Gila River, Luna, Sundt and Springerville. TEP estimates that its share of the AROs to remove the Navajo and Four Corners facilities and settle the Luna, San Juan, Sundt, Gila River, and Springerville environmental and contractual obligations will be approximately 201 million at the retirement dates. Additionally, TEP entered into land lease agreements or land easement agreements with certain landowners for the installation of PV and wind assets. The provisions of the PV and wind land leases or land easements require TEP to remove the PV or wind facilities upon expiration of the agreements. In addition, TEP is required to properly dispose of or recycle certain PV assets under RCRA. We estimate our ARO related to the PV and wind assets to be approximately 50 million at the retirement dates. We have identified no other legal obligations to retire generation assets. 
 TEP has various transmission and distribution lines that operate under land easements and rights-of-way that contain end dates and may contain site restoration clauses. TEP operates transmission and distribution lines as if they will be operated in perpetuity and will continue to be used or sold without land remediation. As such, there are no AROs for these assets. 
 The total net present value of our ARO liability recorded in Other on the Consolidated Balance Sheets was 121 million as of December 31, 2022. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding AROs. 
 Additionally, ACC approved depreciation rates include a component designed to accrue the future costs of retiring assets for which no legal obligations exist. The accumulated balances are recorded as a regulatory liability and represent non-legal estimated cost of removal accruals, less actual removal costs incurred, net of salvage proceeds realized. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding future net cost of removal.

 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plan Assumptions 
 TEP records the underfunded amount for its pension and other postretirement obligations as a current liability, noncurrent liability, or combination of both, and records the overfunded amount as a noncurrent asset. For plans other than the SERP, amounts not yet recognized in the income statement are recorded as a regulatory asset or liability to reflect expected recovery or refund of pension and other postretirement obligations or benefits through rates charged to retail customers. As the funded status, discount rates, and actuarial facts change, the liability and asset balances may vary significantly in future years. Key assumptions used include: 
 discount rates used to determine obligations; 
 expected returns on plan assets; 
 compensation increases; 
 mortality assumptions; and 
 healthcare cost trend rates. 
 Discount Rates 
 As of December 31, 2022, TEP discounted its future pension plan obligations at a rate of 5.7 and its other postretirement plan obligations at a rate of 5.6 . The discount rate for future pension plan and other postretirement plan obligations is determined annually based on the rates currently available on high-quality, non-callable, long-term bonds. The discount rate is based on a corporate yield curve using an average yield between the 60 th and 90 th percentile of AA-graded U.S. corporate bonds with future cash flows that match the timing and amount of expected future benefit payments. 
 Expected Returns on Plan Assets 
 To establish the expected return on assets assumption, TEP reviews the asset allocation and develops return assumptions for each asset class based on advice from an investment consultant and the pension s actuary that includes both historical performance analysis and forward-looking views of the financial markets. As of December 31, 2022, TEP assumed that its pension plans assets would generate a long-term rate of return of 7.5 . 
 Compensation Increases 
 As of December 31, 2022, TEP used a rate of compensation increase of 2.9 to measure pension obligations. 
 Mortality 
 The PRI-2012 mortality table projected with a modified version of improvement scale MP-2020 with 15-year convergence and a 0.75 long-term rate was utilized to measure pension obligations as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 Healthcare Cost Trend Rates 
 TEP used a current year healthcare cost trend rate range between 6.0 and 7.0 in valuing its other postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2022. This rate reflects both market conditions and historical experience.

 Sensitivity Analysis 
 The table below shows the effect on TEP's expense and obligation of a 100-basis point change to its assumptions as of December 31, 2022: Effect on Expense Effect on Obligation (in millions) Increase Decrease Increase Decrease Change to Pension Discount Rate (8) 11 (48) 60 Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets (5) 5 N/A N/A Change to Other Postretirement Benefits Discount Rate 1 (7) 8 Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets N/A N/A Healthcare Cost Trend Rate 2 (1) 7 (6) 
 In 2023, TEP will incur pension costs of 10 million and other postretirement benefit costs of 6 million. TEP expects to record: (i) 13 million to operations and maintenance expense; and (ii) 3 million to capital. In 2023, TEP expects to make pension plan contributions of 7 million and other retiree benefit payments of 6 million. 
 See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further details regarding TEP's pension plans and other postretirement benefit plan expenses and obligations. 
 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 
 Commodity Derivative Contracts 
 TEP enters into forward contracts to purchase or sell capacity or energy at contract prices over a given period of time, typically for one month, three months, one year, or three years, within established limits to meet forecasted load requirements or to take advantage of favorable market opportunities. In general, TEP enters into forward purchase contracts when market conditions provide the opportunity to purchase energy for its load at prices that are below the marginal cost of its supply resources or to supplement its own resources (e.g., during plant outages and summer peaking periods). TEP enters into forward sales contracts when it forecasts that it will have excess supply, and the market price of energy exceeds its marginal cost. TEP enters into forward gas commodity price swap agreements to lock in fixed prices on a portion of forecasted natural gas purchases and to hedge the price risk associated with forward PPAs that are indexed to natural gas prices. 
 For all commodity derivative instruments that do not meet the normal purchase or normal sale scope exception, we recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivative contracts entered into for retail customer load are recorded as either a regulatory asset or liability in the balance sheet based on our ability to recover the costs of hedging activities entered into to mitigate energy price risk for retail customers. There are no current or expected proposals or changes in the regulatory environment that impact the probability of future recovery of these assets through the PPFAC mechanism. 
 The market prices used to determine fair values for TEP s derivative instruments as of December 31, 2022, are estimated based on various factors including broker quotes, exchange prices, over the counter prices, and time value. 
 TEP manages the risk of counterparty default by performing financial credit reviews, setting limits, monitoring exposures, requiring collateral when needed, and using a standardized agreement, which allows for the netting of current period exposures to and from a single counterparty. 
 
 NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ISSUED AND NOT YET ADOPTED 
 For a discussion of new accounting pronouncements affecting TEP, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 TEP is exposed to certain market risks that can affect asset and liability fair value, results of operations, and cash flows. TEP's significant market risks are primarily associated with interest rates, commodity prices, and extension of credit to counterparties. TEP may enter into interest rate swaps and financing transactions to manage changes in interest rates. TEP has a RMC 
 34 

Table of Contents 

 responsible for the oversight of commodity price risk and credit risk related to wholesale energy marketing and power procurement activities. To limit TEP s exposure to commodity price risk, the RMC sets trading and hedging policies and limits, which are reviewed frequently to respond to constantly changing market conditions. To limit TEP s exposure to credit risk, the RMC reviews counterparty credit exposure as well as credit policies and limits on a regular basis. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Credit Agreement 
 TEP is subject to interest rate risk resulting from changes in interest rates on borrowings under the 2021 Credit Agreement. The interest rate paid on borrowings is variable. Amounts borrowed under the credit agreement are made on either the basis of a spread over LIBOR or an ABR. As a result, TEP may experience significant volatility in the rates paid on LIBOR borrowings under its credit agreements. TEP plans to amend the 2021 Credit Agreement to provide for the transition to SOFR-based borrowings before the end of the second quarter of 2023. 
 The 2021 Credit Agreement provides for: (i) 250 million in revolving credit commitments; (ii) a 15 million swingline sublimit; and (iii) a 50 million LOC sublimit. The agreement matures in October 2026. As of December 31, 2022, TEP had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and a 5 million LOC posted. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 TEP is exposed to market fluctuations in electricity, natural gas, and coal prices as a result of its obligation to serve retail customer load in its regulated service territory and long-term wholesale contracts. Exposure to commodity prices consist primarily of variations in the price of fuel required to generate electricity that is purchased and sold in retail and wholesale markets. Commodity prices may be subject to significant price changes as supply and demand are impacted by, among other unpredictable factors, weather, market liquidity, generation facility availability, customer usage, energy storage, and transmission and transportation constraints. Under the guidance of our RMC, we mitigate a portion of commodity price risk using forwards, financial swaps, and other agreements, to effectively secure future supply, fix fluctuating commodity prices, or sell future production generally at fixed prices. We also mitigate exposure to commodity price risk with our ability to recover these costs in regulated rates through our PPFAC mechanism, which is subject to an annual review by the ACC. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K f or additional information related to the PPFAC mechanism. 
 Certain commodity contracts qualify as derivatives and are recorded at fair value. The changes in fair value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodities. The following table shows the changes in fair value of our derivative positions: (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Unrealized Net Gain (Loss) Recorded to Regulatory (Assets) Liabilities 72 62 21 
 TEP's derivative contracts mature on various dates through 2029. The table below displays the valuation methodologies and maturities of derivative contracts by source of fair value: Unrealized Gain (Loss) of TEP s Hedging Activities Maturity 0 6 months Maturity 6 12 months Maturity over 1 yr. Total Unrealized Gain (Loss) (in millions) December 31, 2022 Prices Actively Quoted 9 5 73 87 
 Sensitivity Analysis of Derivatives 
 TEP uses sensitivity analysis to measure the potential impact of favorable and unfavorable changes in market prices on the fair value of its derivative contracts. We primarily record unrealized gains and losses as either a regulatory asset or liability. As contracts settle, the unrealized gains and losses are reversed and realized gains or losses are recorded to the PPFAC. For derivatives related to the purchase and sale of power, a 10 change in the market price of purchased power would affect unrealized positions reported as a regulatory asset or liability by approximately 1 million. For derivatives related to natural gas price hedges, a 10 change in the market price of energy would affect unrealized positions reported as a regulatory asset or liability by approximately 33 million.

Table of Contents 

 Coal Supply Agreements 
 We are subject to fuel price risk from changes in the price of coal used to fuel our coal-fired generation facilities. We mitigate risk by using long-term coal supply agreements with limited price movement. Our coal supply agreements expire in 2031. See Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources and Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information . 
 Credit Risk 
 We are exposed to credit risk in our energy-related marketing activities related to potential non-performance by counterparties. We manage the risk of counterparty default by performing financial credit reviews, setting limits, monitoring exposures, requiring collateral when needed, and using standard agreements which allow for the netting of current period exposures to and from a single counterparty. Counterparty credit exposure is calculated by adding any outstanding receivable, net of amounts payable if a netting agreement exists, to the market value of any forward contracts. If exposure exceeds credit limits or contractual collateral thresholds, we may request that a counterparty provide credit enhancement in the form of cash collateral or an LOC. 
 We have entered into short-term and long-term transactions related to our wholesale marketing and gas hedging activities with various counterparties. As of December 31, 2022, our total credit exposure was approximately 122 million, and we had approximately 4 million of exposure to non-investment grade counterparties. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had no cash posted as collateral to provide credit enhancement. As of December 31, 2022, we held approximately 15 million in collateral from our wholesale counterparties.

 ITEM 8. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the Stockholder and the Board of Directors of 
 Tucson Electric Power Company 
 Tucson, Arizona 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tucson Electric Power Company and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholder's equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements Refer to Notes 1 and 2 to the financial statements 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 The Company is subject to rate regulation by the Arizona Corporation Commission (the ACC and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC ). The ACC has jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric distribution companies in Arizona. The FERC regulates rates and services for electric transmission and wholesale power sales in interstate commerce. Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investment, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, such as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets and liabilities; operating revenues; fuel expense; purchased power expense; operation and maintenance expense; and depreciation expense. 
 We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant or plant under construction, (3) potential refunds to customers and (4) probability of potential charges related to the abandonment of regulated plants. While the Company has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 the regulatory authorities will not approve full recovery of the costs incurred. Auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities. 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the regulatory authorities included the following, among others: 
 We evaluated the effectiveness of management s controls over the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates. 
 We evaluated the Company s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments. 
 We read relevant regulatory rate orders and settlements issued by the regulatory authorities for the Company and other public utilities in Arizona, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the regulatory authorities treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared to management s recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness. 
 For regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Company s filings with the regulatory authorities and the filings with the regulatory authorities by intervenors that may impact the Company s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management s assertions. 
 We inquired of management about property, plant, and equipment that may be abandoned or retired early. We inspected the capital-projects budget and construction-in-process listings and inquired of management to identify projects that are designed to replace assets that may be retired prior to the end of the useful life. We inspected minutes of the board of directors and regulatory orders and other filings with the regulatory authorities to identify any evidence that may contradict management s assertion regarding recoverability of such costs. 
 We inspected regulatory filings for any evidence that intervenors are challenging full recovery of the cost of any capital projects. For significant projects that were over budget or if full recovery of project costs is being challenged by intervenors, we evaluated management s assessment of the probability of a disallowance of such costs.

The approved costs of carrying out this plan are recovered from retail customers through a RES surcharge. The associated lost revenues attributable to meeting DG targets are partially recovered through the LFCR mechanism. 
 TEP is required to implement cost-effective DSM programs to comply with the ACC s EE Standards. The EE Standards provide regulated utilities a DSM surcharge to recover from retail customers the costs to implement DSM programs. The associated lost revenues attributable to meeting the EE Standards are partially recovered through the LFCR mechanism. 
 Any RES or DSM surcharges collected above or below the costs incurred to implement the plans are deferred and reflected in the balance sheet as a regulatory liability or asset. TEP recognizes RES and DSM surcharge revenue in Operating Revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income in amounts necessary to offset recognized qualifying expenditures. 
 RENEWABLE ENERGY CREDITS 
 The ACC measures compliance with the RES requirements through RECs. A REC represents one kWh generated from renewable resources. When TEP purchases renewable energy, the premium paid above the market cost of conventional power, or the REC purchase price, equals the REC cost recoverable through the RES surcharge. As described above, the market cost of conventional power or contract price for power is recoverable through the PPFAC mechanism.

 TEP requested new rates to be implemented by September 1, 2023. TEP cannot predict the timing or outcome of this proceeding. 
 2020 ACC Phase 2 Proceedings 
 In 2020, the ACC issued a rate order for new rates and established a second phase of TEP s rate case to address the impact on certain communities due to the closures of fossil-based generation facilities (Phase 2). In 2021, the ACC staff opened a generic docket related to this matter, and in January 2022, the ACC issued an order delaying Phase 2 until after the completion of the generic docket. In January 2023, the ACC closed Phase 2 and ordered that just and equitable transition issues be considered as part of the 2022 Rate Case. 
 2022 Final FERC Rate Order 
 In 2019, TEP filed a proposal with the FERC requesting a forward-looking formula rate intended to allow for timely recovery of transmission-related costs. The FERC issued an order approving TEP's proposed OATT revisions effective August 1, 2019, subject to refund and further proceedings. As part of the 2022 Final FERC Rate Order, the FERC established hearing and

 return on equity; and 
 elimination of transmission rates that are bifurcated between high-voltage and lower-voltage facilities, as well as elimination of the bifurcated loss factor. 
 Increased rates charged under the 2022 Final FERC Rate Order were subject to refund and deferred as a regulatory liability. In 2022, TEP returned all amounts in excess of the rates approved in the settlement agreement previously deferred as a regulatory liability. TEP had wholesale revenues reserved in Current Liabilities Regulatory Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022, and million reserved as of December 31, 2021, related to the 2022 Final FERC Rate Order. 
 OTHER FERC MATTERS 
 In January 2021, the FERC notified TEP that it was commencing an audit with the intent to evaluate TEP's compliance with: (i) the accounting requirements of the Uniform System of Accounts; and (ii) the reporting requirements of the FERC Form 1 Annual Report and Supplemental Form 3-Q Quarterly Financial Reports. The audit covered the period of January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2021. On November 4, 2022, the FERC published without prejudice the final audit report with its findings and recommendations. TEP accepted the findings therein and submitted compliance items related to the audit in January 2023. TEP does not expect a material financial impact from the results of the audit. 
 COST RECOVERY MECHANISMS 
 TEP has received regulatory decisions that allow for timely recovery of certain costs through recovery mechanisms. Cost recovery mechanisms that have a material impact on TEP's operations or financial results are described below. 
 Purchased Power and Fuel Adjustment Clause 
 TEP's PPFAC rate is typically adjusted annually on April 1st and goes into effect for the subsequent -month period unless the schedule is modified by the ACC. The PPFAC rate includes: (i) a forward component which is calculated by taking the difference between forecasted fuel and purchased power costs and the amount of those costs established in Retail Rates; and (ii) a true-up component that allows for reconciliation of differences between actual costs and those recovered in the preceding period. In April 2022, the ACC approved a rate adjustment for the PPFAC that sets the true-up component of the PPFAC rate to recover the existing uncollected true-up balance over months. The ACC also set the forward-looking component of the PPFAC rate to , which has resulted in under-collection of PPFAC costs. 
 Deferred Fuel and Purchased Power Costs (1) 
 PPFAC and Base Power Recoveries (2) 
 ) ) End of Period 
 (1) Includes costs eligible for recovery through the PPFAC and base power rates. 
 (2) In March 2021, the ACC approved a PPFAC surcharge as part of TEP's annual rate adjustment request beginning in June 2021. The 2022 PPFAC rate adjustment became effective on April 29, 2022. 
 Environmental Compliance Adjustor 
 The ECA allows for the recovery of capital carrying costs and incremental operations and maintenance costs related to environmental investments, provided they are not already recovered in base rates or recovered through another commission-approved mechanism.

 of total annual retail revenue. The difference between costs recovered through rates and actual ECA eligible costs is deferred . TEP defers over-recovered costs as a regulatory liability to return to customers and defers under-recovered costs as a regulatory asset to recover from customers in the future. The 2022 Rate Case includes a proposal to transition away from the current ECA surcharge and to recover the costs in base rates. 
 Tax Expense Adjustor Mechanism 
 The TEAM allows for the timely recovery of future significant income tax changes and provides the Company the ability to pass through as a kWh surcharge: (i) the change in EDIT compared to the test year; and (ii) the income tax effects of tax legislation that materially impacts TEP's authorized revenue requirement. 
 Transmission Cost Adjustor 
 The TCA allows for timely recovery of actual costs required to provide transmission services to retail customers. The TCA is limited to the recovery, or refund, of costs associated with future changes in TEP's OATT rate. The Company files a notice with the ACC in December each year presenting a revised tariff that reflects the changes in the formula OATT rate which goes into effect in the first billing cycle in January of each year. 
 In February 2022, the ACC approved TEP's motion to modify the TCA plan of administration to reflect the terms of the 2022 Final FERC Rate Order settlement agreement. 
 Renewable Energy Standard 
 The ACC s RES requires Arizona regulated utilities to increase their use of renewable energy each year until it represents at least of their total annual retail energy sales by 2025, with DG accounting for . The renewable energy requirement in 2022 was of retail electric sales. In 2022, the percentage of TEP's retail kWh sales attributable to the RES was approximately . Arizona utilities are required to file an annual RES implementation plan for review and approval by the ACC. TEP recovers approved costs of carrying out this plan from retail customers through a RES surcharge. 
 In 2021, the ACC approved TEP's 2021 RES implementation plan for the years 2021 and 2022 with a budget of million. The approved amounts fund: (i) above market cost of renewable power purchases; (ii) previously awarded incentives for customer-installed DG; and (iii) various other program costs. Additionally, the ACC directed TEP to collaborate with the ACC to develop and file a proposal to phase out the RES tariff. In June 2022, TEP filed a request with the ACC for approval of an extension of the 2021 RES implementation plan through the completion of the 2022 Rate Case. The rate case includes a proposal to transition away from the current RES surcharge and to recover the costs in base rates. 
 Energy Efficiency Standards 
 TEP is required to implement cost-effective DSM programs to comply with the ACC s EE Standards. The EE Standards provide regulated utilities a DSM surcharge to recover from retail customers the costs to implement DSM programs, as well as an annual performance incentive. TEP records its annual DSM performance incentive for the prior calendar year in the first quarter of each year. As of December 31, 2022, TEP's cumulative annual energy savings were approximately . 
 In November 2022, the ACC approved TEP s 2022 energy efficiency implementation plan, with a budget of million, which is collected through the DSM surcharge. The 2022 plan will remain in effect until another plan is approved. The 2022 Rate Case includes a proposal to transition away from the current DSM surcharge and to recover the costs in base rates. 
 In 2022, the ACC set an annual energy efficiency target measured by retail MWh savings over three years. 
 Lost Fixed Cost Recovery Mechanism 
 The LFCR mechanism provides for recovery of certain non-fuel costs that would go unrecovered between rate cases due to reduced retail kWh sales as a result of implementing ACC-approved energy efficiency programs and customer-installed DG. The LFCR mechanism is adjusted in each rate case when the ACC approves new base rates. TEP records a regulatory asset and recognizes LFCR revenues when amounts are verifiable regardless of when the lost retail kWh sales occurred. TEP is required to make an annual filing with the ACC requesting recovery of LFCR revenues recognized in the prior year. The recovery is subject to a year-over-year increase cap of of TEP's applicable retail revenues.

 Minimum Purchase Commitments 
 Fuel, Including Transportation 
 TEP has long-term agreements for the purchase and delivery of coal with various expiration dates between 2023 and 2031. In 2022, TEP amended and extended its existing coal sales agreement for the supply of coal for Springerville Unit 1 through 2027 and Unit 2 through 2031. Amounts paid under these contracts depend on actual quantities purchased and delivered. Some of these agreements include price adjustment components that will affect future costs. 
 TEP entered into natural gas commodity purchase agreements that expire through 2023. Certain of these contracts are at a fixed price per MMBtu and others are indexed to natural gas prices. The commitment amounts included in the table above are based on projected market prices as of December 31, 2022. 
 TEP has firm natural gas transportation agreements with capacity sufficient to meet its load requirements. In 2022, TEP extended an agreement for gas transportation to Luna through 2032. These agreements expire in various years between 2023 and 2040. 
 TEP has related party agreements for natural gas supply with UNS Electric through 2023. UNS Electric will pay TEP monthly charges equal to of TEP's related monthly natural gas cost. Natural gas is supplied as needed to meet UNS Electric s load requirements. TEP's commitment does not reflect any reduction for the subsequent sale of natural gas. See Note 6 for more information on related party transactions. 
 Purchased Power 
 TEP has contracts for purchased power to: (i) meet system load and energy requirements; (ii) replace generation from company-owned units under maintenance and during outages; and (iii) meet operating reserve obligations. In general, these contracts provide for capacity and energy payments based on actual power taken under the contracts with various expiration dates through the third quarter of 2024. Certain of these contracts are at a fixed price per MW and others are indexed to market prices. The commitment amounts included in the table above are based on projected market prices as of December 31, 2022. 
 TEP has a tolling PPA to purchase and receive up to MW of capacity, power, and ancillary services from June 15 through October 15, 2023. TEP will pay monthly capacity charges and variable power charges. TEP also has a tolling PPA with UNS Electric to sell and deliver up to MW of capacity, power, and ancillary services over the same period. UNS Electric will pay TEP of TEP's monthly capacity charges and variable power charges. TEP's commitment does not reflect any reduction for the subsequent sale of capacity. See Note 6 for more information on related party transactions.

 RES Performance-Based Incentives 
 TEP has entered into REC purchase agreements to purchase the environmental attributes from retail customers with solar installations. Payments for the RECs are termed PBIs and are paid in contractually agreed-upon intervals (usually quarterly) based on metered renewable energy production. These agreements expire in various years between 2023 and 2034. 
 CONTINGENCIES 
 Legal Matters 
 TEP is party to a variety of legal actions arising out of the normal course of business. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. TEP believes such normal and routine litigation will not have a material impact on its operations or financial results. 
 Mine Reclamation at Generation Facilities Not Operated by TEP 
 TEP pays ongoing mine reclamation costs related to coal mines that supply generation facilities in which TEP has an ownership interest but does not operate. Amounts recorded for final mine reclamation are subject to various assumptions, such as estimations of reclamation costs, timing of when final reclamation will occur, and the expected inflation rate. As these assumptions change, TEP prospectively adjusts the expense amounts for final reclamation over the remaining term of the respective coal supply agreement. TEP s PPFAC allows the Company to pass through to retail customers final mine reclamation costs, as a component of fuel costs. Therefore, TEP defers these expenses until recovered from customers by recording a regulatory asset and the reclamation liability over the remaining life of the respective coal supply agreements. TEP recovers the regulatory asset through the PPFAC as final mine reclamation costs are funded. After expiration of the related coal supply agreement, TEP will record its share of any change in the estimate of its final mine reclamation liability to its regulatory asset and reclamation liability. 
 TEP is liable for a portion of final mine reclamation costs upon closure of the mines servicing San Juan and Four Corners. TEP's share of final mine reclamation costs at Four Corners is million upon the expiration of the Four Corners coal supply agreement in 2031. TEP ceased operations at San Juan upon expiration of the coal supply agreement on June 30, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, TEP's remaining final mine reclamation liability at San Juan was million. TEP established a trust to fund its share of estimated final mine reclamation costs at San Juan, which will remain in effect through the completion of final mine reclamation activities currently projected to be 2039. For additional information see Note 1, Restricted Cash, and Note 3, Plant in Service. 
 TEP's aggregate liability balance related to San Juan and Four Corners final mine reclamation totaled million and million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and was recorded in Other on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Performance Guarantees 
 TEP has joint generation participation agreements with participants at Four Corners and Luna, which expire in 2041 and 2046, respectively. The participants at Four Corners and Luna, including TEP, have guaranteed certain performance obligations. Specifically, in the event of payment default, each non-defaulting participant has agreed to bear its proportionate share of expenses otherwise payable by the defaulting participant. In exchange, the non-defaulting participants are entitled to receive their proportionate share of the generation capacity of the defaulting participant. There is maximum potential amount of future payments TEP could be required to make under the Luna guarantee. The maximum potential amount of future payments on the non-defaulting parties is million at Four Corners. As of December 31, 2022, there have been such payment defaults under either of the participation agreements. 
 The Navajo and San Juan participation agreements expired in 2019 and 2022, respectively, but certain performance obligations continue through the decommissioning of both generation facilities. In the case of a default under either participation agreement, the non-defaulting participants would seek financial recovery directly from the defaulting party.

 For all pension plans, TEP amortizes prior service costs and benefits on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans. 
 Net periodic benefit cost is subject to various assumptions and determinations, such as the discount rate, the rate of compensation increase, and the expected return on plan assets. Changes that may arise over time regarding these assumptions and determinations will change amounts recorded in the future as net periodic benefit cost. 
 TEP uses a combination of sources in selecting the expected long-term rate-of-return-on-assets assumption, including an investment return model. The model used provides a best-estimate range over years from the th percentile to the th percentile. The model, used as a guideline for selecting the overall rate-of-return-on-assets assumption, is based on forward-looking return expectations only. The above method is used for all asset classes.

 Pension Plan Investments 
 Investment Goals 
 Asset allocation is the principal method for achieving each pension plan s investment objectives while maintaining appropriate levels of risk. TEP considers the projected impact on benefit security of any proposed changes to the current asset allocation policy. The expected long-term returns and implications for pension plan sponsor funding are reviewed in selecting policies to ensure that current asset pools are projected to be adequate to meet the expected liabilities of the pension plans. TEP expects to use asset allocation policies weighted most heavily to equity and fixed income funds, while maintaining some exposure to real estate and opportunistic funds. Within the fixed income allocation, long-duration funds may be used to partially hedge interest rate risk. 
 Risk Management 
 TEP recognizes the difficulty of achieving investment objectives considering the uncertainties and complexities of the investment markets. The Company recognizes some risk must be assumed to achieve a pension plan s long-term investment objectives. In establishing risk tolerances, the following factors affecting risk tolerance and risk objectives will be considered: (i) plan status; (ii) plan sponsor financial status and profitability; (iii) plan features; and (iv) workforce characteristics. TEP determined that the pension plans can tolerate some interim fluctuations in market value and rates of return to achieve long-term objectives. TEP tracks each pension plan s portfolio relative to the benchmark through quarterly investment reviews. The reviews consist of a performance and risk assessment of all investment categories and on the portfolio. Investment managers for the pension plan may use derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes or as part of their investment strategy. Currency hedges may also be used for defensive purposes. 
 Relationship between Plan Assets and Benefit Obligations 
 The overall health of each plan will be monitored by comparing the value of plan obligations (both Accumulated Benefit Obligation and Projected Benefit Obligation) against the fair value of assets and tracking the changes in each. The frequency of this monitoring will depend on the availability of plan data but will be no less frequent than annually via actuarial valuation.

 2015 SHARE UNIT PLAN 
 The Human Resources and Governance Committee of UNS Energy approved and UNS Energy's Board of Directors ratified the 2015 Share Unit Plan (2015 Plan) effective January 2015. Under the 2015 Plan, key employees, including executive officers of UNS Energy and its subsidiaries, may be granted long-term incentive awards of PSUs and RSUs annually. Each PSU and RSU granted is valued based on share of Fortis common stock traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange, converted to U.S. dollars.

Energy Derivative Contracts, No Regulatory Recovery 
 TEP enters into certain energy contracts that are considered derivatives but do not qualify for regulatory recovery. The Company records unrealized gains and losses for these contracts in the income statement unless a normal purchase or normal sale election is made. For contracts that meet the trading definition, as defined in the PPFAC plan of administration, TEP must share of any realized gains with retail customers through the PPFAC mechanism.

 As of December 31, 2022, TEP had energy contracts that will settle on various expiration dates through 2029. Gas Contracts BBtu 
 CREDIT RISK 
 The use of contractual arrangements to manage the risks associated with changes in energy commodity prices creates credit risk exposure resulting from the possibility of non-performance by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations. TEP enters into contracts for the physical delivery of power and natural gas which contain remedies in the event of non-performance by the supply counterparties. In addition, volatile energy prices can create significant credit exposure from energy market receivables and subsequent measurements at fair value. 
 TEP has contractual agreements for energy procurement and hedging activities that contain provisions requiring TEP and its counterparties to post collateral under certain circumstances. These circumstances include: (i) exposures in excess of unsecured credit limits due to the volume of trading activity; (ii) changes in natural gas or power prices; (iii) credit rating downgrades; or (iv) unfavorable changes in parties' assessments of each other's credit strength. If such credit events were to occur, TEP, or its counterparties, could have to provide certain credit enhancements in the form of cash, LOCs, or other acceptable security to collateralize exposure beyond the allowed amounts. 
 TEP considers the effect of counterparty credit risk in determining the fair value of derivative instruments that are in a net asset position, after incorporating collateral posted by counterparties, and then allocates the credit risk adjustment to individual contracts. TEP also considers the impact of its credit risk on instruments that are in a net liability position, after considering the collateral posted, and then allocates the credit risk adjustment to the individual contracts. 
 The value of all derivative instruments in net liability positions under contracts with credit risk-related contingent features, including contracts under the normal purchase normal sale exception, was million as of December 31, 2022, compared with million as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, TEP had cash posted as collateral to provide credit enhancement. If the credit risk contingent features were triggered on December 31, 2022, TEP would have been required to post million of collateral. As of December 31, 2022, TEP had million in outstanding net payable balances for settled positions.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 TEP s Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer) supervised and participated in TEP s evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined under Rule 13a 15(e) and Rule 15d 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in TEP s periodic reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the United States Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. These disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by TEP in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon the evaluation performed, TEP s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that TEP s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 TEP s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Management assessed the effectiveness of TEP s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the 2013 Committee of Sponsoring Organizations Internal Control Integrated Framework. 
 Based on management s assessment using those criteria, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, TEP s internal control over financial reporting was effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in TEP s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, TEP s internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES 
 Pre-Approved Policies and Procedures 
 Rules adopted by the SEC in order to implement requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 require public company audit committees to pre-approve audit and non-audit services. UNS Energy s Audit and Risk Committee has adopted a policy pursuant to which audit, audit-related, tax, and other services are pre-approved by category of service. Recognizing that situations may arise where it is in the Company s best interest for the auditor to perform services in addition to the annual audit of the Company s financial statements, the policy sets forth guidelines and procedures with respect to approval of the four categories of service designed to achieve the continued independence of the auditor when it is retained to perform such services for UNS Energy. The policy requires the Audit and Risk Committee to be informed of each service and does not include any delegation of the Audit and Risk Committee s responsibilities to management. The Audit and Risk Committee may delegate to the Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee the authority to grant pre-approvals of audit and non-audit services requiring Audit and Risk Committee approval where the Audit and Risk Committee Chair believes it is desirable to pre-approve such services prior to the next regularly scheduled Audit and Risk Committee meeting. The decisions of the Audit and Risk Committee Chair to pre-approve any such services from one regularly scheduled Audit Committee meeting to the next shall be reported to the Audit and Risk Committee.
