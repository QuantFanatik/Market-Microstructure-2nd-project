ITEM 1. 
 BUSINESS General Watsco, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, Watsco, or we, us, or our was incorporated in Florida in 1956 and is the largest distributor of air conditioning, heating and refrigeration equipment and related parts and supplies HVAC/R in the HVAC/R distribution industry in North America. At December 31, 2022, we operated from 673 locations in 42 U.S. 
 3 

Table of Contents 

States, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico with additional market coverage on an export basis to portions of Latin America and the Caribbean, through which we serve more than 120,000 active contractors and dealers that service the replacement and new construction markets. Our revenues in HVAC/R distribution have increased from 64.1 million in 1989 to 7.3 billion in 2022, resulting from our strategic acquisition of companies with established market positions and subsequent building of revenues and profit through a combination of additional locations, introduction of new products, and other initiatives. Our principal executive office is located at 2665 South Bayshore Drive, Suite 901, Miami, Florida 33133, and our telephone number is (305) 714-4100. Our website address on the Internet is www.watsco.com and e-mails may be sent to info@watsco.com. Our website address is included in this report only as an inactive textual reference. Information contained on, or available through, our website is not incorporated by reference in, or made a part of, this report. Air Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Industry The HVAC/R distribution industry is highly fragmented with approximately 6,500 distribution companies. The industry in the United States and Canada is well-established, having had its primary period of growth during the post-World War II era with the advent of affordable central air conditioning and heating systems for both residential and commercial applications. The advent of HVAC/R products in Latin America and the Caribbean is also well-established but has emerged in more recent years as those economies have grown and products have become more affordable and have matured from luxury to necessity. Based on data published in the September 2022 IBIS World Industry Report for Heating and Air Conditioning Contractors in the U.S. and other available data, we estimate that the annual market on an installed basis for residential central air conditioning, heating, and refrigeration equipment, and related parts and supplies is approximately 123.0 billion. Air conditioning and heating equipment is manufactured primarily by seven major companies that together account for approximately 90 of all units shipped in the United States each year. These companies are Carrier Global Corporation Carrier Daikin Comfort Technologies North America, Inc. Daikin ), a subsidiary of Daikin Industries, Ltd.; Rheem Manufacturing Company Rheem Trane Technologies plc Trane York International Corporation, a subsidiary of Johnson Controls International plc; Lennox International Inc. Lennox and Nortek Global HVAC, LLC, a subsidiary of Nortek, Inc. These manufacturers distribute their products through a combination of factory-owned locations and independent distributors who, in turn, supply the equipment and related parts and supplies to contractors and dealers that sell to and install the products for consumers, businesses, and other end-users. Air conditioning and heating equipment is sold to the replacement and new construction markets for both residential and commercial applications. The residential replacement market has increased in size and importance over the past several years as a result of the aging of the installed base of residential central air conditioners and furnaces, the introduction of new higher energy efficient models to address both regulatory mandates as well as consumer optionality, the remodeling and expansion of existing homes, the addition of central air conditioning to homes that previously had only heating products, and consumers overall unwillingness to live without air conditioning or heating products. The mechanical life of central air conditioning and furnaces varies by geographical region due to usage and ranges from approximately 8 to 20 years. According to data published by the Energy Information Administration in May 2022 there are approximately 102 million central air conditioning and heating systems installed in the United States that have been in service for more than 10 years. Many installed units are currently reaching the end of their useful lives, which we believe long-term provides a growing and stable replacement market. Additionally, we sell a variety of non-equipment products including parts, ductwork, air movement products, insulation, tools, installation supplies, thermostats, and air quality products. We distribute products manufactured by Flexible Technologies, Inc. Flexible Technologies ), Resideo Technologies, Inc. Resideo ), Southwark Metal Mfg. Co. Southwark ), Johns Manville Johns Manville ), and Owens Corning Insulating Systems, LLC Owens Corning ), among others. We also sell products to the commercial refrigeration market. These products include condensing units, compressors, evaporators, valves, refrigerant, walk-in coolers, and ice machines for industrial and commercial applications. We distribute products manufactured by Copeland Corporation, LLC, a subsidiary of Emerson Electric Co. Emerson ), The Chemours Company Chemours ), Mueller Industries, Inc. Mueller ), and Welbilt, Inc. Welbilt ), among others. Culture and Business Strategy Watsco began its HVAC/R distribution strategy in 1989 and has grown by using a buy and build philosophy, resulting in substantial long-term growth in revenues and profits. The buy component of the strategy has focused on acquiring or investing in market leaders to either expand into new geographic areas or gain additional market share in existing markets. We have employed a disciplined and conservative approach, which seeks opportunities that fit well-defined financial and strategic criteria. The build component of the strategy has focused on encouraging growth at acquired companies, by

adding products and locations to better serve customers, investing in scalable technologies, and exchanging ideas and business concepts amongst leadership teams. Newly acquired businesses have access to our capital resources and established vendor relationships to provide their customers with an expanded array of product lines on favorable terms and conditions with an intensified commitment to service. We have also developed a culture whereby leaders, managers and employees are provided the opportunity to own shares of Watsco through a variety of stock-based equity plans. We believe that this culture instills a performance-driven, long-term focus on the part of our employees and aligns their interests with the interests of other Watsco shareholders. Culture of Innovation Technology Strategy In recent years, we have established a strong culture of innovation, whereby people, processes and technology have rapidly evolved to modernize and digitize our business. With this digital evolution in mind, our efforts have addressed how customers are served, how internal processes and practices can be improved, and how data and analytics can be created and used to enhance long-term performance. Investments include the addition of approximately 300 technology employees along with investments in our locations and infrastructure to enable these technologies. To that end, several scalable technology platforms have been launched with the largest focus on customer-focused technologies, which are improving and transforming the customer experience at all of our locations. Specific initiatives include: (i) mobile applications for iOS and Android devices to help customers operate more efficiently and interact with our locations more easily; (ii) e-commerce between our customers and our subsidiaries; (iii) supply chain optimization; (iv) building and maintaining product information management, which is our leading repository of digitized HVAC/R product information used in our mobile applications and e-ecommerce platform; and (v) the development of business intelligence systems and related data sets, which provide enhanced management tools. In addition, through our subsidiary Watsco Ventures, LLC Watsco Ventures ), we have developed (internally and through external collaboration) a variety of early-stage technologies with the goal of helping contractor customers grow and become more profitable, and otherwise compliment the initiatives set forth above. These initiatives include OnCall Air , our digital sales platform and CreditForComfort , its companion consumer financing platform, among others. Strategy in Existing Markets Our strategy for growth in existing markets focuses on customer service, product expansion, and the implementation of technology to satisfy the needs of the higher growth, higher margin replacement market, in which customers generally demand immediate, convenient, and reliable service. We respond to this need by: (i) offering a broad range of product lines, including the necessary equipment at an array of price-points, parts, and supplies to enable a contractor to install or repair a central air conditioner, furnace, or refrigeration system; (ii) maintaining a strong density of warehouse locations for increased customer convenience; (iii) maintaining well-stocked inventories to ensure that customer orders are filled in a timely manner; (iv) providing a high degree of technical expertise at the point of sale; (v) collaborating with customers to advertise and market their business and services in local markets; and (vi) developing and implementing technology to further enhance customer service capabilities. We believe these concepts provide a competitive advantage over smaller, less-capitalized competitors that are unable to commit resources to open and maintain additional locations, implement technological business solutions, provide the same range of products, maintain the same inventory levels, or attract the wide range of expertise that is required to support a diverse product offering. In some geographic areas, we believe we have a competitive advantage over factory-operated distribution networks, which typically do not maintain inventories of parts and supplies that are as diversified as ours and which have fewer warehouse locations than we do, making it more difficult for these competitors to meet the time-sensitive demands of the replacement market. In addition to the replacement market, we sell to the new construction market, including new homes and commercial construction. We believe our reputation for reliable, high-quality service, and relationships with contractors, who may serve both the replacement and new construction markets, allows us to compete effectively in these markets. Product Line Expansion We actively seek new or expanded territories of distribution from our key equipment suppliers. We continually evaluate new parts and supply products to support equipment sales and further enhance service to our customers. This initiative includes increasing our product offering with existing vendors and identifying new product opportunities through traditional and non-traditional supply channels. We have also introduced private-label products as a means to obtain market share and grow revenues. We believe that our private-label branded products complement our existing product offerings at selected locations, based on customer needs and the particular market position and price of these products.

Acquisition Strategy We focus on acquiring and investing in businesses that either complement our current presence in existing markets or establish a presence in new geographic markets. Since 1989, we have acquired 66 HVAC/R distribution businesses, some of which currently operate as primary operating subsidiaries. Other smaller acquired distributors have been integrated into or are under the management of our primary operating subsidiaries. Through a combination of sales and market share growth, opening of new locations, tuck-in acquisitions, expansion of product lines, improved pricing, and programs that have resulted in higher gross profit, performance incentives, and a culture of equity value for key leadership, we have produced substantial sales and earnings growth in our acquired businesses. We continue to pursue additional strategic acquisitions, investments and joint ventures to allow further penetration in existing markets and expansion into new geographic markets. Operating Philosophy We encourage our local leadership to operate in a manner that builds upon the long-term relationships they have established with their suppliers and customers. Typically, we maintain the identity of businesses by retaining their historical trade names, management teams and sales organizations, and continuity of their product brand-name offerings. We believe this strategy allows us to build on the value of the acquired operations by creating additional sales opportunities while providing an attractive exit strategy for the former owners of these companies. We maintain a specialized staff at our corporate headquarters that provides functional support for our subsidiaries growth strategies in their respective markets. Such functional support staff includes specialists in finance, accounting, product procurement, information technology, treasury and working capital management, tax planning, risk management, and safety. Certain general and administrative expenses are targeted for cost savings by leveraging the overall business volume and improving operating efficiencies. Human Capital Management Employee Population As the largest distributor of HVAC/R equipment and related parts and supplies in North America, we have a wide variety of employees. Given the breadth of our employee base, we tailor our human capital management policies with a view to specific employee populations. As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 7,200 full-time and 75 part-time employees (approximately 7,275 total employees), substantially all of whom were non-union employees. Of these employees, approximately 8 were located in Canada and Mexico. Additionally, we use independent contractors and temporary personnel in the normal course of business to supplement our workforce. Diversity and Inclusion We value and foster the diversity and inclusion of the people with whom we work. Our commitment includes providing equal access to, and participation in, employment and advancement opportunities without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, veteran or military status, pregnancy status, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, or marital status. Diverse teams facilitate contributions from people of different backgrounds and varied points of view. Furthermore, we believe that diverse teams make better decisions faster and outperform similarly situated less diverse teams. Additionally, we believe that employees who feel valued, understood, and inspired benefit the Company as a whole. Inclusive leadership leads to innovative solutions, and an inclusive environment is a critical foundation for us, as high-performing, engaged teams join together to help us implement our strategies. Compensation and Benefits We focus on attracting and retaining employees by providing compensation and benefits programs that are competitive within our industry, taking into account each job position s location and responsibilities. In addition to salaries, commission programs, cash incentives, and stock-based equity plans, we also provide a 401(k) retirement plan with a company match, an employee stock purchase plan in which most of our employees may purchase our stock at a discount, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings accounts, paid time off, and various services and tools to support our employees health and wellness. Pay-for-Performance and Ownership Culture We maintain a culture that rewards performance of key leaders through stock-based equity plans, which include the granting of stock options and restricted stock based on individual merit and measures of performance. Approximately 140 employees received such equity awards in 2022. Our equity compensation plans are designed to promote long-term performance, as well as to create long-term employee retention, continuity of leadership, and an ownership culture whereby management and employees think and act as owners of the Company. We believe that our restricted stock program is unique because an employee s restricted share grants generally vest entirely and only at the end of his or her career (age 62 or later) and, prior to retirement, these grants remain subject to significant risk of forfeiture.

Talent Development Our culture celebrates talent sharing, career development, and agility across the Company. We provide a wide variety of opportunities for professional growth and talent development for all employees, including online trainings, on-the-job experience, and education tuition assistance. Health and Safety We continuously strive to improve all aspects of our work practices. We actively support a culture of safety and wellness for the benefit of our employees and their families along with our customers. Providing a safe and healthy work environment is a business priority and is core to our values. Health and safety are an essential part of a broader workforce strategy that reduces the risk of harm to employees and helps them remain healthy, engaged and productive. To build and sustain a culture based on these principles, our commitment to safety and wellness is incorporated into the incentive structure of our key operational leaders. For wellness, we measure employee engagement in completing annual physicals and health assessments to help ensure that our philosophical values are put into action. For safety, we measure and carefully evaluate incidents related to workers compensation, vehicle accidents and injuries to third-parties, and we continuously seek to improve safety measures intended to reduce the number of such incidents. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Products We sell an expansive line of products and maintain a diverse mix of inventory to meet our customers immediate needs, and we seek to provide products a contractor would generally require when installing or repairing a central air conditioner, furnace, or refrigeration system on short notice. The cooling capacity of air conditioning units is measured in tons. One ton of cooling capacity is equivalent to 12,000 British Thermal Units BTUs and is generally adequate to air condition approximately 500 square feet of residential space. The products we distribute consist of: (i) equipment, including residential ducted and ductless air conditioners ranging from 1 to 5 tons, gas, electric, and oil furnaces ranging from 50,000 to 150,000 BTUs, commercial air conditioning and heating equipment systems ranging from 1-1/2 to 25 tons, and other specialized equipment; (ii) parts, including replacement compressors, evaporator coils, motors, and other component parts; (iii) supplies, including thermostats, insulation material, refrigerants, ductwork, grills, registers, sheet metal, tools, copper tubing, concrete pads, tape, adhesives, and other ancillary supplies; and (iv) plumbing and bathroom remodeling supplies in a limited number of stores. Sales of HVAC equipment, which we currently source from approximately 20 vendors, accounted for 68 and 69 of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Sales of other HVAC products, which we currently source from approximately 1,300 vendors, comprised 28 of our revenues in 2022 and 2021. Sales of commercial refrigeration products, which we currently source from approximately 140 vendors, accounted for 4 and 3 of our revenues in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Distribution and Sales At December 31, 2022, we operated from 673 locations, a vast majority of which are located in regions that we believe have demographic trends favorable to our business. We maintain large inventories at each of our warehouse locations and either deliver products to customers using our trucks or third-party logistics providers, or we make products available for pick-up at the location nearest to the particular customer. We have approximately 1,200 salespeople, averaging 14 years of experience in the HVAC/R distribution industry.

The largest market we serve is the United States, in which the most significant markets for HVAC/R products are in the Sun Belt states. Accordingly, the majority of our distribution locations are in the Sun Belt, with the highest concentration in Florida and Texas. These markets have been a strategic focus of ours given their size, the reliance by homeowners and businesses on HVAC/R products to maintain a comfortable indoor environment, and the population growth in these areas over the last 40 years, which has led to a substantial installed base requiring replacement, a shorter useful life for equipment given the significant hours of operation, and the focus by electrical utilities on consumer incentives designed to promote replacement of HVAC/R equipment in an effort to improve energy efficiency.

Joint Ventures with Carrier Global Corporation In 2009, we formed a joint venture with Carrier, which we refer to as Carrier Enterprise I, in which Carrier contributed company-owned locations in the Sun Belt states and Puerto Rico, and its export division in Miami, Florida, and we contributed certain locations that distributed Carrier products. We have an 80 controlling interest in Carrier Enterprise I, and Carrier has a 20 non-controlling interest. In 2019, Carrier Enterprise I acquired substantially all of the HVAC assets and assumed certain of the liabilities of Peirce-Phelps, Inc., an HVAC distributor operating in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. Carrier Enterprise I has a 38.1 ownership interest in Russell Sigler, Inc., an HVAC distributor operating from 35 locations in the Western U.S.

The export division of Carrier Enterprise I, Carrier InterAmerica Corporation CIAC ), redomesticated from the U.S. Virgin Islands to Delaware in 2019, following which CIAC became a separate operating entity in which we have an 80 controlling interest and Carrier has a 20 non-controlling interest. In 2011, we formed a second joint venture with Carrier, which we refer to as Carrier Enterprise II, in which Carrier contributed company-owned locations in the Northeast U.S., and we contributed certain locations operating as Homans Associates LLC Homans ), a Watsco subsidiary, in the Northeast U.S. Subsequently, Carrier Enterprise II purchased Carrier s distribution operations in Mexico. We have an 80 controlling interest in Carrier Enterprise II, and Carrier has a 20 non-controlling interest. In 2019, we repurchased the 20 ownership interest in Homans from Carrier Enterprise II and have since solely owned and operated Homans. In 2012, we formed a third joint venture with Carrier, which we refer to as Carrier Enterprise III, to which Carrier contributed company-owned locations in Canada. We have a 60 controlling interest in Carrier Enterprise III, and Carrier has a 40 non-controlling interest. In April 2021, we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities comprising the HVAC distribution business of Temperature Equipment Corporation, an HVAC distributor operating from Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri and Wisconsin. We formed a new joint venture with Carrier, TEC Distribution LLC TEC ), that operates this business. We have an 80 controlling interest in TEC, and Carrier has a 20 non-controlling interest. Combined, the joint ventures with Carrier represented 54 of our revenues in 2022. See Supplier Concentration in Business Risk Factors in Item 1A. The business and affairs of the joint ventures are controlled, directed, and managed exclusively by Carrier Enterprise I s, Carrier Enterprise II s, Carrier Enterprise III s, CIAC, and TEC s respective boards of directors (the Boards pursuant to related operating agreements. The Boards have full, complete and exclusive authority, power, and discretion to manage and control the business, property, and affairs of their respective joint ventures, and to make all decisions regarding those matters and to perform activities customary or incident to the management of such joint ventures, including approval of distributions to us and Carrier. Each Board is composed of five directors, of whom three directors represent our controlling interest and two directors represent Carrier s non-controlling interest. Matters presented to the Boards for vote are considered approved or consented to upon the receipt of the affirmative vote of at least a majority of all directors entitled to vote with the exception of certain governance matters, which require joint approval. Customers and Customer Service Air conditioning and heating contractors and dealers that install HVAC/R products in homes and businesses must be licensed given the highly regulated nature of the products, refrigerant, natural gas, and building and zoning requirements. We currently serve more than 120,000 active contractors and dealers who service the replacement and new construction markets for residential and light commercial central air conditioning, heating, and refrigeration systems. No single customer in 2022, 2021, or 2020 represented more than 2 of our consolidated revenues. We focus on providing products where and when the customer needs them, technical support by phone or on site as required, and quick and efficient service at our locations. Increased customer convenience is also provided through mobile applications and e-commerce, which allows customers to access information online 24 hours a day, seven days a week to search for desired products, verify inventory availability, obtain pricing, place orders, check order status, schedule pickup or delivery times, and make payments. We believe we compete successfully with other distributors primarily based on an experienced sales organization, strong service support, maintenance of well-stocked inventories, density of warehouse locations, high quality reputation, broad product lines, and the ability to foresee customer demand for new products. Key Supplier Relationships Given our leadership position, Watsco represents a strategic business relationship to many of the leading manufacturers in our industry. Significant relationships with HVAC/R equipment manufacturers include Carrier, Rheem, Daikin, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Gree Electric Appliances, Inc., Welbilt, Bosch Global, Trane, Lennox, and Midea Group. In addition, we have substantial relationships with manufacturers of non-equipment HVAC/R products, including Mueller, Flexible Technologies, Southwark, Resideo, DiversiTech Corp., Emerson, Johns Manville, Chemours, and Owens Corning.

Table of Contents 

We believe the diversity of products that we sell, along with the manufacturers current product offerings, quality, marketability, and brand-name recognition, allow us to operate favorably relative to our competitors. To maintain brand-name recognition, HVAC/R equipment manufacturers provide national advertising and participate with us in cooperative advertising programs and promotional incentives that are targeted to both dealers and end-users. We estimate that the replacement market for residential air conditioning equipment is approximately 85 -90 of industry unit sales in the United States, and we expect this percentage to increase as units installed in the past 20 years wear out or otherwise become practical to replace sooner with newer, more energy-efficient models. The Company s top ten suppliers accounted for 84 of our purchases, including 60 from Carrier, and 8 from Rheem. Given the significant concentration of our suppliers, particularly with Carrier and Rheem, any material interruption with these suppliers, including limitations on the ability of our suppliers to manufacture, or procure from manufacturers, the products we sell, or to meet delivery requirements and commitments, whether due to supply chain disruptions, labor shortages or otherwise, could temporarily disrupt the operations of certain of our subsidiaries, impact current inventory levels, and could adversely affect our financial results. If any restrictions or significant increase in tariffs under existing trade agreements are imposed on products that our top ten suppliers import or assemble outside of the United States, particularly from Mexico and China, we could be required to raise our prices, which may result in the loss of customers and harm to our business. Future financial results are also materially dependent upon the continued market acceptance of these manufacturers respective products and their ability to continue to manufacture products that comply with laws relating to environmental and efficiency standards. However, the Company believes that alternative or substitute products would be readily available in the event of disruption of current supplier relationships given the Company s prominence in the marketplace, including the number of locations, sales personnel, support structure, marketing and sales expertise, financial position, and established market share. See Business Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. Distribution Agreements We maintain trade name and distribution agreements with Carrier, Rheem, and Mitsubishi that provide us distribution rights on an exclusive basis in specified territories and are not subject to a stated term or expiration date. We also maintain distribution agreements with various other suppliers, either on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis, for various terms ranging from one to ten years. Certain distribution agreements for particular branded products contain provisions that restrict or limit the sale of competitive products in the locations that sell such branded products. Other than where such location-level restrictions apply, we may distribute the lines of other manufacturers air conditioning or heating equipment in other locations in the same territories. See Supplier Concentration in Business Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Seasonality Sales of residential central air conditioners, heating equipment, and parts and supplies are seasonal. Furthermore, profitability can be impacted favorably or unfavorably based on weather patterns, particularly during Summer and Winter selling seasons. Demand related to the residential central air conditioning replacement market is typically highest in the second and third quarters, and demand for heating equipment is usually highest in the first and fourth quarters. Demand related to the new construction sectors throughout most of the markets we serve tends to be fairly evenly distributed throughout the year and depends largely on housing completions and related weather and economic conditions. Competition We operate in highly competitive environments. We compete with a number of distributors and also with several air conditioning and heating equipment manufacturers that distribute a significant portion of their products through their own distribution organizations in certain markets. Competition within any given geographic market is based upon product availability, customer service, price, and quality. Competitive pressures or other factors could cause our products or services to lose market acceptance or result in significant price erosion, all of which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity. Order Backlog Order backlog is not a material aspect of our business, and no material portion of our business is subject to government contracts. Government Regulations, Environmental, and Health and Safety Matters Our business is subject to federal, state and local laws, and regulations relating to the storage, handling, transportation, and release of hazardous materials into the environment. These laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, relating to minimum energy efficiency standards of HVAC systems, and the production, servicing, and disposal of more environmentally friendly refrigerants used in such systems, including those established by the Kigali Amendment to the 
 11 

Table of Contents 

Montreal Protocol concerning the phase-down of the production of HFC-based refrigerants for use in new equipment. We are also subject to regulations concerning the transport of hazardous materials, including regulations adopted pursuant to the Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1990. Our operations are also subject to health and safety requirements including, but not limited to, the Occupational, Safety and Health Act. These laws and regulations are continuously changing, and compliance is costly and can require changes to our business practices and significant management time and effort. However, it is our opinion that the costs related to compliance requirements for government, environmental, or other regulations will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We believe that we operate our business in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws, and regulations. Our industry and business are also subject to United States Department of Energy DOE standards related to the minimum required efficiency levels of residential central air conditioning systems and heat pumps. For purposes of establishing these energy conservation standards, the DOE divides the United States into three regions (the North, the Southeast, and the Southwest) according to the number of hours that an air conditioner operates to cool a home during the hotter months. The seasonal energy efficiency rating, or SEER, is the metric used to measure HVAC energy efficiency. The higher the SEER, the more efficient the HVAC equipment. Beginning in 2023, the minimum efficiency level for residential HVAC systems under 45,000 BTUs is 14 SEER in the North and 15 SEER in the Southeast and Southwest. For systems over 45,000 BTUs, the minimum efficiency level is 14 SEER in the North and 14.5 SEER in the Southeast and Southwest. Heat pump efficiency levels, which are measured by the equipment s heating seasonal performance factor HSPF ), is 8.8 HSPF compared with the 8.2 HSPF required by the current standard for all three regions. It is too early to determine the impact to our results of operations this transition will have; however, we expect a benefit from selling higher efficiency units, which sell at higher prices, as historically these changes have increased the cost to service and repair existing systems, which in turn influences a consumer s decision to replace them. In December 2020, the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act of 2020 (the AIM Act was enacted, which gave the United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA regulatory authority to address hydrofluorocarbon HFC refrigerants. HFCs were developed to replace certain refrigerants, such as chlorofluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons that were harmful to the ozone layer, but are considered potent greenhouse gases as a result of their global warming potential GWP ). The Aim Act directed the EPA to administer an 85 phasedown down of the production and consumption of HFCs over a 15-year timeframe beginning on January 1, 2022 and put in place restrictions on HVAC equipment that require them to have refrigerants with less than 750 GWP by January 1, 2025. We are planning for the transition of our inventory to HVAC equipment with refrigerants that comply with the new standard, and we believe we will complete this transition in accordance with the required timeline. During 2014, the DOE established new rules for the manufacturing of motors used in residential furnaces with the purpose of increasing the energy efficiency of these motors, and, consequently, the furnaces in which they operate. The mandate dictates that residential furnace fans manufactured in the United States on or after the effective date of July 3, 2019, must have a Fan Energy Rating FER value reduction of 12 or 46 in watts/cfm, depending on the type of furnace. To meet these new standards, most manufacturers have replaced the permanent split capacitor blower motors in residential furnaces with electronic controlled motors. The transition of our inventory of residential furnaces to those meeting the updated FER standards was complete by the end of 2020. Climate Change and Reductions in CO 2 e Emissions We believe that our business plays an important and significant role in the drive to lower CO2e emissions. According to the DOE, heating and air conditioning accounts for roughly half of household energy consumption in the United States. As such, replacing older, less efficient HVAC systems with higher efficiency systems is one of the most meaningful steps homeowners can take to reduce their electricity costs and carbon footprint. The overwhelming majority of new HVAC systems that we sell replace systems that likely operate below current minimum efficiency standards in the United States and may use more harmful refrigerants that have been, or are being, phased-out. As consumers replace HVAC systems with new, higher-efficiency systems, homeowners will consume less energy, save costs, and reduce their carbon footprint.

The sale of high-efficiency systems has long been a focus of ours, and we have invested in tools and technology intended to capture an increasingly richer sales mix over time. In addition, regulatory mandates will periodically increase the required minimum SEER, thus providing a catalyst for greater sales of higher-efficiency systems. We offer a broad variety of systems that operate above the minimum SEER standards, ranging from base-level efficiency to systems that exceed 20 SEER. Our sales of higher-efficiency residential HVAC systems (those above base-level efficiency) grew 18 organically in 2022, outpacing the overall growth rate of 13 for residential HVAC equipment in the United States. Based on estimates validated by independent sources, we averted an estimated 15.8 million metric tons of CO2e emissions from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2022 through the sale of replacement residential HVAC systems at higher-efficiency standards the equivalent of nearly 3.4 million passenger vehicles driven over the course of one year.

Information contained on, or available through, our website is not incorporated by reference in, or made a part of, this report. Federal Tax Credits and State Incentives Demand for higher-efficiency products, such as variable-speed systems and heat pumps, is expected to benefit from the passage of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA in August 2022. This legislation is intended, in part, to promote the replacement of existing systems in favor of high-efficiency heat pump systems that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as compared to older systems, and thereby combat climate change. Programs under the IRA include enhanced tax credits for homeowners who install qualifying HVAC equipment and tax deductions for owners of commercial buildings that are upgraded to achieve defined energy savings. The IRA also sets aside 4.3 billion for state-administered consumer rebate programs designed to promote energy savings for low and medium-income households, including HVAC systems. Further details, including qualifying products, specific programs, and other regulatory requirements contemplated by the IRA are being determined and are expected to be launched during 2023.

ITEM 1A. 
 RISK FACTORS Business Risk Factors Supplier Concentration and Supply Chain Risks The Company s top ten suppliers accounted for 84 of our purchases during 2022, including 60 from Carrier, and 8 from Rheem. Carrier provides a diverse variety of brands of HVAC systems including, Carrier, Bryant, Payne, Tempstar, Heil, Comfortmaker and Grandaire, along with complimentary replacement parts. Rheem provides Rheem-brand HVAC systems along with complimentary replacement parts. Given the significant concentration of our supply chain, particularly with Carrier and Rheem, any significant interruption by any of the key manufacturers or a termination of a relationship could temporarily disrupt the operations of certain of our subsidiaries. Additionally, our operations are materially dependent upon the continued market acceptance and quality of these manufacturers products and their ability to continue to manufacture products that are competitive and that comply with laws relating to environmental and efficiency standards. Our inability to obtain products from one or more of these manufacturers or a decline in market acceptance of these manufacturers products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity. Many HVAC equipment and component manufacturers, including Carrier and Rheem, source component parts from China and/or assemble a significant number of products for residential and light-commercial applications from Mexico. If any restrictions, including overall trade relations, a potential increase in tariffs, are imposed related to such products sourced or assembled from Mexico and China, including as a result of amendments to existing trade agreements, and our product costs consequently increase, we would be required to raise our prices, which may result in cost inflation, the loss of customers, and harm to our business. In addition, COVID-19, which surfaced in Wuhan, China in December 2019, resulted in increased travel restrictions and extended shutdown of certain businesses in the region. The continuing impact of COVID-19 on our business will depend on future developments; however, closures in China and/or Mexico may disrupt the operations of certain of our suppliers, which could negatively impact our business.

We maintain trade name and distribution agreements with Carrier and Rheem that provide us distribution rights on an exclusive basis in specified territories. Such agreements are not subject to a stated term or expiration date. We also maintain other distribution agreements with various other suppliers, either on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis, for various terms ranging from one to ten years. Certain of the distribution agreements contain provisions that restrict or limit the sale of competitive products in the locations that sell such branded products. Other than where such location-level restrictions apply, we may distribute other manufacturers lines of air conditioning or heating equipment in other locations in the same territories. Risks Inherent in Acquisitions As part of our strategy, we intend to pursue additional acquisitions of complementary businesses, including through joint ventures and investments in unconsolidated entities. If we complete future acquisitions, including investments in unconsolidated entities, or enter into new joint ventures, we may be required to incur or assume additional debt and/or issue additional shares of our common stock as consideration, which will dilute our existing shareholders ownership interest and may affect our results of operations. Growth through acquisitions involves a number of risks, including, but not limited to, the following: 

the ability to identify and consummate transactions with complementary acquisition candidates; 

the successful operation and/or integration of acquired companies; 

the efficiency and effectiveness of the acquired companies internal control environment; 

diversion of management s attention from other daily functions; 

issuance by us of equity securities that would dilute ownership of our existing shareholders; 

incurrence and/or assumption of significant debt and contingent liabilities; and 

possible loss of key employees and/or customer relationships of the acquired companies. In addition, acquired companies and investments made in unconsolidated entities may have liabilities that we failed or were unable to discover while performing due diligence investigations. We cannot assure you that the indemnification, if any, granted to us by sellers of acquired companies or by joint venture partners will be sufficient in amount, scope, or duration to offset the possible liabilities associated with businesses or properties that we assume upon consummation of an acquisition or joint venture. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Failure to successfully manage the operational challenges and risks associated with, or resulting from, acquisitions could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity. Competition We operate in highly competitive environments. We compete with other distributors and several air conditioning and heating equipment manufacturers that distribute a significant portion of their products through their own distribution organizations in certain markets. Competition within any given geographic market is based upon product availability, customer service, price, and quality. Competitive pressures or other factors could cause our products or services to lose market acceptance or result in significant price erosion, all of which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Fluctuations The functional currency of our operations in Canada is the Canadian dollar, and the functional currency of our operations in Mexico is the U.S. dollar because the majority of our Mexican transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on transactions denominated in Canadian dollars and Mexican Pesos, and, therefore, could adversely affect our financial performance. Although we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate movements, we do not currently hold any derivative contracts that hedge our foreign currency translational exposure.

Seasonality Sales of residential central air conditioners, heating equipment, and parts and supplies are seasonal, resulting in fluctuations in our revenue from quarter to quarter. Furthermore, profitability can be impacted favorably or unfavorably based on the severity or mildness of weather patterns during Summer or Winter selling seasons. Demand related to the residential central air conditioning replacement market is typically highest in the second and third quarters, and demand for heating equipment is usually highest in the first and fourth quarters. Demand related to the new construction sectors throughout most of the markets is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year and depends largely on housing completions and related weather and economic conditions. Dependence on Key Personnel Much of our success has depended on the skills and experience of senior management personnel. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key senior management personnel could harm our business. We must continuously recruit, retain, and motivate management and other employees to both maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives. Our success has also depended on the contributions and abilities of our store employees upon whom we rely on to give customers a superior in-store experience. Accordingly, our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain high quality employees to work in and manage our stores. If we are unable to adequately recruit, retain, and motivate employees our projected growth and expansion, and our business and financial performance may be adversely affected. Decline in Economic Conditions We rely predominantly on the credit markets and, to a lesser extent, on the capital markets to meet our financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs if internal funds are not available from our operations. Access to funds under our line of credit is dependent on the ability of the syndicate banks to meet their respective funding commitments. Disruptions in the credit and capital markets could adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit agreement and may also adversely affect the determination of interest rates, particularly rates based on LIBOR, which is one of the base rates under our revolving credit agreement. On March 5, 2021, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, confirmed that LIBOR will either cease to be provided by any administrator or will no longer be representative after June 30, 2023 for USD LIBOR reference rates. The U.S. Federal Reserve has selected the Secured Overnight Funding Rate SOFR as the preferred alternate rate to LIBOR. Our revolving credit agreement provides that it may be amended to replace LIBOR with an alternate benchmark rate including SOFR. SOFR is calculated differently from LIBOR and has inherent differences, including SOFR s limited historical data and that LIBOR is an unsecured lending rate while SOFR is a secured lending rate, which could give rise to uncertainties and volatility in the benchmark rates. While we continue to evaluate the potential impact of a transition to SOFR, these changes could result in interest obligations that are more than or do not otherwise correlate exactly over time with the payments that would have been made on such debt if LIBOR was available in its current form, including a potential increase in our overall interest expense. Additionally, disruptions in the credit and capital markets could also result in increased borrowing costs and/or reduced borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement. Any long-term disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize, or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged. Such measures could include reducing or eliminating dividend payments, deferring capital expenditures, and reducing or eliminating other discretionary uses of cash. A decline in economic conditions and lack of availability of business and consumer credit could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Any capital or credit market disruption could cause broader economic downturns, which may lead to reduced demand for our products and an increased incidence of customers inability to pay their accounts. Further, bankruptcies or similar events by customers may cause us to incur increased levels of bad debt expense. Also, our suppliers may be negatively impacted by deteriorating economic conditions, causing disruption or delay of product availability. These events would adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows, and financial position. Additionally, if the conditions of the capital and credit markets adversely affect the financial institutions that have committed to extend us credit, they may be unable to fund borrowings under such commitments, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, liquidity, and our ability to borrow funds for working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes. COVID-19 Pandemic The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and could continue to have widespread, rapidly-evolving and unpredictable impacts on global financial markets and business practices. As conditions fluctuate, governments have responded by adjusting their restrictions and guidelines accordingly. In light of the periodic resurgence in cases and the spread of variant strains of the virus, there remains uncertainty concerning the nature and extent of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. While the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided with the normalization of living with COVID-19 following the increase in 
 15 

Table of Contents 

accessibility to COVID-19 vaccines and antiviral treatments, the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition, and results of operations is uncertain and will continue to depend on future developments, such as the ultimate duration and scope of the pandemic, its impact on our employees, customers and suppliers, potential subsequent waves of COVID-19 infection or potential new variants, the effectiveness and adoption of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics and the broader implications on the macro-economic environment. We intend to continue to actively monitor the evolution of the pandemic and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers and shareholders. COVID-19 related factors and economic and marketplace dynamics that have impacted us, or may negatively impact, sales, gross margin and other results of operations due to a future resurgence of the pandemic include, but are not limited to: limitations on the ability of our suppliers to obtain necessary raw materials and parts to manufacture, or procure from manufacturers, the products we sell, or to meet delivery requirements and commitments; transportation delays and other logistical challenges resulting in longer lead times and constrained availability of HVAC/R products; limitations on the ability of our employees to perform their work due to illness or other disruptions caused by the pandemic, including local, state, or federal orders requiring employees to remain at home; labor shortages or an increase in the cost of labor; limitations on the ability of carriers to deliver our products to customers; limitations on the ability of our customers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations, conduct their businesses, and purchase our products; and limitations on the ability of our customers to pay us on a timely basis. As we cannot predict the duration or ultimate scope of any future resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the potential negative financial impact to our results of operations cannot be reasonably estimated but could be material and last for an extended period of time. Cybersecurity Risks In addition to the disruptions that may occur from interruptions in our information technology systems, cybersecurity threats and sophisticated and targeted cyberattacks pose a risk to our information technology systems. We have established security policies, processes and defenses designed to help identify and protect against intentional and unintentional misappropriation or corruption of our information technology systems and information and disruption of our operations. Despite these efforts, our information technology systems may be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by hackers and other persons obtaining unauthorized access, malicious software, ransomware, computer viruses, undetected intrusion, hardware failures or other events, and in these circumstances our disaster recovery plans may be ineffective or inadequate. These breaches or intrusions could lead to business interruption, exposure of proprietary or confidential information, data corruption, damage to our reputation, exposure to legal and regulatory proceedings and other costs. Such events could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we could be adversely affected if any of our significant customers or suppliers experiences any similar events that disrupt their business operations or damage their reputation. Failure to successfully manage the operational challenges and risks associated with, or resulting from, upgrades and conversions to newer versions of our information technology systems core to our operations could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity. We maintain change management processes, monitoring practices, and protections of our information technology to reduce these risks and test our systems on an ongoing basis for potential threats. The Audit Committee is briefed on information security matters at least once a year. We carry cybersecurity insurance to help mitigate the financial exposure and related notification procedures in the event of intentional intrusion. There can be no assurance, however, that our efforts will prevent the risk of a security breach of our databases or systems that could adversely affect our business. International Risk Our international sales and operations, as well as sourcing of products from suppliers with international operations, are subject to various risks associated with changes in local laws, regulations, and policies, including those related to tariffs, trade restrictions and trade agreements, investments, taxation, capital controls, employment regulations, different liability standards, and limitations on the repatriation of funds due to foreign currency controls. Our international sales and operations, as well as sourcing of products from suppliers with international operations, are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities, including government budgets, as well as political and economic instability. In addition, closures in China due to their zero-COVID policy may disrupt the operations of certain of our suppliers, which could negatively impact our business. Unfavorable changes in any of the foregoing could adversely affect our results of operations or could cause a disruption in our supply chain for products sourced internationally. Additionally, failure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to, among other things, penalties and legal expenses that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our Class B common stock is substantially identical to our Common stock except: (i) Common stock is entitled to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders, and each share of Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes; (ii) shareholders of Common stock are entitled to elect 25 of our Board of Directors (rounded up to the nearest whole number), and Class B shareholders are entitled to elect the balance of the Board of Directors; (iii) cash dividends may be paid on Common stock without paying a cash dividend on Class B common stock, and no cash dividend may be paid on Class B common stock unless at least an equal cash dividend is paid on Common stock; and (iv) Class B common stock is convertible at any time into Common stock on a one-for-one basis at the option of the shareholder. Future Sales We are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our Common stock or Class B common stock (which we refer to together as common stock), including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, our common stock or any substantially similar securities in the future. We may issue shares of our common stock or other securities in one or more registered or unregistered offerings, and we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions. The number of shares of our common stock issued in connection with any of the foregoing may result in dilution to holders of our common stock. Volatility The market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. Securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, could reduce the market price of shares of our common stock in spite of our operating performance. The trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected due to a number of factors, most of which we cannot predict or control, such as the following: 

fluctuations in our operating results; 

a decision by the Board of Directors to reduce or eliminate cash dividends on our common stock; 

changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by securities analysts; 

general market conditions in our industry or in the economy as a whole; and 

political instability, natural disasters, war and/or events of terrorism. Trading Liquidity The trading market for our common stock is limited, and there can be no assurance that a more liquid trading market for our common stock will develop. There can be no assurance as to the liquidity of any market for our common stock, the ability of the holders of our common stock to sell any of their securities and the price at which the holders of our common stock will be able to sell such securities. Payment of Dividends The amount of any future dividends that we will pay, if any, will depend upon a number of factors. Future dividends will be declared and paid at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon such factors as cash flow generated by operations, profitability, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. The right of our Board of Directors to declare dividends, however, is subject to the availability of sufficient funds under Florida law to pay dividends. In addition, our ability to pay dividends depends on certain restrictions in our credit agreement.

Securities Analyst Research and Reports The trading markets for our common stock rely in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business or industry. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or our industry, or the stock of Carrier or any of our competitors, publish negative or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. General Risk Factors Goodwill, Intangibles and Long-Lived Assets At December 31, 2022, goodwill, intangibles, and long-lived assets represented approximately 34 of our total assets. The recoverability of goodwill, indefinite lived intangibles, and long-lived assets is evaluated at least annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of our reporting unit and contains uncertainty because management must use judgment in determining appropriate assumptions to be used in the measurement of fair value. The estimates of fair value of our reporting unit, indefinite lived intangibles, and long-lived assets are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment and incorporates management s assumptions about expected future cash flows and contemplates other valuation techniques. Future cash flows can be affected by changes in the industry, a declining economic environment, or market conditions. We cannot assure you that we will not suffer material impairments to goodwill, intangibles, or long-lived assets in the future. Risks Related to Loss Contingencies We carry general liability, comprehensive property damage, workers compensation, health benefits, cybersecurity, and other insurance coverage that management considers adequate for the protection of its assets and operations at reasonable premiums. There can be no assurance that the coverage limits and related premiums of such policies will be adequate to cover claims, losses and expenses for lawsuits which have been, or may be, brought against us. A loss in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and/or profitability. Certain self-insurance risks for casualty insurance programs and health benefits are retained and reserves are established based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not yet reported. Assurance cannot be provided that actual claims will not exceed present estimates. Exposure to catastrophic losses has been limited by maintaining excess and aggregate liability coverage and implementing stop-loss control programs. However, more frequent catastrophic weather events may impact the availability and cost of property and casualty insurance. Risks Related to Natural Disasters, Epidemics, or Other Unexpected Events The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, including those linked to climate change, power outages, or other unexpected events, including hurricanes, fires, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, floods and other forms of severe weather, health epidemics, pandemics (including COVID-19) or other contagious outbreaks, conflicts, wars or terrorist acts, in the U.S. or in other countries in which we or our suppliers or customers operate could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Natural disasters, power outages or other unexpected events could damage or close one or more of our locations or disrupt our operations temporarily or long-term, such as by causing business interruptions or by affecting the availability products we sell. Existing insurance arrangements may not cover all of the costs or lost cash flows that may arise from such events. The occurrence of any of these events could also increase our insurance and other operating costs or impact our sales.

 PROPERTIES Our main properties include warehousing and distribution facilities, trucks, and administrative office space. Warehousing and Distribution Facilities At December 31, 2022, we operated 673 warehousing and distribution facilities across 42 U.S. states, Canada, Mexico, and Puerto Rico, having an aggregate of approximately 15.9 million square feet of space, of which approximately 15.7 million square feet is leased. The majority of these leases are for terms of three to five years. We believe that our facilities are sufficient to meet our present operating needs.

Trucks At December 31, 2022, we operated 832 ground transport vehicles, including delivery and pick-up trucks, vans, and tractors. Of this number, 554 trucks were leased and the others were owned. We believe that the present size of our truck fleet is adequate to support our operations. Administrative Facilities Senior management and support staff are located at various administrative offices in approximately 0.3 million square feet of space.

Shareholder Return Performance The following graph compares the cumulative five-year total shareholder return attained by holders of our Common stock and Class B common stock relative to the cumulative total returns of the Russell 2000 index, the S P MidCap 400 index, the S P 500 index, and the S P 400 Industrials index. Given our position as the largest distributor of HVAC/R equipment, parts and supplies in North America, our unique, sole line of business, the nature of our customers (air conditioning and heating contractors), and the products and markets we serve, we cannot reasonably identify an appropriate peer group; therefore, we have included in the graph below the performance of certain major market indices, which contain companies with market capitalizations similar to our own. We have determined to add the S P 400 Industrials Index in the graph below because it more closely relates to the industry in which we operate. The graph tracks the performance of a 100 investment in our common stock and in each index (with the reinvestment of all dividends) from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2022. The performance graph shall not be deemed incorporated by reference by any general statement incorporating by reference this annual report into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except to the extent we specifically incorporate this information by reference, and shall not otherwise be deemed filed under such acts.

 On October 15, 2022, 975,622 shares of Class B restricted stock previously granted to our CEO during the period from 1997 to 2011 under various performance-based incentive plans vested. The vested shares had a value of 265.1 million based on the closing price of our Class B common stock as of that date. This vested value constitutes taxable compensation to our CEO for income tax purposes and was subject to statutory withholding. Upon vesting, we funded 104.3 million in statutory withholding, which, in turn, was satisfied by the CEO through a cash payment to us of 19.7 million and by the surrendering of 311,408 shares of Class B common stock, which we retired. In September 1999, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase, at management s discretion, of up to 7,500,000 shares of common stock in the open market or via private transactions. No shares were repurchased under this plan during 2022, 2021 or 2020. In aggregate, 6,370,913 shares of Common and Class B common stock have been repurchased at a cost of 114.4 million since the inception of this plan. At December 31, 2022, there were 1,129,087 shares remaining authorized for repurchase under this plan. Shares were last repurchased by the Company under this plan in 2008.

Table of Contents 
 Company Overview 

Watsco, Inc. was incorporated in Florida in 1956, and, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, Watsco, or we, us, or our is the largest distributor of air conditioning, heating, and refrigeration equipment, and related parts and supplies HVAC/R in the HVAC/R distribution industry in North America. At December 31, 2022, we operated from 673 locations in 42 U.S. States, Canada, Mexico, and Puerto Rico with additional market coverage on an export basis to portions of Latin America and the Caribbean. 

 Revenues primarily consist of sales of air conditioning, heating, and refrigeration equipment, and related parts and supplies. Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of selling expenses, the largest components of which are salaries, commissions, and marketing expenses that are variable and correlate to changes in sales. Other significant selling, general and administrative expenses relate to the operation of warehouse facilities, including a fleet of trucks and forklifts, and facility rent, a majority of which we operate under non-cancelable
 operating leases. 
 Sales of residential central air conditioners, heating equipment, and parts and supplies are seasonal. Furthermore, profitability can be impacted favorably or unfavorably based on weather patterns, particularly during the Summer and Winter selling seasons. Demand related to the residential central air conditioning replacement market is typically highest in the second and third quarters, and demand for heating equipment is usually highest in the first and fourth quarters. Demand related to the new construction sectors throughout most of the markets we serve tends to be fairly evenly distributed throughout the year and depends largely on housing completions and related weather and economic conditions. 

 Impact of the COVID-19
 Pandemic and Economic and Marketplace Dynamics 

 Since COVID-19
 was declared a pandemic in March 2020, it has had, and could continue to have, widespread impacts on global financial markets and business practices. Although we learned to navigate COVID-19
 while maintaining our operations in all material respects, the pandemic impacted our operations, and the operations of our customers and suppliers throughout 2020 and into 2021. However, as the effects of the pandemic have continued to lessen with the normalization of living with COVID-19
 following the increase in accessibility to COVID-19
 vaccines and antiviral treatments, the impact of the pandemic on our business has been more reflective of greater economic and marketplace dynamics, which include inflation, supply chain disruptions, and labor shortages, rather than pandemic-related issues, such as quarantines, location closures, mandated restrictions, employee illnesses, and travel restrictions. 
 Certain of our manufacturers and suppliers continue to experience some level of supply chain disruptions caused by component availability, labor shortages, transportation delays, and other logistical challenges, resulting in longer lead times and constrained availability of HVAC/R products. These supply chain disruptions impacted our ability to fulfill contractor demand at various points during 2022 and we estimate the impact was approximately 3 to 4 of lost revenues. We cannot reasonably estimate the future impact of supply chain disruptions to the extent that these disruptions become more pronounced than current conditions. Despite these disruptions, we experienced growth in sales during 2022. 

 We continue to take proactive steps to limit the impact of these disruptions and are working closely with our suppliers to ensure availability of products. Also, we continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business. 

 Climate Change and Reductions in CO 2
e Emissions 

We believe that our business plays an important and significant role in the drive to lower CO2e emissions. According to the DOE, heating and air conditioning accounts for roughly half of household energy consumption in the United States. As such, replacing older, less efficient HVAC systems with higher efficiency systems is one of the most meaningful steps homeowners can take to reduce their electricity costs and carbon footprint.

 The overwhelming majority of new HVAC systems that we sell replace systems that likely operate below current minimum efficiency standards in the United States and may use more harmful refrigerants that have been, or are being, phased-out.
 As consumers replace HVAC systems with new, higher-efficiency systems, homeowners will consume less energy, save costs,
 and reduce their carbon footprint. 
 The sale of high-efficiency systems has long been a focus of ours, and we have invested in tools and technology intended to capture an increasingly richer sales mix over time. In addition, regulatory mandates will periodically increase the required minimum SEER, thus providing a catalyst for greater sales of higher-efficiency systems. Recently enacted regulations increased the current minimum SEER beginning in 2023 (in general terms, to 14 SEER from 13 SEER in the Northern U.S. and to 15 SEER from 14 SEER for the Southern U.S.). 

2 

Table of Contents 
 We offer a broad variety of systems that operate above the minimum SEER standards, ranging from base-level efficiency to systems that exceed 20 SEER. Our sales of higher-efficiency residential HVAC systems (those above base-level efficiency) grew 18 organically in 2022, outpacing the overall growth rate of 13 for residential HVAC equipment in the United States. Based on estimates validated by independent sources, we averted an estimated 15.8 million metric tons of CO2e emissions from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2022 through the sale of replacement residential HVAC systems at higher-efficiency standards. 

 Federal Tax Credits and State Incentives 

 Demand for higher-efficiency products, such as variable-speed systems and heat pumps, is expected to benefit from the passage of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA in August 2022. This legislation is intended, in part, to promote the replacement of existing systems in favor of high-efficiency heat pump systems that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as compared to older systems, and thereby combat climate change. Programs under the IRA include enhanced tax credits for homeowners who install qualifying HVAC equipment and tax deductions for owners of commercial buildings that are upgraded to achieve defined energy savings. The IRA also sets aside 4.3 billion for state-administered consumer rebate programs designed to promote energy savings for low and medium-income households, including HVAC systems. Further details, including qualifying products, specific programs, and other regulatory requirements contemplated by the IRA are being determined and are expected to be launched during 2023. 

 Joint Ventures with Carrier Global Corporation 

In 2009, we formed a joint venture with Carrier, which we refer to as Carrier Enterprise I, in which Carrier contributed company-owned locations in the Sun Belt states and Puerto Rico, and its export division in Miami, Florida, and we contributed certain locations that distributed Carrier products. We have an 80 controlling interest in Carrier Enterprise I, and Carrier has a 20 non-controlling
 interest. In 2019, Carrier Enterprise I acquired substantially all of the HVAC assets and assumed certain of the liabilities of Peirce-Phelps, Inc., an HVAC distributor operating in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. Carrier Enterprise I has a 38.1 ownership interest in Russell Sigler, Inc. RSI ), an HVAC distributor operating from 35 locations in the Western U.S. 
 The export division of Carrier Enterprise I, Carrier InterAmerica Corporation CIAC ), redomesticated from the U.S. Virgin Islands to Delaware in 2019, following which CIAC became a separate operating entity in which we have an 80 controlling interest and Carrier has a 20 non-controlling
 interest. 
 In 2011, we formed a second joint venture with Carrier, which we refer to as Carrier Enterprise II, in which Carrier contributed company-owned locations in the Northeast U.S., and we contributed certain locations operating as Homans Associates LLC Homans ), a Watsco subsidiary, in the Northeast U.S. Subsequently, Carrier Enterprise II purchased Carrier s distribution operations in Mexico. We have an 80 controlling interest in Carrier Enterprise II, and Carrier has a 20 non-controlling
 interest. In 2019, we repurchased the 20 ownership interest in Homans from Carrier Enterprise II and have since solely owned and operated Homans. 
 In 2012, we formed a third joint venture with Carrier, which we refer to as Carrier Enterprise III, to which Carrier contributed company-owned locations in Canada. We have a 60 controlling interest in Carrier Enterprise III, and Carrier has a 40 non-controlling
 interest. 
 In April 2021, we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities comprising the HVAC distribution business of Temperature Equipment Corporation, an HVAC distributor operating from Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, 
and Wisconsin. We formed a new joint venture with Carrier, TEC Distribution LLC TEC ), that operates this business. We have an 80 controlling interest in TEC, and Carrier has a 20 non-controlling
 interest. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 

Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. At least quarterly, management reevaluates its judgments and estimates, which are based on historical experience, current trends, and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

Table of Contents 
 Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Management believes that the following accounting estimates include a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity and are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations and, thus, are considered critical accounting estimates. Management has discussed the development and selection of critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosures relating to critical accounting estimates. 

 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 

 An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments. We typically do not require our customers to provide collateral. Accounting for doubtful accounts contains uncertainty because management must use judgment to assess the collectability of these accounts. When preparing these estimates, management considers several factors, including the aging of a customer s account, past transactions with customers, creditworthiness of specific customers, historical trends, and other information, including potential impacts of business and economic conditions. Our business and our customers businesses are seasonal. Sales are lowest during the first and fourth quarters, and past due accounts receivable balances as a percentage of total trade receivables generally increase during these quarters. We review our accounts receivable reserve policy periodically, reflecting current risks, trends, and changes in industry conditions. 

 The allowance for doubtful accounts was 18.3 million and 11.3 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, an increase of 7.0 million, which was primarily due to a single account 
 delinquent in their payments at December 31, 2022. Accounts receivable balances greater than 90 days past due as a percent of accounts receivable at December 31, 2022 increased to 2.4 from 0.9 at December 31, 2021, which was primarily attributable to the account referenced. 

 Although we believe the allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient, a decline in economic conditions could lead to the deterioration in the financial condition of our customers, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments and requiring additional allowances that could materially impact our consolidated results of operations. We believe our exposure to customer credit risk is limited due to the large number of customers comprising our customer base and their dispersion across many different geographical regions. Additionally, we mitigate credit risk through credit insurance programs. 

 Inventory Valuation Reserves 

 Inventory valuation reserves are established to report inventories at the lower of cost using the weighted-average and the first-in,
 first-out
 methods, or net realizable value. As part of the valuation process, inventories are adjusted to reflect excess, slow-moving, and damaged goods. The valuation process contains uncertainty because management must make estimates and use judgment to determine the future salability of inventories. Inventory policies are reviewed periodically, reflecting current risks, trends, and changes in industry conditions. A reserve for estimated inventory shrinkage is maintained and reflects the results of cycle count programs and physical inventories. When preparing these estimates, management considers historical results, inventory levels, and current operating trends. 
 Valuation of Goodwill, Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets
 
 The recoverability of goodwill is evaluated at least annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We have one reporting unit that is subject to goodwill impairment testing. In performing the goodwill impairment test, we use a two-step
 approach. The first step compares the reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. The identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of our reporting unit and contains uncertainty because management must use judgment in determining appropriate assumptions to be used in the measurement of fair value. On January 1, 2023, we performed our annual evaluation of goodwill impairment and determined that the estimated fair value of our reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. 
 The recoverability of indefinite lived intangibles and long-lived assets are also evaluated on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. Indefinite lived intangibles and long-lived assets not subject to amortization are assessed for impairment by comparing the fair value of the intangible asset or long-lived asset to its carrying amount to determine if a write-down to fair value is required. Our annual evaluation did not indicate any impairment of indefinite lived intangibles or long-lived assets.

Table of Contents 
 The estimates of fair value of our reporting unit, indefinite lived intangibles, and long-lived assets are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment and incorporates management s assumptions about expected future cash flows and contemplates other valuation techniques. Future cash flows can be affected by changes in the industry, a declining economic environment, or market conditions. There have been no events or circumstances from the date of our assessments that would have had an impact on this conclusion. The carrying amounts of goodwill, intangibles, and long-lived assets were 1,189.5 million and 1,124.5 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, an increase of 65.0 million, primarily related to higher renewal lease rates of our warehouse facilities. Although no impairment losses have been recorded to date, there can be no assurance that impairments will not occur in the future. An adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill, intangibles, and long-lived assets could materially adversely impact the consolidated results of operations. 

 Loss Contingencies 

 Accruals are recorded for various contingencies including self-insurance, legal proceedings, environmental matters, and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The estimation process contains uncertainty because accruals are based on judgment, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates. Additionally, we record receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable. 

 Self-insurance reserves are maintained relative to company-wide casualty insurance and health benefit programs. The level of exposure from catastrophic events is limited by the purchase of stop-loss and aggregate liability reinsurance coverage. When estimating the self-insurance liabilities and related reserves, management considers several factors, which include historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and valuations provided by independent third-party actuaries. Management reviews its assumptions with its independent third-party actuaries to evaluate whether self-insurance reserves are adequate. If actual claims or adverse development of loss reserves occur and exceed these estimates, additional reserves may be required and could materially impact the consolidated results of operations. The estimation process contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate the ultimate cost that will be incurred to settle reported claims and unreported claims for incidents incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. Reserves in the amounts of 12.3 million and 7.3 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, were established related to such insurance programs. The increase in self-insurance reserves was primarily due to the severity and frequency of claims reported during 2022. 

 Income Taxes 

 Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are recovered or settled. The use of estimates by management is required to determine income tax expense, deferred tax assets, and any related valuation allowance and deferred tax liabilities. A valuation allowance of 8.2 million and 5.1 million was recorded at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase was primarily attributable to the impact on U.S. deferred tax assets from share-based compensation deduction limitations related to the expansion of IRC Section 162(m). See Note 9 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 The valuation allowance is based on several factors including, but not limited to, estimates of future taxable income by jurisdiction in which the deferred tax assets will be recoverable. These estimates can be affected by several factors, including changes to tax laws, or possible tax audits, or general economic conditions, or competitive pressures that could affect future taxable income. Although management believes that the estimates are reasonable, the deferred tax asset and any related valuation allowance will need to be adjusted if management s estimates of future taxable income differ from actual taxable income. An adjustment to the deferred tax asset and any related valuation allowance could materially impact the consolidated results of operations. 
 New Accounting Standards 

There were no new accounting standards made effective during 2022 that have significance, or potential significance, to our consolidated financial statements.

Income taxes represent a composite of the income taxes attributable to our wholly owned operations and income taxes attributable to the Carrier joint ventures, which are primarily taxed as partnerships for income tax purposes; therefore, Carrier is responsible for its proportionate share of income taxes attributable to its share of earnings from these joint ventures. The decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to the increase in share-based compensation deduction resulting from the vesting of 975,622 shares of Class B restricted stock on October 15, 2022 and provided a 49.0 million tax benefit that lowered our effective income tax rate. The share-based compensation deduction was partially offset by the addition of a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset related to share-based compensation, and higher state income taxes in 2022 as compared to those related to the share-based compensation deduction in 2021. 

 Net Income Attributable to Watsco, Inc. 

 Net income attributable to Watsco in 2022 increased 182.2 million, or 43 , to 601.2 million. The increase was primarily driven by higher revenues, expanded profit margins, and lower income taxes, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses and an increase in the net income attributable to the non-controlling
 interest.

 Non-GAAP
 Financial Measures 

 We disclose operating income, operating margin, and diluted earnings per share on an adjusted, non-GAAP
 basis to exclude the impact caused by the vesting of restricted stock on October 15, 2022 as described above. We believe that these adjusted, non-GAAP
 financial measures provide greater comparability regarding our ongoing operating performance. These measures should not be considered an alternative to measurements required by U.S. GAAP.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to execute our business strategy and fund operating and investing activities, taking into consideration the seasonal demand for HVAC/R products, which peaks in the months of May through August. Significant factors that could affect our liquidity include the following: 

cash needed to fund our business (primarily working capital requirements); 

borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility; 

the ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms; 

acquisitions, including joint ventures and investments in unconsolidated entities; 

dividend payments; 

capital expenditures; and 

the timing and extent of common stock repurchases. 

Sources and Uses of Cash 

 We rely on cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement to fund seasonal working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes in the short-term and the long-term, including dividend payments (if and as declared by our Board of Directors), capital expenditures, business acquisitions, and development of our long-term operating and technology strategies. Additionally, we may also generate cash through the issuance and sale of our Common stock. 

 As of December 31, 2022, we had 147.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which 124.9 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. The repatriation of cash balances from our foreign subsidiaries could have adverse tax impacts or be subject to capital controls; however, these balances are generally available to fund the ordinary business operations of our foreign subsidiaries without legal restrictions. 

 We believe that our operating cash flows, cash on hand, funds available for borrowing under our revolving credit agreement, and funds available from sales of our Common stock under our ATM Program (as defined below), each of which is described below, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that our current sources of available funds will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements.

Table of Contents 
 Our access to funds under our revolving credit agreement depends on the ability of the syndicate banks to meet their respective funding commitments. Disruptions in the credit and capital markets could adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit agreement and may also adversely affect the determination of interest rates, particularly rates based on LIBOR, which is one of the base rates under our revolving credit agreement. On March 5, 2021, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, confirmed that LIBOR will either cease to be provided by any administrator or will no longer be representative after June 30, 2023 for USD LIBOR reference rates. The U.S. Federal Reserve has selected the Secured Overnight Funding Rate SOFR as the preferred alternate rate to LIBOR. Our revolving credit agreement provides that it may be amended to replace LIBOR with an alternate benchmark rate including SOFR. SOFR is calculated differently from LIBOR and has inherent differences, including SOFR s limited historical data and that LIBOR is an unsecured lending rate while SOFR is a secured lending rate, which could give rise to uncertainties and volatility in the benchmark rates. While we continue to evaluate the potential impact of a transition to SOFR, these changes could result in interest obligations that are more than or do not otherwise correlate exactly over time with the payments that would have been made on such debt if LIBOR was available in its current form, including a potential increase in our overall interest expense. Additionally, disruptions in the credit and capital markets could also result in increased borrowing costs and/or reduced borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement. 

 Working Capital 

 Working capital increased to 1,392.2 million at December 31, 2022 from 1,234.7 million at December 31, 2021, due to: (i) higher inventory balances primarily due to the general impact of inflation, greater inventory requirements in preparation for the required transition to higher minimum efficiency level for residential HVAC systems effective January 1, 2023, and more extensive inventories in response to various supply chain disruptions; and (ii) higher accounts receivable consistent with overall increased sales, which were offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and the reclassification of borrowings under our revolving credit agreement, which matures in December 2023, as current.

 The individual items contributing to cash flow changes for the years presented are detailed in the audited consolidated statements of cash flows included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
 Operating Activities 

The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher net income and accounts receivable collections, partially offset by increases in the level of inventory and timing of vendor payments in 2022 as compared to 2021. 

 Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities was lower in 2022 primarily due to cash consideration paid for businesses acquired in 2021, whereas we acquired no businesses in 2022. 

 Financing Activities 

The increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to an increase in dividends paid, the payment of withholding tax obligations primarily upon the vesting of restricted stock previously granted to our CEO, and higher borrowings under our revolving credit agreement in 2022, partially offset by proceeds from the non-controlling
 interest for its contribution to the acquisition of TEC in 2021. 
 Revolving Credit Agreement 

 We maintain an unsecured, 560.0 million syndicated multicurrency revolving credit agreement, which we use to fund seasonal working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, dividends (if and as declared by our Board of Directors), capital expenditures, stock repurchases and issuances of letters of credit. The credit facility has a seasonal component from October 1 to March 31, during which the borrowing capacity may be reduced to 460.0 million at our discretion (which effectively reduces fees payable in respect of the unused portion of the commitment), and we effected this reduction in 2021. Included in the credit facility are a 100.0 million swingline subfacility, a 10.0 million letter of credit subfacility, a 75.0 million alternative currency borrowing sublimit and an 8.0 million Mexican borrowing sublimit. 

10 

Table of Contents 
 The revolving credit agreement matures on December 5, 2023, and accordingly, borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit agreement are classified as current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2022. We believe that we will refinance the revolving credit agreement at or prior to its maturity on similar terms and subject to similar conditions. 

 Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at either LIBOR-based rates plus a spread, which ranges from 87.5 to 150.0 basis-points (LIBOR plus 87.5 basis-points at December 31, 2022), depending on our ratio of total debt to EBITDA, or on rates based on the highest of the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.5 , the Prime Rate or the Eurocurrency Rate plus 1.0 , in each case plus a spread which ranges from 0 to 50.0 basis-points (0 basis-points at December 31, 2022), depending on our ratio of total debt to EBITDA. We pay a variable commitment fee on the unused portion of the commitment under the revolving credit agreement, ranging from 7.5 to 20.0 basis-points (7.5 basis-points at December 31, 2022). 

 At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, 56.4 million and 89.0 million, respectively, were outstanding under the revolving credit agreement. The revolving credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants with respect to consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios, and other customary restrictions. We believe we were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2022. 

 At-the-Market

 Offering Program 

 On February 25, 2022, we entered into an amended and restated sales agreement with Robert W. Baird Co. Inc. and Goldman Sachs Co. LLC, which enables the Company to issue and sell shares of Common stock in one or more negotiated transactions or transactions that are deemed to be at the market offerings as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), for a maximum aggregate offering amount of up to 300.0 million (the ATM Program ). The offer and sale of our Common stock pursuant to the ATM Program has been registered under the Securities Act pursuant to our automatically effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3
 (File No. 333-260758).
 As of December 31, 2022, no shares of Common stock had been sold under the ATM Program. 
 Contractual Obligations 

 At December 31, 2022, operating lease liabilities for real property, vehicles, and equipment totaled 319.3 million and expire at various dates through 2032. Refer to Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
 for information on our operating lease liabilities and related maturities. 
 Commercial obligations outstanding at December 31, 2022 under our revolving credit agreement consisted of borrowings totaling 56.4 million with revolving maturities of 31 days. 

 At December 31, 2022, we were obligated under various non-cancelable
 purchase orders with our key suppliers for goods aggregating approximately 69.0 million, of which approximately 56.0 million is with Carrier and its affiliates. These purchase obligations represent commitments under purchase orders for goods in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding with defined terms as to price, quantity, and delivery. 
 The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits (net of the federal benefit received from state positions) relating to various tax positions we have taken, the timing of which is uncertain, was 6.5 million at December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 9 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
 for additional information on our unrecognized tax benefits.

 Investment in Unconsolidated Entity 

 Carrier Enterprise I has a 38.1 ownership interest in RSI, an HVAC distributor operating from 35 locations in the Western U.S. Our proportionate share of the net income of RSI is included in other income in our consolidated statements of income. 

 Carrier Enterprise I is a party to a shareholders agreement (the Shareholders Agreement with RSI and its shareholders, consisting of five family siblings, their children and affiliates related to them. Pursuant to the Shareholders Agreement, RSI s shareholders have the right to sell, and Carrier Enterprise I has the obligation to purchase, their respective shares of RSI for a purchase price determined based on the higher of book value or a multiple of EBIT, the latter of which Carrier Enterprise I used to calculate the price for its 38.1 investment held in RSI. RSI s shareholders may transfer their respective shares of RSI common stock only to members of the Sigler family or to Carrier Enterprise I, and, at any time from and after 

11 

Table of Contents 
 the date on which Carrier Enterprise I owns 85 or more of RSI s outstanding common stock, it has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase from RSI s shareholders the remaining outstanding shares of RSI common stock. At December 31, 2022, the estimated purchase amount we would be contingently liable for was approximately 357.0 million. We believe that our operating cash flows, cash on hand, funds available for borrowing under our revolving credit agreement, or use of the ATM Program would be sufficient to purchase any additional ownership interests in RSI. 

 Acquisitions 

 On August 20, 2021, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries acquired MIS, a distributor of air conditioning and heating products operating from six locations in Pennsylvania. Consideration for the purchase consisted of 3.2 million in cash and the issuance of 3,627 shares of Common stock having a fair value of 1.0 million, net of cash acquired of 0.2 million. 

 On May 7, 2021, we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of ACME, a distributor of air conditioning, heating, and refrigeration products, operating from 18 locations in Louisiana and Mississippi, for 22.9 million less certain average revolving indebtedness. Consideration for the purchase consisted of 18.1 million in cash, 8,492 shares of Common stock having a fair value of 2.6 million, and 3.1 million repayment of indebtedness, net of cash acquired of 1.3 million. 

 On April 9, 2021, we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities comprising the HVAC distribution business of Temperature Equipment Corporation, an HVAC distributor operating from 32 locations in Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, and Wisconsin. We formed a new, stand-alone joint venture with Carrier, TEC, which operates this business. We have an 80 controlling interest in TEC, and Carrier has a 20 non-controlling
 interest. Consideration for the purchase was paid in cash, consisting of 105.2 million paid to Temperature Equipment Corporation (Carrier contributed 21.0 million and we contributed 84.2 million) and 1.5 million for repayment of indebtedness. 
 We continually evaluate potential acquisitions and/or joint ventures and investments in unconsolidated entities. We routinely hold discussions with several acquisition candidates. Should suitable acquisition opportunities arise that would require additional financing, we believe our financial position and earnings history provide a sufficient basis for us to either obtain additional debt financing at competitive rates and on reasonable terms or raise capital through the issuance of equity securities. 

 Common Stock Dividends 

 We paid cash dividends of 8.55, 7.625, and 6.925 per share of Common stock and Class B common stock in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. On January 3, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 2.45 per share of both Common and Class B common stock that was paid on January 31, 2023 to shareholders of record as of January 17, 2023. Future dividends and/or changes in dividend rates are at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors and depend upon factors including, but not limited to, cash flow generated by operations, profitability, financial condition, cash requirements, and future prospects. 

 Company Share Repurchase Program 

 In September 1999, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase, at management s discretion, of up to 7,500,000 shares of common stock in the open market or via private transactions. Shares repurchased under the program are accounted for using the cost method and result in a reduction of shareholders equity. We last repurchased shares under this plan in 2008. In aggregate, 6,370,913 shares of Common and Class B common stock have been repurchased at a cost of 114.4 million since the inception of the program. At December 31, 2022, there were 1,129,087 shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the program. The IRA includes, among other provisions, a 1 excise tax on corporate stock repurchases in tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. In consideration of any further stock repurchases under our repurchase program, we intend to evaluate the impact of the IRA s 1 excise tax on stock repurchases in tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. 

 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

We are exposed to market risks, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. To manage certain of these exposures, we use derivative instruments, including forward and option contracts and swaps. We use derivative instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes. 

 Foreign Currency Exposure 

 We are exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations resulting from currency exchange rate variations. These exposures are transactional and translational in nature. The foreign currency exchange rates to which we are exposed are the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso. Revenues in these markets accounted for 5 and 2 , respectively, of our total revenues for 2022. 

12 

Table of Contents 
 Our transactional exposure primarily relates to purchases by our Canadian operations in currencies other than their local currency. To mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate movements on these purchases, we use foreign currency forward contracts. By entering into these foreign currency forward contracts, we lock in exchange rates that would otherwise cause losses should the U.S. dollar strengthen and gains should the U.S. dollar weaken, in each case against the Canadian dollar. 

 We have exposure related to the translation of financial statements of our Canadian operations into U.S. dollars, our functional currency. We do not currently hold any derivative contracts that hedge our foreign currency translational exposure. A 10 change in the Canadian dollar would have had an estimated 5.1 million impact to our financial position and results of operations for 2022. 

 Historically, fluctuations in these exchange rates have not materially impacted our results of operations. Our exposure to currency rate fluctuations could be material in the future if these fluctuations become significant or if our Canadian and Mexican markets grow and represent a larger percentage of our total revenues. 

 We had only one foreign exchange contract at December 31, 2022, the total notional value of which was 3.3 million, and such contract expired during January 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2022, foreign currency transaction gains and losses did not have a material impact on our results of operations. See Note 16 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
 for further information on our derivative instruments. 
 Interest Rate Exposure 

 Our revolving credit facility exposes us to interest rate risk because borrowings thereunder accrue interest at one or more variable interest rates. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we consider entering into interest rate swap agreements with financial institutions that have investment grade credit ratings, thereby minimizing credit risk associated with these instruments. We do not currently hold any such swap agreements or any other derivative contracts that hedge our interest rate exposure, but we may enter into such instruments in the future. 

 We have evaluated our exposure to interest rates assuming we are fully borrowed under our 560.0 million revolving credit agreement and determined that a 100 basis-point change in interest rates would result in an impact to income before income taxes of approximately 5.6 million. See Note 8 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
 for further information about our debt.

 MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f).
 Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of our published consolidated financial statements. 
 All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective may not prevent or detect misstatements and can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. The assessment was based on criteria established in the framework Internal Control

 Integrated Framework (2013)

, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations COSO of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment under the COSO framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report that is included herein.

 Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

We have audited Watsco, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013)

 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013)

 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 24, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. 

 Basis for Opinion 

The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 Watsco, Inc.: 

 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Watsco, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013)

 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 24, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Basis for Opinion 

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

 Critical Audit Matter 

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated 

financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated 

financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated 

financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Evaluation of inventory net realizable value adjustments related to excess and slow-moving inventory 

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company values its inventory at the lower of cost using weighted-average cost basis and first-in,
 first-out
 methods, or net realizable value. The Company adjusts excess, slow-moving, and damaged inventory to their estimated net realizable value. As of December 31, 2022, the Company s inventory balance was 1,370,173 thousand. 
 We identified the evaluation of inventory net realizable value adjustments related to excess and slow-moving inventory as a critical audit matter due to the amount of judgment required by the Company in making such estimates. As a result, there was a high degree of subjective auditor judgment in assessing such estimates, specifically as it related to the future salability of inventories.

Table of Contents 
 The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company s process to estimate net realizable values related to excess and slow-moving inventory. This included controls related to the future salability of inventories, assumptions used for excess and slow-moving inventory, and the Company s review of inventory net realizable value adjustments. We compared a selection of inventory units to historical performance to assess possible write-down indications and future salability. We performed a sensitivity analysis under various scenarios and analyzed trends of total adjustments to net realizable values in relation to total inventory to test the Company s determination of the inventory valuation and adjustments related to excess and slow-moving inventory.

The exercise of lease renewal options is at our sole discretion, and our lease ROU assets and liabilities reflect only the options we are reasonably certain that we will exercise. Certain real property lease agreements have lease and non-lease
 components, which are generally accounted for as a single lease component. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease payments for short-term leases, which are 12 months or less without a purchase option that is likely to be exercised, are recognized as lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

of our consolidated revenues for all periods presented
. 

Revenue is recognized when control transfers to our customers when products are picked up, or via shipment of products or delivery of services. We measure revenue as the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services, net of any variable considerations (e.g., rights to return product, sales incentives, others) and any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. Revenue for shipping and handling charges is recognized when products are delivered to the customer. 

Product Returns 

We estimate product returns based on historical experience and record them on a gross basis on our balance sheets. Substantially all customer returns relate to products that are returned under manufacturers warranty obligations. Accrued sales returns at December 31, 2022 and 2021 of and , respectively, were included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. 

 Sales Incentives 

We estimate sales incentives expected to be paid over the terms of the programs based on the most likely amounts. Sales incentives are accounted for as a reduction in the transaction price and are generally paid on an annual basis. 

Practical Expedients 

We generally expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less.

 syndicated multicurrency revolving credit agreement, which we use to fund seasonal working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, dividends (if and as declared by our Board of Directors), capital expenditures, stock repurchases, and issuances of letters of credit. The credit facility has a seasonal component from October 1 to March 31, during which the borrowing capacity may be reduced to
 at our discretion (which effectively reduces fees payable in respect of the unused portion of the commitment), and we effected this reduction in 2022. Included in the credit facility are a swingline subfacility, a letter of credit subfacility, a alternative currency borrowing sublimit and an Mexican borrowing sublimit.

The revolving credit agreement 

 matures on , and accordingly, borrowings outstanding under the 

revolving 

 credit agreement are classified as current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2022. We believe that we will refinance the 

revolving 

 credit agreement at or prior to its maturity on similar terms and subject to similar conditions. 

Borrowings 

under the credit facility bear interest at either LIBOR-based rates plus a spread, which ranges from to basis-points (LIBOR plus basis-points at December 31, 2022), depending on our ratio of total debt to EBITDA, or on rates based on the highest of the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus , the Prime Rate or the Eurocurrency Rate plus , in each case plus a spread which ranges from to basis-points basis-points at December 31, 2022), depending on our ratio of total debt to EBITDA. We pay a variable commitment fee on the unused portion of the commitment under the revolving credit agreement, ranging from to basis-points basis-points at December 31, 2022). During 2021, we paid fees of in connection with the increase in the aggregate borrowing capacity of our revolving credit agreement, which are being amortized ratably through the maturity of the facility in December 2023. 

 At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, and , respectively, were outstanding under the revolving credit agreement. The revolving credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants with respect to consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios, and other customary restrictions.

Provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the TCJA such as the one-time repatriation transition tax and the global intangible low-taxed income GILTI for years beginning in 2018, effectively taxed the undistributed earnings previously deferred from U.S. federal and certain state income taxes and eliminated any additional U.S. taxation resulting from repatriation of earnings on non-US
 subsidiaries. GILTI is a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. We have elected to provide for the tax expense related to GILTI in the year the tax was incurred as a period expense. As of December 31, 2022, we have accumulated undistributed earnings generated by our foreign subsidiaries of approximately 
 . Any additional taxes due with respect to such previously taxed earnings, if repatriated, would generally be limited to certain state income taxes and foreign withholding. Deferred taxes have been recorded for foreign withholding taxes on certain earnings of our foreign consolidated subsidiaries expected to be repatriated. We do not intend to distribute the remaining previously taxed foreign earnings and therefore have not recorded deferred taxes for certain state income taxes and foreign withholding on such earnings. The amount of certain state income taxes and foreign withholding that might be payable on the remaining amounts at December 31, 2022 is not practicable to estimate. 
 On March 11, 2021, the America Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (the ARPA was enacted. The ARPA expanded IRC Section 162(m) to include five additional most highly compensated individuals. The expansion of Section 162(m) coverage is effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2026. Unlike the employees subject to Section 162(m) by virtue of being the Chief Executive Officer CEO ), Chief Financial Officer, or three most highly compensated named executive officers, an employee who is identified as one of the additional five employees is not considered to be a covered employee indefinitely. The additional employees will be subject to the annual cap on compensation, and will be determined annually.

 On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (the IRA was enacted, which introduces a new corporate minimum tax based on adjusted financial statement income and a excise tax on stock repurchases, effective January 1, 2023, and provisions intended to mitigate climate change, including tax credit incentives for investments that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Based on our current analysis of the provisions, this legislation will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Valuation allowances are provided to reduce the related deferred income tax assets to an amount which will, more likely than not, be realized. The valuation allowance was 
 and 
 at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase was primarily attributable to the impact on U.S deferred tax assets from share-based compensation deduction limitations related to the expansion of IRC Section 162(m).
