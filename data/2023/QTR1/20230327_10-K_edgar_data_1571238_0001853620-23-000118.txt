EXPLANATORY
NOTES 

The
Exhibit Index describes exhibits provided by certain parties (in their capacities indicated on the Exhibit Index) with respect
to the Santa Anita Mall Mortgage Loan, which constituted approximately 5.4 of the asset pool of the issuing entity as of its
cut-off date. The Santa Anita Mall Mortgage Loan is an asset of the issuing entity and is part of a loan combination that
includes the Santa Anita Mall Mortgage Loan and one other pari passu loan, which is not an asset of the issuing entity.
The other pari passu portion of the loan combination was securitized in the UBS-Barclays Commercial Mortgage Trust 2013-C5
transaction, Commission File Number 333-177354-05 (the UBS-Barclays 2013-C5 Transaction ). This loan combination,
including the Santa Anita Mall Mortgage Loan, is being serviced and administered pursuant to the pooling and servicing agreement
for the UBS-Barclays 2013-C5 Transaction, which is incorporated by reference as Exhibit 4.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

The
master servicer of a pooling and servicing agreement or trust and servicing agreement also functions as the primary servicer of
the related mortgage loans serviced and administered pursuant to such agreement unless a separate primary servicer is identified
herein. If this report does not identify a separate primary servicer, the servicer compliance statement provided by the master
servicer under any such agreement also encompasses its responsibilities as primary servicer of the related mortgage loan or mortgage
loans. 

Midland
Loan Services, a Division of PNC Bank, National Association is the master servicer of the mortgage loans serviced under the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement and the primary servicer and special servicer of the Santa Anita Mall Mortgage Loan. As a result, Midland
Loan Services, a Division of PNC Bank, National Association is a servicer as defined in Item 1108(a)(2)(iii) of
Regulation AB, in the capacities described above, because it is servicing mortgage loans that constituted 10 or more of the assets
of the issuing entity as of its cut-off date. The assessments of compliance with applicable servicing criteria, accountants 
attestation reports and servicer compliance statements delivered by Midland Loan Services, a Division of PNC Bank, National Association
in the capacities described above are listed in the Exhibit Index. 

The
assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria, accountants attestation report and servicer compliance statement
of the certificate administrator of the Santa Anita Mall Mortgage Loan is omitted from this Annual Report on Form 10-K as the
certificate administrator pursuant to the related pooling and servicing agreement or trust and servicing agreement does not perform
any activities that address servicing criteria with respect to the issuing entity and because it is not a servicer 
that meets the criteria in Item 1108(a)(2)(i) through (iii) of Regulation AB.

No
entity or group of affiliated entities provides any derivative instruments or other support for the certificates within this transaction

Item
1117 of Regulation AB, Legal Proceedings. 

The
registrant knows of no material pending legal proceeding involving the trust or any party related to the trust, other than routine
litigation incidental to the duties of those respective parties, and the following, with respect to U.S. Bank National Association,
as trustee, certificate administrator and custodian, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee, certificate administrator
and custodian. 

In
the last several years, U.S. Bank National Association U.S. Bank and other large financial institutions have been
sued in their capacity as trustee or successor trustee for certain residential mortgage backed securities RMBS trusts.
The complaints, primarily filed by investors or investor groups against U.S. Bank and similar institutions, allege the trustees
caused losses to investors as a result of alleged failures by the sponsors, mortgage loan sellers and servicers to comply with
the governing agreements for these RMBS trusts. Plaintiffs generally assert causes of action based upon the trustees purported
failures to enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for alleged breaches of representations and warranties, notify
securityholders of purported events of default allegedly caused by breaches of servicing standards by mortgage loan servicers
and abide by a heightened standard of care following alleged events of default. 

U.S.
Bank denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions
were not the cause of losses to investors, that it has meritorious defenses, and it has contested and intends to continue contesting
the plaintiffs claims vigorously. However, U.S. Bank cannot assure you as to the outcome of any of the litigation, or the
possible impact of these litigations on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. 

On
March 9, 2018, a law firm purporting to represent fifteen Delaware statutory trusts (the DSTs that issued securities
backed by student loans (the Student Loans filed a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery against U.S. Bank
National Association U.S. Bank in its capacities as indenture trustee and successor special servicer, and three
other institutions in their respective transaction capacities, with respect to the DSTs and the Student Loans. This lawsuit is
captioned The National Collegiate Student Loan Master Trust I, et al. v. U.S. Bank National Association, et al., C.A. No. 2018-0167-JRS
(Del. Ch.) (the NCMSLT Action ). The complaint, as amended on June 15, 2018, alleged that the DSTs have been harmed
as a result of purported misconduct or omissions by the defendants concerning administration of the trusts and special servicing
of the Student Loans. Since the filing of the NCMSLT Action, certain Student Loan borrowers have made assertions against U.S.
Bank concerning special servicing that appear to be based on certain allegations made on behalf of the DSTs in the NCMSLT Action. 

U.S.
Bank believes that it has performed its obligations as indenture trustee and special servicer in good faith and in compliance
in all material respects with the terms of the agreements governing the DSTs (the Governing Agreements ), and accordingly
that the claims against it in the NCMSLT Action are without merit. 

U.S.
Bank has filed a motion seeking dismissal of the operative complaint in its entirety with prejudice pursuant to Chancery Court
Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) or, in the alternative, a stay of the case while other prior filed disputes involving the DSTs and
the Student Loans are litigated. On November 7, 2018, the Court ruled that the case should be stayed in its entirety pending resolution
of the first-filed cases. On January 21, 2020, the Court entered an order consolidating for pretrial purposes the NCMSLT Action
and three other lawsuits pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery concerning the DSTs and the Student Loans (the Consolidated
Action ). U.S. Bank and other parties to the Consolidated Action have briefed and argued motions for judgment on the pleadings
pursuant to Chancery Court Rule 12(c) regarding disputed issues of contractual interpretation at issue in one or more of the cases
comprising the Consolidated Action, including the NCMSLT Action. The Court has not yet ruled on these motions or on U.S. Bank s
dismissal motion in the NCMSLT Action. 

Deutsche
Bank Trust Company Americas DBTCA and Deutsche Bank National Trust Company DBNTC have been sued
by investors in civil litigation concerning their role as trustees of certain residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS trusts. 

On
June 18, 2014, a group of investors, including funds managed by Blackrock Advisors, LLC, PIMCO-Advisors, L.P., and others, filed
an action against DBNTC and DBTCA in New York State Supreme Court alleging that DBNTC and DBTCA failed to perform purported duties,
as trustees for 544 private-label RMBS trusts, to enforce breaches of representations and warranties as to mortgage loans held
by the trusts and to enforce breaches by servicers of their mortgage loan servicing obligations for the trusts. During the course
of the litigation, plaintiffs dismissed the case from New York State Supreme Court and refiled two separate cases, one in the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (the BlackRock SDNY Case and the other in the
Superior Court of California, Orange County (the BlackRock California Case ). Pursuant to a settlement among
the parties, the BlackRock SDNY Case was dismissed on December 6, 2018, and the BlackRock California Case was dismissed
on January 11, 2019. 

On
September 27, 2017, DBTCA was added as a defendant to a case brought by certain special purpose entities including Phoenix Light
SF Limited in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, in which the plaintiffs previously alleged incorrectly
that DBNTC served as trustee for all 43 of the trusts at issue. On September 27, 2017, plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint
that names DBTCA as a defendant in addition to DBNTC. DBTCA serves as trustee for one of the 43 trusts at issue. DBNTC serves
as trustee for the other 42 trusts at issue. Plaintiffs third amended complaint brings claims for violation of the U.S.
Trust Indenture Act of 1939 TIA ); breach of contract; breach of fiduciary duty; negligence and gross negligence;
violation of New York s Streit Act; and breach of the covenant of good faith. However, in the third amended complaint, plaintiffs
acknowledge that, before DBTCA was added to the case, the court dismissed plaintiffs TIA Act claims, negligence and gross
negligence claims, Streit Act claims, claims for breach of the covenant of good faith, and certain theories of plaintiffs 
breach of contract claims, and plaintiffs only include these claims to preserve any rights on appeal. Plaintiffs allege damages
of hundreds of millions of dollars. On November 13, 2017, DBNTC and DBTCA filed an answer to the third amended complaint.
On December 7, 2018, DBNTC and DBTCA filed a motion for summary judgment. Also on December 7, 2018, plaintiffs, jointly with Commerzbank
AG (see description of Commerzbank case below), filed a motion for partial summary judgment. On October 27, 2021, DBNTC and DBTCA
filed a supplemental motion for summary judgment relating to plaintiffs standing. On February 8, 2022, the court issued
an order in which it granted DBNTC and DBTCA s supplemental motion for summary judgment, granted in part DBNTC and DBTCA s
initial motion for summary judgment, and denied plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment. As a result of that order,
all of plaintiffs claims were dismissed with prejudice. On March 10, 2022, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit with respect to the court s orders on the motions to dismiss and for summary
judgment. 

On
November 30, 2017, DBTCA was added as a defendant to a case brought by Commerzbank AG Commerzbank in the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York, in which Commerzbank previously alleged incorrectly that DBNTC served as
trustee for all 50 of the trusts at issue. On November 30, 2017, Commerzbank filed a second amended complaint that names DBTCA
as a defendant in addition to DBNTC. DBTCA serves as trustee for 1 of the 50 trusts at issue. DBNTC serves as trustee for the
other 49 trusts at issue. Commerzbank s second amended complaint brings claims for violation of the TIA; breach of contract;
breach of fiduciary duty; negligence; violation of the Streit Act; and breach of the covenant of good faith. However, in the second
amended complaint, Commerzbank acknowledges that, before DBTCA was added to the case, the court dismissed Commerzbank s
TIA claims for the trusts governed by pooling and servicing agreements, as well as its Streit Act claims and claims for breach
of the covenant of good faith, and Commerzbank only includes these claims to preserve any rights on appeal. The second amended
complaint alleges that DBNTC and DBTCA caused Commerzbank to suffer hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, but
the complaint does not include a demand for money damages in a sum certain. On January 29, 2018, DBNTC and DBTCA filed an answer
to the second amended complaint. On December 7, 2018, DBNTC and DBTCA filed a motion for summary judgment. Also on December 7,
2018, Commerzbank, jointly with the Phoenix Light plaintiffs, filed a motion for partial summary judgment. On February
8, 2022, the court issued an order in which it granted in part DBNTC and DBTCA s motion for summary judgment and denied
plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment. As a result of that order, many of plaintiffs claims and theories
were dismissed with prejudice. Discovery is ongoing. 

On
December 30, 2015, IKB International, S.A. in Liquidation and IKB Deutsche Industriebank A.G. (collectively, IKB ),
as an investor in 37 RMBS trusts, filed a summons with notice in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County,
against DBNTC and DBTCA as trustees of the trusts. On May 27, 2016, IKB served its complaint asserting claims for breach of contract,
breach of fiduciary duty, breach of duty to avoid conflicts of interest, violation of the Streit Act, violation of the TIA, violation
of Regulation AB, and violation of Section 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code. IKB alleges that DBNTC and DBTCA are liable for over
U.S. 268 million in damages. On October 5, 2016, DBNTC and DBTCA, together with several other trustees defending lawsuits by
IKB, filed a joint motion to dismiss. On January 6, 2017 and June 20, 2017, IKB voluntarily dismissed with prejudice all claims
as to seven trusts. On January 27, 2021, the court granted in part and denied in part DBNTC and DBTCA s motion to dismiss.
The court granted the motion to dismiss with respect to IKB s claims for violations of the Streit Act, Regulation AB, and
Section 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, as well as certain aspects of IKB s claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary
duty, and violation of the TIA. The court denied the remainder of the motion to dismiss. IKB s remaining claims for breach
of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of duty to avoid conflicts of interest, and violation of the TIA will proceed. On
May 10, 2021, DBNTC and DBTCA filed a notice of appeal with the New York Supreme Court Appellate Division, First Department, regarding
certain aspects of the court s order on the motion to dismiss. On May 20, 2021, IKB filed a notice of cross appeal with
respect to other aspects of that order. On August 30, 2022, the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department affirmed
in part and reversed in part the court s order on the motion to dismiss. On November 10, 2022, the First Department granted
DBNTC and DBTCA s motion for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals, and denied IKB s separate motion for reargument
and leave to appeal. On June 2, 2021, IKB filed a motion for re-argument regarding certain aspects of the court s order
on the motion to dismiss, which the court denied on August 3, 2021. On May 13, 2021, DBNTC and DBTCA filed an answer to the complaint.
On October 28, 2021, the parties filed a stipulation, voluntarily dismissing with prejudice all claims as to seven additional
trusts. On December 29, 2021, the parties filed a stipulation, voluntarily dismissing with prejudice all claims as to one additional
trust. On April 22, 2022, the parties filed a stipulation, voluntarily dismissing with prejudice all claims as to 17 certificates
at issue (including all claims as to 5 trusts), leaving 17 trusts at issue. Discovery is ongoing. 

It
is DBTCA s belief that it has no pending legal proceedings (including, based on DBTCA s present evaluation, the litigation
disclosed in the foregoing paragraphs) that would materially affect its ability to perform its duties under the related servicing
agreement. 

Item
1119 of Regulation AB, Affiliations and Certain Relationships and Related Transactions. 

The
information regarding this Item has been previously provided in a prospectus supplement of the Registrant relating to the issuing

(logo) 

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To
the Board of Directors, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. 

We
have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Assessment of Compliance
with SEC Regulation AB Servicing Criteria, that Midland Loan Services, a division of PNC Bank, National Association Midland 
or the Company ), complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s
Regulation AB for all transactions serviced on the Enterprise! Loan Management System (the Platform as of December 31, 2022 and for the year then ended excluding criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(B), 1122(d)(3)(i)(C), 1122(d)(3)(i)(D),
1122(d)(3)(ii), 1122(d)(3)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(iv), and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the
servicing activities performed by them with respect to the Platform. Midland s management is responsible for its assertion
and for the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria based on our examination. 

As
described in management s assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(i), 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(iii), 1122(d)(4)(iv),
1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii), 1122(d)(4)(xi), and 1122(d)(4)(xii), the Company has engaged certain vendors to perform the activities
required by these servicing criteria. The Company has determined that these vendors are not considered servicers 
as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with
the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06 of the SEC Division
of Corporation Finance s interpretations of the rules adopted under Regulation AB and the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act Interpretation 200.06 ). As permitted by Interpretation 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies
and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects
with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC
requirements to apply Interpretation 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed
no procedures with respect to the Company s determination of its eligibility to use Interpretation 200.06. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and
in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all material respects, and, accordingly, included examining,
on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of selected asset-backed transactions
and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether
the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the applicable servicing
criteria. Our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the
period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred
prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during
the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides, and that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide, a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s
compliance with the servicing criteria.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

Rialto Capital Advisors, LLC: 

We have examined management of Rialto Capital Advisors, LLC s
assertion, included in the accompanying Management s Assertions on Compliance with Applicable Regulation AB Servicing Criteria,
that Rialto Capital Advisors, LLC (the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of
the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the commercial mortgage loan platform (the Platform ),
excluding criteria in Items 1122 (d)(1)(iii), (d)(3)(i.C), (d)(3)(i.D), (d)(3)(ii), (d)(3)(iii), (d)(3)(iv), (d)(4)(v), (d)(4)(ix),
(d)(4)(x), (d)(4)(xi), (d)(4)(xii), (d)(4)(xiii), (d)(4)(xiv), and (d)(4)(xv) (the servicing criteria ), as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2022,which management has determined are not applicable to the activities performed by the Company
with respect to the Platform. Exhibit 1 to management s assertion identifies the individual asset-backed transactions defined
by management as constituting the Platform. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria
and its assertion. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance
with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established
by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about compliance with the servicing criteria is fairly stated,
in all material respects, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance
with the servicing criteria, including tests on a sample basis of the servicing activities related to the Platform, determining
whether the Company performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria during the specified period,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our procedures were limited to selected servicing
activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report and, accordingly, such samples may not have included
servicing activities related to each asset-backed transaction included in the Platform. Further, an examination is not designed
to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to the period specified above that may have affected the
balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that the evidence
we obtained in our examination is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

As described in management s assertion, for servicing
criteria Item 1122(d)(1)(ii), the Company has engaged vendors to perform certain activities required by this servicing criteria.
The Company has determined that these vendors are not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation
AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to these
vendors as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI
200.06 ). As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed
to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria
applicable to these vendors. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI
200.06 for these vendors and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the
Company s determination of its eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 

Our examination does not provide a legal determination
on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 

In our opinion, management s assertion
that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, for the commercial
mortgage loan platform, is fairly stated, in all material respects.

for the U.S. Bank Corporate Trust Asset-Backed Securities Platform (the Platform ), for which the Company provides
trustee, securities administration, registrar, paying agent and document custody services, as of and for the year ended December
31, 2022, except for servicing criteria Items 1122(d)(1)(iii) and 1122(d)(4)(iv)-(xiv), which the Company has determined are not
applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the servicing platform covered by this report. Management is responsible
for the Company s compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s
assertion about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence
about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than all of the individual asset-backed transactions
and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining
whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing
criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company
during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either
prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during

for assessing compliance with Items 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(v), and 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB, there were no servicing
activities performed by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2022 that required these servicing criteria to be complied
with. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

We
are required to be independent of the Company and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant
ethical requirements related to our examination engagement. 

Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria.

our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2022, for the U.S. Bank Corporate Trust Asset-Backed Securities Platform is fairly stated, in all material
respects.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

Deutsche
Bank National Trust Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas 

We
have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management s Assertion of Compliance, that Trust
 Agency Services department of Deutsche Bank National Trust Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (collectively
the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s
Regulation AB for the publicly-issued (i.e., transaction-level reporting required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended) and certain privately-issued (i.e., for which transaction-level reporting is required pursuant to contractual obligation)
residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities and other asset-backed securities issued on or after
January 1, 2006, for which the Company provides trustee, certificate administrator, securities administration, paying agent or
custodian services, as defined in the transaction agreements, excluding publicly-issued securities sponsored or issued by any
government sponsored entity (the Platform ), as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 except for criteria 1122(d)(4)(iv)
 1122(d)(4)(xiv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the
servicing platform covered by this report. Refer to Appendix A of Management s Assertion of Compliance for the asset backed
transactions covered by this platform. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with those servicing criteria.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the servicing
criteria based on our examination. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence
about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than all of the individual asset backed transactions
and securities that comprise the platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities related to the Platform and determining
whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing
criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company
during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either
prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during
the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. Although the Company is responsible
for assessing compliance with criteria 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(iii) and 1122(d)(4)(iii) of Regulation AB,
there were no servicing activities performed by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2022 that required these servicing
criteria to be complied with. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion. 

We
are required to be independent of the Company and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant
ethical requirements related to our examination engagement. 

Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 

In
our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2022 for the platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT

Board
of Directors and Management of 
 Situs
 Holdings, LLC 
 
 We
 have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Assessment of Compliance
 with SEC Regulation AB Servicing Criteria Management s Report ), that Situs Holdings, LLC (the Company ),
 a wholly-owned subsidiary of SitusAMC Holdings Corporation SitusAMC ), complied with servicing criteria
 set forth in Items 1117, 1119, 1122(d)(3)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(vii) of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission s
 Regulation AB for the Operating and/or Trust Advisor Services Platform (the Platform) as of and for the year ended
 December 31, 2022. The Platform consists of the asset- backed transactions and securities for which the Company was named
 as the Operating and/or Trust Advisor as defined by management in Appendix B of Management s Report. Management
 is responsible for the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express
 an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria
 for the Platform based on our examination. 
 
 Our
examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and
in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and, accordingly,
included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria for
the Platform and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing
selected asset-backed transactions and securities constituting the Platform and evaluating whether the Company performed servicing
activities related to those transactions and securities in compliance with the applicable servicing criteria for the period covered
by this report. Accordingly, our testing may not have included servicing activities related to each asset-backed transaction or
security constituting the Platform. Further, our examination was not designed to detect material noncompliance that may have
occurred prior to the period covered by this report and that may have affected the Company s servicing activities during
the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination
does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. 
 
 In
our opinion, management s assertion that Situs Holdings, LLC complied with the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 for the Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.
