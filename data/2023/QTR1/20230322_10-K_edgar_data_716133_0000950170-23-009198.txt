 Item 1. Business 
 Overview and Strategy 
 Cincinnati Bell Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries Cincinnati Bell, we, our, us or the Company provide integrated communications and IT solutions that keep consumer and business customers connected with each other and with the world. The Company operates its businesses through the following segments: Network, previously referred to as Entertainment and Communications, and IT Services and Hardware. The Network segment serves customers in the Greater Cincinnati region through our altafiber brand and services customers in Hawaii through our Hawaiian Telcom brand. The IT Services and Hardware segment services customers in the U.S. and Europe through our CBTS brand and in Canada through our OnX brand. 
 On March 13, 2020, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement with Red Fiber Parent LLC, a Delaware limited liability company Parent ), and RF Merger Sub Inc., an Ohio corporation and directly wholly owned subsidiary of Parent Merger Sub ). On September 7, 2021 (the Closing Date or Merger Date ), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Ohio General Corporation Law (the OGCL ), Merger Sub merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation (the Merger ). At the effective time of the Merger (the Effective Time ), the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub ceased, and the Company survived the Merger as a wholly owned private subsidiary of Parent. 
 Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each of Cincinnati Bell s issued and outstanding Common Shares was converted into the right to receive 15.50 per share in cash, without interest. Trading of the Company s Common Shares was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE and the Common Shares were subsequently delisted from the NYSE. Additionally, the Company redeemed Depositary Shares simultaneously with the redemption of the 6 3 / 4 Preferred Shares, at a redemption price of 50 per Depositary Share (equivalent to 1,000 per 6 3 / 4 Preferred Share), and the Depositary Shares were then delisted from the NYSE. As a result of the Merger Agreement, the Company has ceased to be a registrant (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements); however, due to contractual provisions in certain indentures, the Company is required to voluntarily file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). 
 This Annual Report on Form 10-K provides an overview of Cincinnati Bell Inc.'s financial condition as of December 31, 2022 and our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, the periods January 1, 2021 through September 7, 2021 and September 8, 2021 through December 31, 2021, and the year ended December 31, 2020. References in this Annual Report to Successor refer to the Company on or after September 8, 2021 and references to Predecessor refer to the results prior to September 8, 2021. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. 
 Our results of operations as reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements for these periods are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Although GAAP requires that we report on our results for the period from January 1, 2021 through September 7, 2021 and the period from September 8, 2021 through December 31, 2021 separately, management views the Company s operating results for the year ended December 31, 2021 by combining the results of the applicable Predecessor and Successor periods because such presentation provides the most meaningful comparison of our results to current and prior periods. 
 To enhance the analysis of our operating results for the periods presented, we have included a discussion of selected financial and operating data of the Predecessor and Successor on a combined basis for the year ended December 31, 2021. This presentation consists of the mathematical addition of selected financial and operating data of the Predecessor for the period from January 1, 2021 to September 7, 2021 plus the comparable financial and operating data of the Successor for the period from September 8, 2021 to December 31, 2021. There are no other adjustments made in the combined presentation. The mathematical combination of selected financial and operating data is included below under the heading Combined Year Ended December 31, 2021 and this data is a non-GAAP presentation. Management believes that this selected financial and operating data provides investors with useful information upon which to assess our operating performance because the results of operations for a twelve-month period correspond to how we have reported our results in the past and how we will report our results in the future.

 Cincinnati Bell Inc. 

Through its Network segment, the Company provides high-speed data, video, and voice solutions to consumers and businesses over an expanding fiber network and a legacy copper network. During 2018, the Company acquired Hawaiian Telcom Holdco, Inc. Hawaiian Telcom ), the largest full service provider of communication services on all of Hawaii's major islands. This acquisition added operational scale to our business by adding access to both Honolulu, a well-developed, fiber-rich city on Oahu, as well as the growing neighbor islands. As a result of the acquisition, the Company's combined fiber networks are approximately 20,400 fiber route miles. On May 2, 2022, the Company acquired Agile IWG Holdings, LLC Agile for total cash consideration of 65.5 million. Agile delivers customers, primarily located in Ohio and Pennsylvania, with middle mile, last mile and campus connectivity services through hybrid fiber wireless networks that are designed, built and managed by Agile. 
 Through its IT Services and Hardware segment, business customers across the U.S., Canada and Europe rely on the Company for the sale and service of efficient, end-to-end communications and IT systems and solutions. 
 Our goal is to continue the transformation of Cincinnati Bell from a legacy copper-based telecommunications company into a technology company with state-of-the-art fiber assets servicing customers with data, video, voice and IT solutions to meet their evolving needs. 
 In an effort to achieve our objectives, we continue to focus on the following key initiatives: 
 expand our fiber network; and 

grow our IT Services and Hardware segment. 

Expand our fiber network 
 During 2022, we invested 306.6 million of capital in the Network segment in products that can be categorized as Fioptics, previously referred to as Consumer/SMB Fiber in Hawaii and collectively with Fioptics in Cincinnati. Revenue from these high demand products totaled 527.9 million for 2022, up 54.3 million compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021 partially mitigating the decline in legacy products. The primary focus of these investments is the expansion of high-speed internet products which are designed to compete directly with the cable Multiple System Operators, such as Charter Communications, serving the Company s operating territories. Year-over-year revenue and subscribers for these products are outlined in the table below:

During the year, we passed an additional 73,900 addresses in the Greater Cincinnati area with Fioptics, which included a focus on Fiber to the Premise FTTP addresses as FTTP has become a more relevant solution for our customers. As of December 31, 2022, the Fioptics products are now available to approximately 733,000 customer locations or more than 85 of the Greater Cincinnati operating territory. During 2022, we passed an additional 48,500 addresses in Hawaii. The Fioptics products are now available to approximately 327,800 addresses, or more than 50 of the operating territory in Hawaii, including Oahu and the neighbor islands. 
 In 2022, the Company also invested 40.4 million in Enterprise Fiber products, which includes fiber and IP-based core network technology as well as expenditures for Agile. These investments position the Company to meet increased business and carrier demand within Greater Cincinnati and in the Midwest region. In Hawaii, expenditures are for high-bandwidth data transport products, such as metro-ethernet, including the Southeast Asia to United States SEA-US cable. We continue to evolve and optimize network assets to support the migration of legacy products to new technology, and as of December 31, 2022, the Company has: 
 increased the total number of commercial addresses with fiber-based services (referred to as a lit address) to 36,200 in Greater Cincinnati and 27,300 in Hawaii by connecting approximately 4,700 additional lit addresses in Greater Cincinnati and 4,900 additional lit addresses in Hawaii during 2022; 

expanded the fiber network to span more than 14,600 route miles in Greater Cincinnati and 5,800 route miles in Hawaii; and 

provided cell site back-haul services to approximately 90 of the 1,075 cell sites in the Greater Cincinnati market, all of which are lit with fiber, and approximately 90 of the 1,120 cell sites in Hawaii, nearly all of which are lit with fiber. 

In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company entered into a definitive purchase agreement to acquire inter-island submarine and middle-mile terrestrial fiber infrastructure assets in Hawaii owned by the bankruptcy estate of the Paniolo Cable Company, LLC. The transaction closed in August 2021 for an amount of 52.3 million, inclusive of transaction costs. The Company's expanding fiber assets allow us to support the ever-increasing demand for data, video and internet devices with speed, agility and security. We believe our fiber investments are a long-term solution for our customers' bandwidth needs. 
 Grow our IT Services and Hardware Segment 
 Cincinnati Bell continues to grow the IT Services and Hardware segment by developing new products as well as expanding its reach to new customers. As a result of both organic and inorganic growth, our geographic footprint now extends across the U.S., Canada, Europe and India. We continue to diversify our customer base and expand our product portfolio. The Company continues to develop high-demand products for business customers through our investments in unified communications and cloud services. Our ability to be innovative and to react to the changing technology demands of our customers is important to the growth of our IT Services and Hardware segment. Our offerings under the Infrastructure Solutions practice provide a platform for buyer engagement and an opportunity for connecting the customer to higher value professional and managed services. 
 As a company with a long history of managing customers' network and technology needs, we combine the management of the network, whether owned or leased from other carriers out of territory, with integrated voice and IT offerings. We supply the architecture and integration intelligence, labor and hardware as well as any combination of these services. These projects can be established based on hourly billing rates, service-level driven agreements or utility-based managed service models. Customers are attracted to our ability to combine our historic knowledge, unique assets and talented workforce in order to help them improve their operational efficiency, mitigate risk and reduce costs.

Network 
 
 The Network segment provides products and services such as high-speed internet, data transport, local voice, video and other services. Cincinnati Bell Telephone Company LLC CBT ), a subsidiary of the Company, is the incumbent local exchange carrier ILEC for a geography that covers a radius of approximately 25 miles around Cincinnati, Ohio, and includes parts of northern Kentucky and southeastern Indiana. CBT has operated in this territory for approximately 150 years. In 2022, the Company started their network expansion outside of this territory to provide fiber services to Dayton, Ohio. Voice and data services in the Enterprise Fiber and Legacy categories that are delivered beyond the Company's ILEC territory, particularly in Dayton and Mason, Ohio, are provided through the operations of Cincinnati Bell Extended Territories LLC CBET ), a subsidiary of CBT. Hawaiian Telcom, a subsidiary of the Company, is the ILEC for the State of Hawaii and the largest full service provider of communications services and products in that state. Originally incorporated in Hawaii in 1883 as Mutual Telephone Company, Hawaiian Telcom has a strong heritage of nearly 140 years as Hawaii s communications carrier. Its services are offered on all of Hawaii s major islands, except its video service, which currently is only available on the island of Oahu. On May 2, 2022, the Company acquired Agile, based in Canton, Ohio. Agile leases wireless infrastructure assets to third parties and provides connectivity through hybrid fiber wireless data networks primarily to customers in Ohio and Pennsylvania. The key products and services provided by the Network segment include the following: 
 Data 
 The Company's data products include high-speed internet access, data transport and interconnection services. Consumer demand for increased internet speeds is accelerating, and more customers are opting for higher bandwidth solutions. To address this demand, the Company is focused on building out new FTTP addresses as well as overlaying FTTN addresses, enabling these addresses to receive speeds up to one gigabit per second Gbps ). FTTP addresses now cover nearly 80 of the market in Greater Cincinnati and more than 40 of the market in Hawaii, of which approximately 657,200 and 268,000 addresses are capable of receiving speeds up to one Gbps in Greater Cincinnati and Hawaii, respectively. 
 As business customers migrate from legacy products and copper-based technology, our metro-ethernet product becomes the access method of choice due to its ability to support multiple applications on a single physical connection. We are also expanding our metro-ethernet platform to deliver services across a wider geography to target business customers beyond our ILEC footprint. The Company s regional network connects Greater Cincinnati, Columbus, and Dayton, Ohio, as well as Indianapolis, Indiana, Chicago, Illinois, and Louisville, Kentucky. 
 As a result of the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom, the Company gained access to the SEA-US trans-Pacific submarine cable system connecting Indonesia, the Philippines, Guam, Hawaii and the mainland United States. The system provides an initial 20 Terabytes per second Tbps of capacity using state-of-the-art 100 Gbps technology to accommodate the increase in data consumption. 
 Voice 
 Voice represents local service over both copper and fiber. It also includes consumer long distance, digital trunking, switched access and other value-added services such as caller identification, voicemail, call waiting and call return. 
 The Company's voice access lines over copper continue to decrease as its customers have increasingly employed wireless technologies in lieu of wireline voice services wireless substitution ), migrated to competitors, or migrated to VoIP services provided by the Company and others. 
 Customers purchasing traditional long distance service can choose from a variety of long distance plans, which include unlimited long distance for a flat fee, purchase of minutes at a per-minute-of-use rate, or a fixed number of minutes for a flat fee. The Company's long distance lines and related minutes of use have continued to decline as a result of wireless substitution. 
 Video 
 In the Greater Cincinnati territory, the Company launched Fioptics in 2009 and initially focused our fiber network investment on densely populated areas, such as apartments and condominiums. Since that time, Fioptics has been deployed over a much broader base and is now available to more than 85 of Greater Cincinnati. As of December 31, 2022, we have 123,100 video subscribers in Greater Cincinnati. Our Fioptics customers enjoy access to over 400 entertainment channels, including digital music, local, movie and sports programming with over 150 high-definition channels, parental controls, HD DVR and video On-Demand.

 Infrastructure Solutions 
 The Company maintains premium resale relationships and certifications with a variety of branded technology vendors which allows it to competitively sell, architect and install a wide array of telecommunications and IT infrastructure equipment to meet the needs of its customers. 
 Sales and Distribution Channels 
 The Company s Network segment utilizes a number of distribution channels to acquire customers. As of December 31, 2022, the Company operated seven retail stores in the Greater Cincinnati area and one retail store in Dayton, Ohio to market and distribute our Fioptics suite of products. The Company works to locate retail stores in high traffic but affordable areas, with a distance between each store that considers optimal returns per store and customer convenience. The Company also offers fully-automated, end-to-end web-based sales of various other Company services and accessories for both the Cincinnati operating territory and the Hawaii operating territory. In addition, the Company utilizes a call center, as well as a door-to-door sales force, to target the sale of our consumer products to residents. 
 For both operating segments, we utilize a business-to-business sales force and a call center organization to reach business customers in our operating territories. Larger business customers are supported by sales account representatives and solution architects located in our branch offices across the U.S., Canada and Europe that understand the customer's technology needs and recommend Company-offered solutions. Smaller business customers are supported through a telemarketing sales force, customer representatives and store locations. 
 The IT Services and Hardware segment utilizes an indirect distribution channel to sell services, primarily focused on Communications. Compensation to the distributor is success-based and typically involves a residual payment based on revenue from customers. 
 Suppliers and Product Supply Chain 
 The Company generally subjects purchases to competitive bids and selects its vendors based on price, service level, delivery terms, quality of product and terms and conditions. 
 The Network segment's primary purchases are for video content, network equipment, software, fiber cable and contractors to maintain and support the growth of the fiber network. The Company maintains facilities and operations for storing cable and other equipment, product distribution and customer fulfillment.

The Company purchases some of its programming directly from the program networks by entering into affiliation agreements with the programming suppliers. The Company also benefits from membership with the National Cable Television Cooperative NCTC ), which enables us to take advantage of volume discounts. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 70 of Cincinnati s programming was sourced from the NCTC and approximately 50 of Hawaiian Telcom s programming was sourced from the NCTC. 
 The IT Services and Hardware segment primarily purchases IT and telephony equipment that is either sold to a customer or used to provide service to the customer. The Company is a certified distributor of leading technology and software solutions including, but not limited to, Cisco, Hewlett-Packard, Dell and IBM. Most of this equipment is shipped directly to the customer from vendor locations, but the Company does maintain warehouse facilities for replacement parts and equipment testing and staging. 
 In addition, we have long-term commitments to outsource various services, such as certain information technology functions, cash remittance and accounts payable functions, call center operations and maintenance services. 
 Competition 
 The telecommunications industry is competitive, and the Company competes against larger, well-capitalized national providers. 
 The Network segment faces competition from other local exchange carriers, wireless service providers, inter-exchange carriers, as well as cable, broadband, internet and fixed wireless service providers. The Company has lost, and will likely continue to lose, access lines as a portion of the customer base migrates to competitive wireline or wireless providers in lieu of the Company s services. Wireless providers, particularly those that provide unlimited wireless service plans with no additional fees for long distance, offer customers a substitution service for the Company s local voice and long-distance services. The Company believes wireless substitution and competition is the reason for the largest portion of the Company s access line and long-distance line losses. 
 Our Fioptics and Enterprise Fiber products also face intense competition from cable operators, other telecom companies and niche fiber companies. Many of our competitors have lower operating costs and access to resources that provide economies of scale that allow them to more aggressively price products, as well as provide products on a much broader scale given their expanded geographic operations. Our competitors continuously upgrade their service quality and offerings which could substantially erode the competitive advantage we currently have with our fiber-based products. These competitive factors could limit the Company's ability to grow revenue and cash flows despite the strategic initiatives implemented. 
 
 The Company's video product also faces competition from a number of different sources, including companies that deliver movies, television shows and other video programming over broadband Internet connections. Increasingly, content owners are utilizing Internet-based delivery of content directly to consumers, some without charging a fee for access to the content. 
 Furthermore, due to consumer electronics innovations, consumers are able to watch such Internet-delivered content on television sets and mobile devices. Increased customer migration to these non-traditional entertainment products could result in increased churn and decreased penetration for video; however, this trend could also drive increased demand for our high-speed internet product.

The IT Services and Hardware segment competes against numerous information technology consulting, web-hosting, and computer system integration companies, many of which are larger in scope and well-financed. The Company believes that participants in this market must grow rapidly and achieve significant scale to compete effectively. Other competitors may consolidate with larger companies or acquire software application vendors or technology providers, enabling them to more effectively compete. This consolidation could affect prices and other competitive factors in ways that could impede the ability of these businesses to compete successfully in the market. In addition, as more customers migrate to the public cloud, we expect to see declines in the demand for Infrastructure Solutions. However, this trend could provide an opportunity in Consulting, Communications and Cloud Services as the Company has IT professionals that can assist customers through this migration to the public cloud. 
 Customers 
 The Company had no customers whose revenue comprised greater than 10 of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022, the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Verizon Communications Inc. Verizon comprised 21 and 26 of consolidated accounts receivable, respectively. The accounts receivable with Verizon are significant to the Company, but the associated revenue does not exceed 10 of total revenue as a result of the application of ASC 606 and management s conclusion that for hardware transactions we act as the agent and, as a result, record revenue net of the cost of product. 
 Employees and Human Capital Resources 
 At December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately 5,800 employees. Approximately 22 of its employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Approximately 12 of total employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the Communications Workers of America CWA ), which is affiliated with the AFL-CIO, and approximately 10 of total employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 1357. The collective bargaining agreements with the CWA and IBEW are effective until the second quarter of 2026 and third quarter of 2028, respectively. 
 The Company knows that our people are our most valuable assets and is committed to investing in them and their success. We have developed various programs and practices to support, develop and care for our employees throughout their careers with the Company. 
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion The Company believes in the transformative power of connectivity, and we believe connections are made stronger when we embrace the diversity in our employees. It is our mission to create an environment that celebrates the unique qualities of those around us and empowering all employees to reach their full potential. We are committed to employing diversity and inclusion efforts that align with our values, such as talent development and progressive hiring practices which will help drive increased representation of underrepresented groups across the organization. In addition, we are committed to developing fair systems, procedures and resource distribution to ensure that we create equitable opportunities for all employees. The Company has dedicated staff focused on diversity, equity and inclusion efforts throughout the organization. 
 Professional Development Investing in the development of our people is a core value of the Company. As a result, the Company continually seeks to offer new and innovative ways to provide development opportunities to our employees throughout their careers including, but not limited to, on-demand training for both professional and industry-specific skills through our intranet site, certification programs to encourage employees to develop and enhance skills, technical talent programs to provide technical leadership and define job enrichment opportunities across the organization and leadership development programs to enable employees to grow and progress on the leadership path.

Employee Engagement The Company seeks to create and communicate engagement opportunities for all employees for increased development and retention through surveys, periodic town hall meetings with leadership and other forms of direct employee feedback. In addition, the Company sponsors several resource groups which we believe are the cornerstone for personal and professional enrichment and are also integral to the exploration of diversity and inclusion in our workplace. Employees are encouraged to partner with the Company to pursue areas of passion including community outreach activities and volunteer programs. 
 Safety The Company is focused on establishing safety as a core value among employees with the primary goal that every employee returns home safely at the end of the day. This applies not only to our field technicians and warehouse personnel but also to our employees working in an office environment. As a result, the Company has hired additional staff to increase safety training, observations and assist in building our overall safety culture. 
 Compensation and Benefits The Company is committed to rewarding and supporting our employees, and therefore, we offer a comprehensive compensation program that includes market-competitive pay, healthcare benefits, a retirement savings plan, tuition reimbursement programs, and paid time off and family leave. 
 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees as well as the communities in which we operate. These include having the vast majority of our employees work from home starting in March 2020 and continuing to offer employees the option of a hybrid work environment.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 In addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating us. Our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations could be materially affected by any of these risks. 
 Risks Related to Our Business, Operations and Industry 
 
 Volatile geopolitical turmoil, including popular uprisings, regional conflicts, terrorism and war could result in market instability, which could negatively impact our business results. 
 The Company primarily provides our services in the United States of America and Canada, but certain outsourced operations are located in Taiwan and India as well as to a lesser extent in other countries located in Europe and Asia. Additionally, vendors that the Company sources from are global in nature. Recent escalation in regional conflicts, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which resulted in economic sanctions, and the risk of increased tensions between China and Taiwan, could limit the Company s ability to source goods and services and could result in closure of our vendors' facilities in sanctioned countries. In addition, international conflict has resulted in: increased pressure on the supply chain, which has led to increased energy costs, and could result in further increased energy costs, which could continue to increase utility expense and transportation costs; inflation, which could result in increases in the cost to provide services, increased capital spend for the continued expansion of the network, decreased customer purchasing power, and increased price pressure; increased risk of cybersecurity attacks; and market instability, which could adversely impact financial results. 
 Global health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have had an impact on the Company s supply chain and could have a material impact on our customers and our vendors, which could adversely impact our business results and financial condition. 
 The continued evolution of COVID-19 and its variants, as well as periodic spikes in infection rates, local outbreaks in the geographies in which the Company operates or third-party providers or vendor sites are located, even with safety measures and vaccination requirements in place, could cause additional disruptions to Company operations or those of our providers or vendors. In 2020 and 2021, the Company experienced disruptions with certain of our third-party vendors, including those who provide many of our information technology, call center functions, and certain accounting functions. In 2022, disruptions experienced by Company were limited in nature and considered to have a nominal impact on operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to global supply chain challenges, which have adversely impacted our ability to procure certain inventory and, if such inventory procurement challenges continue, could impact our ability to execute the capital build plan for our fiber network and thereby cause delays in delivery of our services and solutions to our customers in both of our operating segments. The Company has also experienced increased labor and material costs with certain third-party providers that are contracted to support and perform activities associated with the build-out of our fiber network resulting in a negative impact to business results and operations. As new variants of the virus appear, especially variants that are more easily spread, cause more serious outcomes, or are resistant to existing vaccines, new health orders and safety protocols could further impact operations. These factors could materially increase our costs, negatively impact our consumer and business sales and damage the Company s financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity position, possibly to a significant degree. 
 Our commitment to Net Zero emissions in company operations by 2040 will be subject to significant costs and regulations which could impact our business operations, processes, and reputation. 
 In October 2022, the Company disclosed its commitment to achieving net zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by December 31, 2040 with an interim target by December 31, 2030. The Company plans to meet this commitment by reducing energy consumption through network, facility and fleet efficiency and conservation measures; investments in renewable energy; and adoption of electric vehicles in our fleet. In addition, the Company will inventory and screen its Scope 3 emissions to determine reduction and engagement targets across the most relevant, impactful categories beginning in 2023. 
 Our work on a comprehensive climate action plan to achieve a 40 emission reduction by 2030 is ongoing, and overall cost and operation implications are unknown at this time. The achievement of our targets may require significant operational expense and capital improvements. Additionally, the achievement of our climate action plan involves requiring customers to migrate to our fiber optic network and away from our legacy copper network, which runs a risk of customer dissatisfaction and potentially adversely impacting our revenue and profitability.

If we are unable to sufficiently reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions through energy reduction measures and investments in renewable energy, we may fail to achieve our net zero emission commitments by December 31, 2030 and December 31, 2040. Failing to achieve the Company s net zero or science-based targets commitments could result in investor, customer or public dissatisfaction and damage to our reputation. 
 The Company operates in highly competitive industries, and customers may not continue to purchase products or services, which would result in reduced revenue and loss of market share. 
 The telecommunications industry is very competitive, and the Company competes against larger, well-capitalized national providers. Competitors may reduce pricing, create new bundled offerings, or develop new technologies, products or services that they can offer in expanded geographic regions. Our competitors are expected to continuously upgrade their service quality and offerings. If the Company cannot continue to offer reliable, competitively priced, value-added services, or if the Company does not keep pace with technological advances and upgrades, competitive forces could adversely affect it through a loss of market share or a decrease in revenue and profit margins. 
 The Network segment faces competition from other local exchange carriers, wireless service providers, inter-exchange carriers, cable, broadband and internet service providers, other telecom companies, niche fiber companies and companies that deliver movies, television shows and other video programming over broadband Internet connections. Wireless providers, particularly those that provide unlimited wireless voice and data plans with no additional fees for long distance, offer customers a substitution for the Company s services. The Company believes wireless substitution accounts for the largest portion of its access line losses. Also, cable competitors that have existing service relationships with the Company's customers in the Network segment offer substitution services, such as VoIP and long distance voice services in the Company's operating areas. As a result of wireless substitution and increased competition, legacy voice lines decreased by 13 and 11 in Cincinnati and Hawaii, respectively, in 2022 compared to 2021. 
 In addition, our strategic products, particularly our fiber-based products, face competition from a number of different sources including cable operators, other telecom companies, niche fiber companies, and companies that deliver movies, television shows and other video programming over broadband Internet connections. Increasingly, content owners are utilizing Internet-based delivery of content directly to consumers, some without charging a fee for access to the content. Furthermore, due to consumer electronics innovations, consumers are able to watch such Internet-delivered content on television sets and mobile devices. Increased customer migration to these non-traditional entertainment products could result in increased churn and decreased penetration in our Consumer/SMB Fiber products. If the Company is unable to effectively implement strategies to attract and retain video and high-speed internet subscribers, retain access lines and long distance subscribers, or replace such customers with other sources of revenue, the Company's Network segment will be adversely affected. 
 The IT Services and Hardware segment competes against numerous other information technology consulting, web-hosting, and computer system integration companies, many of which are large in scope and well-financed. Other competitors may consolidate with larger companies or acquire software application vendors or technology providers, which may provide competitive advantages. The Company believes that many of the participants in this market must grow rapidly and achieve significant scale to compete effectively. This consolidation could affect prices and other competitive factors in ways that could impede our ability to compete successfully in the market. The competitive forces described above could adversely affect the Company s IT Services and Hardware segment and have a material adverse impact on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The Company may be unable to grow its revenues and cash flows despite the initiatives it has implemented. 
 We must produce adequate revenues and cash flows that, when combined with cash on hand and funds available under our revolving credit facilities, will be sufficient to service our debt, fund our capital expenditures, and fund our pension and other employee benefit obligations. We have identified some potential areas of opportunity and implemented several growth initiatives. We cannot be assured that these opportunities will be successful or that these initiatives will improve our financial position or our results of operations. The outbreak of COVID-19 has, and may continue to, negatively impact these opportunities and require us to incur additional related costs such as overtime wages for employees that are working additional hours to offset employees that are following quarantine protocol for field technicians and customer facing employees. 
 If the Company s goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets or long-lived assets become impaired, the Company may be required to record significant charges to earnings. 
 The Company has a substantial amount of goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets on its balance sheet. The Company reviews goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The impairment evaluation requires significant judgment and estimates by management, and unfavorable changes in these assumptions or other factors could result in future impairment charges and have a significant adverse impact on the Company s reported earnings. Such factors include operating performance of the business, the execution of the Company s network build plan, growth of consumer and business activations, higher than anticipated churn, changes in customer behavior post-pandemic, ability of the infrastructure practice to obtain product on a timely basis, changes in discount rates, or other key business initiatives. Additionally, the value of comparable companies may also impact the fair value of our reporting units, which could result in a write-down of goodwill and reduction to net income. 
 For further information on Cincinnati Bell s evaluation of impairment for goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets, see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates under Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 Failure to anticipate the need to introduce new products and services or to compete with new technologies may compromise the Company s success in our industries. 
 The Company s success depends, in part, on being able to anticipate the needs of current and future business, carrier and consumer customers. The Company seeks to meet these needs through new product introductions, service quality and technological improvements. New products and services are important to the Company s success because our industry is technologically driven, such that new technologies can offer alternatives to the Company s existing services. If our new products and services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace, or if costs associated with the implementation and introduction of these new products and services materially increase, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company s revenue, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 The Company s access lines, which generate a significant portion of its cash flows and profits, are decreasing in number. If the Company continues to experience access line losses similar to the past several years, its revenues, earnings and cash flows from operations may be adversely impacted. 
 The Company generates a substantial portion of its revenues by delivering voice and data services over access lines. The Company's local telecommunications subsidiaries have experienced substantial access line losses over the past several years due to a number of factors, including wireless and broadband substitution and increased competition. The Company expects access line losses to continue into the foreseeable future. Failure to retain access lines without replacing such losses with an alternative source of revenue would adversely impact the Company's revenues, earnings and cash flow from operations. 
 The Company has provided alternative sources of revenue by way of its strategic products; however, these products may generate lower profit margins than its traditional services. In addition, as a larger portion of our customer base has already migrated to these new product offerings, a decreased growth rate of strategic products can be expected. Moreover, we cannot provide assurance that the revenues generated from our new offerings will mitigate revenue losses from the reduced sales of our legacy products or that our new strategic offerings will be as successful as anticipated.

Negotiations with the providers of content for our video programming may not be successful, potentially resulting in our inability to carry certain programming channels, which could result in the loss of subscribers. In addition, due to the influence of some content providers, we may be forced to pay higher rates for some content resulting in increased costs. 
 We must negotiate with the content owners of the programming that we carry. These content owners are the exclusive provider of the channels they offer. If we are unable to reach a mutually-agreed upon contract with a content owner, our existing agreements to carry this content may not be renewed, resulting in the blackout of these channels. The loss of content could result in our loss of customers who place a high value on the particular content that is lost. In addition, many content providers own multiple channels. As a result, we typically have to negotiate the pricing for multiple channels rather than one, and carry and pay for content with which customers do not associate much value, in order to have access to other content with which customers do associate value. Some of our competitors have materially larger scale than we do and may, as a result, be better positioned than we are in such negotiations. As a result of these factors, the expense of content may continue to increase and have a material adverse impact on the Company s results of operations and cash flows. 
 Maintaining the Company's telecommunications networks requires significant capital expenditures, and the Company's inability or failure to maintain its telecommunications networks could have a material impact on the Company s market share and ability to generate revenue. 
 Over the past several years, the Company has improved its wireline network through increased capital expenditures for fiber optic cable in areas of its operating network. The Company intends to continue its capital expenditures for fiber optic cable. 
 In order to provide appropriate levels of service to the Company's customers, the network infrastructure must be protected against damage from human error, natural disasters, unexpected equipment failure, power loss or telecommunications failures, terrorism, sabotage or other intentional acts of vandalism. The Company's networks may not address all of the problems that may be encountered in the event of a disaster or other unanticipated problems, which may result in disruption of service to customers. 
 The Company may also incur significant additional capital expenditures as a result of unanticipated developments, regulatory changes and other events that impact the business. 
 The Company's failure to meet performance standards under its agreements could result in customers terminating their relationships with the Company or customers being entitled to receive financial compensation, leading to reduced revenues and/or increased costs. 
 The Company s agreements with its customers contain various requirements regarding performance and levels of service. If the Company fails to provide the levels of service or performance required by its agreements, customers may be able to receive financial compensation or may be able to terminate their relationship with the Company. In order to provide these levels of service, the Company is required to protect against human error, natural disasters, equipment failure, power failure, sabotage and vandalism, and have disaster recovery plans available in the event of disruption of service. The failure to address these or other events may result in a disruption of service. In addition, any inability to meet service level commitments or other performance standards could reduce the confidence of customers. Decreased customer confidence could impair the Company s ability to attract and retain customers, which could adversely affect the Company s ability to generate revenues and operating results. 
 The Company generates a substantial portion of revenue by serving a limited geographic area. 
 
 The Company generates a substantial portion of revenue by serving customers in Cincinnati, Ohio, Dayton, Ohio and the islands of Hawaii. An economic downturn or natural disaster occurring in any of these limited operating territories would have a disproportionate effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows compared to similar companies of a national scope and similar companies operating in different geographic areas. Furthermore, because of Hawaii s geographic isolation, the successful operation and growth of the business in Hawaii is dependent on favorable economic and regulatory conditions in the state. 
 The customer base for telecommunications services in Hawaii is small and geographically concentrated. The population of Hawaii is approximately 1.4 million, approximately 70 of whom live on the island of Oahu. Any adverse economic conditions affecting Oahu, or Hawaii generally, could materially impair our ability to operate our business. Labor shortages or increased labor costs in Hawaii could also have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, we may be subject to increased costs for goods and services that we are unable to control or defray as a result of operating in this limited territory. Increased expenses including, but not limited to, energy and health care have adversely impacted operations due to rising costs and could continue to have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations if these costs continue to rise.

One large customer accounts for a significant portion of the Company s accounts receivable. The loss or significant reduction in business from this customer would cause operating results to decline and could negatively impact profitability and cash flows. 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Verizon Communications Inc. Verizon comprised 21 and 26 of consolidated accounts receivable, respectively. As a result of these concentrations, the Company's results of operations and financial condition could be materially affected if the Company lost this customer or if products and services purchased were significantly reduced. In addition, if Verizon were to default on its accounts receivable obligations, the Company would be exposed to potentially significant losses in excess of the provisions established. This would also negatively impact the available borrowing capacity under the Company's accounts receivable securitization facility Receivables Facility ). 
 Increases in broadband usage may cause network capacity limitations resulting in service disruptions or reduced capacity for customers. 
 Video streaming services and peer-to-peer file sharing applications use significantly more bandwidth than traditional internet activity, such as web browsing and email. As utilization rates and availability of these services continue to grow, our high-speed internet customers may use much more bandwidth than in the past. If this continues to occur and our existing network capacity becomes unable to handle the increased demand, we could be required to make significant capital expenditures to increase network capacity in order to avoid service disruptions or reduced capacity for customers. We may not be able to recover the costs of the necessary network investments. This could result in an adverse impact to our results of operations and financial condition.

An IT and/or network security breach or cyber-attack may lead to unauthorized use or disabling of our network, theft of customer data or other sensitive data, unauthorized use or publication of our confidential business information and could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 Cyber-attacks and other breaches of network or information technology security could have an adverse effect on our business. Our business relies on the integrity and availability of our technology infrastructure and systems and the processes that deliver services to our customers and business partners. The security of data we create or collect is also important to our customers, business partners and stakeholders. 
 We have a comprehensive security program in place designed to mitigate risks to our business from: 
 Physical and personnel security threats; 

Data breaches involving customer, employee and other confidential data; 

Malware, including ransomware; 

Denial of service threats; 

Unauthorized changes to technology systems and data; 

Fraud; 

Hacking, including nation-state sponsored attacks on critical infrastructure; 

Unauthorized or unintentional actions by third parties; 

Compliance failures; 

Disasters and business continuity events; and 

Misuse of our systems, products and services. 

Although we take proactive and reasonable steps to address these risks, including the use of insurance, we understand that physical and cyber security incidents are possible and could have a material effect to our businesses. Costs associated with a major security incident could include material retention incentives offered to existing customers or business partners, lost revenues from business interruption, litigation and damage to our reputation, fines from regulatory authorities, and increased expenditures for technology, security measures, and incident response. These costs or any prolonged disruption to our business operations could result in a material adverse effect on our results and financial condition. To date, we have not experienced any material security incident and continue to evaluate security risks to our businesses. We proactively review our security posture and adopt new control measures that address current and future physical and cyber security threats. 
 
 Cyber-attacks or security breaches at third parties providing critical services or with access to or possession of sensitive data could also adversely impact business operations or result in regulatory actions, loss of customers, legal fees or increased costs, associated with incident response beyond current insurance limits. Cyber-attacks of technology that is used in the organization s supply-chain to provide network and IT services or that are resold to customers could also have the same adverse impacts. 
 
 Weather conditions, natural disasters, terrorist acts or acts of war could cause damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations. 
 Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, power outages, terrorist attacks, and other political instability, such as the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine and events beyond our control. Such events could cause significant damage to our infrastructure resulting in degradation or disruption of service to our customers. The potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. These events could also damage the infrastructure of suppliers that provide us with the equipment and services we need to operate our business and provide products to our customers. A natural disaster or other event causing significant physical damage could cause us to experience substantial losses resulting in significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations as well as lost revenues from business interruption as well as damage to our reputation.

In particular, from time to time, the islands of Hawaii experience severe weather conditions such as high winds and heavy rainfall and natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunami, which can overwhelm our employees, disrupt our services and severely damage our property. Such disruptions in service and damage to property could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Moreover, it is impossible to predict the extent to which climate change could cause extreme weather conditions to become more frequent or more extreme. 
 The Company depends on a number of third-party providers and the loss of or problems with one or more of these providers may impede the Company s growth, cause it to lose customers or materially and adversely impact its business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 
 The Company depends on third-party providers to supply products and services. For example, many of the Company s information technology, call center functions and certain accounting functions are performed by third-party providers, and network equipment is purchased from and maintained by vendors, some of which providers and vendors are located outside of the United States. Additionally, certain installation services sold by our IT Services and Hardware segment are performed by third-party providers. 
 
 Events that adversely impact our third-party providers could impair our ability to obtain adequate and timely services or supplies. Such events include, among others, difficulties or problems associated with our third party providers business, the financial instability and labor problems of third party providers, natural or man-made disasters, inclement weather conditions, war, acts of terrorism and other political instability, such as the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, economic conditions, shipment issues, and increased production costs. Our third-party providers may be forced to reduce their production, shut down their operations or file for bankruptcy. The occurrence of one or more of these events could impact our ability to get necessary inventory to build the fiber network, result in disruptions to our operations, increase our costs and decrease our profitability. 
 
 As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on our suppliers around the world, we have experienced shortages of certain inventory and capital assets, price increases and delays to the delivery of materials that have adversely impacted the Company s financial condition and operations. The ultimate impact of these adverse events is unknown as of the date of this filing and will be determined based on the duration of these shortages of certain inventory items and the ability of third parties to meet the demand. Additionally, we could be materially adversely impacted, including from any disruption to critical vendor services or losses of business, if any of our suppliers face significant business disruptions as a result of COVID-19 and its variants, or any similar outbreak. 
 
 A failure of back-office information technology systems could adversely affect the Company s results of operations and financial condition. 
 The efficient operation of the Company s business depends on back-office information technology systems. The Company relies on back-office information technology systems to effectively manage customer billing, business data, communications, supply chain, order entry and fulfillment and other business processes. A failure of the Company s information technology systems to perform as anticipated could disrupt the Company s business and result in a failure to collect accounts receivable, transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers, causing the Company s reputation and results of operations to suffer. In addition, information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond the Company s control, including fire, natural disasters, systems failures, security breaches and viruses. Any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business. 
 We may be liable for the material that content providers distribute over our networks. 
 The law relating to the liability of private network operators for information carried on, stored or disseminated through their networks is still unsettled. As such, we could be exposed to legal claims relating to content disseminated on our networks. Claims could challenge the accuracy of materials on our network or could involve matters such as defamation, invasion of privacy or copyright infringement. If we need to take costly measures to reduce our exposure to these risks or are required to defend ourselves against such claims, our financial results would be negatively affected.

Our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel could disrupt our business and affect the Company's ability to meet key financial and business objects. 
 
 Our future success depends partly on the continued service of the Company s key engineering, sales, marketing, IT, executive and administrative personnel. We believe our pay levels are competitive within the regions in which we operate. However, labor shortages, inflationary pressure on wages, and increased attrition have intensified competition for talent in most fields across the geographic areas in which we operate, and it may become more difficult to retain key employees. If we fail to retain key personnel and are unable to hire highly qualified replacements, we may not be able to meet key objectives, such as meeting financial goals and maintaining or expanding the business. 
 
 If the Company fails to extend or renegotiate its collective bargaining agreements with its labor unions when they expire, or if the Company s unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, the Company s business and operating results could be materially harmed. 
 The Company is a party to collective bargaining agreements with its labor unions in both the Cincinnati and Hawaii operating territories, which represent approximately 22 of the Company s employees. No assurance can be given that the Company will be able to successfully extend or renegotiate its collective bargaining agreements in the future. If the Company fails to extend or renegotiate its collective bargaining agreements, if disputes with its union arise, or if its unionized workers engage in a strike or a work stoppage, the Company could experience a significant disruption of operations or incur higher ongoing labor costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business. The collective bargaining agreements with the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1357 are effective until the second quarter of 2026 and third quarter of 2028, respectively.

Risks Related to Our Indebtedness 
 The Company s debt could limit its ability to fund operations, raise additional capital, and fulfill its obligations, which, in turn, would have a material adverse effect on the Company s businesses and prospects generally. 
 In connection with the Merger, in September 2021, the Company entered into a new Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement and terminated the Company s existing corporate credit agreement. The Credit Agreement was subsequently amended in November 2021 and provides for (i) a five-year 400 million senior secured revolving credit facility including both a letter of credit subfacility of up to 40 million and a swingline loan subfacility of up to 10 million (the Revolving Credit Facility ), (ii) a seven-year 500 million senior secured term loan facility (the Term B-1 Loans ), and (iii) a seven-year 650 million senior secured term loan facility (the Term B-2 Loans and together with the Term B-1 Loans, the Term Loans ). The Revolving Credit Facility matures in September 2026, and the Term Loans mature in November 2028. Borrowings under the Term Loans were used in part to refinance existing Company indebtedness and for working capital and general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2022, there were 223.0 million outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, leaving 177.0 million available. 
 The Company s debt has important consequences, including the following: 
 the Company is required to use a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, and other general corporate requirements; 

there is a variable interest rate on a portion of its debt which will increase if the market interest rates increase; 

the Company s debt increases its vulnerability to adverse changes in the credit markets, which adverse changes could increase the Company's borrowing costs and limit the availability of financing; 

the Company s debt service obligations limit its flexibility to plan for or react to changes in its business and the industries in which it operates; 

the Company s level of debt and shareowners deficit may restrict it from raising additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, and other general corporate requirements; and 

the Company s debt instruments contain limitations on the Company and require the Company to comply with specified financial ratios and other restrictive covenants. Failure to comply with these covenants, if not cured or waived, could limit availability to the cash required to fund the Company's operations and general obligations and could result in the Company s dissolution, bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization.

The Company s Credit Agreement and other indebtedness impose significant restrictions on the Company. 
 The Company s debt instruments impose, and the terms of any future debt may impose, operating and other restrictions on the Company. These restrictions affect, and in many respects limit or prohibit, among other things, the Company s ability to: 
 incur additional indebtedness; 

create liens; 

make investments; 

enter into transactions with affiliates; 

sell assets; 

guarantee indebtedness; 

declare or pay dividends or make other distributions to shareholders; 

repurchase equity interests; 

enter into agreements that restrict dividends or other payments from subsidiaries; 

issue or sell capital stock of certain of our subsidiaries; 

consolidate, merge, or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis; and 

change our fiscal year. 

The Credit Agreement also requires the Company to achieve and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. 
 The restrictions contained in the terms of the Credit Agreement and our other debt instruments could: 
 limit the Company s ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet capital needs or otherwise restrict the Company s activities or business plans; and 

adversely affect the Company s ability to finance our operations, strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances, other capital needs, or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest. 

A breach of any of the debt's restrictive covenants or the Company s inability to comply with the required financial ratios would result in a default under some or all of the debt agreements. During the occurrence and continuance of a default, the lenders may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. Additionally, under the Credit Agreement, the lenders may elect not to provide loans under the Revolving Credit Facility until such default is cured or waived. The Company s debt instruments also contain cross-acceleration provisions, which generally cause each instrument to be subject to early repayment of outstanding principal and related interest upon a qualifying acceleration of any other debt instrument, subject to certain materiality thresholds. Failure to comply with these covenants, if not cured or waived, would limit the cash available to the Company required to fund operations and our general obligations and could result in the Company s dissolution, bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization. 
 
 The Company depends on its revolving credit facility and receivables facility to provide for its short-term financing requirements in excess of amounts generated by operations, and the availability of those funds may be reduced or limited. 
 The Company depends on the Revolving Credit Facility and its Receivables Facility to provide for short-term financing requirements in excess of amounts generated by operations. The Revolving Credit Facility has a maturity date of September 2026. At December 31, 2022, the Receivables Facility had a termination date of June 2024 and was subject to renewal every 364 days, with the next renewal occurring in June 2023. On January 31, 2023, the Company executed amendments to the Receivables Facility which, among other things, extended the renewal date to January 2025 and the termination date to January 2026. See Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further details regarding amendments to the Receivables Facility.

The Company's ability to borrow under its Revolving Credit Facility is subject to the Company's compliance with covenants, including covenants requiring compliance with specified financial ratios. Failure to satisfy these covenants would constrain or prohibit our ability to borrow under these facilities. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 223.0 million outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, leaving 177.0 million in additional borrowing availability under this facility. The 177.0 million available under the Revolving Credit Facility is funded by various financial institutions. If one or more of these banks is not able to fulfill its funding obligations, the Company s financial condition could be adversely affected. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company had a total borrowing capacity of 215.0 million on a maximum borrowing capacity of 215.0 million on our Receivables Facility. At that date, there were 186.9 million of outstanding borrowings and 19.3 million of outstanding letters of credit. The available borrowing capacity is calculated monthly based on the amount and quality of outstanding accounts receivable and thus may be lower than the maximum borrowing limit. If the quality of the Company s accounts receivables deteriorates, this will negatively impact the available capacity under this facility. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 8.8 million of borrowing capacity remaining under its Receivables Facility. 
 The servicing of the Company s indebtedness is dependent on its ability to generate cash, which could be impacted by many factors beyond the Company s control. 
 
 The Company s ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors, many of which are beyond its control. The Company cannot provide assurance that its business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, that additional sources of debt financing will be available or that future borrowings will be available under its Revolving Credit Facility or Receivables Facility, in each case, in amounts sufficient to enable the Company to service its indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. If the Company cannot service its indebtedness, the Company will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing indebtedness or seeking additional equity capital, which may adversely affect its shareholders, debt holders and customers. The Company may not be able to negotiate remedies on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict the Company from adopting any of these alternatives. The Company s inability to generate the necessary cash flows could result in its dissolution, bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization.

Risks Related to Our Financial Condition 
 
 The Company may need additional financing in the future to meet our capital needs or to make opportunistic acquisitions, and such financing may not be available on terms favorable to the Company, if at all. 
 
 The Company may need to seek additional financing to support the build out of the Company s fiber network in out of territory markets. For example, the Company may need to increase its capital spend or need funds to make acquisitions. The Company may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on favorable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, the Company may be unable to fund fiber expansion in out of territory markets. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt, we may be subject to further limitations on our operations in addition to increased interest payments that could negatively impact our cash flow. 
 Growing inflation, supply chain disruption and other increased operating costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Global demand inflation, supply chain disruptions, interest rate increases, civil unrest, tariffs and government regulations, which are beyond our control, could adversely affect operating costs and administrative expenses such as wages, benefits, supplies and inventory costs, insurance costs and costs of borrowing. Any such increase could impact results of operations and cash flows if we do not choose, or are unable, to pass the increased costs to our customers. 
 
 We rely on a limited number of suppliers for capital purchases needed to construct the fiber network, the hardware resale business and certain other supplies we use in our operations. Our ability to secure such equipment and supplies from alternative sources as needed may be time-consuming or expensive or may cause a temporary disruption in our supply chain. In 2021, we anticipated intermittent shortages of certain supplies from our standard vendors and, accordingly, we enhanced our sourcing procedures to identify alternative suppliers and bought in excess in order to avoid any actual shortages, albeit sometimes at additional cost. Increasingly during 2021, the delivery times were extended on certain inventory items utilized by the Network business and the hardware resale business but, through alternative sourcing, we avoided any significant disruptions. Disruptions were not incurred in 2022 as delivery times and sourcing issues started to normalize. Shortages or interruptions in the supply chain could continue to occur for reasons within or beyond the control of us and the supplier. Decreased fuel supplies resulted in significant increases to fuel prices, most notably in Hawaii, which adversely impacted our transportation costs for the field technicians and third parties who are assisting us with the network build in addition to the utilities spend in Hawaii where oil is relied on to produce electricity for the state. Increased fuel costs have adversely affected the profit margins in 2022 and are expected to continue to adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 The uncertain economic environment, including uncertainty in the U.S. and world securities markets, could impact the Company's business and financial condition. 
 The uncertain economic environment could have an adverse effect on the Company s business and financial liquidity. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an economic downturn, including difficulty to hire and retain staff and a decrease in consumer and commercial activity that may continue for an extended period of time. The current conflict between Russia and Ukraine has created additional uncertainty in the economic environment and world securities markets. The Company s primary source of cash is customer collections. As a result of current adverse economic conditions, some customers have cancelled or requested discounts on future contracted services or have had difficulty paying their accounts receivable. Additional customers may cancel or request discounts on future contracted services or have difficulty paying their accounts receivable, especially if economic conditions worsen. Some competitors have lowered prices or offered promotions as a result of economic conditions, and others may do so as well, which has exerted, and could further exert, pricing pressure on the Company. If the economies of the U.S. and the world continue to deteriorate, this could have an adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Adverse changes in the value of assets or obligations associated with the Company s employee benefit plans could negatively impact shareowners equity and liquidity. 
 The Company sponsors noncontributory defined benefit pension plans for eligible management employees, non-management employees and certain former executives. The Company also provides healthcare and group life insurance benefits for eligible retirees. The Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets indirectly reflect the value of all plan assets and benefit obligations under these plans. The accounting for employee benefit plans is complex as is the process of calculating the benefit obligations under the plans. Adverse changes in interest rates or market conditions, among other assumptions and factors, could cause a significant increase in the Company s benefit obligations or a significant decrease of the asset values, without necessarily impacting the Company s net income. In addition, the Company s benefit obligations could increase significantly if it needs to unfavorably revise the assumptions used to calculate the obligations. These adverse changes could have a significant negative impact on the Company s shareowners equity. Additionally, the Company s postretirement costs are adversely affected by increases in medical and prescription drug costs. Further, if there are adverse changes to plan assets or if medical and prescription drug costs increase significantly, the Company could be required to contribute additional material amounts of cash to the plans or to accelerate the timing of required payments. 
 Intellectual Property, Tax, Regulatory, and Litigation Risks 
 The Company s future cash flows could be adversely affected if it is unable to fully realize its deferred tax assets. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company had deferred tax assets of 322.1 million, which are primarily composed of deferred tax assets associated with U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of 203.6 million, and state and local net operating loss carryforwards of 24.0 million. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets related to certain state and local net operating losses and other deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of the Company s ability to utilize the assets within the statutory expiration period. The use of the Company s deferred tax assets enables it to satisfy current and significant future tax liabilities without the use of the Company s cash resources. As a result of the Merger, the Company s net operating losses face potential limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 and similar state provisions. If the Company is unable for any reason to generate sufficient taxable income to fully realize its deferred tax assets, including its net operating losses, the Company s net income, equity and future cash flows would be adversely affected.

Changes in tax laws and regulations, and actions by federal, state and local taxing authorities related to the interpretation and application of such tax laws and regulations, could have a negative impact on the Company's financial results and cash flows. 
 The Company calculates, collects and remits various federal, state, and local taxes, surcharges, and regulatory fees to numerous federal, state and local governmental authorities, including but not limited to federal Universal Service Fund contributions, sales tax, regulatory fees and use tax on purchases of goods and services used in our business. Tax laws are subject to change, and new interpretations of how various statutes and regulations should be adhered to are frequently issued. In many cases, the application of tax laws are uncertain and subject to differing interpretations, especially when evaluated against the Company s new and evolving technologies and services. In the event that we have incorrectly calculated, assessed, or remitted amounts due to governmental authorities, or if revenue and taxing authorities disagree with positions we have taken, we could be subject to additional taxes, fines, penalties, or other adverse actions. In the event that federal, state, or local municipalities were to significantly increase taxes on goods and services used to construct and maintain our network, operations, or provision of services, or seek to impose new taxes, there could be a material adverse impact on financial results. 
 The regulation of the Company s businesses by federal and state authorities may, among other things, place the Company at a competitive disadvantage, restrict our ability to price our products and services competitively, participate in new regulatory programs and threaten our operating licenses. 
 Several of the Company s subsidiaries are subject to regulatory oversight of varying degrees at both the state and federal levels, which may differ from the regulatory scrutiny faced by the Company s competitors. A significant portion of the Company s revenue is derived from pricing plans that are subject to regulatory review and approval. These regulated pricing plans limit the rates the Company can charge for some services while the competition has typically been able to set rates for services with limited or no restriction. In the future, regulatory initiatives that would put the Company at a competitive disadvantage or mandate lower rates for our services would result in lower profitability and cash flows for the Company. In addition, different regulatory interpretations of existing regulations or guidelines may affect the Company s revenues and expenses in future periods. 
 At the federal level, the Company s telecommunications services are subject to the Communications Act of 1934 as amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, including rules adopted by the Federal Communications Commission FCC ). In addition, certain aspects of the Company s communications facilities and operations are subject to oversight by the Department of Justice and the Department of Defense relative to assessing and mitigating national security risks. Violations of the terms of the agreements with these agencies could result in the revocation of the Company s FCC licenses which would affect its business operations in the future. The Company s submarine cable facilities and operations are also subject to requirements imposed by the national security and law enforcement agencies e.g. , the Departments of Justice, Defense and Homeland Security). At the state level, Cincinnati Bell Telephone Company LLC CBT operates as the incumbent local exchange carrier ILEC and carrier of last resort in portions of Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana, while Hawaiian Telcom, Inc. HTI serves as the ILEC and carrier of last resort in Hawaii. As the ILEC in those states, these entities are subject to regulation by the Public Utilities Commissions in those states. Various regulatory decisions or initiatives at the federal or state level may from time to time have a negative impact on CBT s and HTI s ability to compete in their respective markets. In addition, although less heavily regulated than the Company s ILEC operations, other subsidiaries are authorized to provide competitive local exchange service, long distance, and cable television service in various states, and consequently are also subject to various state and federal telecommunications and cable regulations that could adversely impact their operations.

There are currently many regulatory actions under way and being contemplated by federal and state authorities regarding issues, including national security and law enforcement matters, that could result in significant changes to the business conditions in the telecommunications industry. On April 4, 2020, President Trump issued Executive Order No. 13913 Establishing the Committee for the Assessment of Foreign Participation in the United States Telecommunications Services Sector (the Committee ), which formalized the ad-hoc foreign investment review process (formerly referred to as Team Telecom applicable to FCC licenses and transactions. The Executive Order empowers the Committee to review FCC license and transfer applications involving foreign participation to determine whether grant of the requested license or transfer approval may pose a risk to the national security or law enforcement interests of the United States, and to review existing licenses to identify any additional or new risks to national security or law enforcement interests that did not exist when a license was first granted. Following an investigation, the Committee may recommend that the FCC revoke or modify existing licenses or deny or condition approval of new licenses and license transfers. It is not possible for the Company to determine whether it may be subject to a proceeding to revoke or modify our existing licenses or predict the outcome of a review of new license or transfer applications by the Committee in the future. A review of existing licenses and/or a review of new licenses and transfers by the Committee may result in additional compliance obligations that may affect the Company s expenses and business operations in the future. 
 In addition, in connection with our internet access offerings, we could become subject to laws and regulations as they are adopted or applied to the internet. There is currently only limited regulation applicable to these services although court decisions, legislative action and/or changes in regulatory policy could lead to greater regulation of the internet (including internet access services). The Company cannot provide any assurances that changes in current or future regulations adopted by the FCC or state regulators, or other legislative, administrative, or judicial initiatives relating to the telecommunications industry, will not have an adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 From time to time, different regulatory agencies conduct audits to ensure that the Company is in compliance with the respective regulations. The Company could be subject to fines and penalties if found to be out of compliance with these regulations, and these fines and penalties could be material to the Company s financial condition. 
 
 As a winning bidder in the FCC s Connect America Fund II CAF II and Rural Digital Opportunity Fund RDOF auction, the Company must comply with numerous FCC and state requirements prior to and after receiving such funding. If the Company fails to comply with those requirements, the FCC could consider us in default of the CAF II and RDOF program rules, and it could incur substantial penalties or forfeitures of future revenues, most significantly in Hawaii. For example, if the Company fails to attain certain specific buildout milestones and performance requirements under the CAF II and RDOF programs, the FCC could withhold future support payments until those shortcomings are corrected. Failure to comply with the rules and requirements for the CAF II and RDOF program could result in the Company being suspended or disbarred from future governmental programs or contracts for a significant period of time, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition. 
 Third parties may claim that the Company is infringing upon their intellectual property, and the Company could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products. 
 The Company may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology, products or services. Any litigation growing out of third-party patents or other intellectual property claims could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the Company s management and key personnel from our business operations. The complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increases these risks. Resolution of claims of intellectual property infringement might also require the Company to enter into costly license agreements. Likewise, the Company may not be able to obtain license agreements on acceptable terms. The Company also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against the development and sale of certain of our products or services. Further, the Company often relies on licenses of third-party intellectual property for its businesses. The Company cannot ensure these licenses will be available in the future on favorable terms or at all. 
 Third parties may infringe upon the Company s intellectual property, and the Company may expend significant resources enforcing its rights or suffer competitive injury. 
 The Company s success significantly depends on the competitive advantage it gains from our proprietary technology and other valuable intellectual property assets. The Company relies on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets protections, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect its intellectual property rights. If the Company fails to successfully enforce its intellectual property rights, its competitive position could suffer, which could harm its operating results.

The Company may also be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police its intellectual property rights. The Company may not be able to detect third-party infringements and its competitive position may be harmed before the Company does so. In addition, competitors may design around the Company s technology or develop competing technologies. Furthermore, some intellectual property rights are licensed to other companies, allowing them to compete with the Company using that intellectual property. 
 The Company could be subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could require the Company to pay significant damages or settlements. 
 
 The industry that the Company operates in faces a substantial risk of litigation, including, from time to time, patent infringement lawsuits, antitrust class actions, securities class actions, wage and hour class actions, personal injury claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection processes. We may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay significant awards and settlements. 
 The Company could incur significant costs resulting from complying with, or potential violations of, environmental, health and human safety laws. 
 The Company s operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, health, and human safety, including those governing the management and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous materials and the clean-up of contamination, and the emission of radio frequencies. While the Company believes its operations are in substantial compliance with environmental, health, and human safety laws and regulations, as an owner or operator of property and in connection with the current and historical use of hazardous materials and other operations at its sites, the Company could incur significant costs resulting from complying with or violations of such laws, the imposition of clean-up obligations and third-party suits. For instance, a number of the Company s sites formerly contained underground storage tanks for the storage of used oil and fuel for back-up generators and vehicles.

 The Company is subject to various lawsuits, actions, proceedings, claims and other matters asserted under laws and regulations in the normal course of business. We believe that the liabilities accrued for legal contingencies in our consolidated financial statements, as prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ), are adequate in light of those contingencies that are probable and able to be estimated. However, there can be no assurances that the actual amounts required to satisfy alleged liabilities from various legal proceedings, claims, tax examinations, and other matters, and to comply with applicable laws and regulations, will not exceed the amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements. As such, costs, if any, that may be incurred in excess of those amounts provided as of December 31, 2022, cannot be reasonably determined. 
 Based on information currently available, consultation with counsel, available insurance coverage and established reserves, management believes the eventual outcome of all outstanding claims will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

 Item 6. Selected Financial Data 
 
 Effective with the Merger and the subsequent filing of the Form 25, the Company no longer meets the definition of an SEC registrant and is therefore filing this form with the reduced disclosure format and has omitted the information called for by this Item pursuant to General Instruction I(2)(c) of Form 10-K.

 Introduction 
 This Management s Discussion and Analysis section provides an overview of Cincinnati Bell Inc.'s financial condition as of December 31, 2022 and the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, the periods January 1, 2021 through September 7, 2021 Predecessor and September 8, 2021 through December 31, 2021 Successor ), and the year ended December 31, 2020. References in this Annual Report to Successor refer to the Company on or after September 8, 2021 and references to Predecessor refer to the results prior to September 8, 2021. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. 
 Our results of operations as reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements for these periods are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Although GAAP requires that we report on our results for the period from January 1, 2021 through September 7, 2021 and the period from September 8, 2021 through December 31, 2021 separately, management views the Company s operating results for the year ended December 31, 2021 by combining the results of the applicable Predecessor and Successor periods because such presentation provides the most meaningful comparison of our results to prior periods. 
 To enhance the analysis of our operating results for the periods presented, we have included a discussion of selected financial and operating data of the Predecessor and Successor on a combined basis for the year ended December 31, 2021. This presentation consists of the mathematical addition of selected financial and operating data of the Predecessor for the period from January 1, 2021 to September 7, 2021 plus the comparable financial and operating data of the Successor for the period from September 8, 2021 to December 31, 2021. There are no other adjustments made in the combined presentation. The mathematical combination of selected financial and operating data is included below under the heading Combined Year Ended December 31, 2021 and this data is a non-GAAP presentation. Management believes that this selected financial and operating data provides investors with useful information upon which to assess our operating performance because the results of operations for a twelve-month period correspond to how we have reported our results in the past and how we will report our results in the future. 
 Our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this document generally discusses 2022 and 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021. Discussions of 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 that are not included in this document can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 filed on May 19, 2022. 
 Acquisition by Red Fiber Parent LLC 
 On March 13, 2020, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement with Red Fiber Parent LLC, a Delaware limited liability company Parent ), and RF Merger Sub Inc., an Ohio corporation and directly wholly owned subsidiary of Parent Merger Sub ). On September 7, 2021 (the Closing Date or Merger Date ), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Ohio General Corporation Law (the OGCL ), Merger Sub merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation (the Merger ). At the effective time of the Merger (the Effective Time ), the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub ceased, and the Company survived the Merger as a wholly owned private subsidiary of Parent.

Upon completion of the Merger, Parent was deemed the accounting acquirer and Cincinnati Bell Inc. the accounting acquiree. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities associated with Cincinnati Bell Inc. were recorded at their fair values measured as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. The capital contribution as a result of the Merger included cash from Parent in the amount of 1,716.1 million. These proceeds were used to pay on the date of the Merger (1) 807.3 million of consideration payable to Common Shareholders, including restricted stock awards that vested upon the Closing Date to certain employees, (2) 155.2 million of consideration payable to Preferred Shareholders, (3) 658.2 million of existing debt and accrued interest under the Corporate Credit Agreement and (4) transaction costs of 44.0 million primarily related to legal costs and acquisition-related advisory fees associated with the Merger. The Company also incurred note issuance costs of 38.1 million related to the Credit Agreement entered into in connection with the Merger. The Note issuance costs were capitalized as a reduction to the outstanding debt balances or to Other noncurrent assets for costs associated with the Revolving Credit Facility due 2026. In addition, certain stock-based compensation awards were accelerated upon the Closing Date, which resulted in a nonrecurring expense of approximately 9.3 million recorded to SG A in the Predecessor period. 
 Prior to entering into the Merger Agreement, the Company previously entered the Brookfield Merger Agreement with affiliates of Brookfield, the infrastructure investment division of Brookfield Asset Management, which was subsequently amended. On March 13, 2020, the Company terminated the Brookfield Merger Agreement and entered into the Merger Agreement. In connection with the termination of the Brookfield Merger Agreement, the Company paid to an affiliate of Brookfield a termination fee of 24.8 million as required by the terms of the Brookfield Merger Agreement. The termination fee is recorded in Transaction and integration costs on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 altafiber Brand 
 In March 2022, the Company announced that we will begin doing business as altafiber in Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana as we continue to expand our geographic reach and invest in our fiber network that delivers broadband connectivity. The branding change will not impact our Hawaiian Telcom business or IT Services business, which is branded as CBTS in the U.S. and Europe and OnX in Canada. 
 Executive Summary 
 Segment results described in the Executive Summary are net of intercompany eliminations. 
 Consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 totaled 1,796.0 million, an increase of 102.9 million compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021 as strategic revenue growth in both segments offset declines in Legacy revenue. For 2022, Fioptics revenue increased 54.3 million compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the prior year as the Company continues to focus on high-speed internet activations in addition to recording revenue of 22.9 million in 2022 associated with nonrecurring subsidized fiber build projects while Legacy revenue decreased 43.1 million compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included in 2021. IT Services and Hardware experienced revenue growth in all practices in 2022 compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods in 2021, with the most significant growth in the Consulting practice and Infrastructure Solutions practice in which revenue increased 13 and 20 , respectively, compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the prior year. 
 
 Operating loss for 2022 totaled 97.3 million compared to operating income of 18.6 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021. Revenue growth in both segments was more than offset due most significantly to higher depreciation and amortization expenses related to the increased value of property, plant and equipment and intangibles as a result of fair value adjustments recorded as of the Merger Date in addition to increases in cost of services and products and SG A expenses to support revenue growth. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in transaction and integration costs in 2022 compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021. 
 
 Interest expense decreased 27.3 million for 2022 compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021 primarily due to the extinguishment of the 7 Senior Notes due 2024 and 8 Senior Notes due 2025 in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the extinguishment of the Tranche B Term Loan due 2024 and interest rate swaps in the Predecessor period in connection with the Merger. These decreases were partially offset by interest expense incurred in 2022 related to the Term B-1 Loans and Term B-2 loans in addition to higher interest expense on the Revolving Credit Facility due 2026 and Receivables Facility due to increases in interest rates and borrowings in 2022.

Form 10-K Part II 
 
 Cincinnati Bell Inc. 

Other components of pension and postretirement benefit plans expenses decreased for 2022 compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the prior year due to remeasuring the pension and postretirement projected benefit obligations, actuarial gains (losses) and prior service costs (benefits) as of the Merger Date as well as favorable asset returns in 2021 also favorably impacting the annual remeasurement performed in December 2021and the Merger Date remeasurement. 
 
 Loss on extinguishment of debt recorded in the Predecessor period of 2021 is due to the termination of the Company s former Corporate Credit Agreement in connection with the Merger. Loss on extinguishment of debt recorded in the Successor period of 2021 is due to the termination of the 7 Senior Notes due 2024 and 8 Senior Notes due 2025. 
 
 Other (income) expense, net totaled income of 13.6 million for 2022 primarily due to recording a gain associated with the Company s interest rate swap agreements and interest rate cap agreements in 2022 of 12.0 million. Other (income) expense, net totaled expense of 19.4 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021 due to recording a loss on termination of interest rate swaps of 20.1 million in the Predecessor period of 2021. 
 Loss before income taxes totaled 166.0 million for 2022 resulting in an increase in the loss of 33.3 million compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021. The decrease in operating income more than offset lower interest expense and pension and postretirement benefit plans expense in 2022 compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021 as well as recording a gain on the Company's interest rate swap agreements and interest cap agreements in 2022 and recording loss on extinguishment of debt and loss on termination of interest rate swaps in the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the prior year. 
 
 The income tax provision for 2022 was a benefit of 35.1 million which was slightly higher than the period's income at the statutory rate, due primarily to net state tax benefit. The income tax provision for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021 was a benefit of 24.2 million. The income tax benefit recorded in 2022 was higher than the benefit recorded in the comparable combined Predecessor and Successor periods in the prior year due to higher losses before taxes in the current period. 
 
 Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business - Update 
 
 Beginning in March 2020 and continuing through the first quarter of 2021, our business experienced the effects of t he COVID-19 pandemic most significantly due to increased bad debt expense and reduced revenue in certain of our revenue streams primarily due to the Keep Americans Connected Pledge Pledge for which the Company committed to waive late fees for, and not terminate service to, any of our consumer or small business customers who did not pay their bills timely due to an inability to pay caused by the COVID-19 crisis. Subsequent to the first quarter of 2021, bad debt expense has returned to pre-pandemic levels and strategic revenue trends are normalized and improving. Starting in 2021, we began to experience logistics challenges in obtaining inventory in a timely manner due to demand exceeding the supply of certain inventory products. Logistics challenges continued to impact operations in 2022. Additionally, access to skilled employees and contractors may create delays or increased costs in the planned build-out of the fiber network in both geographies. 
 Discussion of Operating Segment Results 
 The Company manages its business based upon product and service offerings. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we operated two business segments: Network, previously referred to as Entertainment and Communications, and IT Services and Hardware. Certain corporate administrative expenses have been allocated to our business segments based upon the nature of the expense and the relative size of the segment. Intercompany transactions between segments have been eliminated.

 Cincinnati Bell Inc. 

Network 
 The Network segment provides products and services that are categorized as Fioptics, previously referred to as Consumer/SMB Fiber in Hawaii and collectively with Fioptics in Cincinnati, Enterprise Fiber or Legacy. Cincinnati Bell Telephone Company LLC CBT ), a subsidiary of the Company, is the incumbent local exchange carrier ILEC for a geography that covers a radius of approximately 25 miles around Cincinnati, Ohio, and includes parts of northern Kentucky and southeastern Indiana. CBT has operated in this territory for approximately 150 years. In 2022, the Company announced that we will being doing business as altafiber and started their network expansion outside of this territory to provide fiber services to Dayton, Ohio. Voice and data services in the Enterprise Fiber and Legacy categories that are delivered beyond the Company's ILEC territory, particularly in Dayton and Mason, Ohio, are provided through the operations of Cincinnati Bell Extended Territories LLC CBET ), a subsidiary of CBT. On July 2, 2018, the Company acquired Hawaiian Telcom. Hawaiian Telcom is the ILEC for the State of Hawaii and the largest full service provider of communications services and products in the state. Originally incorporated in Hawaii in 1883 as Mutual Telephone Company, Hawaiian Telcom has a strong heritage of nearly 140 years as Hawaii s communications carrier. Its services are offered on all of Hawaii s major islands, except its video service, which currently is only available on the island of Oahu. On May 2, 2022, the Company acquired Agile IWG Holdings, LLC Agile ), based in Canton, Ohio. Agile leases wireless infrastructure assets to third parties and provides connectivity through hybrid fiber wireless data networks primarily to customers in Ohio and Pennsylvania. 
 Fioptics products include high-speed internet access, categorized below as data, voice lines and video as well as subsidized fiber build project revenue included in Other related to extending the Company's fiber network in the Greater Cincinnati territory subsidized through our UniCity program and in Hawaii subsidized through a customer contract. The Company is able to deliver speeds up to one gigabit per second to nearly 80 of Greater Cincinnati and more than 40 of Hawaii s total addressable market. 
 Enterprise Fiber products include metro-ethernet, dedicated internet access, wavelength, IRU contracts, and wireless backhaul to macro-towers and small cells. Hawaiian Telcom Enterprise Fiber also includes revenue from the SEA-US cable. As enterprise customers migrate from legacy products and copper-based technology, our metro-ethernet product becomes the preferred method of transport due to its ability to support multiple applications on a single physical connection. Subsequent to the Company's acquisition of Agile in May 2022, Enterprise Fiber revenue also includes revenue from Agile. 
 Legacy products include traditional voice lines, consumer long distance, switched access, digital trunking, DSL, DS0, DS1, DS3 and other value-added services such as caller identification, voicemail, call waiting and call return.

 Fioptics 
 Fioptics revenue increased 54.3 million in 2022 compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021 as the increase in the subscriber base for internet more than offset the decline in video subscribers. The internet subscriber base continues to increase as we focus attention on growing the internet FTTP subscriber base and accelerating the pace of our fiber build which enabled us to pass 126,400 FTTP addresses in Cincinnati and 53,000 FTTP addresses in Hawaii during 2022. The Average Revenue Per User ARPU for 2022 increased for internet in both Cincinnati and Hawaii by 7 and 11 , respectively, compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021, primarily due to price increases and more customers subscribing to higher broadband tiers. Video ARPU also increased for 2022 compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021 in both Cincinnati and Hawaii by 4 and 6 , respectively, which partially offset the decline in subscribers. Video ARPU increases are related to price increases as well as change in the mix of subscribers. Other revenue increased for 2022 compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021 primarily due to recording revenue of 22.9 million in 2022 associated with nonrecurring subsidized fiber build projects in Cincinnati and Hawaii. 
 Enterprise Fiber 
 Enterprise Fiber revenue increased by 15.1 million for 2022 compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021 primarily due to increased revenue as a result of customers migrating from legacy product offerings to higher bandwidth fiber solutions as evidenced by the 51 and 11 increases in Ethernet Bandwidth in Cincinnati and Hawaii, respectively. During 2022, significant contracts were signed with large carriers in Cincinnati and Hawaii to upgrade Ethernet Bandwidth across their networks. Increased revenue was partially offset by pricing pressures to provide higher speeds at a lower cost. In addition, Agile contributed revenue of 8.7 million in 2022. 
 Legacy 
 Legacy revenue decreased for 2022 compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021 due to the decline in voice lines and DSL subscribers. Voice lines declined 13 and 11 in Cincinnati and Hawaii, respectively, as the traditional voice lines become less relevant. DSL subscribers continue to decrease in Cincinnati and Hawaii, as subscribers demand the higher speeds that can be provided by fiber. In addition, declines in DS1, DS3 and digital trunking have contributed to the revenue decline for these products in 2022 compared to the prior year as customers migrate away from these solutions to fiber-based solutions.

 Operating Costs and Expenses 
 Cost of services and products increased 7.9 million for 2022 compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021. Operating and facilities expenses increased 6.5 million due to increased energy costs. Operating materials increased 4.4 million as a result of increased purchases associated with the expansion of our fiber network. Rent expense increased 3.5 million primarily due to expense contributed by Agile in 2022. Software development costs increased 1.9 million due to costs associated with our video product and call center. Payroll related costs increased 1.6 million primarily due to additional headcount and overtime wages partially offset by lower healthcare costs. Video content costs also increased 1.5 million. These increases were partially offset by lower operating taxes of 6.3 million primarily due to lower regulatory fees. In addition, costs deferred in accordance with ASC 606 during the Predecessor period were remeasured as of the Merger Date resulting in a decrease to expense of 3.8 million in 2022 compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods in 2021. 
 SG A expenses increased 30.1 million for 2022 compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021. Contract services costs increased 9.4 million primarily due to higher utilization of outside contractors on certain specialized projects, increased insurance costs and legal expense incurred associated with a legal dispute in Hawaii. Payroll related costs increased 6.8 million due to additional headcount including headcount associated with the Company's acquisition of Agile. Advertising expenses increased 5.4 million due to increased marketing campaigns, including rebranding the business as altafiber, and promotional events. Software development costs increased 2.3 million primarily due to improvements related to automating the consumer experience as well as other internal projects. Bad debt expense increased 2.3 million due to lower expense incurred in the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021 as a result of focus on collection efforts for aged receivables of customers who did not pay their bills timely due to an inability to pay caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and favorable resolution in the first quarter of 2021 of reserved balances associated with a customer that filed for bankruptcy in a prior period. Operating materials increased 1.6 million primarily due to purchases associated with the Company s rebranding as altafiber and increased fuel costs. Employee related costs increased 1.1 million as travel and entertainment activity continued to be lower in the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021 as a result of the pandemic. 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses increased 113.4 million for 2022 compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021 primarily due to additional expense incurred subsequent to the Merger Date related to the increased value of property, plant and equipment and intangibles as a result of recording amounts at fair value. 
 
 Loss on impairment of long-lived assets recorded in 2022 is related to the impairment of leasehold improvements at the Company s headquarters. 
 Restructuring and severance charge reversals recorded in the Predecessor period of 2021 are due to employees that transitioned to new positions in the Company and were previously included in the VSP offered in the first quarter of 2020.

 Revenue 
 IT Services and Hardware revenue increased 76.2 million for 2022 compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021. Consulting revenue increased 40.3 million due to existing customer projects which continued to bill and grow in 2022. Cloud revenue increased 3.4 million primarily due to increased revenue from providing ongoing public cloud services to new customers obtained in 2021 and 2022 that continue to bill and grow in addition to providing ongoing monitoring and management services and other cloud services related to significant customer contracts obtained in prior years which continued to bill and grow in 2022. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in virtual data center revenue of 2.4 million as a result of a customer s insourcing initiatives and a decrease in professional services projects. Communications revenue increased 4.7 million as a result of customers migrating to newer technologies which has increased the Company s Hosted UCaaS profiles, NaaS locations and SD-WAN locations. These increases were partially offset by the decline in legacy communications revenue. Infrastructure Solutions revenue increased 27.8 million primarily due to increased revenue associated with professional services projects and the sale of hardware in 2022 compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021. 
 Operating Costs and Expenses 
 IT Services and Hardware cost of services and products increased 57.9 million for 2022 compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021 due to increases in payroll related costs and contractor costs, and to a lesser extent, software licensing costs. In 2022, the increases in payroll related costs and contractor costs of 11.1 million and 51.2 million, respectively, as compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021 are due to additional headcount to support the growth in the Communications and Consulting practices. Billable resources as of December 31, 2022 were flat compared to December 31, 2021 due to the timing of projects but the average headcount for 2022 was higher compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021 resulting in the increased expense in 2022. Higher software licensing costs were also incurred to support the revenue growth in the Communications practice. These increases were partially offset by lower regulatory fees and network related costs for 2022 compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021. The decrease in network related costs is due to legacy revenue decline in the Communications practice.

IT Services and Hardware, continued 
 SG A expenses increased 9.2 million for 2022 compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021 primarily to support revenue growth. Payroll related costs increased 2.6 million due to higher employee commissions. Increased contract services costs of 1.8 million are due to increased contractors used for special projects in addition to higher insurance expenses. Employee related costs increased 1.3 million as travel and entertainment continued to be low in the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021 as a result of the pandemic. Increased rent expense of 0.7 million is primarily due to increased operating lease expense. Software development costs increased 0.6 million due to internal software projects. 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses increased 44.2 million for 2022 compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021 primarily due to additional expense incurred subsequent to the Merger Date related to the increased value of property, plant and equipment and intangibles as a result of recording amounts at fair value. 
 Restructuring and severance charges recorded in the year ended December 31, 2022, the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020 are associated with initiatives to reduce and contain costs. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 Capital expenditures are dependent on the timing of success-based projects. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2022 were primarily related to projects supporting the Cloud and Communications practice. In addition to success-based projects, the Company incurred 4.9 million in capital expenditures for implementation work associated with internal software projects in the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Corporate 
 Corporate is comprised primarily of general and administrative costs that have not been allocated to the business segments and transaction and integration costs related to acquisition transactions. Corporate costs totaled 32.7 million in 2022, 82.5 million in the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021 and 58.3 million in 2020. 
 Corporate costs decreased by 49.8 million in 2022 compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021 primarily due to lower transaction and integration costs of 44.3 million in addition to decreased bonus expense for certain stock-based compensation awards that were accelerated upon the Merger Date.

Financial Condition, Liquidity, and Capital Resources 
 Capital Investment, Resources and Liquidity 
 Short-term view 
 Our primary source of cash is generated by operations. The Company generated cash flows from operations of 321.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, 167.7 million in the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021 and 206.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
 The Company s primary uses of cash are for capital expenditures and debt service and, to a lesser extent, to fund pension and retiree medical obligations. In 2022, the Company paid cash consideration of 65.5 million related to the acquisition of Agile. In connection with the Merger and the initial capitalization by Parent in 2021, the Company paid 807.3 million as consideration to Common Shareholders, including restricted stock awards that vested on the Merger Date to certain employees, 155.2 million as consideration to Preferred Shareholders and 44.0 million of transaction costs primarily related to legal costs and acquisition-related advisory fees associated with the Merger. 
 In connection with the Merger, at the Effective Time, the Company entered into a new Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement and terminated the existing Corporate Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement initially provided for (i) a five-year 275 million senior secured revolving credit facility, including both a letter of credit subfacility of up to 40 million and a swingline loan subfacility of up to 10 million (the Revolving Credit Facility due 2026 and (ii) a seven-year 150 million senior secured term loan facility (the Term B-1 Loans ). The Revolving Credit Facility due 2026 matures in September 2026 and the Term B-1 Loans mature in September 2028. Borrowings under the Term B-1 Loans were used to refinance existing company indebtedness, finance a portion of the fees and expenses relating to the acquisition of the Company and the establishment of the Credit Agreement, and for working capital and general corporate purposes. The Company capitalized 32.0 million of costs incurred as a result of the Term B-1 Loans as a reduction of debt. In addition, 6.1 million of costs incurred as a result of the Revolving Credit Facility due 2026 were capitalized and recorded in Other noncurrent assets. 
 In November 2021, the Company entered into an Amendment (the Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Agreement to provide for, among other things, (i) a 125.0 million upsize to the Revolving Credit Facility due 2026, increasing the total commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility due 2026 to 400.0 million, (ii) a 350.0 million incremental increase to the Term B-1 Loans (the Incremental Term B-1 Loans Increase ), increasing the aggregate principal amount of Term B-1 Loans to 500.0 million, and (iii) the incurrence of a new tranche of 650.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured term loans (the Term B-2 Loans ). The proceeds of the Incremental Term B-1 Loans Increase and the Term B-2 Loans were used by the Company to redeem in full all of the Company s existing 7.000 Senior Notes due 2024 (the 2024 Notes and 8.000 Senior Notes due 2025 (the 2025 Notes ), and to pay fees and expenses in connection thereto. The Term B-2 Loans mature in November 2028. The Amendment No. 1 also extended the maturity of all Term B-1 Loans to November 2028 and reduced the interest applicable to the Term B-1 Loans and the Revolving Credit Facility due 2026. The Amendment No. 1 also provided for the transition of the benchmark rate of interest under the Credit Agreement from LIBOR to Term SOFR. As a result of the Amendment No. 1, the Company incurred deferred financing costs of 4.3 million and 9.7 million related to the Incremental Term B-1 Loans Increase and the Term B-2 Loans, respectively, and capitalized the amounts as a reduction to the outstanding debt balances. In addition, 1.3 million of costs incurred related to increasing the capacity of the Revolving Credit Facility due 2026 were capitalized and recorded in Other noncurrent assets. 
 The Credit Agreement has a financial covenant that requires the Company to maintain a Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of 5.75 to 1.00 when the utilization under the Revolving Credit Facility due 2026 exceeds 35 . In addition, the Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including but not limited to, restrictions on the Company's ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, pay dividends, make certain investments, prepay other indebtedness, sell, transfer, lease, or dispose of assets and enter into, or undertake, certain liquidations, mergers, consolidations or acquisitions. 
 The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default (which are in some cases subject to certain exceptions, thresholds 
 and grace periods), including, but not limited to, nonpayment of principal or interest, failure to perform or observe covenants, breaches of representations and warranties, cross-defaults with certain other indebtedness, certain bankruptcy-related events or proceedings, final monetary judgments or orders, ERISA defaults, invalidity of loan documents or guarantees, and certain change of control events. If the Company was to violate any of its covenants and was unable to obtain a waiver, it would be considered a default. If the Company was in default under the Credit Agreement, no additional borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility due 2026 would be available until the default was waived or cured. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Form 10-K where a more in-depth explanation of default consequences appears.

The Term B-1 Loans and Term B-2 Loans are subject to the same affirmative and negative covenants and events of default as the Revolving Credit Facility due 2026, except that a breach of the financial covenants will not result in an event of default under the Term B-2 Loans unless and until the agent or a majority in interest of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility due 2026 have terminated their commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility due 2026 and accelerated the loans then outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility due 2026 in response to such breach in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement. 
 Capital expenditures increased 190.6 million for 2022 compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021 primarily due to the increase in the Network segment as a result of increased construction and installation capital expenditures associated with the expansion of our fiber network. 
 Interest payments were 84.6 million in 2022, 135.6 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021 and 125.5 million in 2020. Interest payments decreased for 2022 compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021 primarily due to the extinguishment of the 7 Senior Notes due 2024 and 8 Senior Notes due 2025 in the Successor period in 2021 and the extinguishment of the Tranche B Term Loan due 2024 and interest rate swaps in the Predecessor period in connection with the Merger. These decreases were partially offset by interest payments incurred in 2022 related to the Term B-1 Loans and Term B-2 loans in addition to higher interest payments on the Revolving Credit Facility due 2026 and Receivables Facility due to increases in interest rates and borrowings in 2022. Our contractual debt maturities in 2023, including finance lease obligations and other financing arrangements, are 45.0 million and associated contractual interest payments are expected to be approximately 70 million. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 195.2 million of short-term liquidity, comprised of 9.4 million of cash and cash equivalents, 177.0 million of undrawn capacity on our Revolving Credit Facility due 2026 and 8.8 million available under the Company s accounts receivables securitization facility Receivables Facility ). In 2023, the Company expects to use a portion of this liquidity to fund our Joint Venture with the State of Ohio, Digital Access Ohio LLC DAO ), for an amount of approximately 3 million. 
 
 In the second quarter of 2022, the Company executed amendments to its Receivables Facility, which replaced, amended and added certain provisions and definitions including the replacement of LIBOR with SOFR, a rate equal to the secured overnight financing rate as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 
 On January 31, 2023, the Company, together with certain of its U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries, made certain amendments (the Amendments to the Company s Receivables Facility. The Amendments amend the Receivables Facility to, among other things: (i) increase the total maximum borrowing capacity to 280.0 million, (ii) separate the Receivable Facility into two separate facilities, with (A) the existing Receivable Facility (the Network Receivables Facility ), as amended by the Amendments, covering receivables originated by certain U.S. subsidiaries of the Company including Cincinnati Bell Telephone Company LLC, Hawaiian Telcom Communications, Inc. and certain of their respective subsidiaries having a maximum borrowing capacity of 55.0 million and (B) a new facility (the CBTS Receivable Facility covering receivables originated by certain U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries of the Company including CBTS Technology Solutions LLC and OnX Enterprise Solutions Ltd. having a maximum borrowing capacity of 225.0 million, (iii) move the receivables monetization arrangements from the Network Receivables Facility to the CBTS Receivable Facility, and (iv) make applicable technical and conforming changes thereto. In addition, the Amendments extend the renewal dates of each facility to January 2025 and the termination dates of each facility to January 2026. 
 Capacity on the Network Receivables Facility and the CBTS Receivables Facility is calculated and will continue to be calculated based on the quantity and quality of outstanding accounts receivables. Therefore if the Company experiences declines in revenue or extends discounts to customers, the capacity could be negatively impacted and reduce our short term liquidity. While we expect to continue to renew the Network Receivables Facility and CBTS Receivables Facility, we would be required to use cash, our Revolving Credit Facility due 2026, or other sources to repay any outstanding balances on the facilities if they were not renewed. 
 Management believes that cash on hand, operating cash flows, its Revolving Credit Facility due 2026, its Network Receivables Facility and CBTS Receivables Facility, and the expectation that the Company will continue to have access to capital markets to refinance debt and other obligations as they mature and come due, should allow the Company to meet its cash requirements for the foreseeable future.

Long-term view, including debt covenants 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 1,701.0 million of outstanding indebtedness and an accumulated deficit of 158.1 million. In addition to the uses of cash described in the Short-term view section above, the Company has to satisfy its long-term debt obligations. The Company has no significant debt maturities until 2026. In addition, we have ongoing obligations to fund our qualified pension plans. Funding requirements for future years are uncertain and will significantly depend on changes in future actuarial assumptions. It is also possible that we will use a portion of our cash flows generated from operations for de-leveraging in the future, including discretionary, opportunistic repurchases of debt prior to the scheduled maturities. See Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further details regarding our outstanding debt and other financing arrangements, including certain information about maturities, covenants and restrictions related to such debt and financing arrangements. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with the Credit Agreement covenants and ratios. 
 Certain of our variable-rate debt, including debt under the Paniolo fiber assets financing arrangement, uses LIBOR as one of the benchmarks for establishing the rate of interest. LIBOR is the subject of recent regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms and other pressures may cause LIBOR to be replaced with a new benchmark in the future or to perform differently than in the past. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted, but could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness. Upon the discontinuation of LIBOR, the benchmark rate of interest for the Paniolo fiber assets financing arrangement will transition to SOFR in accordance with the terms of the arrangement. 
 While the Company is no longer a SEC registrant or issuer following the merger transaction, certain covenants included in the 7 Notes due 2023 and the Cincinnati Bell Telephone Notes due 2028 require the Company to make ongoing voluntary filings with the SEC. 
 Management believes that cash on hand, operating cash flows, its Revolving Credit Facility due 2026, its Network Receivables Facility and CBTS Receivables Facility, and the expectation that the Company will continue to have access to capital markets to refinance debt and other obligations as they mature and come due, should allow the Company to meet its cash requirements for the foreseeable future. 
 Cash Flows 
 Cash flows from operating activities 
 Cash provided by operating activities in 2022 was 321.2 million, an increase of 153.5 million compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021. The increase in 2022 compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the prior year is due to lower interest payments of 51.0 million, decreased transaction and integration costs of 41.1 million, loss on termination of interest rate swaps of 20.1 million incurred in the Predecessor period in 2021 and 56.8 million of accounts receivable sold on the Receivables Facility as of December 31, 2022 compared to no accounts receivable sold as of December 31, 2021. Cash receipt in the third quarter of 2021 for a long term revenue contract that was paid in advance partially offset the increase in 2022. 
 Cash flows from investing activities 
 Cash used in investing activities in 2022 totaled 553.7 million. Cash used in investing activities in 2022 includes capital expenditures of 482.8 million primarily associated with extending the Company's fiber network, the acquisition of Agile for 65.5 million and the purchase of perpetual licenses for a block of IP addressed for 6.8 million to be used as the Company continues to add internet subscribers as we extend the network. 
 Cash used in investing activities during the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021 totaled 1,955.3 million. Cash used in investing activities in the Successor period includes 1,620.7 million related to consideration transferred associated with the Merger Agreement. Consideration transferred includes payments to Common Shareholders, payments to Preferred Shareholders, and the extinguishment of existing debt and accrued interest under the Corporate Credit Agreement. In addition, cash used in investing activities for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021 includes the acquisition of fiber assets from the Paniolo Cable Company, LLC (the Paniolo Acquisition for 52.2 million and capital expenditures of 292.2 million primarily associated with extending the Company's fiber network.

Cash flows from financing activities 
 Cash provided by financing activities totaled 239.4 million in 2022 due to net borrowings of 223.0 million and 33.9 million on the Revolving Credit Facility due 2026 and Receivables Facility, respectively, partially offset by debt repayments of 20.3 million primarily related to the Term B-1 Loans, Term B-2 Loans and finance leases. 
 Cash provided by financing activities totaled 1,776.4 million during the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021 primarily due to the Merger and capital contributions by Red Fiber Parent LLC and the issuance of long-term debt in the third and fourth quarters. Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt include Term B-1 Loans and Term B-2 Loans which the net proceeds of 1,145.0 million were primarily utilized for the repayment of the 2024 Notes and 2025 Notes and debt issuance costs associated with the Term B-1 Loans, Term B-2 Loans and Revolving Credit Facility due 2026. The Company also issued long term debt of 23.0 million, the Paniolo fiber assets financing arrangement, to cover a portion of the Paniolo Acquisition. Dividends paid on the Company s preferred stock totaled 10.2 million in the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021. 
 Future Operating Trends 
 Network 
 We continue to mitigate the revenue decline experienced with our Legacy products with increases in revenue of our fiber-based products. In addition, the merger with Hawaiian Telcom has allowed us to build scale and fiber density to help capitalize on the growing demands for internet speeds that only a fiber network can provide. We expect the desire by customers for increased internet speeds will only continue as evidenced by the fact that more than 80 of Cincinnati s internet customers subscribe to speeds of 100 megabits or more, compared to approximately 70 and 65 subscribed to such speeds in 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 65 of internet customers in Hawaii subscribed to speeds of 100 megabits or more, compared to approximately 55 and 50 subscribed to such speeds in 2021 and 2020, respectively. In 2022, we started building outside of the Greater Cincinnati market in Dayton, Ohio and will continue to build addresses in this market throughout 2023. In order to support the Dayton network build, the Company has opened a sales office and purchased land and buildings for warehousing inventory and for central offices. 
 During 2023, we expect continued competition for internet, voice and video services as the cable competitor in the Cincinnati market continues to target areas where we have copper and FTTN. Due to this competition, as well as customers migrating to obtaining video programming over broadband Internet connections, we expect to continue to see a decline in video subscribers as well as FTTN and DSL internet subscribers. In the Hawaii market, we also expect continued competition for internet, voice and video services as the cable competitor has increased advertising subsequent to our acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom.

 Cincinnati Bell Inc. 

In 2023, we plan to invest approximately 350 million for Fioptics, including construction, installation and value-added services. Our focus for 2023 in the Cincinnati, Dayton and Hawaii markets is to identify opportunities to expand our FTTP footprint to residential and commercial addresses with the highest return profile, to upgrade the remaining FTTN addresses to FTTP addresses, increase penetration, and drive operational efficiencies. We will take a FTTP internet-based focus due to the increased relevance of this product and the high return profile that it provides. Furthermore, we will apply a similar strategy as we identify opportunities to expand our network footprint in areas outside the Greater Cincinnati market and pursue out of market subsidized fiber build opportunities. The planned construction of the fiber network build could be negatively impacted by availability of staffing and third party contractors that will be necessary in order to meet our construction targets. Additionally, issues in the supply chain and obtaining the necessary equipment and supplies may also impact the planned construction timeline. As we expand outside of the Greater Cincinnati market, there could be a need for additional real estate and building space for central offices and sales offices to support new markets. 
 For our enterprise fiber customers, we expect to continue to see a migration from Legacy products and copper-based technology to higher bandwidth fiber solutions as evidenced by the 51 and 11 increases in Ethernet Bandwidth in Cincinnati and Hawaii, respectively, in 2022 compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021. 
 IT Services and Hardware 
 The Company's strategy for future growth is to diversify the geographies in which it operates and grow revenue in each of the practices. In 2023, the Company will continue to focus on expanding products and services to our customer base with our full stack of products from simple hardware sales through managed voice and software defined network management, creating contractual recurring revenue streams. As more customers migrate to the public cloud, we will see declines in the demand for Infrastructure products. However, this trend can provide an opportunity in the form of consulting as we have IT professionals that can develop the strategy to guide customers through this migration. As a result of expanding the customer base and increasing sales with existing customers, we expect revenue to grow by approximately 10 compared to 2022.

(2) Assumes no early payment of debt in future periods. The interest rate applied on variable rate borrowings is the rate in effect as of December 31, 2022. 

(3) Includes finance lease obligations primarily related to vehicles, network equipment used in the deployment of our fiber network and to provide our IT managed services, and wireless towers assumed from our discontinued operations. 

(4) Includes amounts under open purchase orders and open blanket purchase orders for purchases of network, IT and telephony equipment, video content, and other goods; contractual obligations for services such as software maintenance and outsourced services; and other purchase commitments. 

(5) Includes payments for Cincinnati and Hawaii Pension and Postretirement Plans as well as other employee retirement agreements. Amounts due within the next 12 months include approximately 7 million expected to be contributed for postretirement benefits. Although the Company expects to continue operating the plans past the next 12 months, its contractual obligation related to postretirement obligations only extends through 2023. Amounts for 2023 through 2032 include approximately 33 million of estimated cash contributions to the qualified pension plans with nominal cash contributions due within the next 12 months. Expected qualified pension plan contributions are based on current plan design, legislation and current actuarial assumptions. Any changes in plan design, legislation or actuarial assumptions may also affect the expected contribution amount. 

(6) Includes the portion of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits. If the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated for unrecognized tax benefits, these liabilities are included in the Beyond the next 12 months column of the table above. 

(7) Includes contractual obligations primarily related to asset removal obligations, liabilities related to the pole license agreement obligation, a deferred vendor rebate and other financing arrangements. 

The amount of these obligations can be expected to change over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed, terminated, or modified.

Contingencies 
 We are subject to various lawsuits, actions, proceedings, claims and other matters asserted under laws and regulations in the normal course of business. We believe that the amounts provided in our consolidated financial statements, as prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles, are adequate in light of those contingencies that are probable and able to be estimated. However, there can be no assurances that the actual amounts required to satisfy alleged liabilities from various legal proceedings, claims, tax examinations, and other matters, including the matters discussed below and to comply with applicable laws and regulations, will not exceed the amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements. As such, costs, if any, that may be incurred in excess of those amounts provided as of December 31, 2022, cannot be reasonably determined. 
 Based on information currently available, consultation with counsel, available insurance coverage and established reserves, management believes that the eventual outcome of all outstanding claims will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Indemnifications 
 During the normal course of business, the Company makes certain indemnities, commitments, and guarantees under which it may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions. These include: (a) intellectual property indemnities to customers in connection with the use, sale, and/or license of products and services, (b) indemnities to customers in connection with losses incurred while performing services on their premises, (c) indemnities to vendors and service providers pertaining to claims based on negligence or willful misconduct, (d) indemnities involving the representations and warranties in certain contracts, and (e) outstanding letters of credit which totaled 19.3 million as of December 31, 2022. In addition, the Company has made contractual commitments to several employees providing for payments upon the occurrence of certain prescribed events. The majority of these indemnities, commitments, and guarantees do not provide for any limitation on the maximum potential for future payments. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates or judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the financial statements could reflect different estimates or judgments. Certain accounting policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. 
 Our most significant accounting policies are presented in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Management views critical accounting policies to be those policies that are highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments, estimates or assumptions, and where changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. We have discussed our most critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates with our Audit and Finance Committee. 
 The discussion below addresses major judgments used in: 
 business combinations 

reviewing the carrying values of goodwill and definite-lived intangible assets; 

accounting for income taxes; and 

accounting for pension and postretirement obligations.

Business Combinations In accounting for business combinations, we apply the accounting requirements of FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations, which requires the recording of net assets of acquired businesses at fair value. The Company utilizes management estimates and an independent third-party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities. In developing estimates of the fair value of net assets, the Company analyzes a variety of factors including market data, estimated future cash flows of the acquired operations, industry growth rates, current replacement cost for fixed assets, and market rate assumptions for contractual obligations. Such a valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, particularly with respect to the intangible assets and network assets. The Company reports in its consolidated financial statements provisional amounts for the items for which accounting is incomplete. Goodwill is adjusted for any changes to provisional amounts made within the measurement period. 
 Reviewing the Carrying Values of Goodwill and Definite-lived Intangible Assets We amortize intangible assets over their useful lives unless we determine such lives to be indefinite. We evaluate goodwill annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For impairment testing, goodwill has been assigned to reporting units which consist of the Company s Network business, IT Services and Hardware business and Agile business. 
 The Company adheres to the guidance under ASC 350-20 in testing goodwill for impairment. Under this guidance, the Company has the option of performing a qualitative assessment for impairment prior to performing the quantitative tests. In connection with the Merger, goodwill and intangible assets were remeasured at fair value as of the Merger Date for the Network business and the IT Services and Hardware business. Goodwill and intangible assets for Agile were measured at fair value as of the Agile acquisition date on May 2, 2022. We perform our annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter on October 1st when our five-year plan is updated based on the following steps: 
 Step 0 or Qualitative assessment - Evaluate qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The factors we consider include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance or events specific to that reporting unit. If or when we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, including goodwill, we would move to Step 1 of the quantitative method. 
 
 Step 1 - Compare the fair value for each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Fair value is determined based on a combination of valuation methods, including both income-based and market-based methods. The income-based approach utilizes a discounted cash flow model using projected cash flows derived from the five-year plan, adjusted to reflect market participants' assumptions. Expected future cash flows are discounted at the weighted average cost of capital applying a market participant approach. The market-based approach utilizes earnings multiples from comparable publicly-traded companies. A goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount that the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. If a reporting unit s fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary. 
 The Company performed a quantitative analysis of goodwill utilizing Step 1 guidance in 2022 for the Network business and the IT Services and Hardware business and concluded that the fair values exceeded the carrying values and goodwill was not impaired. The Company performed a qualitative assessment utilizing Step 0 guidance for the annual test for indefinite-lived intangible assets and concluded that it is more like than not that the fair values exceeded the carrying values and indefinite-lived intangible assets were not impaired. In addition, the Company performed a qualitative assessment for Agile goodwill due to the limited amount of time that passed from the acquisition date and the testing date and concluded that it is more like than not that the fair value exceeded the carrying value and goodwill was not impaired. In the Successor period of 2021, the Company performed a qualitative assessment and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair values exceeded the carrying values and goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets were not impaired. No goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment losses were recognized in 2022, the Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021, and 2020. 
 We use the income approach to determine the fair value of our definite-lived trade names and customer relationships intangible assets. Our projections used in the income approach to determine the fair value of our definite-lived trade names and customer relationships intangible assets include assumptions for growth rates of sales, costs, and profits, which are based on various long-range financial and operational plans. Additionally, discount rates used in the definite-lived intangible analysis are based on a weighted-average cost of capital, driven by interest rates, as well as credit ratings and financing abilities, among other factors.

Changes in certain assumptions could have a significant impact on the impairment tests for goodwill. The most critical assumptions are projected future growth rates, operating margins, capital expenditures, terminal values, discount rate selection and market multiples. These assumptions are subject to change as the Company's long-term plans and strategies are updated each year. As of the annual testing date, each reporting unit's fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit, and as such, there is no goodwill impairment. 
 Accounting for Income Taxes The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction as well as various foreign, state and local jurisdictions. The Company s previous tax filings are subject to normal reviews by regulatory agencies until the related statute of limitations expires. With a few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examinations for years prior to 2018. 
 The Company has net operating loss carryforwards at the federal, state and local levels. Federal net operating loss carryforwards are available to offset taxable income in current and future periods. On its 2022 income tax return to be filed in 2023, the Company expects to utilize the 55.8 million tranche of Federal operating loss carryforwards that would otherwise expire. The ultimate realization of the deferred income tax assets depends upon our ability to generate future taxable income during the periods in which basis differences and other deductions become deductible and prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards. The Company assessed all available positive and negative evidence to determine whether it expects that sufficient future taxable income will be generated to allow it to realize its existing deferred tax assets. Despite the cumulative book loss incurred over the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, there are sufficient sources of future taxable income (e.g. reversing deferred tax liabilities) for management to conclude that it is more likely than not that the Company will utilize available federal net operating loss carryforwards prior to their expiration. However, realization of certain state, local and foreign net operating losses, as well as other deferred tax assets, is not certain. Changes in our current estimates due to such factors as unanticipated market conditions and legislative developments could have a material effect on our ability to utilize deferred tax assets. As a result of the Merger, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions place potential limitations on the Company s ability to fully utilize existing deferred tax assets related to federal and state net operating losses. 
 Valuation allowances of 15.7 million and 18.4 million have been recognized as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These valuation allowances are primarily against state and local net operating losses and state credits. 
 As of both December 31, 2022 and 2021, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits was 19.3 million. The liability is representative of tax positions taken where tax authorities' interpretation of the appropriate tax treatment may differ from the position the Company has taken. As of December 31, 2022, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate is 19.0 million. Accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits is recognized in interest expense. 
 Accounting for Pension and Postretirement Obligations In accounting for pension and postretirement expenses, we apply ASC 715, Compensation Retirement Benefits. A liability has been recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the unfunded status of the pension and postretirement plans. Actuarial gains (losses) and prior service costs (benefits) that arise during the period are recognized as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 The Company sponsors noncontributory defined benefit pension plans for eligible management employees, non-management employees, and certain former senior executives. We also provide healthcare and group life insurance benefits for eligible retirees. The measurement date for our pension and postretirement obligations is as of December 31. When changes to the plans occur during interim periods, management reviews the changes and determines if a remeasurement is necessary. In the fourth quarter of 2022, an amendment to the Hawaii postretirement health and life insurance plans was approved by the Union which decreased the maximum subsidy certain employees could receive for Medicare Part B Premiums to the standard amount. A remeasurement of the Hawaii postretirement health and life insurance plans was performed as of October 1, 2022. With the exception of the previously discussed amendment, no other amendments to the plans were made during 2022 or 2021. 
 
 The measurement of our pension and postretirement projected benefit obligations involves significant assumptions and estimates. Each time we remeasure our projected benefit obligations, we reassess the significant assumptions and estimates. The actuarial assumptions attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expenses and liabilities related to these plans. The most significant of these numerous assumptions, which are reviewed annually, include the discount rate, rate of return and healthcare cost trend rates.

Discount rate 
 A discount rate is used to measure the present value of projected benefit obligations. The discount rate for each plan is individually calculated based upon the timing of expected future benefit payments. Our discount rates are derived based upon a yield curve developed to reflect yields available on high-quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the average discount rate used to value the Cincinnati pension plans and postretirement plans was 5.40 . In the Successor and Predecessor periods included within 2021, the average discount rate used to value the Cincinnati pension plans was 2.70 and 2.60 , respectively, while the average discount rate used to value the Cincinnati postretirement plans was 2.80 and 2.60 , respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the average discount rate used to value the Hawaii pension plans and postretirement plans was 5.40 and 5.50 , respectively. In the Successor and Predecessor periods included within 2021, the average discount rate used to value the Hawaii pension plans was 2.70 and 2.50 , respectively, while the average rate used to value the Hawaii postretirement plans was 2.90 and 2.80 , respectively. Higher rates of interest available on high-quality corporate bonds drove the increase in the discount rates in 2022. 
 Expected rate of return 
 The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, developed using the building block approach, is based on the mix of investments held directly by the plans and the current view of expected future returns, which is influenced by historical averages. The required use of an expected versus actual long-term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized pension expense or income that is greater or less than the actual returns of those plan assets in any given year. Over time, however, the expected long-term returns are designed to approximate the actual long-term returns. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the estimated long-term rate of return was 5.80 for the Cincinnati pension plan assets, 5.00 for the union Hawaii pension plan assets and 4.50 for the nonunion Hawaii pension plan assets. In the Successor and Predecessor periods included within 2021, the estimated long-term rate of return for both the Cincinnati pension plan assets and Hawaii pension plan assets was 6.00 . The long-term rate of return on the Cincinnati and Hawaii postretirement plan assets was estimated to be zero for the disclosed periods as these plans have minimal assets with a low rate of return. Actual asset returns for the Cincinnati pension trusts were losses of 21.77 in 2022 and gains of 6.23 for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021. Actual asset returns for the Hawaii pension trusts were losses of 26.20 in 2022 and gains of 6.57 for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021. In our Successor period pension calculations, the market-related value of assets is equal to the fair market value. In our Predecessor period pension calculations, we utilized the market-related value of plan assets, which is a calculated asset value that recognizes changes in asset fair values in a systematic and consistent manner. Differences between actual and expected returns are recognized in the market-related value of plan assets over five years. 
 Healthcare cost trend 
 Our healthcare cost trend rate is developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. As of both December 31, 2022 and 2021, the healthcare cost trend rate used to measure the Cincinnati postretirement health benefit obligations was 6.5 . As of December 31, 2022, the healthcare cost trend rate for the Cincinnati plans is assumed to decrease gradually to 4.8 by the year 2032. As of both December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Hawaii postretirement plans have exceeded the per capita cost caps, and therefore, the healthcare cost trend does not apply. 
 The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to the changing market and economic conditions and other changes. Revisions to and variations from these estimates would impact liabilities, equity, cash flow and other components of pension and postretirement benefit plans expense.

At December 31, 2022, unrecognized actuarial net gains were 36.3 million and at December 31, 2021, unrecognized actuarial net gains were 3.4 million. The unrecognized net gains (losses) have been primarily generated by differences between assumed and actual rates of return on invested assets, changes in discount rates, healthcare costs and the amendment to the Hawaii postretirement health and life insurance plans in 2022. Because gains and losses reflect refinements in estimates, as well as real changes in economic values, and because some gains in one period may be offset by losses in another or vice versa, we are not required to recognize these gains and losses in the periods that they occur. Unrecognized actuarial gains or losses that exceed 10 of the projected benefit obligation are amortized on a straight-line basis over the average life expectancy of the participant group for the Cincinnati pension plans and Hawaii pension plans, the average life expectancy of current retirees for the Cincinnati postretirement plans and the average remaining service period of active employees for the Hawaii postretirement plans. 
 Regulatory Matters and Competitive Trends 
 Federal - The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the 1996 Act was enacted with the goal of establishing a pro-competitive, deregulatory framework to promote competition and investment in advanced telecommunications facilities and services to all Americans. From 1996 to 2008, federal regulators considered a multitude of proceedings aimed at promoting competition and deregulation. Although the 1996 Act called for a deregulatory framework, the FCC continued to maintain significant regulatory restraints on the traditional ILECs while increasing opportunities for new competitive entrants and new services by applying minimal regulation. Since 2009, federal regulators have devoted considerable attention to initiatives aimed at promoting investment in, and adoption of, advanced telecommunications services, particularly broadband Internet access services. Simultaneously, the FCC has been adopting measures that it believes would promote competition, protect consumers, reform universal service, and enhance public safety and national security. From 2017 through 2020, the FCC increasingly focused on eliminating burdensome and unnecessary regulations that impede broadband investment. However, with the change in administration in 2021 and the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic, measures to close the digital divide in both rural and urban areas have been at the top of the FCC s agenda and will likely remain there for the foreseeable future. The FCC currently has only four commissioners which constrains Chairwoman Rosenworcel s ability to move forward on controversial issues such as net neutrality and various consumer protection issues. Once a fifth commissioner is confirmed, giving the Democrats a majority on the Commission, we expect to see the FCC move forward with proceedings on net neutrality and data privacy. We will monitor the changing regulatory environment for any potential impacts, particularly on the following proceedings.

Universal Service 
 The federal Universal Service Fund USF is funded via an assessment on the interstate end-user revenue of all telecommunications carriers and interconnected VoIP providers. The assessment is used to support high cost, low income, rural healthcare, and schools and libraries programs. During 2022, the quarterly USF assessment rate remained near historic highs, leading for increasing calls from industry and consumer groups for the FCC to re-evaluate the USF contribution mechanism. Although there is no indication that the FCC intends to initiate a proceeding to do so in the near term, several lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the USF are pending in various circuit courts and if any are successful could up-end the entire universal service regime. 
 In October 2011, the FCC adopted new rules aimed at controlling the size of the high-cost portion of the fund and transitioning it from supporting legacy circuit-switched networks to broadband. These rules capped the high-cost fund and established a framework for transitioning support to the new Connect America Fund to bring broadband to unserved areas. Phase I reforms froze existing high-cost support and provided a mechanism for distributing additional support for qualifying price cap companies. Hawaiian Telcom received 1.4 million in Phase I support and has completed its Phase I buildout. Under Phase II, 1.8 billion of annual support was made available to expand broadband in unserved areas served by price cap ILECs. In August 2015, price cap ILECs, which had the right of first refusal, accepted over 1.5 billion of the annual Phase II support that was available to them. The Phase II support was distributed over a six-year period and carriers were required to satisfy their buildout commitment by the end of 2020. Cincinnati Bell Telephone CBT accepted approximately 2 million in annual Phase II support beginning in 2015 in exchange for a commitment to expand broadband to 6,339 Kentucky locations and 745 Ohio locations. Hawaiian Telcom accepted 4.4 million to build to 11,081 locations in Hawaii over the six-year award period. In a Report and Order adopted in January 2020, the FCC gave the price cap carriers receiving CAF II support the opportunity to elect to receive an additional year of CAF II support in 2021 in exchange for a commitment to continue providing broadband service to the CAF II areas during that time. CBT and Hawaiian Telcom accepted the seventh year of CAF II support, which provided 2.2 million for CBT and 4.4 million for Hawaiian Telcom during 2021. On September 10, 2020, Hawaiian Telcom filed a Petition for Waiver with the FCC requesting that the FCC modify its buildout obligation to account for the 523 locations destroyed or isolated by the Kilauea Volcano eruptions that began in May 2018. On June 1, 2021, the FCC released an Order granting Hawaiian Telcom s request relative to the 370 locations for which Hawaiian Telcom had completed its CAF II deployment prior to the locations being destroyed by the volcano. The additional 153 locations included in Hawaiian Telcom s original request were not included in the FCC Order after Hawaiian Telcom informed the FCC that it had identified CAF II eligible alternate locations in other areas. On January 4, 2021, Hawaiian Telcom notified the FCC that it would likely fall short of its 100 CAF II buildout milestone, but would complete the buildout by year-end 2021 taking advantage of the grace period allowed under the CAF II rules. On January 19, 2022, Hawaiian Telcom notified the FCC that it had completed the build and met its 100 buildout obligation as of December 31, 2021. 
 In August 2018, bidding concluded in the FCC s Connect America Fund Phase II auction (Auction 903). Under this reverse auction, up to 2 billion in support over a 10-year period was available to expand fixed broadband service into additional unserved high-cost areas of the country. There were 103 winning bidders and the total amount of support that will be provided to these bidders over the 10-year term is 1.5 billion. Winning bidders must build out their broadband networks within the winning geographic areas (specific census block groups covering 713,176 locations in 45 states) within the first six years of the support term. CBT and Hawaiian Telcom were both winning bidders. As a result, CBT will receive 1.1 million to extend its broadband service to 342 unserved locations and Hawaiian Telcom will receive 18.2 million to build to 3,936 unserved locations. CBT and Hawaiian Telcom auction support distributions began in May 2019 and will continue until May 2029. The build out to all funded auction locations must be completed by December 31, 2025. 
 In January 2020, the FCC adopted a Report and Order establishing the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund RDOF ), which will be used to distribute 20.4 billion over ten years to expand broadband in areas that remain unserved at the conclusion of the CAF II price cap support program. T he funds will be awarded via two reverse auctions. The Phase I auction (Auction 904) began on October 29, 2020 and concluded on November 25, 2020 with 180 winning bidders for a 10-year support amount of 9.23 billion to serve over 5 million locations. The remaining 11 billion will be distributed via a second auction to be held at a later date when more accurate broadband availability data becomes available. Cincinnati Bell was announced as the winning bidder for 26.9 million of support over the 10-year period to reach 11,131 locations in Hawaii, Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio. Cincinnati Bell assigned the Hawaii winning bids 24.3 million for 8,049 locations) to Hawaiian Telcom and the Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio winning bids 2.6 million for 3,082 locations) to Cincinnati Bell Telephone. The funding will be distributed in monthly installments over a 10-year period with buildout milestones beginning in 2024 and concluding in 2029.

Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act 
 On November 15, 2021, President Biden signed the 1 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law No. 117-58) IIJA ), which contains 65 billion for various broadband initiatives. The broadband funding includes 42.5 billion which will be distributed by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration NTIA to states for awards to public and private entities to expand broadband deployment to currently unserved or underserved areas. This NTIA funding cannot be released until the FCC releases an updated broadband map as it was charged to do by Congress in the March 2020 Broadband DATA Act (Public Law No. 116-130). The first iteration of the new broadband map was released by the FCC in November 2022. A nationwide public challenge process is currently underway and will be used to improve the accuracy of the map before the NTIA funding is released. An updated version of the map for use by NTIA is expected to be released in late second quarter 2023. In the meantime, the Company is closely monitoring the federal and state procedural rules drafting processes and continues to evaluate initiatives that will lay the foundation for potential participation once the funding is allocated to the states. The Company will pursue opportunities for funding where it deems it to be beneficial. 
 The IIJA replaced the COVID-19 Emergency Broadband Benefits EBB with a longer term low-income broadband assistance program called the Affordable Connectivity Program ACP effective December 31, 2021. Congress appropriated 14.2 billion for the ACP and consumers were transitioned from the EBB program during the first quarter of 2022. Under the ACP, participating providers must make all of their broadband plans available to qualifying consumers and cannot reject a consumer due to unpaid balances the consumer may have with the provider. Because the ACP will be available on all broadband offerings and the IIJA requires more specific measures to increase awareness of the availability of the program, participation rates have increased significantly relative to the EBB program. Both Cincinnati Bell Telephone and Hawaiian Telcom are participating in the ACP. 
 Intercarrier Compensation 
 In October 2011, in conjunction with its reform of the USF high cost support program, the FCC adopted comprehensive reforms to the switched access and reciprocal compensation rules that govern the means by which carriers compensate one another for use of their networks. The end point of the reforms is a bill-and-keep system under which all per-minute intercarrier charges are eliminated. 
 Terminating switched access and reciprocal compensation rates were phased out over a six-year period that concluded in 2018 for price cap carriers including CBT and Hawaiian Telcom. The plan contains a mechanism that enables ILECs to recover some of the lost revenue from increased end-user charges, which CBT and Hawaiian Telcom have utilized to the fullest extent possible. On October 9, 2020, the FCC released a Report and Order transitioning originating access charges for toll free calls to bill-and-keep over a three-year period. The Order does not provide a specific recovery mechanism for price cap companies to replace this lost revenue, finding instead that these companies can increase their existing Subscriber Line Charge or Access Recovery Charge to the extent they are otherwise able to do so. The impact on the Company due to this change has been minimal. CBT will adjust rates where possible to minimize the impact in future years as the phase-in continues. 
 Special Access/Business Data Services 
 In April 2017, based upon data collected from incumbent and competitive carriers, the FCC adopted a Report and Order finding that the market for all packet-based services, Ethernet services, TDM services above the DS3 level, and DS1 and DS3 transport services is competitive in all geographic markets and should no longer be subject to price regulation. Price regulation of TDM services of DS3 or below terminating to end users depends upon the competitive status of the county in which the service is provided. The FCC designated counties as competitive or non-competitive for these TDM end user services based upon historical data submitted by providers and purchasers of BDS in response to a mandatory data request issued in 2012 and supplemented with cable broadband deployment data submitted by providers in the FCC s semi-annual broadband deployment report. Price regulation was eliminated for these TDM end user services in competitive counties. In non-competitive counties, price regulation continues, although carriers are permitted to offer contract tariffs and volume and term discounts. The Order required all price cap companies to remove all competitive BDS services from their tariffs by August 2020. The list of competitive and non-competitive counties released by the FCC designated all but two of the counties in the Company s CBT ILEC territory as competitive, and in Hawaii, four of the five counties were deemed competitive. In November 2017, Hawaiian Telcom filed an application with the FCC to discontinue offering BDS services in Kalawao County (the non-competitive county). This application was granted in January 2018, and Hawaiian Telcom subsequently filed to detariff all BDS services statewide except for special federal government services, which were detariffed effective August 1, 2020. On August 1, 2020, CBT eliminated its tariffs for BDS services offered in its competitive counties which is nearly all of its BDS revenue.

Unbundled Network Elements 
 Under rules adopted pursuant to the Telecommunications Act of 1996, ILECs were required to unbundle the components of their network and provide the unbundled network elements UNEs to requesting competitive local exchange carriers at cost-based rates set by state public utility commissions in the 1990 s. The rules also required ILECs to resell their voice service to requesting competitive carriers at wholesale rates set by state regulators. Since 2019, the FCC has taken significant steps to eliminate the ILEC unbundling obligations. On July 10, 2019, in response to a forbearance petition filed by USTelecom The Broadband Association USTelecom ), the FCC granted forbearance for unbundled DS1 and DS3 transport, and on August 2, 2019, it granted forbearance from UNE loop and resale requirements. Specifically, it granted forbearance from the unbundling requirements for DS1 and DS3 transport along routes where competitive fiber is present within a half mile of the ILEC wire center endpoints that trigger the unbundling obligation. As it relates to UNE loops and resale, forbearance was granted for analog voice-grade copper loops and the avoided-cost resale requirements. Finally, on October 27, 2020, the FCC adopted a Report and Order eliminating DS0 loops in densely populated areas, DS1 and DS3 loops in areas with sufficient competition, and dark fiber loops near competitive fiber networks. All of the orders allow for a transition period during which existing UNEs can be maintained and new UNEs can be ordered. While Cincinnati Bell s ILECs may benefit from the ability to charge competitive commercially negotiated prices for these facilities and services, the Company s competitive carrier operations could see increased prices for such facilities currently purchased from other ILECs. As a result, the Company is reviewing its current UNE purchases to determine where to transition to commercial agreements for these facilities versus deploying its own facilities and will pursue the most cost effective solution in each market. 
 IP Transition 
 In late 2013, the FCC opened a proceeding to explore how to transition from the legacy circuit-switched TDM networks to Internet Protocol IP networks. Examination of the myriad of technical, legal and policy issues surrounding the IP transition moved to the forefront during 2014, and during 2015 and 2016, the FCC adopted several orders imposing additional requirements on service providers seeking to transition their networks from copper to fiber. However, during the second quarter of 2017, the FCC opened several proceedings aimed at removing barriers to wireline and wireless broadband deployment and proposed reversing several of the additional requirements imposed in 2015 and 2016. Following this review, in November 2017, the FCC revised its rules to streamline the ILEC copper retirement process and the approval process for discontinuing legacy TDM service to speed the transition from legacy copper-based TDM services to IP services. It also reformed the pole attachment rules to make it easier for providers to attach equipment necessary for next-generation networks. In 2018, the FCC adopted additional changes aimed at streamlining the pole attachment process and preempting state and local processes considered to be detrimental to broadband deployment, particularly the small cells that will be used for 5G networks. The Company does not anticipate any significant financial impact due to these proceedings, although the streamlined processes will help facilitate a smooth transition as the Company migrates from its legacy copper network to a fiber-based IP network. 
 Citizens Band Radio Service Spectrum Auction 
 
 The FCC conducted an auction of over 22,000 county-sized Priority Access Licenses PALs in the 3550-3650 MHz portion of the Citizens Band Radio Service CBRS 3.5 GHz spectrum band. This auction (Auction 105), commenced on July 23, 2020 and ended on August 25, 2020. This auction offered up to seven PALs in each county-based license area, for a total of 22,631 PALs nationwide. Each PAL consists of a 10-megahertz unpaired channel in the 3.55-3.65 GHz band. Cincinnati Bell was the winning bidder for 56 PALs (23 in Ohio, 20 in Kentucky, and 13 in Hawaii) at a total cost of 6.2 million. During 2021, Cincinnati Bell assigned the Hawaii licenses to Hawaiian Telcom and the Kentucky and Ohio licenses to Cincinnati Bell Telephone. The licenses have a 10-year build out term. 
 Broadband Internet Access/Net Neutrality 
 In an order adopted in 2005, the FCC provided wireline carriers the option of offering broadband Internet access as a non-regulated information service (comparable treatment to cable modem Internet access at that time) or as a regulated telecommunications service. In 2007, CBT and Hawaiian Telcom elected the non-regulated information service designation for broadband Internet access service. The FCC also ruled that wireless broadband service was a non-regulated information service, placing it on the same regulatory footing as other broadband services such as cable modem service and wireline DSL service.

In conjunction with the adoption of the 2005 wireline broadband Internet access order, the FCC adopted a policy statement intended to ensure that broadband networks are widely deployed, open, affordable, and accessible to all consumers. In April 2010, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals issued an opinion finding that an FCC enforcement action regarding Comcast's network management practices exceeded the FCC's authority, causing the FCC to reassess its approach to crafting net neutrality rules. In December 2010, the FCC adopted net neutrality rules that required broadband providers to publicly disclose network management practices, restricted them from blocking Internet content and applications, and prohibited fixed broadband providers from engaging in unreasonable discrimination in transmitting traffic. In January 2014, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the net neutrality order s anti-blocking and anti-discrimination requirements finding that they were akin to common carrier regulation. However, the Court upheld the transparency and disclosure requirements and found that the FCC has general authority under Section 706 of the Communications Act to promulgate rules to encourage broadband deployment. In response to the Court s decision, the FCC adopted new rules in February 2015 under which it reclassified broadband Internet access as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act. Although these new rules were appealed by numerous parties, in June 2016, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the FCC s new rules in their entirety. In November 2016, the FCC adopted an order establishing broadband privacy and security requirements for Internet service providers using its authority under Title II. The restrictive new privacy rules diverged from the Federal Trade Commission framework that had for years set the standard for protecting Internet users privacy. 
 In March 2017, Congress adopted a resolution under the Congressional Review Act to invalidate the new broadband privacy and security rules approved by the FCC in November 2016. In December 2017, the FCC issued a Declaratory Ruling restoring the information service classification of broadband Internet access service that existed prior to 2015 and affirmed that broadband consumer protection authority resides with the Federal Trade Commission. In the accompanying Restoring Internet Freedom Order , the FCC required that Internet service providers disclose information about their practices relative to blocking, throttling, paid prioritization, or affiliated prioritization. Challenges to the Restoring Internet Freedom Order were largely rejected by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. In October 2020, the FCC adopted an Order on Remand reaffirming its decision on the three discrete issues that had been remanded to it by the Court. 
 Once the FCC has a full contingent of five commissioners with the Democrats holding the majority, we expect that the Commission will once again open a proceeding on net neutrality and broadband privacy. 
 
 Robocalls 
 During 2019, the FCC took several steps to mitigate the impact of illegal robocalls and spoofed calls on consumers and businesses, including the Chairman calling on the largest voice service providers to voluntarily adopt the secure telephone identity revisited signature-based handling of asserted information using tokens STIR/SHAKEN call authentication standards developed by the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Standards ATIS ). In addition, in December 2019, Congress passed and President Trump signed into law the Pallone-Thune Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence Act Pallone-Thune TRACED Act ). Under the Pallone-Thune TRACED Act, within 18 months, all voice service providers must implement the STIR/SHAKEN framework in their IP networks and take reasonable measures to implement an effective call authentication framework in their non-IP networks. During 2020, the FCC adopted several Orders to implement the provisions of the Pallone-Thune TRACED Act that require voice service providers to take proactive steps to mitigate the origination of illegal robocalls from their networks. The Company continues to take all steps necessary to comply with the new requirements. 
 State - Ohio and Kentucky - CBT, the Company s ILEC in Ohio and Kentucky, moved from rate of return regulation to alternative regulation plans for its local services in 1994. These alternative regulation plans restricted CBT s ability to increase the price of basic local service and related services, but eliminated any earnings cap associated with traditional rate of return regulation. Under alternative regulation, price increases and enhanced flexibility for some services partially offset the effect of fixed pricing for basic local service and reduced pricing for other, primarily wholesale services.

In Ohio, statutory changes enacted by the Ohio General Assembly in 2005 gave the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio PUCO the authority to provide ILECs with pricing flexibility for basic local rates upon a showing that consumers have sufficient competitive alternatives (House Bill 218). As a result of that legislation, the Company received authority from the PUCO to increase its rates for basic local exchange service in eight of its Ohio exchanges. In September 2010, the Ohio General Assembly passed Substitute Senate Bill 162, which revised state policy concerning the provision of telecommunications service, repealed Ohio's alternative regulation legislation, and authorized additional pricing flexibility for ILEC basic local exchange service BLES - a standalone access line not bundled with other services) upon a competitive showing by the ILEC. CBT filed an application for pricing flexibility under the new rules and, in January 2011, received authority to increase the monthly rate for a standalone local service line throughout its Ohio serving area by 1.25 annually. Nearly all other retail services were removed from rate regulation, including local service lines bundled with other services. Substitute SB 162 also provided cost savings and revenue opportunities resulting from revision of the PUCO's retail rules and service standards beginning in January 2011. In June 2015, House Bill 64 was enacted, which included provisions that could relieve ILECs from their carrier of last resort obligations, pending the outcome of the FCC s IP Transition proceeding. As part of the provisions of HB 64, the PUCO is currently conducting a process that would assist in the identification of BLES customers that might not have a competitive alternative should the ILEC withdraw BLES as part of its transitioning from a circuit-switched TDM network to an IP Network. The 2015 rules have the potential to provide CBT with substantial regulatory relief in Ohio in the future; however, there is no impact in the near-term. Finally, in December 2018, the General Assembly passed House Bill 402 giving ILECs the ability to increase the monthly BLES rate by 2.00 annually and allowed them to seek approval for complete rate deregulation of BLES lines beginning in 2023 upon a demonstration that the ILEC has lost more than 50 of its access lines. CBT anticipates seeking approval for this rate deregulation during 2023. The 2018 legislation also limited the PUCO s authority over other aspects of telecom regulation, including eliminating the PUCO s authority to review and approve mergers and acquisitions for telecom companies. 
 In Kentucky, CBT entered into an alternative regulation plan in July 2006 under terms established by the Kentucky General Assembly in House Bill No. 337. Under this plan, BLES prices were capped in exchange for earnings freedom and pricing flexibility on other retail services. The caps on BLES prices expired in July 2011 providing CBT with flexibility to increase rates for basic local exchange service. In March 2015, the General Assembly passed House Bill 152, which removed the Public Service Commission's authority to regulate terms, conditions, rates or availability of any retail service in urban exchanges (greater than 15,000 Households) for a modifying utility. In March 2017, the General Assembly passed Senate Bill 10, which extended the same privileges as HB 152 to all exchanges, thus providing CBT with nearly complete deregulation for all retail services in Kentucky. 
 In Hawaii, the legislature and the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission HPUC have taken steps over the last decade to reduce rate regulation of some of the services of the Company s Hawaiian Telcom subsidiaries. 
 In 2009 and 2010, the Hawaii State Legislature required the HPUC to treat all intrastate retail telecommunications services, including intrastate toll i.e. , inter island), central exchange (Centrex), most residential and business local exchange services, integrated service digital network (ISDN) private lines and special assemblies, and directory assistance, as fully competitive under the HPUC s rules with certain qualifications. As a result, HPUC approval and cost support filings were no longer required to establish or reduce rates or to bundle service offerings; however, all service offerings were required to be priced above the service s long run incremental cost and HPUC retained the ability to suspend and investigate any offering. In 2012, the Hawaii State Legislature passed legislation that gave Hawaiian Telcom pricing flexibility to increase tariffed intrastate rates for any retail telecommunications service without approval from the HPUC, with the exception of basic exchange service i.e ., single line residential and single line business services). 
 In May 2019, the Hawaii State Legislature granted nearly full pricing flexibility to telecommunications carriers, including Hawaiian Telcom, for intrastate telecommunications services. Rate changes for retail telecommunications services no longer need to be filed with and approved by the HPUC except for any price increase greater than 6.50 on an annual basis for basic exchange services in counties with a population of less than 500,000. In addition, the traditional cost-of-service regulatory framework that required cost support for retail telecommunications service offerings and pricing above a service s long run incremental cost are no longer applicable; however, the HPUC retains the ability to investigate any offering. The legislation also eliminated the requirements for providers of fully competitive retail telecommunications services to obtain HPUC approval for financing and the sale or encumbrance of regulated property and assets, except when such sale or encumbrance occurs as part of a merger or consolidation with any other public utility. Additional relief was also granted on reporting affiliated transactions and accidents. 
 Based on these regulatory reforms, the Company can now compete more effectively in Hawaii by making decisions based on marketplace dynamics and other economic information.

Cable Franchises - Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana - The states of Ohio and Indiana permit statewide video service authorization. The Company is now authorized by Ohio and Indiana to provide service in its self-described territory with only 10-day notification to the local government entity and other providers. The authorization can be amended to include additional territory upon notification to the state. A franchise agreement with each local franchising authority is required in Kentucky. The Company has agreements with fifty-three franchising authorities in Kentucky. 
 Hawaii - In Hawaii, cable franchises must be approved by the Hawaii Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs. Since 2011, the Company s Hawaiian Telcom Services Company, Inc. subsidiary has held a cable franchise authorizing it to provide video services throughout the island of Oahu.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 The Company borrows funds at a combination of fixed and variable rates. The Company has exposure to interest rate risk, primarily in the form of variable-rate borrowings from its Term B-1 Loans, Term B-2 Loans, Revolving Credit Facility due 2026, Receivables Facility, Paniolo fiber assets financing arrangement and Digital Access Ohio Advance, as well as changes in current rates compared to that of its fixed rate debt. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement use the secured overnight financing rate SOFR as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as the benchmark for establishing the rate of interest. In the second quarter of 2022, the Receivables Facility was amended to replace the use of LIBOR with SOFR. Debt under the Paniolo fiber assets financing arrangement uses LIBOR as one of the benchmarks for establishing the rate of interest. Upon the discontinuation of LIBOR, the benchmark rate of interest for the Paniolo fiber assets financing arrangement will transition to SOFR in accordance with the terms of the arrangement. Borrowings under the Digital Access Ohio Advance use the long term applicable federal rate. 
 LIBOR is the subject of recent regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. On November 30, 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration IBA ), the administrator of LIBOR, with the support of the United States Federal Reserve and the United Kingdom s Financial Conduct Authority, announced plans to consult on ceasing publication of U.S. Dollar LIBOR on December 31, 2021, for only the one week and two month U.S. Dollar LIBOR tenors, and on June 30, 2023, for all other U.S. Dollar LIBOR tenors. While this announcement extends the transition period to June 2023, the United States Federal Reserve concurrently issued a statement advising banks to stop new U.S. Dollar LIBOR issuances by the end of 2021. 
 The Company's management periodically employs derivative and other financial instruments to manage exposure to interest rate risk and variable cash flows. The use of these types of instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to changes in interest rates carries additional risks, such as counterparty credit risk and the legal enforceability of hedging contracts. 
 The Company had 110.2 million principal amount of fixed-rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2022, excluding debt with a variable rate that is effectively fixed by related interest rate hedge contracts. The estimated aggregate fair market value of this debt was 98.2 million as of December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, the weighted average interest rate on fixed-rate debt is 6.5 . 
 At December 31, 2022, 375.0 million of our variable-rate debt was subject to non-designated floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps and 375.0 million of our variable-rate debt was subject to non-designated interest rate cap agreements. If the underlying SOFR rate increases or decreases by 100 basis points, the aggregate fair market value of the swaps at December 31, 2022 would increase by 10.9 million or decrease by 11.3 million. If the underlying SOFR rate increases or decreases by 100 basis points, the aggregate fair market value of the caps at December 31, 2022 would increase by 8.4 million or decrease by 7.2 million. 
 At December 31, 2022, the Company had remaining variable-rate borrowings not protected by non-designated interest rate swaps and interest rate caps of 821.6 million. The estimated aggregate fair market value of this debt was 813.8 million as of December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, the weighted average interest rate on this variable-rate debt was 6.7 . A hypothetical increase or decrease of 100 basis to the market interest rates associated with this variable-rate debt would result in our annual interest expense increasing or decreasing by 6.8 million.

Foreign Currency Risk 
 IT Services and Hardware currently has business operations in Canada, the U.K. and India, and foreign currency risk might arise in the future. We do not currently employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to mitigate foreign currency risk.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGIS TERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the Board of Directors and Shareowners of Cincinnati Bell Inc. 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cincinnati Bell Inc. and its subsidiaries (Successor) (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income (loss), of equity (deficit), and of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from September 8, 2021 to December 31, 2021, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from September 8, 2021 to December 31, 2021 (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from September 8, 2021 to December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB and in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Goodwill Impairment Assessment - Network Reporting Unit 
 
 As described in Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s consolidated goodwill balance was 723.5 million as of December 31, 2022 and the goodwill associated with the Network segment was 545.9 million. The Network reporting unit goodwill represents a majority of the Network segment goodwill. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets may be impaired using either a qualitative or quantitative approach. An impairment loss is measured as the excess of the carrying value of a reporting unit over its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The fair value of a reporting unit is based on a combination of valuation methods, including both income-based and market-based methods. The income approach relies on management s estimates of future revenue growth rates, terminal growth rates, EBITDA margin assumption, and discount rates. The market approach requires the determination of an appropriate peer group, which is utilized to derive estimated fair values based on selected market multiples. 
 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessment of the Network reporting unit is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the reporting unit; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management s significant assumptions related to (a)future revenue growth rates, terminal growth rate, EBITDA margin assumption, and discount rate for the income approach and (b) peer group determination and market multiples selection for the market approach; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included, among others, (i) testing management s process for developing the fair value estimate of the Network reporting unit; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methods; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the methods; and (iv) evaluating the significant assumptions used by management related to (a) future revenue growth rates, terminal growth rate, EBITDA margin assumption, and discount rate for the income approach and (b) peer group determination and market multiple selections for the market approach. Evaluating management s assumptions related to future revenue growth rates and EBITDA margin assumption involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting unit; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the Company s valuation methods and (ii) the reasonableness of management s assumptions related to terminal growth rate, discount rate, peer group determination, and market multiples selection.

Expected credit lo sses related to trade receivables are recorded as an allowance for credit losses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company establishes the allowances for uncollectible accounts using percentages of aged accounts receivable balances to reflect the historical average of credit losses as well as specific provisions for certain identifiable, potentially uncollectible balances. When internal collection efforts on accounts have been exhausted, the accounts are written off and the associated allowance for uncollectible accounts is reduced. As of the Merger Date, the Company measured their receivables at fair value in accordance with ASC 805.

 of consolidated revenue in 2022. Revenue derived from foreign operations was approximately of consolidated revenue for both the Successor period and the Predecessor period included within 2021. Revenue derived from foreign operations was approximately of consolidated revenue in 2020. Network Revenues from local telephone, special access, internet product and video services, which are billed monthly prior to performance of service, are not recognized upon billing or cash receipt but rather are deferred until the service is provided. Consumer long distance, switched access and other usage based charges are billed monthly in arrears. Network bills service revenue in regular monthly cycles, which are spread throughout the days of the month. As the last day of each billing cycle rarely coincides with the end of the reporting period for usage-based services such as long distance and switched access, we must estimate service revenues earned but not yet billed. These estimates are based upon historical usage, and we adjust these estimates during the period in which actual usage is determinable, typically in the following reporting period. Pricing of local voice services is generally subject to oversight by both state and federal regulatory commissions. Such regulation also covers services, competition, and other public policy issues. Various regulatory rulings and interpretations could result in increases or decreases to revenue in future periods. For long-term indefeasible right of use, or IRU, contracts for fiber circuit capacity, the Company may receive up-front payments for services to be delivered for a period of up to years. In these situations, the Company defers the revenue and amortizes it on a straight-line basis to earnings over the term of the contract. See Note 3 for further information. IT Services and Hardware Revenue is generally recognized as the service is provided. Maintenance on telephony equipment is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the underlying customer contract, generally one to . For hardware sales, revenue is recognized net of the cost of product and is recognized when the hardware is either shipped or delivered in accordance with the terms of the contract. Installation service revenue is generally recognized when installation is complete. We sell equipment and installation services on both a combined and standalone basis. For the sale of hardware within the Infrastructure Solutions category, the Company evaluated whether it is the principal (in which case we report revenues on a gross basis) or the agent (in which case we report revenues on a net basis). The Company has concluded it acts as an agent because it does not control the inventory before it is transferred to customers, it does not have the ability to direct the product to anyone besides the purchasing customer, and it does not integrate the hardware with any of its own goods or services.

We record all other federal taxes collected from customers on a net basis. 
 . As a result, the following awards vested and were paid on the date of acquisition: (i) time-based restricted stock units and performance-based stock units associated with the 2019 2021 long-term incentive plan granted under the 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan; (ii) time-based restricted stock units granted to non-employee directors in 2020 under the 2017 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors; and (iii) time-based restricted stock units granted under the Hawaiian Telcom 2010 Equity Incentive Plan in the first quarter of 2018 which the Company assumed responsibility for the eventual payout upon the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom. Due to the accelerated vesting and cash payment of these awards, the Company recorded additional compensation expense of million to Selling, general and administrative expense in the Predecessor period of 2021 on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there are outstanding awards granted under the 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan, 2017 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors and Hawaiian Telcom 2010 Equity Incentive Plan. 

Management uses quoted market prices and observable inputs to the maximum extent possible when measuring fair value. In the absence of quoted market prices or observable inputs, fair value is determined using valuation models that incorporate assumptions that a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. Fair value measurements are classified within one of three levels, which prioritize the inputs used in the methodologies of measuring fair value for assets and liabilities, as follows: Level 1 Quoted market prices for identical instruments in an active market; Level 2 Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (i.e., interest rates, yield curves, etc.), and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (market corroborated inputs); and Level 3 Unobservable inputs that reflect management's determination of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. These inputs are developed based on the best information available, including our own data. The determination of where an asset or liability falls in the hierarchy requires significant judgment.

. The Company has evaluated the amendments that must be applied on a retrospective or modified retrospective basis and concluded that no adjustments are necessary. The Company has applied all other amendments on a prospective basis, and the changes did not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. The ASU is intended to provide temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the U.S. GAAP guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens related to the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. ASU 2020-04 was amended in December 2022 by the provisions of ASU 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848. These amendments are effective as of any date from the beginning of an interim period that includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020 and may be applied prospectively to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated on or before December 31, 2024. The Company does not expect the standard to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. Other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements upon adoption. 

and automatically renew on a month-to-month basis. Customers are invoiced on a monthly basis for services rendered. Contracts for projects that are included within the Other revenue stream are typically short in duration and less than one year. Contracts associated with the SEA-US cable system typically range from to and payment is prepaid. The IT Services and Hardware segment provides a full range of Information Technology IT solutions, including Communications, Cloud and Consulting services. IT Services and Hardware customers enter into contracts that have a typical duration of one to five years, with varied renewal options at the end of the term. Customers are invoiced on a monthly basis for services rendered. The IT Services and Hardware segment also provides enterprise customers with Infrastructure Solutions, which includes the sale of hardware and maintenance contracts. These contracts are typically satisfied in less than twelve months and revenue is recognized at a point in time. The Company has elected the practical expedient described in ASC 606-10-32-18 that allows an entity to not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if the entity expects that the period of time between the transfer of a promised good or service to the customer and when the customer pays for such good or service will be one year or less. Customers are typically billed immediately upon the rendering of services or the delivery of products. Payment terms for customers are between and days. Subsequent to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom, the Company began recognizing a financing component associated with the up-front payments for services to be delivered under indefeasible right of use IRU contracts for fiber circuit capacity. The IRU contracts are associated with the SEA-US cable system and other dedicated fiber routes. The IRU contracts typically have a duration ranging from to . Performance Obligations A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, or a series of distinct goods or services, and is the unit of account defined in ASC Topic 606. The transaction price identified in the contract is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. Contract modifications for changes to services provided are routine throughout the term of our contracts. In most instances, contract modifications are for the addition or reduction of services that are distinct, and price changes are based on the stand-alone selling price of the service and, as such, are accounted for on a prospective basis as a new contract. Goods and services are sold individually, or a contract may include multiple goods or services. For contracts with multiple goods and services, the contract transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using the stand-alone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. Certain customers of the Company may receive cash-based rebates based on volume of sales, which are accounted for as variable consideration. Potential rebates are considered at contract inception in our estimate of transaction price based on the projected volume of sales. Estimates are reassessed quarterly. Performance obligations are satisfied either over time as services are performed or at a point in time. Substantially all of our service revenue is recognized over time. For services transferred over time, the Company has elected the practical expedient to recognize revenue based on amounts invoiced to the customer as the Company has concluded that the invoice amount directly corresponds with the value of services provided to the customer. Management considers this a faithful depiction of the transfer of control as services are provided evenly over the month and are substantially the same over the life of the contract. As the Company has elected the practical expedients detailed at ASC 606-10-50-13, revenue for these unsatisfied performance obligations that will be billed in future periods has not been disclosed. As of December 31, 2022, our estimated revenue, including a financing component, expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations associated with customer contracts that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) is million. Approximately of this revenue is related to an IRU contract entered into in the Successor period of 2021 to provide dedicated fiber routes for a period of years (see Note 9). Certain IRU contracts extend for periods of up to years and are invoiced at the beginning of the contract term. The revenue from such contracts is recognized over time as services are provided over the contract term.

Thereafter 

Network The Company has identified four distinct performance obligations in the Network segment, namely Data, Voice, Video and Other. For each of the Data, Voice and Video services, service is delivered to the customer continuously and in a substantially similar manner for each period of the agreement, the customer takes full control over the services as the service is delivered, and as such, Data, Voice and Video are identified to be a series of distinct services. Services provided by the Network segment can be categorized into three main categories that include Fioptics, Enterprise Fiber and Legacy, each of which may include one or more of the aforementioned performance obligations. Data services include high-speed internet access, digital subscriber lines, ethernet, routed network services, SONET (Synchronous Optical Network), dedicated internet access, wavelength, digital signal and IRU revenue. Voice services include traditional and fiber voice lines, switched access, digital trunking and consumer long distance calling. Video services are offered through our fiber network to residential and commercial customers based on various standard plans with the opportunity to add premium channels. To receive video services, customers are required to use the Company's set top boxes that are billed as part of the monthly recurring service. Set top boxes are not considered a separate performance obligation from video because the equipment is necessary for the service to operate and the customer has no alternative use for the equipment. Services and products not included in Data, Voice or Video are included in Other revenue and are comprised of wire care, wire time and materials projects, subsidized fiber build projects and advertising. Transfer of control of these services and products is evaluated on an individual project basis and can occur over time or at a point in time. The Company uses multiple methods to determine stand-alone selling prices in the Network segment. For Data, Video and Voice products in Fioptics, market rate is the primary method used to determine stand-alone selling prices. For Data performance obligations under the Enterprise Fiber category, and Voice, Data and Other performance obligations under the Legacy category, stand-alone selling prices are determined based on a list price, discount off of list price, a tariff rate, a margin percentage range, or a minimum margin percentage. IT Services and Hardware The Company has identified four distinct performance obligations in the IT Services and Hardware segment. These performance obligations are Communications, Cloud, Consulting and Infrastructure Solutions. Communications services are monthly services that include data and VoIP services, tailored solutions that include converged IP communications of data, voice, video and mobility applications, enterprise long distance, MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching) and conferencing services. Cloud services include storage, backup, disaster recovery, SLA-based monitoring and management, cloud computing and cloud consulting. Consulting services provide customers with IT staffing, consulting and emerging technology solutions. Infrastructure Solutions includes the sale of hardware and maintenance contracts as well as installation projects. For the sale of hardware, the Company evaluated whether it is the principal or the agent. The Company has concluded it acts as an agent because it does not control the inventory before it is transferred to customers, it does not have the ability to direct the product to anyone besides the purchasing customer, and it does not integrate the hardware with any of its own goods or services. Based on this assessment, the performance obligation is to arrange a sale of hardware between the vendor and the customer. In the instance where there is an issue with the hardware, the Company coordinates with the manufacturer to facilitate a return in accordance with the standard manufacturer warranty. Hardware returns are not significant to the Company. Within the IT Services and Hardware segment, stand-alone selling prices for the four performance obligations are determined based on either a margin percentage range, minimum margin percentage or discount from standard price list if it is determined to be representative of stand-alone selling price. For hardware sales, revenue is recognized net of the cost of product and is recognized when the hardware is shipped or delivered in accordance with the terms of the contract. For certain projects within Communications and Consulting, revenue is recognized when the customer communicates acceptance of the services performed. For contracts with freight on board shipping terms, management has elected to account for shipping and handling as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the good, and therefore, has not evaluated whether shipping and handling activities are promised services to its customers. Contract Balances The Company recognizes incremental fulfillment costs as an asset when installation expenses are incurred as part of performing the agreement for Voice, Video and Data product offerings in the Network segment in which the contract life is longer than one year. These fulfillment costs are amortized ratably over the expected life of the customer, which is representative of the expected period of benefit of the asset capitalized. The expected life of the customer is determined utilizing the average churn rate for each product. The Company calculates average churn based on the historical average customer life. We also recognize an asset for incremental fulfillment costs for certain Cloud and Communications services in the IT Services and Hardware segment that require us to incur installation and provisioning expenses. The asset recognized for Cloud and Communication services is amortized over the average contract life. Churn rates and average contract life are reviewed on an annual basis. Fulfillment costs are capitalized to Other noncurrent assets. The related amortization expense is recorded to Cost of services and products. The Company recognizes an asset for the incremental costs of acquiring a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs related to Voice, Video, Data and certain Communications and Cloud services meet the requirements to be capitalized. The contract asset established for the costs of acquiring a contract is recorded to Other noncurrent assets. Sales incentives are amortized ratably over the period that services are delivered using either an average churn rate or average contract term, both representative of the expected period of benefit of the asset capitalized. Customer churn rates and average contract term assumptions are reviewed on an annual basis. The related amortization expense is recorded to Selling, general and administrative. Management has elected to use the practical expedient detailed in ASC 340-40-25-4 to expense any costs to fulfill a contract and costs to obtain a contract as they are incurred when the amortization period would be one year or less. This practical expedient has been applied to fulfillment costs that include installation costs associated with wiring projects and certain Cloud services. In addition, this practical expedient has been applied to acquisition costs associated with revenue from certain Communications projects.

billion, including assumption of debt of million. Upon the Effective Time, the separate existence of Merger Sub ceased and the Company survived the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each of Cincinnati Bell s issued and outstanding Common Shares was converted into the right to receive per share in cash, without interest. Trading of the Company s Common Shares was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE and the Common Shares were subsequently delisted from the NYSE. Additionally, the Company redeemed Depositary Shares simultaneously with the redemption of the 6 3 / 4 Preferred Shares, at a redemption price of per Depositary Share (equivalent to per 6 3 / 4 Preferred Share), and the Depositary Shares were subsequently delisted from the NYSE. The Company accounted for this transaction as a business combination in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their estimated fair values, using primarily Level 3 inputs, as described in Note 1, as of the Merger Date. Transaction costs of the acquirer are not included as a component of consideration transferred but are accounted for as expenses in the period in which such costs are incurred, or, if related to the issuance of debt, capitalized as debt issuance costs. Acquisition-related transaction costs incurred as part of the Merger, primarily included advisory, legal and accounting fees. The valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was based on estimated fair values at the Merger Date. The allocation of consideration to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed reflect various fair value estimates and analyses, including work performed by third-party valuation specialists. The determination of the final purchase price allocation to specific assets acquired and liabilities assumed is complete.

During the second quarter of 2022, the Company recorded measurement period adjustments considered to be immaterial in nature which impacted Property, plant and equipment, Goodwill, and Deferred income tax liability. In the third quarter of 2022, an adjustment was recorded to reflect the Merger s impact on state and local tax apportionment which resulted in an increase to Deferred income tax liability and to Goodwill of million. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company recorded measurement period adjustments with the offset recorded as an increase or decrease to Goodwill which were considered to be immaterial in nature. Measurement period adjustments were applied retrospectively to the Merger Date. In connection with this acquisition, the Company recorded goodwill attributable to increased access to a diversified customer base, acquired workforce in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom and India with industry expertise and expected synergies. The goodwill related to this acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes. The Company recorded definite-lived intangible assets related to the customer relationships, trade names and technology and an indefinite-lived intangible asset related to FCC licenses. The fair value of the most significant identified intangible assets, customer relationships and trade names, were valued using the multi-period excess earnings method and relief from royalty method, under the income approach. The Company applied judgment which involved the use of significant assumptions with respect to revenue growth rates, customer attrition rate, discount rate and terminal growth rate in relation to the customer relationships and royalty rates and discount rate in relation to the trade names.

Transaction costs were expensed as incurred and recorded to Transaction and integration costs on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Cincinnati Bell Inc. incurred transaction costs associated with the Merger Agreement of million in 2022, million and million in the Successor and Predecessor periods of 2021, respectively, and million in 2020. Transaction costs of million that were paid on the Merger Date were recorded in the Predecessor period of 2021 and included as an assumed liability. Additionally, million of severance associated with a change of control clause in an employee s contract was recorded in the Predecessor period of 2021 with the final payments completed in 2022. Transaction-related bonuses of million were also recorded in the Predecessor period of 2021 but due to timing of payroll, were paid prior to the Merger Date.

The Company accounted for the Paniolo Acquisition as an asset acquisition under ASC 805-10-55 Business Combinations because the assets acquired from Paniolo do not include an assembled workforce, and the gross value of the assets acquired meets the screen test in ASC 805-10-55-5A related to substantially all of the fair value being concentrated in a single asset or group of assets (i.e., the fiber infrastructure assets) and, thus, the assets are not considered a business. The acquisition of Paniolo s assets augments the Company s existing backbone network and increases the Company s total submarine and terrestrial fiber footprint by more than miles. The aggregate purchase price paid upon closing of the Paniolo Acquisition after transactional costs was million, consisting of million in cash and million in committed purchase money financing. The assets are recorded as network equipment and buildings in Property, plant and equipment, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2022, million and million of the committed purchase money financing was recorded in Current portion of long-term debt and Long-term debt, less current portion, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2021, million and million of the committed purchase money financing was recorded in Current portion of long-term debt and Long-term debt, less current portion, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Acquisition of Agile IWG Holdings, LLC On May 2, 2022 Agile Acquisition Date ), the Company acquired Agile, based in Canton, Ohio for total cash consideration of million. Agile delivers customers, primarily located in Ohio and Pennsylvania, with middle mile, last mile and campus connectivity services through hybrid fiber wireless networks that are designed, built and managed by Agile. The cash portion of the purchase price was funded through borrowings under the Receivables Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility (see Note 7). The valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on estimated fair values at the Agile Acquisition Date. The allocation disclosed below is considered preliminary in nature due to the ongoing work by management, with the assistance of third party experts, to refine the fair value estimates. The Company considers the allocation and fair value estimates of property, plant and equipment, ROU Assets and Liabilities, Intangible Assets and Goodwill to be preliminary in nature as of December 31, 2022. The Company expects to continue to obtain information to assist in determining the fair value of the net assets acquired as of the Agile Acquisition Date while the measurement period remains open. Measurement period adjustments related to the acquisition of Agile will be applied retrospectively to the Agile Acquisition Date. The Company incurred million in acquisition expenses related to the Agile acquisition in 2022. expenses related to the Agile acquisition were recorded in the Predecessor period in 2021 or the Successor period in 2021. These expenses are recorded in Transaction and integration costs on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

I n connection with the Merger, the Company recorded million of finite-lived intangible assets and million of indefinite-lived intangible assets representing the fair values at the Merger Date. As a result of the acquisition of Agile, the Company recorded million of finite-lived intangible assets representing preliminary fair value at the Agile Acquisition Date. See Note 4 for additional information regarding the Merger and the acquisition of Agile. The change in gross carrying amounts for finite-lived intangible assets is also due to foreign currency translation on finite-lived intangible assets denominated in foreign currency. The finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives based on a number of assumptions including the estimated period of economic benefit and utilization. During the third quarter of 2020, the Company participated in Auction 105 conducted by the FCC for Priority Access Licenses of the Citizens Band Radio Service Spectrum CBRS ). The Company was the winning bidder of wireless spectrum licenses in Greater Cincinnati, Dayton and Hawaiian counties that allow the Company to further expand broadband coverage across its operating footprint. The licenses were transferred to the Company in the fourth quarter of 2020. The Company elected to perform a qualitative impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2022 and concluded that the CBRS priority access licenses are not impaired. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company purchased perpetual licenses for a block of IP addresses to be used as the Company continues to extend our fiber network and add internet subscribers. The Company s finite-lived intangible assets recorded in the Predecessor period were established in connection with completed acquisitions. They were amortized over their useful lives based on a number of assumptions including the estimated period of economic benefit and utilization. The amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets was million in 2022, million and million in the Successor and Predecessor periods in 2021, respectively, and million in 2020. impairment losses were recognized on intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2022, the Successor and Predecessor periods in 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020. years

Credit Agreement (effective 2021) In connection with the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time (the date on which the Effective Time occurred, the Closing Date ), the Company entered into a new Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement and terminated the former Corporate Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement initially provided for (i) a million senior secured revolving credit facility, including both a letter of credit subfacility of up to million and a swingline loan subfacility of up to million (the Revolving Credit Facility due 2026 and (ii) a million senior secured term loan facility (the Term B-1 Loans ). The Revolving Credit Facility due 2026 matures in and the Term B-1 Loans mature in . Borrowings under the Term B-1 Loans were used to refinance existing company indebtedness, finance a portion of the fees and expenses relating to the acquisition of the Company and the establishment of the Credit Agreement, and for working capital and general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility due 2026 may be used to provide ongoing working capital as well as for other general corporate purposes of the Company. The Company (i) incurred deferred financing costs of million related to the issuance of the Term B-1 Loans and capitalized as a reduction to the outstanding debt balances as of the Merger Date and (ii) incurred deferred financing costs of million related to the issuance of the Revolving Credit Facility due 2026 and capitalized to Other noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the Merger Date. In November 2021, the Company entered into an Amendment (the Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Agreement to provide for, among other things, (i) a million upsize to the Revolving Credit Facility due 2026, increasing the total commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility due 2026 to million, (ii) a million incremental increase to the Term B-1 Loans (the Incremental Term B-1 Loans Increase ), increasing the aggregate principal amount of Term B-1 Loans to million, and (iii) the incurrence of a new tranche of million aggregate principal amount of senior secured term loans (the Term B-2 Loans ). The proceeds of the Incremental Term B-1 Loans Increase and the Term B-2 Loans were used by the Company to redeem in full all of the Company s existing Senior Notes due 2024 (the 2024 Notes and Senior Notes due 2025 (the 2025 Notes ), and to pay fees and expenses in connection thereto. The Term B-2 Loans mature in . The Amendment No. 1 also extended the maturity of all Term B-1 Loans to and reduced the interest applicable to the Term B-1 Loans and the Revolving Credit Facility due 202 6. At December 31, 2022, borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility due 2026 were million, leaving million available. The Amendment No. 1 also provided for the transition of the benchmark rate of interest under the Credit Agreement from LIBOR to Term SOFR. As a result of the Amendment No. 1 in 2021, the Company incurred deferred financing costs of million and million related to the Incremental Term B-1 Loans Increase and the Term B-2 Loans, respectively, and capitalized the amounts as a reduction to the outstanding debt balances in 2021. In addition, the Company incurred deferred financing costs of million related to increasing the capacity of the Revolving Credit Facility due 2026 and capitalized the amount to Other noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in 2021. Borrowings under the Term B-1 Loans will, following the Amendment No. 1, bear interest, initially, at a rate equal to, at the Company s option, either: a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate (determined for any day as the rate per annum equal to the weighted average of the rates on overnight federal funds transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System of the United States arranged by federal funds brokers on such day, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on the business day next succeeding such day) plus , (ii) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by Goldman Sachs as its prime rate in effect at its principal office in New York City and notified to the Company, and (iii) to the extent ascertainable, one month Adjusted Term SOFR (determined as set forth below) plus , plus, in any such case, ; or

Annually, this bank distributes patronage in the form of cash and stock in the cooperative based on the Company s average outstanding loan balance. The Company will recognize the patronage, generally as declared, in Other (income) expense, net. The stock component will be recognized at its stated cost basis. The Company may voluntarily repay and reborrow outstanding loans under the Revolving Credit Facility due 2026 at any time without a premium or a penalty, other than customary breakage costs with respect to SOFR revolving loans. Guarantors and Security Interests, Credit Agreement All obligations under the Term B-1 Loans, Term B-2 Loans and Revolving Credit Facility due 2026 are unconditionally guaranteed by the direct parent of the Company and each of the existing and future direct and indirect material, wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries of the Company, subject to certain exceptions (including for Cincinnati Bell Funding LLC, Cincinnati Bell Funding Canada Ltd. (and any other similar special purpose receivables financing subsidiary), the Company's joint ventures, subsidiaries prohibited by applicable law or contractual obligation from becoming guarantors, immaterial subsidiaries, unrestricted subsidiaries, foreign subsidiaries, and other customary exceptions as more fully described in the Credit Agreement). Obligations outstanding under the Credit Agreement are secured by perfected first priority pledges of and security interests in (i) the equity interests of the Company held by its direct parent and (ii) substantially all of the assets of the Company and each subsidiary guarantor (subject to customary exceptions as more fully described in the Credit Agreement), including equity interests of each subsidiary guarantor under the Credit Agreement. Corporate Credit Agreement (effective 2017) In connection with the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, the outstanding loans under the Corporate Credit Agreement, dated as of October 2, 2017, were paid in full together with accrued interest and unpaid fees. As a result of the Company terminating the Corporate Credit Agreement, certain previously deferred costs and unamortized discount associated with the Corporate Credit Agreement s Revolving Credit Facility and Tranche B Term Loan due 2024 were written off in the Predecessor period of 2021. The loss on extinguishment of debt associated with the transaction was million. Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility Cincinnati Bell Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries have an accounts receivable securitization facility Receivables Facility ). In the second quarter of 2022, the Company executed amendments to its Receivables Facility, which replaced, amended and added certain provisions and definitions including the replacement of LIBOR with SOFR, a rate equal to the secured overnight financing rate as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The Receivables Facility is subject to renewal in June 2023 and has a termination date in June 2024. The maximum borrowing limit for loans and letters of credit under the Receivables Facility is million in the aggregate. The available borrowing capacity is calculated monthly based on the quantity and quality of outstanding accounts receivable and thus may be lower than the maximum borrowing limit. At December 31, 2022, the available borrowing capacity was million . Of the total borrowing capacity o f million, there were million of outstanding borrowings and million of outstanding letters of credit, leaving million available as of December 31, 2022. Interest on the Receivables Facility is based on the SOFR rate plus . The average interest rate on the Receivables Facility was in 2022. The Company pays letter of credit fees on letters of credit drawn under the securitization facility and also pays commitment fees on the unused portion of the total facility. Under this agreement, certain U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries, as originators, sell their respective trade receivables on a continuous basis to Cincinnati Bell Funding LLC CBF or Cincinnati Bell Funding Canada Ltd. CBFC ), wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries of the Company. Although CBF and CBFC are wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries of the Company, CBF and CBFC are legally separate from the Company and each of the Company s other subsidiaries. Upon and after the sale or contribution of the accounts receivable to CBF or CBFC, such accounts receivable are legally assets of CBF and CBFC and, as such, are not available to creditors of other subsidiaries or the parent company. The Receivables Facility includes an option for CBF to sell, rather than borrow against, certain receivables on a non-recourse basis. As of December 31, 2022, the outstanding balance of certain accounts receivable sold, rather than borrowed against, was million. The transferors sell their respective trade receivables on a continuous basis to CBF or CBFC. In turn, CBF or CBFC grants, without recourse, a senior undivided interest in the pooled receivables to various purchasers, including commercial paper conduits, in exchange for cash while maintaining a subordinated undivided interest in the form of over-collateralization in the pooled receivables. The transferors have agreed to continue servicing the receivables for CBF and CBFC at market rates; accordingly, no servicing asset or liability has been recorded. For the purposes of consolidated financial reporting, the Receivables Facility is accounted for as secured financing. Because CBF and CBFC have the ability to prepay the Receivables Facility at any time by making a cash payment and effectively repurchasing the receivables transferred pursuant to the facility, the transfers do not qualify for sale treatment on a consolidated basis under ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing. On January 31, 2023, the Company, together with certain of its U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries, made certain amendments (the Amendments to the Company s Receivables Facility. The Amendments amend the Receivables Facility to, among other things: (i) increase the total maximum borrowing capacity to million, (ii) separate the Receivable Facility into separate facilities, with (A) the existing Receivable Facility (the Network Receivables Facility ), as amended by the Amendments, covering receivables originated by certain U.S. subsidiaries of the Company including Cincinnati Bell Telephone Company LLC, Hawaiian Telcom Communications, Inc. and certain of their respective subsidiaries having a maximum borrowing capacity of million and (B) a new facility (the CBTS Receivable Facility covering receivables originated by certain U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries of the Company including CBTS Technology Solutions LLC and OnX Enterprise Solutions Ltd. having a maximum borrowing capacity of million, (iii) move the receivables monetization arrangements from the Network Receivables Facility to the CBTS Receivable Facility, and (iv) make applicable technical and conforming changes thereto. In addition, the Amendments extend the renewal dates of each facility to and the termination dates of each facility to . In conjunction with the Amendments, certain U.S. subsidiaries, as originators, began selling their respective trade receivables on a continuous basis to CBTS Funding LLC CBTSF ), a wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary of the Company. Although CBTSF is a wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary of the Company, CBTSF is legally separate from the Company and each of the Company s other subsidiaries. Upon and after the sale or contribution of the accounts receivable to CBTSF, such accounts receivable are legally assets of CBTSF and, as such, are not available to creditors of other subsidiaries or the parent company. In addition, certain of our variable rate debt, including debt under the Paniolo fiber assets financing arrangement (defined below), uses LIBOR as one of the benchmarks for establishing the rate of interest and may be hedged with LIBOR-based interest rate derivatives. LIBOR is the subject of recent regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms and other pressures may cause LIBOR to be replaced with a new benchmark in the future or to perform differently than in the past. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted, but could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness. Upon the discontinuation of LIBOR, the benchmark rate of interest for the Paniolo fiber assets financing arrangement will transition to SOFR in accordance with the terms of the arrangement. 7 1 / 4 Notes due 2023 In 1993, the Company issued million of 7 1 / 4 Notes due 7 1 / 4 Notes ). The indenture related to the 7 1 / 4 Notes does not subject the Company to restrictive financial covenants, but it does contain a covenant providing that if the Company incurs certain liens on its property or assets, the Company must secure the outstanding 7 1 / 4 Notes equally and ratably with the indebtedness or obligations secured by such liens. The liens under the Credit Agreement resulted in the 7 1 / 4 Notes being secured equally and ratably with the collateral granted by the Company (but not its subsidiaries) that secures the obligations under the Credit Agreement. The Company may not redeem the 7 1 / 4 Notes prior to maturity. The indenture governing the 7 1 / 4 Notes provides for customary events of default, including for failure to make any payment when due and for one or more defaults of any other existing debt instruments that exceeds million, in the aggregate. Cincinnati Bell Telephone Notes In 1998, CBT's predecessor issued million in aggregate principal of unsecured senior notes due (the CBT Notes ), which are guaranteed on a subordinated basis by the Company but not its subsidiaries. The indenture related to the CBT Notes does not subject the Company or CBT to restrictive financial covenants, but it does contain a covenant providing that if CBT incurs certain liens on its property or assets, CBT must secure the outstanding CBT Notes equally and ratably with the indebtedness or obligations secured by such liens. The liens under the Credit Agreement resulted in the CBT Notes being secured equally and ratably with the collateral granted by CBT that secures the obligations under the Credit Agreement. The maturity date of the CBT notes is in 2028, and the CBT Notes may be redeemed at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of of the principal amount of the CBT Notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity, plus accrued interest to the redemption date. The indenture governing the CBT Notes provides for customary events of default, including for failure to make any payment when due and for one or more defaults of any other existing debt instruments of the Company or CBT that exceeds million, in the aggregate. Paniolo Fiber Assets Financing Arrangement In connection with the Paniolo Acquisition in the third quarter of 2021, the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, Hawaiian Telcom Inc. HTI ), entered into a purchase money financing agreement to finance a portion of the Paniolo Acquisition. The Paniolo fiber assets financing arrangement provides for a million loan secured by the Paniolo assets acquired in the transaction. Borrowings under the Paniolo fiber assets financing arrangement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus . Upon the discontinuation of LIBOR, the benchmark rate of interest will transition to SOFR in accordance with the terms of the arrangement. The Company guarantees HTI s borrowings under the Paniolo fiber assets financing arrangement. Digital Access Ohio Advance The Company holds an interest in DAO (Note 1), which entered into a secured promissory note Digital Access Ohio Advance to finance a portion of DAO's operations. The Digital Access Ohio Advance matures in July 2033 , and the total borrowings shall not exceed million in the aggregate. Borrowings under the Digital Access Ohio Advance bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the long term applicable federal rate plus . The interest will continue to accrue and is due either upon maturity in July 2033 or upon repayment if that occurs prior to the maturity date. The Company guarantees DAO's borrowings under the Digital Access Ohio Advance. In the fourth quarter of 2022, DAO received initial funding resulting in borrowings under the Digital Access Ohio Advance of million.

Debt Covenants Credit Agreement The Credit Agreement has a financial covenant that requires the Company to maintain a Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of to 1.00 when the utilization under the Revolving Credit Facility due 2026 exceeds . In addition, the Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including but not limited to, restrictions on the Company's ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, pay dividends, make certain investments, and prepay other indebtedness, sell, transfer, lease, or dispose of assets and enter into, or undertake, certain liquidations, mergers, consolidations or acquisitions. The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default (which are in some cases subject to certain exceptions, thresholds and grace periods), including, but not limited to, nonpayment of principal or interest, failure to perform or observe covenants, breaches of representations and warranties, cross-defaults with certain other indebtedness, certain bankruptcy-related events or proceedings, final monetary judgments or orders, ERISA defaults, invalidity of loan documents or guarantees, and certain change of control events. If the Company was to violate any of its covenants and was unable to obtain a waiver, it would be considered a default. If the Company was in default under the Credit Agreement, no additional borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility due 2026 would be available until the default was waived or cured. The Term B-1 Loans and Term B-2 Loans are subject to the same affirmative and negative covenants and events of default as the Revolving Credit Facility due 2026, except that a breach of the financial covenants will not result in an event of default under the Term B-2 Loans unless and until the agent or a majority in interest of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility due 2026 have terminated their commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility due 2026 and accelerated the loans then outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility due 2026 in response to such breach in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement.

Our leases have various expiration dates through , some of which include to extend the leases for up to years. Upon adoption of ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, the Company elected not to recognize leases with terms of one-year or less on the balance sheet. The Company's leases generally do not provide an implicit rate, and therefore the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate when measuring operating lease liabilities. The incremental borrowing rate represents an estimate of the interest rate the Company would incur at lease commencement to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over the term of the lease.

Trans-Pacific Submarine Cable Commensurate with the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom, the Company gained access to the SEA-US cable. In August 2014, Hawaiian Telcom joined several other telecommunication companies to form a consortium to build and operate the SEA-US cable. The total system cost was million and was primarily composed of a supply contract with the lead contractor. The Company has a fractional ownership in the system and recognizes its fractional share at cost. In addition, the Company constructed a cable landing station in Hawaii and provides cable landing services. The system was completed in August 2017. The Company has excess capacity on its share of the SEA-US cable that it makes available to other carriers for a fee. The Company has contracted and expects to enter into additional IRU agreements with other carriers for use of this excess fiber circuit capacity . The Company may receive up-front payments for services to be delivered over a period of up to years. The Company has a remaining obligation related to the sale of capacity and other services of million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, recorded in Other noncurrent liabilities and million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, recorded in Other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, which was previously received in up-front payments.

Indemnifications During the normal course of business, the Company makes certain indemnities, commitments, and guarantees under which it may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions. These include (a) intellectual property indemnities to customers in connection with the use, sale, and/or license of products and services, (b) indemnities to customers in connection with losses incurred while performing services on their premises, (c) indemnities to vendors and service providers pertaining to claims based on negligence or willful misconduct of the Company, (d) indemnities involving the representations and warranties in certain contracts, and (e) outstanding letters of credit which totaled million as of December 31, 2022. In addition, the Company has made contractual commitments to several employees providing for payments upon the occurrence of certain prescribed events. The majority of these indemnities, commitments, and guarantees do not provide for any limitation on the maximum potential for future payments that the Company could be obligated to make. As permitted under Ohio law, the Company has agreements whereby the Company indemnifies its officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at the Company's request in such capacity. The term of the indemnification period is for the lifetime of the officer or director. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, the Company has a director and officer insurance policy that limits the Company's exposure and enables the Company to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. As a result of the Company's insurance policy coverage, the Company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal. The Company has liabilities recorded for these agreements as of December 31, 2022 or 2021. Purchase Commitments The Company has purchase commitments and blanket purchase requisitions related to certain goods and services. These agreements typically range from one to . As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the minimum commitments associated with these arrangements that are noncancellable in nature, are not considered significant. The Company generally has the right to cancel open purchase orders prior to delivery and to terminate the contracts without cause. Litigation Cincinnati Bell and its subsidiaries are subject to various lawsuits, actions, proceedings, claims and other matters asserted under laws and regulations in the normal course of business. We believe the liabilities accrued for legal contingencies in our consolidated financial statements, as prescribed by GAAP, are adequate in light of the probable and estimable contingencies. However, there can be no assurances that the actual amounts required to satisfy alleged liabilities from various legal proceedings, claims, tax examinations, and other matters, and to comply with applicable laws and regulations, will not exceed the amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements. As such, costs, if any, that may be incurred in excess of those amounts provided as of December 31, 2022, cannot be reasonably determined.

The interest rate swaps expire in . In the second quarter of 2022, the Company entered into two interest rate cap agreements to limit exposure to interest rate risk on variable rate debt. The interest rate caps each have a cap rate of with notional amounts of million and million and deferred premiums of million and million, respectively. The deferred premiums will be paid on a monthly basis over the term of the respective interest rate cap. The interest rate caps expire in . The fair value of the Company's interest rate swaps and interest rate caps are impacted by the credit risk of both the Company and its counterparties. The Company has agreements with its derivative financial instrument counterparties that contain provisions providing that if the Company defaults on the indebtedness associated with its derivative financial instruments, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative financials instruments obligations. In addition, the Company minimizes nonperformance risk on its derivative instruments by evaluating the creditworthiness of its counterparties, which are limited to major banks and financial institutions. The Company does not apply hedge accounting to the interest rate swaps and interest rate caps and records all mark-to-market adjustments directly to Other (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The fair values of the interest rate swaps and interest rate caps are categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as they are based on well-recognized financial principles and available market data.

Interest Rate Hedges In the second quarter of 2018, the Company entered into one forward starting non-amortizing interest rate swap with a notional amount of million to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. The interest rate swap became effective in June 2018 with an expiration date in . The interest rate swap resulted in interest payments based on an average fixed rate of plus the applicable margin per the requirements in the Company's former Corporate Credit Agreement. In the first quarter of 2019, the Company entered into three forward starting non-amortizing interest rate swaps, with a notional amount of million each, to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. The interest rate swaps became effective in March 2019 with expiration dates in . The interest rate swaps resulted in interest payments based on an average fixed rate per swap of , and plus the applicable margin per the requirements in the Company's former Corporate Credit Agreement. Upon inception, the interest rate swaps were designated as cash flow hedges under ASC 815, with gains and losses, net of tax, measured on an ongoing basis recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The fair value of the interest rate swaps was categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as they were based on well-recognized financial principles and available market data. The Company terminated four interest rate swaps in the Predecessor period of the third quarter of 2021 in connection with the repayment in full of the Term Loan B under the Company's former Corporate Credit Agreement that occurred as part of the Merger Agreement.

million in 2022, million and million in the Successor and Predecessor periods of 2021, respectively, and million in 2020. Pension and Postretirement Plans In connection with the Merger, the Company remeasured the pension and postretirement projected benefit obligations as of the Merger Date. As a result, the Company s pension and postretirement benefit obligations decreased million and million, respectively. The decrease in the benefit obligations was primarily driven by changes in the discount rate as well as gains to record pension assets to fair value. Additionally, actuarial gains (losses) and prior service costs (benefits) recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss of million were remeasured as of the Merger Date. Unrecognized actuarial net gains and losses for the Cincinnati Plans (defined below) and the Hawaii Plans (defined below) are primarily generated by differences between assumed and actual rates of return on invested assets, changes in discount rates and healthcare costs. Additionally, in Hawaii, a favorable amendment to the postretirement health and life insurance plan generated unrecognized gains in the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. Because gains and losses reflect refinements in estimates, as well as real changes in economic values, and because some gains in one period may be offset by losses in another or vice versa, we are not required to recognize these gains and losses in the periods that they occur. Instead, if the gains and losses exceed a 10 corridor defined in the accounting literature, the excess is amortized over a defined term. In conjunction with remeasuring the pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of the Merger Date, the amortization period for the Cincinnati pension plans in the Successor period was updated to amortize the excess over the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants from the average future working lifetime which was utilized in the Predecessor period. This change did not have an impact in the 2021 Successor period as gains or losses were not generated until December 31, the next measurement date. Additionally in the Successor period, the market-related value of assets is equal to the fair market value. Previously, the market-related value of assets was determined using a five-year moving market average method. Except for these changes described related to the Cincinnati pension plans, no other changes to methodology were made in the Successor period as a result of the Merger. Cincinnati Plans The Company sponsors noncontributory defined benefit pension plans: one for eligible management employees, one for non-management employees, and one supplemental, nonqualified, unfunded plan for certain former senior executives (collectively the Cincinnati Plans ). The management pension plan is a cash balance plan in which the pension benefit is determined by a combination of compensation-based credits and annual guaranteed interest credits. The non-management pension plan is also a cash balance plan in which the combination of service and job-classification-based credits and annual interest credits determine the pension benefit. Benefits for the supplemental plan are based on eligible pay, adjusted for age and service upon retirement. We fund both the management and non-management plans in an irrevocable trust through contributions, which are determined using the traditional unit credit cost method. We also use the traditional unit credit cost method for determining pension cost for financial reporting purposes. During 2020, the management pension plan made lump sum payments of million resulting in a reduction of the plan benefit obligation of million. The Company recorded a pension settlement cost of million in 2020 as a result of the lump sum payments to the plan participants exceeding the sum of the service cost and the interest cost component of the net pension cost. The Company also provides healthcare and group life insurance benefits for eligible retirees. We fund healthcare benefits and other group life insurance benefits using Voluntary Employee Benefit Association VEBA trusts. It is our practice to fund amounts as deemed appropriate from time to time. Contributions are subject to Internal Revenue Service IRS limitations developed using the traditional unit credit cost method. The actuarial expense calculation for our postretirement health plan is based on numerous assumptions, estimates, and judgments including healthcare cost trend rates and cost sharing with retirees. Retiree healthcare benefits were phased out as of December 31, 2018 for all employees, with the exception of a small group of grandfathered employees. The postretirement health plan also includes liabilities associated with employees who have special death benefits only. Hawaii Plans The Company sponsors one noncontributory defined benefit plan for union employees, one cash balance pension plan for nonunion employees, and two postretirement health and life insurance plans for Hawaiian Telcom employees (collectively the Hawaii Plans ). During 2022, Hawaiian Telcom's pension plans made lump sum payments of million resulting in a reduction of the plan benefit obligation of million and a nominal pension settlement cost. During 2021, Hawaiian Telcom s pension plans made lump sum payments of million in the Successor period and million in the Predecessor period resulting in a reduction of the plan benefit obligation of million and million, respectively. The Company recorded a nominal pension settlement gain in the Successor period as a result of the sum of the service cost and the interest cost component of the net pension cost exceeding lump sum payments to the plan participants. The Company recorded a pension settlement cost of million in the Predecessor period as a result of lump sum payments to the plan participants exceeding the sum of the service cost and the interest cost component of the net pension cost. During 2020, Hawaiian Telcom s pension plans made lump sum payments of million resulting in a reduction of the plan benefit obligation of million and a pension settlement cost of million. In the thi rd quarter of 2022, the Company identified a correction related to the Hawaiian Telcom postretirement health and life insurance plans liability. The adjustment resulted in an increase to the Postretirement and Other Benefits liability of million, an increase to Goodwill of million and reduction to Deferred income tax liabilities of million on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The impact of the correction is immaterial to current and prior period fin ancial statements. The postretirement health and life insurance plan was amended in the fourth quarter of 2022 to limit the amount of Medicare Part-B premium reimbursements to the standard amount resulting in an actuarial gain of million recorded to Accumulated other comprehensive income. Components of Net Periodic Cost The following information relates to noncontributory defined benefit pension plans, postretirement healthcare plans, and life insurance benefit plans for the year ended December 31, 2022, the Successor and Predecessor periods in 2021 and for the year ended December 31, 2020 for the Cincinnati Plans and the Hawaii Plans. In accordance with ASU 2017-07, only the service cost component of net benefit cost is eligible for capitalization, which was immaterial for the year ended December 31, 2022, the Successor and Predecessor periods in 2021 and for the year ended December 31, 2020.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, developed using the building block approach, for each of the plans is based on the mix of investments held directly by the plans and the current view of expected future returns, which is influenced by historical averages. Changes in actual asset return experience and discount rate assumptions can impact the Company s operating results, financial position and cash flows. The Company utilized the Pri-2012/MP-2021 mortality tables published by the Society of Actuaries to measure the benefit obligations as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Plan Assets, Investment Policies and Strategies Cincinnati and Hawaii Plans The primary investment objective for the trusts holding the assets of the pension and postretirement plans is preservation of capital with a reasonable amount of long-term growth and income without undue exposure to risk. The investment follows a glide path approach toward liability-driven investing that shifts a higher portfolio weighting to fixed income as the plan s funded status increases. The current target allocations for the pension plan assets are equity securities and investment grade fixed income securities with the exception of the Hawaii pension plan for union employees that is equity securities and investment grade fixed income securities as a result of its funded status. Equity securities are primarily held in the form of passively managed funds that seek to track the performance of a benchmark index. Equity securities include investments in growth and value common stocks of companies located in the United States, which represents approximately of the equity securities held by the pension plans at December 31, 2022, as well as stock of international companies located in both developed and emerging markets around the world. Fixed income securities primarily include holdings of funds, which generally invest in a variety of intermediate and long-term investment grade corporate bonds from diversified industries and U.S. Treasuries. The postretirement plan assets held by the Cincinnati plan are currently invested in a group insurance contract.

The fair values of Level 1 investments are based on quoted prices in active markets. The group insurance contract is valued at contract value plus accrued interest and has not been included in the fair value hierarchy but is included in the totals above. There were contributions to our qualified pension plans in 2022 and the Successor period in 2021. Contributions to our qualified pension plans were million in the Predecessor period in 2021 and million in 2020. Contributions to our non-qualified pension plans were million in 2022, million in the Successor period in 2021, million in the Predecessor period in 2021 and million in 2020. Based on current assumptions, contributions are expected to be nominal to the qualified plans and approximately million to the non-qualified plans in 2023. Management expects to make cash payments of approximately million related to its postretirement health plans in 2023. Estimated Future Benefit Payments

As of December 31, 2022, the Company had million of federal net operating loss carryforwards with a deferred tax asset value of million and million in deferred tax assets related to state and local net operating loss carryforwards. On its 2022 income tax return to be filed in 2023, the Company expects to utilize the million tranche of Federal operating loss carryforwards that would otherwise expire. U.S. tax laws limit the annual utilization of net operating loss carryforwards of acquired entities but the Company expects to fully utilize the net operating loss carryforwards. The Company assessed all available positive and negative evidence to determine whether it expects that sufficient future taxable income will be generated to allow it to realize its existing deferred tax assets. Despite the cumulative book loss incurred over the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, there are sufficient sources of future taxable income (e.g. reversing deferred tax liabilities) for management to conclude that it is more likely than not that the Company will utilize available federal net operating loss carryforwards prior to their expiration. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had valuation allowances of million and million, respectively, recorded against other deferred tax assets consisting primarily of state and local net operating loss carryforwards and state credits. Management has concluded that it is more likely than not that it will realize all other deferred tax assets. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate is million at both December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Accrued interest and penalties on income tax uncertainties were immaterial as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various foreign, state and local jurisdictions. With a few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examinations for years before 2018. The Company has not recorded deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries because of management s intent to indefinitely reinvest such earnings. Determination of the amount of any unrecognized deferred income tax liability on temporary differences arising from tax and financial reporting basis differences has not been practicable. 

 Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights Generally, the awards of stock options and stock appreciation rights fully vested from grant date and expired from grant date. Beginning in 2012, some of the stock options vested over a period based on the achievement of certain performance objectives.

business segments: Network, previously referred to as Entertainment and Communications, and IT Services and Hardware. In July 2018, the Company acquired Hawaiian Telcom. Based on the nature of the products and services offered, financial results are presented in either the Network segment or the IT Services and Hardware segment. The Network segment provides products and services that can be categorized as Fioptics, previously referred to as Consumer/SMB Fiber in Hawaii and collectively with Fioptics in Cincinnati, Enterprise Fiber or Legacy. Cincinnati Bell Telephone Company LLC CBT ), a subsidiary of the Company, is the incumbent local exchange carrier ILEC for a geography that covers a radius of approximately 25 miles around Cincinnati, Ohio, and includes parts of northern Kentucky and southeastern Indiana. Voice and data services in the Enterprise Fiber and Legacy categories that are delivered beyond the Company's ILEC territory, particularly in Dayton and Mason, Ohio, are provided through the operations of Cincinnati Bell Extended Territories LLC CBET ), a subsidiary of CBT. On July 2, 2018, the Company acquired Hawaiian Telcom. Hawaiian Telcom is the ILEC for the State of Hawaii and the largest full service provider of communications services and products in the state. On May 2, 2022, the Company acquired Agile. Agile delivers customers, primarily located in Ohio and Pennsylvania, with middle mile, last mile and campus connectivity services through hybrid fiber wireless networks that are designed, built and managed by Agile. Capital expenditures in the Network segment are incurred to expand our Fioptics product suite, upgrade and increase capacity for our internet and data networks, and to maintain our wireline network. The IT Services and Hardware segment provides end-to-end solutions from consulting to implementation to ongoing optimization to customers in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. These solutions include Cloud, Communications and Consulting services along with the sale and maintenance of major branded hardware reported as Infrastructure Solutions. In July 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom, and products such as UCaaS, hardware and enterprise long distance delivered by Hawaiian Telcom are included in the IT Services and Hardware segment. Total assets for the Company increased million as of December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021. Network assets increased million primarily due to increased property, plant and equipment and inventory related to extending the Company's fiber network as well as the addition of assets associated with the acquisition of Agile. IT Services and Hardware assets decreased million primarily due to depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2022 which was partially offset by increased goodwill due to measurement period adjustments and the adjustment to the Hawaiian Telcom postretirement health and life insurance plans (Note 11). Corporate assets decreased million. Deferred tax assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets totaled million and million as of December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to deferred tax assets and liabilities of million and million as of December 31, 2021, respectively. The decrease in net deferred tax liabilities is due primarily to higher depreciation and amortization expense reported for GAAP versus tax. This was offset, in part, by the utilization of existing federal and state net operating losses.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with A ccountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure 
 As a result of the Merger and upon approval by the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors on January 20, 2022, the Company dismissed Deloitte Touche LLP Deloitte as its independent registered public accounting firm. 
 Deloitte s report on the Company s consolidated financial statements for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor was such report qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. 
 During the Company s fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, and through January 20, 2022: (i) there were no disagreements between the Company and Deloitte on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to Deloitte s satisfaction, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with any reports on the financial statements for such years; and (ii) there were no reportable events as defined in item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. 
 The Company provided Deloitte with a copy of the disclosures required by Item 304(a) of Regulation S-K contained in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 24, 2022 and requested that Deloitte furnish the Company with a letter addressed to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether it agreed with the statements made by the Company in the Form 8-K and, if not, stating the respects in which it did not agree. A copy of Deloitte s letter, dated January 24, 2022, was filed as Exhibit 16.1 to the Form 8-K. 
 On January 14, 2022, the Audit Committee approved, effective immediately, the engagement of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP PwC as the Company s independent registered public accounting firm as of and for the years ending December 31, 2021 and 2022. 
 As part of this engagement acceptance process, the Company and PwC identified a non-audit service PwC performed for the Company that is inconsistent with the SEC and PCAOB auditor independence rules. 
 From February 1, 2021 through May 7, 2021, Hawaiian Telcom Communications, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, engaged PwC to provide post-implementation support services in connection with its implementation of a third party software solution, which included the performance of certain employee activities, deemed a management function pursuant to Rule 2-01(c)(4)(vi) of Regulation S-X under the SEC s auditor independence rules. PwC s fees associated with this service were approximately 11,400. 
 The Audit Committee and PwC separately discussed the service, which is no longer being performed, and each concluded that this matter does not impair PwC s ability to exhibit the requisite objectivity and impartiality to report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021. In reaching this conclusion, the Audit Committee and PwC noted that, (i) the service was not performed by individuals who will be part of the audit engagement team for the Company; (ii) the service was not related to any financial information system, and as a result, will not have any accounting impact on the financial results of the Company; (iii) the service was administrative in nature and the rudimentary tasks did not involve making management decisions; (iv) the service was terminated prior to the commencement of the PCAOB professional engagement period; and (v) the fee earned by PwC for the service is insignificant to PwC and the Company.
