 CONVERSIONS 
 
 In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, a conversion of natural gas volumes to BOE is on the basis of six Mcf to one bbl. BOE is based on a generic energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent economic value equivalency at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value, particularly if used in isolation. 
 
 CONVENTIONS 
 
 Unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars, all references to dollars , or US are to U.S. dollars and all references to C are to Canadian dollars. All amounts are provided on a before tax basis, unless otherwise stated. In addition, all information provided herein is presented on an after royalties basis. 
 
 The terms include , includes , including and included are to be construed as if they were immediately followed by the words without limitation , except where explicitly stated otherwise. 
 
 The term liquids is used to represent oil, NGLs and condensate. The term liquids rich is used to represent natural gas streams with associated liquids volumes. The term play is used to describe an area in which hydrocarbon accumulations or prospects of a given type occur. The Company s focus of development is on hydrocarbon accumulations known to exist over a large areal expanse and/or thick vertical section and are developed using hydraulic fracturing. This type of development typically has a lower geological and/or commercial development risk and lower average decline rate, when compared to conventional development.

 STRATEGY AND APPROACH 
 
 Ovintiv aims to be one of the largest producers of oil, NGLs and natural gas in North America. The Company is committed to producing products safely, respectfully and responsibly to drive progress and improve lives. Ovintiv s products provide energy, which in turn supports better education, healthcare and equality opportunities. Ovintiv looks to pioneer innovative ways to provide safe, reliable and affordable energy. 
 
 The Company s culture is unique and underpinned by its core values of one, agile, innovative and driven. The Company manages risk by driving efficiency gains across its business, creating optionality from a high-quality multi-basin and multi-product portfolio, building flexibility into commercial agreements and leveraging an active fundamentals team that provides commodity price risk management, with results being delivered in a socially and environmentally responsible manner. 
 
 Ovintiv aims to be the leading North American producer of oil, NGLs and natural gas by delivering quality returns on the capital the Company invests in its multi-basin portfolio, generating free cash flows and providing significant cash returns to its shareholders. The Company seeks to maximize shareholder returns through its transparent and durable capital allocation framework, which includes a combination of base dividends, share buybacks and/or variable dividends, determined on a quarterly basis at the discretion of the Company s Board of Directors. 
 
 The pillars that support the execution of the Company s strategy include: 

Execution Excellence - The Company is a leader in horizontal drilling utilizing cube development and innovative completions methods that leverage advanced technology. Applicable technologies and operating practices are quickly deployed across the Company s multi-basin portfolio with the goal of achieving a competitive advantage. Technology and innovation enable Ovintiv to reduce development risks, capture capital and operating efficiencies, and sustainably enhance margins and returns while minimizing its 

 7 

environmental footprint. Ovintiv strives to be a leading operator that delivers quality returns through the commodity price cycle. 

Disciplined Capital Allocation - Ovintiv s capital investment strategy focuses on a limited number of assets to generate cash flows and quality returns. Ovintiv s investment strategy is flexible, allowing for capital programs to be quickly right-sized in response to changes in the macro commodity-price environment, which helps to preserve excess cash flows to return to shareholders and to maintain balance sheet strength. 

Commercial Acumen & Risk Management - While Ovintiv s multi-product, multi-basin portfolio and capital investment strategy provide optionality and flexibility, the Company also leverages its innovative supply chain and market fundamentals expertise to support capital allocation and quickly respond in a dynamic commodity price environment. The Company actively monitors and seeks to manage market volatility through diversification of price risks and market access risks with the aim of enhancing margins and returns. 

Drive Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance Progress - Ovintiv embraces stakeholder and societal expectations as it continues to grow and change in response to the evolving landscape with respect to climate change, diversity, equity, inclusion and governance matters. Ovintiv believes that strong ESG performance can directly contribute to increased efficiency, economic performance, value creation and sustainability. Since 2005, the Company has published an annual Sustainability Report, which communicates Ovintiv s ESG performance and tracks progress on key issues important to stakeholders. Additional information on Ovintiv s ESG practices can be found on the Company s sustainability website at sustainability.ovintiv.com . 

As part of the Company s commitment to reducing its environmental footprint, Ovintiv has established an emissions reduction task force chaired by the Company s Chief Operations Engineer with the purpose of identifying and evaluating operational emission reduction opportunities and other environmental improvements. The Company also voluntarily participates in certain emission reduction programs and has adopted a range of strategies to help reduce emissions from its operations. Strategies include incorporating new and proven technologies and collaborations with third-party partners, such as governmental and other organizations, to knowledge share and further advance future potential emission reduction technology. The Company continues to focus on reducing its Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, by adopting strategies intended to improve wellsite and completions designs that reduce flaring, fluid usage, methane venting and fugitive emissions. In addition, Ovintiv s reduction targets for Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions intensity are tied to the Company s employees annual compensation program. 
 
 The foundation of the Company s strategy is built upon the following elements: 

Top Tier Multi-Basin Assets - The Company holds a multi-basin, multi-product portfolio of prolific North American plays, including: Permian in west Texas, Anadarko in west-central Oklahoma, Bakken in northwest North Dakota, Uinta in northeastern Utah and Montney in northeast British Columbia and northwest Alberta. Ovintiv s multi-basin portfolio both diversifies risk and provides optionality due to the commodity mix of the Company s plays and their geographic locations. As of December 31, 2022, the Company s estimated net proved reserves comprised approximately 24 percent oil, 26 percent NGLs, which includes six percent plant condensate, and 50 percent natural gas. 

Financial Strength - The Company has ample access to liquidity to allow management of its business through commodity price cycles. Ovintiv works to maximize its financial flexibility by quickly adapting capital programs to reflect changes in commodity prices and market conditions. The Company leverages its fundamentals expertise by actively monitoring and managing price volatility as well as diversifying price risk through market access. 

8 

Currently, the Company has access to committed credit facilities totaling 3.5 billion maturing in July 2026, at attractive rates. In addition, Ovintiv has continued to focus on debt reduction, reducing total long-term debt by over 3.3 billion since the end of 2020. 

People and Values - Ovintiv s core values of one, agile, innovative and driven guide the Company s actions. The foundational values of integrity, safety, sustainability, trust and respect guide the organization s behavior and define expectations in the workplace. Ovintiv takes pride not only in what the Company achieves, but also in how its goals are accomplished.

Permian 
 
 Permian is an oil play located in west Texas in Midland, Martin, Howard, Glasscock, Andrews and Upton counties. The properties within the play are characterized by exposure of up to 10 potential producing horizons spanning approximately 3,000 feet of stratigraphy or stacked pay, an extensive production history and developed infrastructure. At December 31, 2022, the Company controlled approximately 114,000 net acres in the play. The current focus of development is on the Spraberry and Wolfcamp formations in the Midland basin, where Ovintiv holds a large position. During 2022, the Company drilled 62 horizontal net wells. In 2022, production averaged approximately 62.7 Mbbls/d of oil, approximately 29.4 Mbbls/d of NGLs and approximately 149 MMcf/d of natural gas. 
 
 The Company has primarily developed the play using its cube development model and simul-frac technique. Cube development utilizes multi-well pads and frac spreads running in parallel to simultaneously access multiple layers of stacked pay to maximize product recovery. Simul-frac technique is the process of fracing pairs of wells at the same time instead of a single well. These advanced development approaches optimize cycle times and increase capital efficiency, while minimizing the surface footprint. During 2022, the Company focused on increasing drilling and completions performance which reduced cycle times, accelerating spud to first sales by approximately 12 percent compared to the prior year. Further efficiencies were achieved through holding onsite inventory of locally sourced wet sand. In addition to reducing costs, wet sand has reduced sand related CO2 emissions as well as airborne silica dust at the workplace and in surrounding communities. During 2022, the Company also focused on expanding its inventory of drilling locations by drilling 13 percent of the incremental wells in new zones or at greater density within the standard cube. 
 
 Oil and natural gas facilities include field gathering systems, storage batteries, saltwater disposal systems, separation equipment and pumping units. The majority of Ovintiv s acreage and associated oil production is dedicated to a pipeline gathering agreement, which has a total remaining term of 11 years with optional renewal terms. In the event of pipeline capacity constraints, Ovintiv s oil production is trucked by various third parties. Natural gas is delivered by the Company to the purchaser s meter and pipeline interconnection point in the field. 
 
 Anadarko 
 
 Anadarko is a liquids-rich play located in west-central Oklahoma in Blaine, Canadian, Custer, Dewey, Garvin, Grady, Kingfisher, Major, McClain and Stephens counties. The majority of the Anadarko properties are located in the black oil window of the STACK which comprises the Woodford, Meramec and Osage formations spanning up to 800 feet of stratigraphy and in the SCOOP which comprises the Woodford, Sycamore, Caney and Springer formations spanning up to 1,150 feet of stratigraphy. The play is characterized by silt, shale and carbonate formations which provide multiple potential oil and natural gas targets making the play ideal for cube development and long laterals. At December 31, 2022, the Company controlled approximately 352,000 net acres in the play, with development currently targeting liquids-rich prospects in the Woodford, Springer, Meramec and Caney formations. During 2022, the Company drilled 54 horizontal net wells. In 2022, production averaged approximately 35.5 Mbbls/d of oil, approximately 43.2 Mbbls/d of NGLs and approximately 286 MMcf/d of natural gas. 
 
 The Company is developing the play using its cube development model and simul-frac technique. During 2022, Ovintiv focused on increasing drilling performance and well economics by drilling longer laterals and reducing cycle times which accelerated spud to first sales by approximately 11 percent compared to the prior year. 
 
 The play has significant existing infrastructure and ample access to major pricing hubs, including Cushing, Oklahoma, the U.S. Gulf Coast, Mont Belvieu, Texas and Conway, Kansas, and a number of Mid-Continent natural gas pipelines. The Company s oil and natural gas production is gathered at various production facilities, with the majority of oil subsequently transported to sales points by pipeline or sold at and trucked from tank batteries. The majority of Ovintiv s acreage and associated production is dedicated to long-term gathering and processing agreements with various third parties, which have remaining terms ranging from two to nine years. 
 12 

Bakken 
 
 Bakken is an oil play located primarily in McKenzie and Dunn counties of North Dakota. The focus of development includes targets in the Bakken and Three Forks formations. During 2022, the Company focused on improving completions performance and wellbore architecture as well as enhancing well economics by implementing innovative and successful practices from across the Company s portfolio. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, the Company controlled approximately 46,000 net acres in the play. During 2022, the Company drilled 25 horizontal net wells. Production averaged approximately 15.3 Mbbls/d of oil, approximately 8.2 Mbbls/d of NGLs and approximately 36 MMcf/d of natural gas. 
 
 The majority of Ovintiv s acreage and associated production is dedicated to a gathering and processing agreement, which has a remaining term of nine years. Ovintiv uses a combination of pipelines and trucks to transport oil to sales points. 
 Uinta 
 
 Uinta is an oil play located in northeastern Utah primarily in Duchesne and Uintah counties. The Uinta basin provides a deep inventory of multiple stacked oil horizons with approximately 2,600 feet of oil saturated reservoir rock. At December 31, 2022, the Company controlled approximately 130,000 net acres in the play. During 2022, the Company drilled 12 horizontal net wells. Production averaged approximately 17.9 Mbbls/d of oil, approximately 1.1 Mbbls/d of NGLs and approximately 16 MMcf/d of natural gas. 
 
 During 2022, the Company drilled 14 gross wells on six pads utilizing multi-well pad development which captured capital efficiencies. 
 
 Oil production from Uinta is waxy, ranging from yellow to black, and is transported from the lease by truck due to the high heat pour point characteristics of the oil. The Company has oil volume minimum delivery commitments with one refinery in the Salt Lake City area through 2025. Oil production that is not subject to sales commitments is sold monthly in spot markets or transported by rail to other markets, mainly the Gulf Coast.

Montney 
 
 Montney is primarily a condensate-rich natural gas play located in northeast British Columbia and northwest Alberta. The play includes properties that are located in the Montney formation where Ovintiv is primarily targeting the development of condensate-rich locations, but also includes landholdings with incremental producing formations such as Cadomin and Doig. The Montney formation is characterized by up to six stacked horizons spanning over 1,000 feet of stratigraphy and is being developed exclusively with horizontal well technology. In 2022, total production from the play averaged approximately 47.5 Mbbls/d of oil and NGLs and approximately 970 MMcf/d of natural gas. As at December 31, 2022, the Company controlled approximately 861,000 net acres and 497,000 net undeveloped acres in the play. 
 
 Ovintiv utilizes cube development to precisely place and space each well drilled to maximize value and resource extraction within the productive pay. During 2022, Ovintiv focused on drilling longer laterals in less time and completing wells faster while improving sand proppant efficiency. Drilling, completions and production efficiencies were captured by stacking innovation initiatives such as redesigned drill bits, motor optimization, real time frac optimization, simul-frac techniques, multi-coil tubing and integrated service rigs. In 2022, the Company drilled approximately 52 horizontal net wells. Ovintiv also focused on reducing its emissions footprint by implementing frac fleets operating on natural gas, which also resulted in lower fuel costs, logistical complexity of sourcing diesel, and reducing our operational footprint. 
 
 Ovintiv has access to natural gas processing capacity of approximately 1,528 MMcf/d, of which approximately 1,313 MMcf/d is under contract with third parties under varying terms and duration and approximately 215 MMcf/d of processing capacity which is owned by the Company. In addition, Ovintiv has access to liquids handling capacity of approximately 126 Mbbls/d of which approximately 93 Mbbls/d is contracted with third parties under varying terms and duration, and approximately 33 Mbbls/d is owned by the Company. 
 
 Other Operations:

In 2022, natural gas production averaged approximately 4 MMcf/d. 
 
 PROVED RESERVES AND OTHER OIL AND NATURAL GAS INFORMATION 
 
 The process of estimating oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves is complex and requires significant judgment. The Company s estimates of proved reserves and associated future net cash flows were evaluated and prepared by the Company s internal qualified reserves evaluators QREs and are the responsibility of management. As a result, Ovintiv has developed internal policies that prescribe procedures and standards to be followed for preparing, estimating and recording reserves in compliance with SEC definitions and regulations. Ovintiv s policies assign responsibilities for compliance in booking reserves and require that reserve estimates be made by its QREs. A QRE is an individual who has a minimum of five years practical experience, with at least three recent years of experience in the evaluation of reserves, and has a degree in petroleum engineering, geology, or other discipline of engineering or physical science. 
 
 Ovintiv s Corporate Reserves Group, which consists of five staff, report to the Vice-President, Strategy, Corporate Reserves and Midstream who reports to the Executive Vice-President & Chief Financial Officer. The Corporate Reserves Group is responsible for overseeing the internal preparation, review and approval of the reserves estimates and is separate and independent from the preparation of reserves estimates, which are done by operations teams who report to Ovintiv s Executive Vice-President & Chief Operating Officer. The Corporate Reserves Group maintains Ovintiv s internal policies that prescribe procedures and standards to be followed for preparing, estimating and recording reserves. This includes the Company s reserves manual and conducting internal audits of the procedures, records and controls relating to the preparation of reserves estimates. Ovintiv s QREs receive ongoing education on the fundamentals of SEC definitions and reserves reporting through the review of the Company s reserves manual and internal training programs administered by the Corporate Reserves Group. The Corporate Reserves Group also oversees the engagement of independent qualified reserves evaluators IQREs or independent qualified reserves auditors IQRAs ), if any, retained by the Company. 
 
 As a member of the Corporate Reserves Group, the Company s Director, Reserves is primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of proved reserves estimates. The Director, Reserves has a Bachelor of Science with a degree in Petroleum Engineering from Colorado School of Mines and is a member of the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers (Denver Chapter). The Director, Reserves has over 23 years of experience in upstream oil and gas and has held numerous positions in reservoir, development and production engineering. 
 
 Annually, each play is reviewed in detail by the QREs, the Corporate Reserves Group, subject matter experts and the Company s executive officers, as appropriate. The Corporate Reserves Group also conducts a separate review to ensure the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and that the reserves estimates are free from material misstatement. The final reserves estimates are reviewed by Ovintiv s Reserves Committee of the Board of Directors (the Reserves Committee ), for approval by the Board of Directors. The Reserves Committee comprises directors that are independent and familiar with estimating oil and natural gas reserves and disclosure requirements. The Reserves Committee provides additional oversight to the Company s reserves process, meeting with management periodically to review the reserves process, the portfolio of properties, results and related disclosures. The Reserves Committee is also responsible for reviewing the qualifications and appointment of IQREs or IQRAs, if any, retained by the Company, including recommending the selection of such IQREs or IQRAs to the Board of Directors for its approval, and meets with such IQREs or IQRAs to review their reports. 
 
 For year-ended December 31, 2022, the Company involved IQRAs to audit the Company s internal oil and natural gas reserve estimates for certain properties. In 2022, Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. audited 36 percent of the Company s estimated U.S. proved reserve volumes and McDaniel & Associates Consultants Ltd. audited 26 percent of the Company s estimated Canadian proved reserve volumes. An audit of reserves is an examination of a company s oil and natural gas reserves by an independent petroleum consultant that is conducted for the purpose of expressing an opinion as to whether such estimates, in aggregate, are reasonable and have been estimated and presented in conformity with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation methods and procedures. 
 15 

Proved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil, natural gas and NGLs which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. To be considered proved, oil and natural gas reserves must be economically producible before contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. Also, the project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time. Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years. 
 The Company s reserve estimates are conducted from fundamental petrophysical, geological, engineering, financial and accounting data. Data used in reserves assessments may include information obtained directly from the subsurface through wellbores such as well logs, reservoir core samples, fluid samples, static and dynamic pressure information, production test data, and surveillance and performance information. Reserves are estimated based on production decline analysis, analogy to producing offsets, detailed reservoir modeling, volumetric calculations or a combination of these methods, based on the unique circumstances of each reservoir and the dataset available at the time of the estimate. The tools used to interpret the data may include proprietary and commercially available reservoir modeling and simulation software. Reservoir parameters from analogous reservoirs may be used as appropriate. In the case of producing reserves, the emphasis is on decline analysis where volumetric analysis is considered to limit forecasts to reasonable levels. Undeveloped reserves are estimated by analogy to producing offsets, with consideration of volumetric estimates of in place quantities. All locations to which proved undeveloped reserves have been assigned are subject to a development plan adopted by the Company s management. In all cases, the Company s reserve estimates consider technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results, having regard to economic considerations, as defined in the SEC regulations. 
 
 In general, estimates of economically recoverable reserves and the future net cash flows therefrom are based on a number of variable factors and assumptions, such as historical production from the properties, production rates, ultimate reserve recovery, timing and amount of capital expenditures, marketability of oil and natural gas, royalty rates, the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies, and operating costs, all of which may vary materially from actual results. For those reasons, among others, estimates of the economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves attributable to any group of properties and estimates of future net revenues associated with reserves may vary and such variations may be material. The actual production, revenues, taxes, and development and operating expenditures with respect to the reserves associated with the Company s properties may vary from the information presented herein, and such variations could be material. 
 
 SEC regulations require that proved reserves be estimated using existing economic conditions (constant pricing). Based on this methodology, the Company s reserves have been calculated utilizing the 12-month average trailing historical price for each of the years presented prior to the effective date of the report. The 12-month average is calculated as an unweighted average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month. The reserve estimates provided herein are estimates only and there is no guarantee that the estimated reserves will be recovered. 
 
 Ovintiv does not file any estimates of total net proved reserves with any U.S. federal authority or agency other than the SEC and the Department of Energy DOE ). Reserve estimates filed with the SEC correspond with the estimates of the Company s reserves contained in its reports. Reserve estimates, for the Company s U.S. assets, are filed with the DOE and are based upon the same underlying technical and economic assumptions as the estimates of Ovintiv s reserves that are filed with the SEC however, the DOE requires reports to include the interests of all owners in wells that Ovintiv operates and to exclude all interests in wells that Ovintiv does not operate. 
 
 The reserves and other oil and natural gas information set forth below has an effective date of December 31, 2022 and was prepared as of January 13, 2023. The audit reports prepared by the IQRAs are attached in Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 The following table is a summary of the Company s proved reserves. Estimates of future net cash flows and discounted future net cash flows derived from proved reserves information can be found in Note 27 to Ovintiv s audited Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 Changes in reserve estimates resulting from application of improved recovery techniques are included in revisions of previous estimates. 

In 2022, the Company s proved reserves increased by 15.4 MMBOE from 2021 primarily due to extensions and discoveries of 370.6 MMBOE from successful drilling leading to increased technical delineation, as well as new proved undeveloped locations resulting from updated development plans primarily in Montney and Permian. Extensions and discoveries include 26.9 MMBOE as a result of drilling wells in 2022 that were not previously classified as proved undeveloped reserves. Approximately 44 percent of the 2022 extensions and discoveries were oil, condensate and NGLs. Revisions and improved recovery of previous estimates were negative 189.2 MMBOE 
 17 

primarily due to changes in the approved development plan of 142.5 MMBOE, negative price revisions of 49.6 MMBOE from higher royalties in Canada due to higher 12-month average trailing prices , and 1.5 MMBOE from revisions other than price, partially offset by 4.4 MMBOE from infill drilling locations. 
 
 Production for 2022 was 186.2 MMBOE. Purchases of 45.9 MMBOE were primarily properties with oil and liquids-rich potential in Permian. Sales of 25.7 MMBOE were primarily due to the divestitures of properties held in Uinta. 
 
 Proved reserves are estimated based on the average first-day-of-month prices during the 12-month period for the respective year. The average prices used to compute proved reserves at December 31, 2022 were WTI: 93.82 per bbl, Edmonton Condensate: C 121.18 per bbl, Henry Hub: 6.36 per MMBtu, and AECO: C 5.65 per MMBtu. Prices for oil, NGLs and natural gas are inherently volatile.

As of December 31, 2022, there are no proved undeveloped reserves that are expected to remain undeveloped for five years or more. 
 
 Extensions and discoveries of 343.7 MMBOE of proved undeveloped reserves were the result of successful drilling leading to increased technical delineation, as well as new proved undeveloped locations resulting from updated development plans primarily in Montney and Permian. Revisions of prior estimates of proved undeveloped reserves were negative 168 MMBOE primarily due to development plan changes of 142.5 MMBOE, downward revision of 26.7 MMBOE from higher royalties in Canada due to higher 12-month average trailing price, and 2.9 MMBOE from well performance, partially offset by 4.1 MMBOE from infill drilling locations. Development plan changes are driven by portfolio optimization and changing commodity prices as compared to the prior year. 
 Conversions of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed status were 161.3 MMBOE, equating to 17 percent of the total prior year-end proved undeveloped reserves. Ovintiv s five-year average proved undeveloped conversion ratio is above 20 percent. Approximately 56 percent of proved undeveloped reserves conversions occurred in Permian and Anadarko in the U.S. and 36 percent occurred in Montney in Canada. The Company spent approximately 1,195 million to develop proved undeveloped reserves in 2022, of which approximately 83 percent related to the U.S. properties and 17 percent related to the Canadian properties. 
 
 Purchases of proved undeveloped reserves of 41.1 MMBOE relate primarily to properties with liquids-rich potential in Permian, while the sale of proved undeveloped reserves of 3.1 MMBOE relate primarily to properties in Montney.

 Undeveloped acreage refers to those acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of economic quantities of oil or gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves. 

Of the total 2.0 million net acres, approximately 1.9 million net acres is held by production. The table above includes acreage subject to leases that will expire over the next three years: 2023 - approximately 16,400 net acres 2024 - approximately 3,500 net acres and 2025 - approximately 18,300 net acres, if the Company does not establish production or take any other action to extend the terms. For acreage that the Company intends to further develop, Ovintiv will perform operational and administrative actions to continue the lease terms that are set to expire. As a result, it is not expected that a significant portion of the Company s net acreage will expire before such actions occur. 
 
 Title to Properties 
 
 As is customary in the oil and natural gas industry, a preliminary review of title records, which may include opinions or reports of appropriate professionals or counsel, is made at the time Ovintiv acquires properties. The Company believes that title to all of the various interests set forth in the above table is satisfactory and consistent with the standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry, subject only to immaterial exceptions that do not detract substantially from the value of the interests or materially interfere with their use in Ovintiv s operations. The interests owned by Ovintiv may be subject to one or more royalty, overriding royalty, or other outstanding interests (including disputes related to such interests) customary in the industry. The interests may additionally be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, and orders of arbitral or governmental authorities. In addition, the interests may be subject to burdens such as production payments, net profits interests, liens incident to operating agreements and current taxes, development obligations under oil and natural gas leases, and other encumbrances, easements, and restrictions, none of which detract substantially from the value of the interests or materially interfere with their use in the Company s operations. 
 21 

MARKETING ACTIVITIES 
 
 Market Optimization activities are managed by Ovintiv s Midstream, Marketing & Fundamentals team, which is responsible for the sale of the Company s proprietary production and enhancing the associated netback price. In marketing its production, Ovintiv looks to minimize market related curtailment, maximize realized prices and manage concentration of credit-risk exposure. Market Optimization activities include third party purchases and sales of product to provide operational flexibility and cost mitigation for transportation commitments, product type, delivery points and customer diversification. In conjunction with certain divestitures, the Company has also agreed to market and transport certain portions of the acquirer s production with remaining terms of less than one year. 
 
 Ovintiv s produced oil, NGLs and natural gas, are primarily marketed to refiners, local distributing companies, energy marketing companies and aggregators. Prices received by Ovintiv are based primarily upon prevailing market index prices in the region in which it is sold . Prices are impacted by regional and global supply and demand and by competing fuels in such markets. 
 
 Ovintiv s oil production is sold under short-term and long-term contracts that range up to three years or under dedication agreements, for which prices received by Ovintiv are based primarily upon the prevailing index prices in the relevant region where the product is sold. The Company also has firm transport contracts to deliver oil to other downstream markets. Ovintiv s NGLs production is sold under short-term and long-term contracts that range up to six years, or under dedication arrangements at the relevant market price at the time the product is sold. Ovintiv s natural gas production is sold under short-term and long-term delivery contracts with terms ranging up to one year in duration, at the relevant monthly or daily market price at the time the product is sold. The Company also has firm transport contracts to deliver natural gas production to other downstream markets, including Dawn and Chicago. 
 
 Ovintiv also seeks to mitigate the market risk associated with future cash flows by entering into various financial derivative instruments used to manage price risk relating to produced oil, NGLs and natural gas. Details of contracts related to Ovintiv s various financial risk management positions are found in Note 24 to Ovintiv s audited Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 The Company enters into various contractual agreements to sell oil, NGLs and natural gas, some of which require the delivery of fixed and determinable quantities. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was committed to deliver approximately 38.3 MMbbls of oil and approximately 32 MMcf of natural gas in the USA Operations and approximately 8.6 MMbbls of oil and NGLs and approximately 38 MMcf of natural gas in the Canadian Operations with varying contract terms. The Company has one oil minimum volume sales contract related to Uinta production in Utah. Given the limited access to transportation and refining facilities resulting from the paraffin content in Uinta oil production, volatility in commodity prices and changes in capital and development plans, deficiency fees incurred can vary and may be incurred on the remaining committed deliveries of 17 Mbbls/d through August 2025.

In general, Ovintiv expects to fulfill its delivery commitments with oil, NGLs and natural gas production from proved developed reserves, with longer term delivery commitments to be filled from the Company s proved undeveloped reserves. Where proved reserves are not sufficient to satisfy the Company s delivery commitments, Ovintiv can and may use spot market purchases to satisfy the respective commitments. In addition, for the Company s long-term transportation and processing agreements, Ovintiv also expects to fulfill delivery 
 22 

commitments from the future development of resources not yet characterized as proved reserves. W here delivery commitments are not transferred along with property divestitures, Ovintiv may market and transport certain portions of the acquirer s production to meet the delivery requirements. 
 
 In addition, oil, NGLs and natural gas production from the Company s reserves are not subject to any priorities or curtailments that may affect quantities delivered to its customers or any priority allocations or price limitations imposed by federal or state regulatory agencies, or any other factors beyond the Company s control that may affect Ovintiv s ability to meet contractual obligations other than those discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 MAJOR CUSTOMERS 
 
 In connection with the marketing and sale of the Company s oil, NGLs and natural gas production and purchased product for the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company had one customer, Vitol Inc., which individually accounted for more than 10 percent of the Company s consolidated revenues (2021 and 2020 - one customer, Vitol Inc.). Ovintiv does not believe that the loss of any single customer would have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition or results of operations. Further information on Ovintiv s major customers is found in Note 2 to Ovintiv s audited Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 COMPETITION 
 
 The Company s competitors include national, integrated and independent oil and natural gas companies, as well as oil and natural gas marketers and other participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial, commercial and individual consumers. All aspects of the oil and natural gas industry are highly competitive and Ovintiv actively competes with other companies in the industry, particularly in the following areas: 

Exploration for and development of new sources of oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves 

Reserves and property acquisitions 

Transportation and marketing of oil, NGLs, natural gas and diluents 

Access to services and equipment to carry out exploration, development and operating activities and 

Attracting and retaining experienced industry personnel. 

The oil and natural gas industry also competes with other industries focused on providing alternative forms of energy to consumers. Competitive forces can lead to cost increases or result in an oversupply of oil, NGLs or natural gas. 
 
 HUMAN CAPITAL 
 
 Ovintiv strives to be one of the most competitive energy companies in North America, bringing together the brightest minds and best technologies to fuel innovation and maximize operational performance and results. Recruiting, developing and retaining Ovintiv s workforce is vital to the Company s future success.

 Ovintiv s success is the direct result of a talented workforce and the Company s expectation to share ideas and work together to achieve company goals. Ovintiv s culture is defined by constant innovation, promoting internal collaboration as a way for employees to implement successful strategies and best practices across the Company s business. Opportunities are provided for Ovintiv s employees to further develop leadership, technical and business skills through on-the-job work experiences and job rotations, development opportunities, networking and mentoring circles, as well as formal learning programs and instructor led workshops. The Company also offers new graduate and intern opportunities in both technical and professional disciplines to support the recruitment of top talent, hiring an average of 16 new graduates and 26 interns per year over the past three years. In addition, the Company has a robust approach to succession planning for key personnel which assesses the competencies, experience, leadership capabilities, and development opportunities of identified succession candidates. 
 
 Ovintiv s compensation and benefits program is designed to attract and retain the talent necessary to achieve the Company s business strategy by rewarding individual performance as well as company performance. The Company s compensation model is tied to financial, operational and environmental metrics which align to Ovintiv s strategic plan. In addition, the compensation philosophy is anchored by two key objectives: a) delivering competitive base salaries and benefits and b) rewarding short and long-term performance through the grant of an annual cash bonus and long-term incentive awards LTI awards ). LTI awards are primarily performance-based and are designed to incentivize delivery of the Company s strategy and long-term value creation with the payout of these awards correlating to Ovintiv s stock price performance. Settlement of certain awards can be either in shares of common stock or cash at the discretion of the Human Resources and Compensation Committee. Awards that settle in shares of common stock do not result in beneficial ownership until the awards are settled. See Note 21. Compensation Plans and Note 22. Pensions and Other Post-Employment Benefits t o Ovintiv s audited Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, the average tenure of our employees is over nine years and voluntary turnover is approximately six percent. 
 
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
 
 The Company values diversity and fosters a culture of equity and inclusion, believing that diverse perspectives and experience enhances Ovintiv s overall effectiveness and performance. Diversity and inclusion is nested within the Company s social commitment as part of the ESG strategy. The Company takes an integrated approach to this work by inviting perspectives from various internal functions in order to amplify the impact. As part of the Company s commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, Ovintiv has an employee resource group called Leveraging Inclusion, Networking and Knowledge LINK ), to help provide opportunities for all employees to engage, collaborate, learn and grow, in addition to fostering an environment where diverse perspectives are celebrated. In addition, formal training and resources have been offered to employees of all levels on inclusive leadership and interrupting bias. 
 
 Ovintiv strives to provide equal opportunity in recruitment, career development, promotion, training and rewards for its employees. The Company actively facilitates professional development for women and other underrepresented groups through its targeted succession planning and mentoring programs. In order to broaden the diversity of the Company s talent pipeline, Ovintiv also participates in programs targeting diverse students in junior and high schools, with the purpose of advancing and strengthening its workforce. 
 24 

Specific to gender diversity, women at Ovintiv comprised approximately 6 0 percent of the executive leadership team reporting to the Chief Executive Officer , approximately 18 percent of the senior leadership group and approximately 31 percent of all employees at December 31, 202 2 . 
 
 Employee Safety & Wellness 
 
 Safety is a foundational value at Ovintiv. Providing a safe workplace for employees, suppliers, and the community is a tenet of managing the Company s operations. Strong safety performance reflects a well-run business and builds confidence in the communities where Ovintiv operates. Ovintiv promotes workplace safety with regular comprehensive training and orientation programs for employees and contractors. Employees and contractors are expected to comply with Ovintiv s process safety protocols, regulatory compliance, and are required to report incidents and near-miss events. 
 
 Our operations are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act OSHA ), and comparable state and provincial laws, rules and regulations and have established a variety of standards related to workplace exposure to hazardous substances, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, in the U.S. the OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act and comparable state and provincial statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state, provincial and local government authorities and citizens. 
 
 As a result, certain safety metrics are included in the Company s scorecard and are tied into the Company s compensation program. Environmental, Health and Safety EH&S metrics reflected in the scorecard include Total Recordable Injury Frequency, Spill Intensity, GHG Intensity, all of which are described in the Proxy Statement relating to the Company s 2022 annual meeting of shareholders. 
 
 REGULATORY MATTERS 
 
 As Ovintiv is an operator of oil and natural gas properties and facilities in the United States and Canada, the Company is subject to numerous federal, state, provincial, local, tribal and foreign country laws and regulations. These laws and regulations relate to matters that include: acquisition of seismic data issuance of permits location, drilling and casing of wells well design hydraulic fracturing well production use, transportation, storage and disposal of fluids and materials incidental to oil and natural gas operations surface usage and the restoration of properties upon which wells have been drilled and facilities have been constructed plugging and abandoning of wells pollution, protection of the environment and the handling of hazardous materials transportation of production periodic report submittals during operations and calculation and disbursement of royalty payments and production and other taxes. The following are significant areas of government control and regulation affecting Ovintiv s operations: 
 
 Exploration and Development Activities 
 
 Certain of our U.S. oil and natural gas leases are granted or approved by the federal government and administered by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Office of Natural Resources Revenue or the Bureau of Land Management BLM ), all of which are federal agencies. BLM leases contain relatively standardized terms and require compliance with detailed regulations. Many onshore leases contain stipulations limiting activities that may be conducted on the lease. Some stipulations are unique to particular geographic areas and may limit the time during which activities on the lease may be conducted, the manner in which certain activities may be conducted or, in some cases, may ban surface activity. Under certain circumstances, the BLM may require that our operations on federal leases be suspended or terminated. Any such suspension or termination could materially and adversely affect Ovintiv s interests. 
 
 In addition, President Biden and certain members of his administration have expressed support for, and have taken steps to implement, additional regulation of oil and gas leasing and permitting on federal lands. For example, President Biden issued an executive order in January 2021 directing the Secretary of the Interior to pause on entering new oil and gas leases on public lands to the extent possible and to launch a rigorous review of all existing leasing and permitting practices related to fossil fuel development on public lands. Although the pause on leasing 
 25 

was lifted in June 2021, the Department of the Interior subsequently issued its report on the federal leasing program in November 2021. The report recommended various changes to the program, including, among other things, increasing royalty and rental rates, enhancing bonding requirements and applying a more rigorous land-use planning process prior to leasing. However, certain of the report s recommendations require Congressional actions, and we cannot predict to what extent, if any, the Department of the Interior may be able to promulgate rules implementing the recommendations of the November 2021 report. While it is not possible at this time to predict the ultimate impact of these or any other future regulatory changes, any additional restrictions or burdens on our ability to operate on federal lands could adversely impact our business in areas where we operate under federal leases. 
 
 In Canada, oil and natural gas mineral rights may be held by individuals, corporations or governments that have jurisdiction over the area in which such mineral rights are located. Generally, parties holding these mineral rights grant licenses or leases to third parties to facilitate the exploration and development of these mineral rights. The terms of these leases and licenses are generally established to require timely development. Notwithstanding the ownership of mineral rights, the government of the jurisdiction in which the mineral rights are located generally retains authority over the drilling and operation of oil and natural gas wells. 
 Drilling and Production 
 
 The Company s operations also are subject to conservation regulations, including the regulation of the location of wells, size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit the rate of production allowable from oil and natural gas wells and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties. In the U.S., some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases, which make it more difficult to develop oil and natural gas properties. In addition, conservation laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratable purchase of production. These regulations limit the amounts of oil and natural gas that can be produced from the Company s wells and the number of wells or the locations that can be drilled. 
 Royalties 
 
 Operations on U.S. Federal or Indian oil and natural gas leases must comply with numerous regulatory restrictions, including various non-discrimination statutes, and certain of such operations must be conducted pursuant to certain on-site security regulations and other permits issued by various tribal and federal agencies, including the BLM and the Office of Natural Resources Revenue ONRR ). The basis for royalty payments due under federal oil and natural gas leases are through regulation issued under the applicable statutory authority. State regulatory authorities establish similar standards for royalty payments due under state oil and natural gas leases. The basis for royalty payments established by ONRR and the state regulatory authorities is generally applicable to all federal and state oil and natural gas leases. 
 
 The royalty calculation in Canada is a significant factor in the profitability of Canadian oil and natural gas production. Oil and natural gas crown royalties are determined by provincial and territorial government regulation and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production, net of allowed deductions. The royalty rate is dependent in part on prescribed references prices, well productivity, geographical locations, recovery methods, as well as type and quality of the hydrocarbon produced. For pre-payout oil and natural gas projects, the regulations prescribe lower royalty rates for oil and natural gas projects until allowable capital costs have been recovered. The calculation for wells post payout is based on a percentage of production net of allowed deductions and varies with commodity price. 
 
 Royalties payable on production from lands other than federal, state or provincial government lands are determined through negotiations between the parties. 
 
 Sales and Transportation 
 
 Although oil and natural gas prices are currently unregulated in the U.S., Congress historically has been active in oil and natural gas regulation. As a result, the Company cannot predict whether new regulations might be proposed. 
 
 The availability, terms and transportation significantly affect sales of oil and natural gas. The interstate transportation and sale for resale of oil and natural gas is subject to U.S. federal regulation, including regulation of 
 26 

terms, conditions and rates for interstate transportation, storage and various other matters, primarily by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC . Federal and state regulations govern the price and terms of access to oil and natural gas pipeline transportation. FERC s regulations for oil and natural gas transmission in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of oil as the transportation of oil in common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate regulation by the FERC under the Intrastate Commerce Act. To the extent that effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, the Company believe s that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors . 
 
 Project Approvals 
 
 Approvals and licenses from relevant state, provincial or federal government or regulatory bodies are required to carryout or make modifications to the Company s oil and natural gas activities. The project approval process can involve environmental assessment, stakeholder and Indigenous consultation and inputs regarding project concerns and public hearings and may included various conditions and commitments which may arise throughout the process. 
 
 In 2019, the Canadian government implemented a new environmental assessment framework in Canada under the Impact Assessment Act, which may impact the way large energy projects are approved. Though the Company does not typical own, operate, permit or construct projects which fall under the scope of the Impact Assessment Act, some of the Company s business may rely on these projects owned, operated, permitted and constructed by others. 
 
 On June 29, 2021, the Supreme Court of British Columbia declared, among other things, that the province of British Columbia has unjustifiably infringed on the rights of the Blueberry River First Nation (BRFN) by permitting the cumulative impacts of industrial development (activities which include forestry, mining, oil and natural gas, agriculture, land clearing, hydroelectric infrastructure, roads and other industrial developments) to diminish the BRFN s ability to meaningfully exercise its treaty rights within an area comprising approximately 9,400,000 acres in northeast British Columbia. As a result, the Province and the BRFN engaged in negotiations to establish timely enforceable mechanisms to assess and manage the cumulative impact of industrial development on the BRFN s treaty rights and on January 18, 2023, the Province and BRFN jointly announced that they had reached an agreement, which if implemented as intended, is agreed to resolve the Treaty infringement identified by the Court. Further, on January 20, 2023, the Province announced it had signed an agreement (the Consensus Document to advance a collaborative approach to land and resource planning with an additional four Treaty 8 First Nations in northeast British Columbia and indicated that agreements with the remaining three Treaty 8 First Nations are moving towards a resolution. Though the specifics of the agreements have yet to be released, the information available to date indicates that the agreements will transform how the Province and First Nations steward land, water and resources together, and address cumulative effects in BRFN s Claim Area through restoration measures to heal the land, establish new areas protected from industrial development, and constrain development activities while a new long-term cumulative effects management regime is implemented. More importantly, the new development constraints are land disturbance focused and are not intended to cap or constrain production. The new requirements do not apply to existing production, to private lands, or to lands outside of the claim area identified in the court case. However, authorizations on private lands will be subject to an enhanced Indigenous consultation process. Although Ovintiv s landholdings in Montney that are located in northeast British Columbia are within the Blueberry Claim Area subject to the agreement, the majority of the Company s current land holdings and operations are on private land. While it is not anticipated the new agreements will materially impact the Company s development plans in Montney, final details of the agreements have yet to be released. Should the agreements impose new, onerous approval requirements, the Company may be unable to conduct exploration and development activities on a portion of its landholdings in Montney that are located within northeast British Columbia. 
 
 Investment Canada Act 
 
 The Investment Canada Act requires Government of Canada approval, in certain cases, of the acquisition of control of a Canadian business by an entity that is not controlled by Canadians. In certain circumstances, the acquisition of oil and natural gas properties may be considered to be a transaction requiring such approval. 
 27 

Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Regulations 
 
 The Company is subject to many federal, state, provincial, local and tribal environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. These environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, legal requirements relating to: 

the discharge of pollutants into federal, provincial and state waters 

assessing the environmental impact of seismic acquisition, drilling or construction activities 

the generation, storage, transportation and disposal of waste materials, including hazardous substances 

the emission of certain gases into the atmosphere, including any laws or regulations in connection with a response to climate change 

the protection of private and public surface and ground water supplies 

the sourcing and disposal of water 

the protection of endangered species and habitat 

the monitoring, abandonment, reclamation and remediation of well and other sites, including former operating sites 

the development of emergency response and spill contingency plans and 

the establishment of workplace standards for the protection of the health and safety of employees, including the implementation of hazard communications programs designed to inform employees about hazardous substances in the workplace, potential harmful effects of these substances, and appropriate control measures. 

Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil, and criminal penalties the imposition of investigatory, remedial, and corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures the occurrence of delays in the permitting, development or expansion of projects and the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting some or all of the Company s activities in a particular area. Further, certain environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations contain citizen suit provisions which allow private parties, including environmental organizations, to directly sue alleged violators or government agencies to enforce applicable requirements. To address climate change, the United States, Canada, and other signatories to the Paris Agreement and the Glasgow Climate Pact have agreed to voluntary and non-binding commitments to limit GHG emissions and fossil fuel subsidies. In June 2021, Canada passed the Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act, which formally establishes the country s 2050 net-zero emissions target. In the United States, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented at the federal level. However, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA has determined that GHG emissions present a danger to public health and the environment and has proposed New Source Performance Standards to more stringently regulate methane and volatile organic compound emissions from oil and natural gas sources. Although environmental requirements have a substantial impact upon the energy industry as a whole, Ovintiv does not believe that these requirements affect the Company differently, to any material degree, as compared to other companies in the oil and natural gas industry. For further information regarding regulations relating to environmental protection, see Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Monitoring and reporting programs for environmental, health and safety performance in day-to-day operations, as well as inspections and assessments, are designed to provide assurance that environmental and regulatory standards are met. The Company has established operating procedures and training programs designed to limit the environmental impact of the Company s field facilities and identify, communicate and comply with changes in existing laws and regulations. Contingency plans are in place for a timely response to an environmental event and remediation/reclamation programs are in place and utilized to restore the environment. In addition, the Environmental, Health and Safety Committee of the Board of Directors reviews and recommends environmental policy to the Board of Directors for approval and oversees compliance with government laws and regulations. The Board of Directors is advised of significant contraventions thereof, and receives updates on trends, issues or events which could have a significant impact on the Company. 
 The Company believes that the cost of maintaining compliance with these existing laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, Ovintiv maintains insurance coverage for insurable risks against certain environmental and occupational health and safety risks that is consistent with insurance coverage held by other similarly situated industry participants, but the Company is not fully insured against all such risks . However, it is possible that developments, such as new or more stringently applied existing laws and regulations as well as claims for damages to property or persons resulting from 
 28 

the Company s operations, could result in substantial costs and liabilities to the Company. As a result, Ovintiv is unable to predict with any reasonable degree of certainty future exposures concerning such matters.

I TE M 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 Our business and operations, and our industry in general, are subject to a variety of risks. If any event arising from the risk factors set forth below occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, the trading prices of our securities and in some cases our reputation could be materially and adversely affected. When assessing the materiality of the foregoing risk factors, we consider several qualitative and quantitative factors, including, but not limited to, financial, operational, environmental, regulatory, reputational and safety aspects of the identified risk factor. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face, as our business, operations and industry may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently believe are immaterial. 
 
 The Company s risk factors are summarized as market operational environmental financial regulatory tax and general risks associated with business and industry. 
 
 Market Risks 

A substantial or extended decline in oil, NGLs or natural gas prices, or a substantial increase in oil, NGLs and natural gas price differentials, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and the trading prices of our securities. 

A pandemic, epidemic or other widespread outbreak of an infectious disease, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, could materially and adversely affect the operation of our business. 

The trading price of our securities, including our common stock, is subject to volatility. 

Fluctuations in exchange rates could affect expenses or result in realized and unrealized losses. 

Operational Risks 

Our ability to operate and complete projects is dependent on numerous factors outside of our control. 

Our operations involve many risks, some of which could result in unforeseen interruptions and expose us to substantial losses and liabilities, for which our insurance may not fully protect us. 

Oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities involve substantial costs and risks and may not result in commercially productive reserves. 

The proved reserves data provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is an estimate only and any inaccuracies in the methodology or assumptions underlying our proved reserves estimates could cause the quantity and net present value of our oil, NGLs, and natural gas reserves to be materially overstated or understated. 

If we fail to find, develop or acquire additional oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves, our reserves and production will decline materially from their current levels. 

Horizontal multi-well pad drilling involves certain risks which may cause volatility in our operating results. 

We are subject to risks and liabilities from acquisitions and any anticipated or desired benefits from such acquisitions may not be realized. 

We are dependent on partners to fund certain projects conducted through joint ventures and partnerships. 

We do not operate all of our assets, and, in such instances, we may have a limited ability to exercise influence over the operation and development of such assets. 

Our customers, counterparties and lenders may be unable to satisfy their contractual or legal obligations. 

We retain certain indemnification obligations related to our corporate reorganization in November of 2009. 

We may be unable to dispose of certain assets and may be required to retain liabilities for certain matters. 

Our operations may be affected by indigenous treaty, title and other rights. 

Environmental Risks and Risks Associated with Climate Change 

We are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with increased environmental regulations in all jurisdictions in which we operate. 

We are subject to risks and uncertainties arising out of government action in response to concerns over climate change that could reduce demand for the oil, NGLs and natural gas we produce increase our operating costs and limit the areas in which we may explore for, develop, and produce oil, NGLs and natural gas. 

Enhanced scrutiny on ESG matters could have an adverse effect on our operations. 

Financial and Liquidity Risk 

Downgrades in our credit ratings could increase our cost of capital and limit our access to capital, suppliers or counterparties. 

Our level of indebtedness may limit our financial flexibility. 

 30 

Our risk management activities may prevent us from fully benefiting from an increase in oil, NGLs and natural gas prices and expose us to certain other risks. 

The decision to return capital to shareholders, whether through cash dividends, share buybacks or otherwise, and the amount and timing of such capital returns is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will vary from time to time. 

Regulation and Litigation Risk 

We are subject to extensive federal, state, provincial and local government laws, rules and regulations that can adversely affect the cost, manner and feasibility of our business, and increased regulation in the future could increase costs, impose additional operating restrictions and cause delays. 

We currently are, and from time to time in the future may be, subject to claims, litigation, administrative proceedings and regulatory actions that may not be resolved in our favor. 

The ability of Canadian and other non-resident shareholders to effect service of process or enforce remedies against Ovintiv, its directors, officers, experts, and assets may be limited. 

Tax Risks 

U.S. and Canadian tax laws and regulations may change over time, and such changes may result in increased taxes on our business. 

Our corporate reorganization in January of 2020 may result in material Canadian and/or U.S. federal income taxes. 

General Risks 

The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors have available resources in excess of our own. 

We could be adversely affected by security threats, including cyber-security threats and related disruptions. 

The following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information contained herein, including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. Unless the context requires otherwise, "we," "us," "our" and "Ovintiv" refer to Ovintiv Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
 
 Market Risks 
 
 A substantial or extended decline in oil, NGLs or natural gas prices, or a substantial increase in oil, NGLs and natural gas price differentials, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and the trading prices of our securities. 
 
 Our financial performance and condition are substantially dependent on the prevailing prices we receive for the oil, NGLs and natural gas which we produce. Prices for oil, NGLs and natural gas are inherently volatile and fluctuate in response to changes in a variety of factors beyond our control, including: 

the international and domestic supply and demand for oil, NGLs and natural gas 

volatility and trading patterns in the commodity futures market 

global economic conditions 

production levels of members of OPEC, Russia, the United States or other hydrocarbon producing nations 

geopolitical risks, including political and civil unrest in oil and natural gas producing regions 

adverse weather conditions, natural disasters and other catastrophic events, such as tornadoes, flooding, severe heat or cold, earthquakes and hurricanes 

the price and level of North American oil, NGLs and natural gas imports and exports 

the level of global oil, NGLs and natural gas inventories 

the economic and financial impact of epidemics or other public health issues, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic 

differing quality of production, including the gravity and sulphur content of our oil, the Btu and sulphur content of our natural gas, and the quantity of NGLs associated with our natural gas 

the price and availability of, and demand for, alternative sources of energy (including coal, nuclear, hydroelectric, solar and wind) 

the effect of energy conservation efforts and technological advances in energy consumption and production, including with respect to transportation and power generation 

 31 

the availability and proximity of gathering, transportation, processing, refining, storage and other infrastructure facilities 

changes in trade relations and policies, including the imposition of tariffs by the United States or Canada 

conservation and environmental protection efforts, including activities by non-governmental organizations to restrict the exploration, development and production of oil, NGLs and natural gas and 

the nature and extent of governmental regulations, including any changes or other actions with respect to emissions, climate change, tariffs or tax laws. 

Prices for oil, NGLs and natural gas are particularly sensitive to actual and perceived threats to geopolitical stability and to changes in production from OPEC+ member states. For example, the ongoing conflict, and the continuation of, or any increase in the severity of, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, has led and may continue to lead to an increase in the volatility of global oil and gas prices. 
 
 We also may receive discounted prices for our oil, NGLs and natural gas production relative to certain benchmark prices (such as Brent and WTI for oil and Henry Hub and AECO for natural gas) due to constraints on our ability to transport and sell such production to certain markets. A failure to resolve such regional pricing differentials may result in our continued realization of discounted or reduced oil, NGLs and natural gas prices relative to such benchmarks. 
 
 A substantial or extended decline in oil, NGLs and natural gas prices, or a substantial increase in oil, NGLs and natural gas price differentials with respect to certain benchmarks, could result in, among other things, (a) a delay or cancellation of existing or future drilling, development or construction programs (b) the curtailment or shut-in of production at some or all of our properties (c) unutilized long-term transportation and drilling commitments or (d) a decrease in the value of our oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and the trading prices of our securities. Additionally, on at least an annual basis, we assess the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties in accordance with applicable accounting standards. If oil, NGLs and natural gas prices decline significantly for a sufficient period, the carrying value of our properties could be subject to financial impairment, and our net earnings could be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 A pandemic, epidemic or other widespread outbreak of an infectious disease, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, could materially and adversely affect the operation of our business. 
 
 A pandemic, epidemic or other widespread outbreak of an infectious disease, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and resulting restrictive measures implemented by governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate, have at times and could in the future prevent our employees, contractors or suppliers from accessing our properties or performing critical services. Such measures have included and may include limitations or prohibitions on cross-border travel, restrictions on large gatherings, stay-at-home orders, vaccine mandates and mandatory closures of non-essential businesses. In the event such measures remain in place for an extended period of time, our ability to maintain ordinary staffing levels, secure operational inputs, and execute on portions of our business could be impacted, and if a significant subset of our employees are required to work remotely, we will face an increased exposure to vulnerabilities related to digital technologies and may experience a higher rate of cyber-attacks. Additionally, concerns over the prolonged negative effects of a pandemic, epidemic or other widespread outbreak of an infectious disease, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, on global economic and business prospects have at times and may in the future contribute to decreased demand for oil, NGLs and natural gas increased volatility in capital and commodity markets, including volatility in the prices of oil, NGLs and natural gas substantial fluctuations in currency exchange rates, inflation rates and interest rates increased counterparty credit and performance risk and reduced levels of general investing and consumption. 
 
 While the full impact of a pandemic, epidemic or other widespread outbreak of an infectious disease, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, is inherently uncertain, the ultimate impact will depend on several factors, including the location and severity of the virus's spread, the effectiveness and adoption rate of vaccines, the emergence of new or previously unknown variants and the effectiveness of mitigation actions taken by governmental authorities. Any pandemic, epidemic or other widespread outbreak of an infectious disease, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, may reduce our spending and operating plans reduce the value and amount of our oil, NGLs or natural gas reserves and production cause substantial fluctuations in our stock price and credit ratings or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and access to liquidity.

The trading price of our securities, including our common stock , is subject to volatility. 
 
 The trading price of our securities, including our common stock, may be volatile. The value of an investment in our securities may decrease or increase abruptly, and such volatility may bear little or no relation to our financial or operational performance. The price of our securities may fall in response to market appraisal of our strategy or if our results of operations and/or prospects are below the expectations of market analysts or stakeholders. In addition, equity and debt markets have, from time to time, experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of securities, and may, in the future, experience similar fluctuations which may be unrelated to our operating performance and prospects but nevertheless affect the price of our securities. Broad equity and debt market fluctuations resulting from general economic conditions, as well as our ability to meet or exceed market expectations, may materially and adversely affect the trading prices of our securities, including our common stock. 
 
 Fluctuations in exchange rates could affect expenses or result in realized and unrealized losses. 
 
 We currently have operations in Canada and, as a result, a portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in Canadian dollars. In addition, our subsidiaries that are domiciled in Canada may hold U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar have resulted in and could in the future result in realized and unrealized losses, which has impacted and could in the future impact our revenue and expenses and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Operational Risks 
 
 Our ability to operate and complete projects is dependent on numerous factors outside of our control. 
 
 We undertake a variety of projects including exploration and development projects and the construction or expansion of facilities and pipelines. Our ability to operate, generate sufficient cash flows, and timely complete projects depends upon numerous factors largely beyond our control. These factors include: 

oil, NGLs and natural gas prices 

global supply and demand for oil, NGLs and natural gas 

the overall state of the financial markets, including investor appetite for debt and equity securities issued by oil and natural gas companies and the effects of economic recessions or depressions 

the ability to secure and maintain financing on acceptable terms 

legislative, environmental and regulatory matters 

oil and natural gas reservoir quality 

the availability of drilling rigs, completions equipment and other facilities and equipment 

the ability to access lands 

the ability to access water for hydraulic fracturing operations 

reliance on vendors, suppliers, contractors and service providers 

shortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages 

changes to free trade agreements 

inflation and other unexpected cost increases, including with respect to materials and labor 

prevailing interest and foreign exchange rates 

royalty and tax rates 

physical impacts from adverse weather conditions and natural disasters 

transportation and processing interruptions or constraints, including the availability and proximity of pipeline and processing capacity 

technology failures and 

accidents. 

In addition, part of our corporate strategy is focused on a limited number of assets which results in a concentration of development capital and production. Some of the foregoing risks may be magnified due to the concentrated nature of our development activities and may result in a relatively greater impact on our financial condition and results of operations compared to other companies that may have more geographically diversified operations. Any material delays in a project or project cost overruns could result in delayed revenues and some projects becoming 
 33 

uneconomic , each of which could have a material and adverse e ffect on our business, financial condition and results of operations . 
 
 Our operations involve many risks, some of which could result in unforeseen interruptions and expose us to substantial losses and liabilities, for which our insurance may not fully protect us. 
 
 Our business is subject to the operating risks normally associated with (a) the exploration, development and production of oil, NGLs and natural gas and (b) the operation of midstream facilities, including the gathering, transportation, processing, storing and marketing of oil, NGLs and natural gas. These risks include: 

blowouts, cratering, explosions and fires 

loss of well control 

environmental hazards, such as the uncontrollable release or spill of oil, natural gas, toxic gases (such as hydrogen sulfide), produced water (brine), drilling or completion fluids, or other pollutants into the environment, including the surface, subsurface, air and groundwater 

pipeline ruptures, vessel ruptures and other equipment malfunctions, failures or accidents 

mechanical difficulties, such as stuck oilfield drilling and service tools, pipe or cement failures and casing collapses 

adverse weather conditions, such as severe heat or cold, flooding, tornados and other natural disasters 

encountering unexpected or abnormally pressured formations 

premature declines of reservoir pressure or productivity 

acts of vandalism and terrorism, including attacks targeting oil, NGLs and natural gas facilities and infrastructure and 

cyber attacks targeting oil and gas infrastructure. 

 If any of the foregoing risks were to materialize, we could sustain material losses as a result of: 

injury or loss of life 

damage to, or destruction of, property, natural resources or equipment, including the costs of repair or replacement 

pollution or other environmental harm, including the costs associated with remediation, reclamation and plugging and abandonment 

interruptions to our ongoing operations, including the reduction or shutting-in of existing production 

regulatory investigations and administrative, civil and criminal penalties and 

injunctions resulting in limitation or suspension of current or future operations. 

To the extent such weather events or natural disasters become more frequent or more severe, disruptions to our business and costs to repair damaged facilities could increase. 
 
 While we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses described above, our insurance may not be adequate to cover all casualty losses or liabilities, and our insurance does not cover penalties or fines that may be assessed by a governmental authority. We cannot predict the continued availability of insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase. The occurrence of a significant event for which we are not fully insured may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. 
 
 Oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities involve substantial costs and risks and may not result in commercially productive reserves. 
 
 Oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities involve numerous risks, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be encountered. The cost of drilling and completing wells is often uncertain and operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled, or become costlier, as a result of a variety of factors, including: 

unexpected drilling conditions, including abnormal pressures or irregularities in formations 

equipment failures or accidents 

construction delays 

fracture stimulation accidents or failures 

 34 

adverse weather conditions or natural disasters 

title defects or restricted access to land 

lack of available gathering, transportation, processing, fractionation, storage, refining or export facilities 

lack of available capacity on interconnecting transmission pipelines 

access to, and the cost and availability of, the equipment, services, resources and personnel required to complete our drilling, completion and production activities, including as a result of increased inflation, labor shortages or supply chain issues and 

delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with or changes in environmental and other governmental, regulatory or contractual requirements. 

Additionally, our operations involve utilizing some of the latest horizontal drilling and completion techniques as developed internally and by our service providers. Risks that we face while drilling and completing horizontal oil and natural gas wells include the following: 

landing the wellbore in the desired zone within the target formation 

staying in the desired zone within the target formation while drilling horizontally for extended lengths 

controlling formation pressures during drilling 

running casing the entire length of the wellbore 

being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal wellbore 

the ability to effectively fracture stimulate the reservoir with the desired number of stages and 

the ability to successfully clean out the wellbore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage. 

Our future exploration and development activities may not be successful as a result of, among other things, the risks set forth above and, if unsuccessful, our proved oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves and production would decline, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. While all development activities involve these risks, exploratory and extension development activities involve a greater risk of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. 
 The proved reserves data provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is an estimate only and any inaccuracies in the methodology or assumptions underlying our proved reserves estimates could cause the quantity and net present value of our oil, NGLs, and natural gas reserves to be materially overstated or understated. 
 
 There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating economically recoverable quantities of oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves, including many factors beyond our control. All oil, NGLs and natural gas reserve estimates are uncertain to some degree, and classifications of oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves are only attempts to define the degree of uncertainty involved. For those reasons, estimates of the quantity of oil, NGLs and natural gas economically recoverable from a group of properties and the classification of such oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves, when prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers at different times, may vary substantially. Additionally, estimates with respect to oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves can be based upon volumetric calculations and upon analogy to similar types of reserves, rather than upon actual production history. Oil, NGLs and natural gas reserve estimates based on these methods are generally less reliable than those based on actual production history. Subsequent evaluation of the same reserves based upon production history will result in variations in the estimated reserves and these variations may be material. 
 
 Proved reserves data in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other publications we make publicly available represent estimates only. In general, estimates of our oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves, and the future net cash flows therefrom, are based upon a number of factors and assumptions, including commodity prices, operating and capital costs, availability of future capital, historical production from the same or similar properties and the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies, including with respect to royalty payments, all of which may vary considerably from actual results. Our actual production, revenues, taxes and development and operating expenditures with respect to our proved reserves may vary materially from such estimates. 
 
 The estimates of proved reserves included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are prepared in accordance with SEC regulations. Subject to limited exceptions, oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves may only be classified as proved undeveloped reserves if the wells developing such reserves are scheduled to be drilled within five years after the date of classification. The development timing of our oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves is based upon numerous expectations and assumptions, including the allocation of development capital anticipated costs to drill, complete 
 35 

and operate our wells and anticipated commodity prices. Our development expectations and assumptions are subject to change and p roved undeveloped reserves may be reclassified to unproved reserves at any time. Additionally, commodity prices used to estimate proved reserves included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month within the preceding 12-month period. Significant future price changes can have a material effect on the quantity and value of our proved reserves. The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K will not represent the current market value of our estimated proved reserves. In addition, these proved reserve estimates do not include any value for probable or possible reserves that may exist, nor do they include any value for unproved undeveloped acreage. 
 If we fail to find, develop or acquire additional oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves, our reserves and production will decline materially from their current levels. 
 
 Our future oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves and production, and therefore our future cash flows, are highly dependent upon our success in developing our current reserves base and exploring for, developing or acquiring additional oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves. Typically, to maintain an oil and natural gas lease in the United States, we are required to drill at least one well that is commercially productive within the primary term of the lease and, once drilled, maintain oil or natural gas production in paying quantities from the lease. If we are unsuccessful in drilling a commercially productive well during the primary term of the lease or, once drilled, in maintaining oil or natural gas production in paying quantities from the lease, we could lose our rights to explore for and develop oil and natural gas under such lease and our right to any oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves associated with the lease. In some cases, the initial commercially productive well will only maintain the lease as to a portion of the lands covered thereby and further oil and natural gas development activities are required to maintain the entirety of the lease. 
 
 The business of exploring for, developing and acquiring oil and natural gas reserves is capital intensive. Acquisition opportunities in the oil and natural gas industry are inherently competitive, which can increase the cost of, or cause us to refrain from, completing acquisitions. To the extent that cash flows from our operations are insufficient and external sources of capital become limited or undesirable, our ability to make the necessary capital investments to maintain and expand our oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves and production will be impaired. In addition, there can be no certainty that we will be able to find, develop or acquire additional oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves to replace current reserves and production at acceptable costs. Without additions through exploration, development or acquisition activities, our oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves and production will decline over time as the reserves are depleted, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Horizontal multi-well pad drilling involves certain risks which may cause volatility in our operating results. 
 
 Our operations utilize horizontal multi-well pad drilling. In this type of development, multiple wells are drilled based upon spacing and completions techniques that evolve over time as learnings are captured and applied. Wells drilled on a multi-well pad are generally not placed on production until all wells on the pad are drilled and completed. While the use of this development technique can accelerate the production of our oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves and increase our observed recovery factor from the reservoir, it can also result in production delays as problems with a single well can adversely affect the production of all wells on the pad. Additionally, horizontal multi-well pad drilling increases the risk of unintentional communication or pressure interference between wells which may adversely affect our production. As a result, multi-well pad drilling can both cause delays in our production schedule and result in oil, NGLs and natural gas production below expectations. These delays or production interruptions may reduce our anticipated production volumes from both new and existing wells and this volatility could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We are subject to risks and liabilities from acquisitions and any anticipated or desired benefits from such acquisitions may not be realized. 
 
 Historically, acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties, including through acreage trades, farm-ins and asset- or corporate-level acquisitions, have contributed to our growth. Acquisition opportunities in the oil and natural gas industry are inherently competitive, which can increase the cost of, or cause us to refrain from, completing acquisitions. The success of any acquisition will depend on several factors and involves potential risks and uncertainties, including, among other things: 
 
 36 

the inability to accurately forecast and estimate oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves, production volumes, development costs and the net cash flows attributable to such properties 

the inability to accurately forecast commodity prices 

the assumption of unknown liabilities, including environmental liabilities, for which we may not be indemnified or for which the indemnity may not be adequate 

the validity of assumptions about asset- and corporate-level synergies 

the effect on our liquidity or financial leverage when using available cash or debt to finance the acquisition or from the amount of debt assumed as part of the acquisition 

the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns and 

the inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate the acquired assets or business. 

All of these factors, among others, affect whether an acquisition will ultimately generate cash flows sufficient to provide a suitable return on investment. Even though we assess and review the properties we seek to acquire in a manner consistent with what we believe to be industry practice, such reviews are limited in scope, inexact and not capable of identifying all existing or potentially adverse conditions. This risk is magnified when the acquired properties are in a geographic area where we have not historically operated. As a result, the anticipated and desired benefits of an acquisition may not materialize, and this may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial performance and results of operations. 
 
 We are dependent on partners to fund certain projects conducted through joint ventures and partnerships. 
 
 Some of our projects are conducted through joint ventures, partnerships or other arrangements, where we are dependent on our partners to fund their contractual share of the project s capital and operating expenditures. If our partners do not approve their contractual share of capital or operating expenditures, are unable to fulfill their contractual obligations, or suspend or terminate their contractual arrangements with us, the projects may become delayed or we may be forced to absorb additional capital or operating expenditures, each of which may materially and adversely affect the viability of such projects and our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 These partners may also have strategic plans, objectives and interests that do not coincide, and may conflict, with our plans, objectives and interests. While certain operational decisions may be made solely at our discretion in our capacity as the operator of certain projects, major capital and strategic decisions affecting such projects may require agreement among the partners. No assurance can be provided that future demands or expectations of any party, including our demands and expectations, relating to such project will be met satisfactorily or in a timely manner. Failure to satisfactorily meet such demands or expectations may affect our or our partners participation in the operation of such project or the timing for undertaking various activities, which could materially and adversely affect the viability of such project and our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, we are involved from time to time in disputes with our partners and, as such, we may be unable to dispose of certain assets or interests in certain arrangements if such disputes cannot be resolved in a satisfactory or timely manner. 
 
 We do not operate all of our assets, and, in such instances, we may have a limited ability to exercise influence over the operation and development of such assets. 
 
 Third parties operate a portion of the assets in which we have an ownership interest, and, in such instances, we may have a limited ability to exercise influence over the operation and development of such assets. The success and timing of our activities on these assets is therefore dependent upon factors that are largely outside of our control. These factors include (a) the timing and amount of capital, operating and maintenance expenditures related to the project (b) the third-party operator s expertise and financial resources (c) the third-party operator s ability to obtain required approvals from other non-operating partners and (d) the third-party operator s selection and implementation of adequate technology and risk management practices. The failure of one or more third-party operators to effectively and efficiently operate assets in which we have an ownership interest could result in the inefficient deployment of capital and the loss of production volumes, each of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 37 

Our customers, counterparties and lenders may be unable to satisfy their contractual or legal obligations. 
 
 We are exposed to certain risks associated with our customers, contractual counterparties and lenders. These risks include (a) credit risks associated with (i) customers who purchase our oil, NGLs and natural gas production, (ii) the collection of receivables from our joint interest partners for their proportionate share of expenditures made on projects we operate, and (iii) counterparties to our derivative financial contracts (b) performance risks associated with the non-delivery, or delayed delivery, of contracted products or services, including the transportation and processing of our oil, NGLs and natural gas production and (c) liquidity risk in the event one or more lenders under our existing credit facilities are unable to perform their funding obligations. We utilize a variety of mechanisms to limit our exposure to these and similar risks, including requiring guaranty s, letters of credit or prepayments under certain conditions. Despite these mechanisms, in the event a customer, contractual counterparty or lender fails to satisfy their obligations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 We retain certain indemnification obligations related to our corporate reorganization in November of 2009. 
 
 As part of our November 2009 corporate reorganization that split our predecessor, Encana, into two independent publicly traded energy companies, Encana and Cenovus Energy Inc. Cenovus ), Encana and Cenovus each agreed to indemnify the other for certain liabilities and obligations associated with, among other things, in the case of Encana s indemnity, the business and assets retained by Encana, and in the case of Cenovus s indemnity, the business and assets transferred to Cenovus. We are unable to predict whether we will be required to indemnify, or seek indemnity from, Cenovus for any obligations and the magnitude of such obligations. Any indemnification claims against us pursuant to the various agreements entered with Cenovus, or our failure to obtain indemnity from Cenovus for any claims we may hold, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We may be unable to dispose of certain assets and may be required to retain liabilities for certain matters. 
 
 We may identify certain assets for disposition, the proceeds of which could reduce the amount of our existing indebtedness and/or increase the amount of capital available for other business purposes, including shareholder returns and acquisitions. Various factors could materially affect our ability to dispose of the identified assets or complete any announced transactions, including commodity price volatility the availability of counterparties willing to acquire oil and natural gas assets at prices and on terms acceptable to us approval by our Board of Directors associated asset retirement obligations due diligence general market conditions the assignability of any associated contract, joint venture, partnership or other arrangements and required stock exchange, governmental or third party approvals. These factors may also reduce the value of our assets or the proceeds of any asset disposition. 
 We (including our predecessor entities) have retained, or in the future may retain, liabilities or indemnification obligations in connection with certain asset dispositions. While we are unable to predict the magnitude of any retained liabilities or indemnification obligations, any liabilities or indemnification obligations retained could ultimately be material. For example, under state and federal law, once an oil or natural gas well has permanently ceased production of oil or natural gas, the operator of such well is obligated to plug and abandon P&A the well, decommission production facilities and restore the well site to pre-operating conditions. U.S. state and federal regulations allow the government to call upon predecessors in interest of oil and natural gas leases associated with such well to pay for P&A, decommissioning and restoration obligations (together, P&A Obligations if the current operator fails to fulfill those obligations. If purchasers of any assets previously owned by us or our predecessors (including any offshore wells or facilities), or any successor owners of those assets, are unable to meet their P&A Obligations due to bankruptcy, dissolution or other liquidity issues, we may be unable to rely on our arrangements with them, if any, to fulfill (or provide reimbursement for) those obligations. In those circumstances, the government may seek to impose the bankrupt entity s P&A Obligations on us and any other predecessors in interest, and such payments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Further, certain third parties may be unwilling to release us from guarantees or other credit support provided prior to the disposition of an asset. In those cases, after the asset disposition, we may remain secondarily liable for the obligations guaranteed or supported to the extent that the acquirer of the assets fails to perform their obligations. 
 
 38 

Our operations may be affected by indigenous treaty, title and other rights. 
 
 Indigenous peoples have claimed indigenous treaty, title and other rights in respect of areas within the United States and Canada. The legal basis of an indigenous land claim is a matter of considerable legal complexity and we cannot predict the impact of such a claim, or the possible effects of a settlement of such claim, with any degree of certainty. In addition, no assurance can be given that any recognition of indigenous rights or claims whether by way of a negotiated settlement or by judicial pronouncement (or through the grant of an injunction prohibiting exploration, development or production activities pending resolution of any such claim) would not delay or even prevent our exploration, development and production activities. If a material claim were to arise and be successful, such claim could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the process of addressing such claim, regardless of the outcome, could be expensive and time consuming and could result in delays which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For more information on the ongoing BRFN Case refer to Government and Environmental Regulatory Matters under Item 1 and 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 In addition to the foregoing, we may become subject to various laws and regulations that apply to operators and other parties operating within the boundaries of Native American reservations in the United States. These laws and regulations may result in the imposition of certain fees, taxes, environmental standards, lease conditions or requirements to employ specified contractors or service providers. Any one of these requirements, or any delay in obtaining the approvals or permits necessary to operate within the boundaries of Native American tribal lands, could adversely impact our operations and ability to explore, develop and produce new properties. 
 
 Further, in Canada, the province of British Columbia enacted legislation to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples UNDRIP in the fall of 2019 and the Canadian federal government has followed suit by adopting the UNDRIP Act on June 21, 2021. The UNDRIP legislation adopted by both British Columbia and the Canadian federal government provide frameworks for recognizing the constitutional and human rights of indigenous peoples and aligning their respective provincial and federal laws with the internationally recognized standards of UNDRIP. Both pieces of UNDRIP legislation are at an early stage of implementation and we are unable to predict the total impact of the potential regulations upon our business. Although we do not anticipate any near-term impacts to our business as a result of such legislation, the implementation of the standards of UNDRIP has the potential to increase permitting times and change the processes and costs associated with project development and operations. 
 
 Environmental Risks and Risks Associated with Climate Change 
 
 We are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with increased environmental regulations in all jurisdictions in which we operate. 
 
 Our operations and properties are subject to numerous existing laws, rules and regulations governing our interactions with the environment that are enacted by U.S. and Canadian federal, state, provincial, territorial, tribal, and municipal governments (collectively, Environmental Regulations ). Environmental Regulations impose, among other things, restrictions, liabilities and obligations in connection with (a) discharges and emissions of various substances into the environment (b) the hydraulic fracturing of wells (c) the handling, use, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of chemicals, hazardous substances and waste associated with finding, producing, transmitting and storing oil, NGLs and natural gas (d) the availability and management of fresh, potable or brackish water sources that are being used, or whose use is contemplated, in oil and natural gas operations and (e) requirements that well sites and other properties associated with our operations be constructed, operated, maintained, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities. In addition, certain types of operations, including new exploration and development projects and certain changes to existing exploration and development projects, may require the submission and approval of environmental impact assessments or permit applications. Expenditures required to institute and maintain compliance with new or existing Environmental Regulations can be significant. Failure to comply with Environmental Regulations may result in substantial clean-up and remediation costs arising from damaged or contaminated properties, the imposition of significant fines and penalties by regulators and costly litigation or administrative proceedings. Examples of recently proposed and final Environmental Regulations or other regulatory initiatives include the following: 
 
 39 

Emissions - Greenhouse gases (which include, among other things, methane, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and various fluorinated gases GHGs are typically emitted throughout all phases of the oil and natural gas supply chain, including production, transportation, processing, refining and storage operations. Additionally, although beyond our control, end user consumption of oil and natural gas in activities such as power generation and motorized transportation also results in GHG emissions. In the United States, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA has determined that GHG emissions present a danger to public health and the environment and has adopted Environmental Regulations that, among other things, restrict GHG emissions and require the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified sources. For example, in November 2021 and supplemented in November 2022, the EPA proposed New Source Performance Standard Subpart OOOOb that seeks to impose more stringent methane and volatile organic compound emission standards for new, reconstructed, and modified sources in the oil and natural gas industry. The EPA also proposed New Source Performance Standard Subpart OOOOc, which would create, for the first-time, emission guidelines for existing oil and natural gas sources to be included in individual states implementation plans. These Subpart OOOOb and OOOOc standards expand upon previously issued New Source Performance Standards, Subpart OOOO and Subpart OOOOa published by the EPA in 2012 and 2016, respectively. Furthermore, in November 2022, the BLM proposed regulations limiting the waste of natural gas from venting, flaring and leaks during operations on existing and new federal and tribal leases. In addition, policy makers at both the federal and state levels continue to propose more stringent Environmental Regulations designed to further limit GHG and other air emissions. Many state and local officials have stated their intent to intensify efforts to regulate GHG and other air emissions, including methane, from the oil and natural gas industry and it is anticipated that the Biden Administration will propose additional Environmental Regulations that may impose new costs on the oil and natural gas industry in an effort to accelerate reductions of GHG and other air emissions from both the production and consumption of energy. 
 
 In Canada, the Environment and Climate Change Canada published, in November 2022, a proposed regulatory framework for the reduction of methane emissions in the oil and gas sector in order to achieve at least a 75 percent reduction in oil and gas methane by 2030 relative to 2012. The proposed regulatory amendments would, among other things, prohibit flaring and venting, require high levels of equipment efficiency and require annual inspections for non-producing wells. Alberta and British Columbia have equivalency agreements in place with the Government of Canada, such that the current federal methane regulations generally do not apply in these provinces. However, in the event that the proposed federal amendments are passed, regulatory changes in Alberta and British Columbia will likely be required to maintain equivalency. The comment period for the proposed regulatory framework closed in December 2022. Additional details regarding timing and the text of the proposed regulatory amendments have not been released. 
 
 On January 1, 2023, material amendments to Alberta's Technology, Innovation and Emissions Reduction Regulation TIER came into force. The amendments align TIER with Canada's federal Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, provide price certainty and seek to address a potential surplus of provincial carbon credits in the coming years. As a result of the amendments, flaring emissions are now included in the total regulated emissions for the Company's aggregate oil and gas facilities that are subject to TIER. 
 
 The U.S. and Canadian federal governments, along with several provincial and state governments, have also announced intentions to adhere to certain international protocols regarding GHG emissions and regulate GHGs and certain air pollutants. In addition to federal action, many state, provincial and local officials have stated their intent to intensify efforts to regulate GHG emissions, including methane, from the oil and natural gas industry. These governments are currently developing and/or implementing regulatory and policy frameworks to deliver on their announcements. For example, effective February 19, 2021, the United States officially rejoined the Paris Agreement, an international accord to address climate change through voluntary and non-binding commitments to reduce GHG emissions by signatory nations. Pursuant to its pledge under the Paris Agreement, the United States has committed to reducing its net GHG emissions by 50-52 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. In Canada, the Government of Canada (a) has committed to cutting Canada s net GHG emissions by 40-45 percent below 2005 levels by 2030 in accordance with its pledge under the Paris Agreement (b) is gradually raising the federal carbon tax to C 170/tonne CO2e by 2030 and (c) has announced its intention to impose a hard cap on GHG emissions from the oil and natural gas industry, seek to reduce methane emissions from the oil and natural gas industry by 75 percent below 2012 levels by 2030 and ensure GHG emission reductions are on a pace and scale sufficient to reach net-zero by 2050. In November 2021, the Unites States, Canada, and other countries entered into the Glasgow Climate Pact, which includes a range of measures designed to address climate change, including but not limited to the phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies, reducing methane emissions 30 percent by 2030, and cooperating toward the advancement of the 
 40 

development of clean energy. We actively participate in certain provincial industrial emission programs offered by both Alberta and British Columbia that allow for the generation of offsets and other rebates to incent ivize emission reduction projects and mitigate carbon tax costs . We expect to continue to be able to utilize these provincial programs in the future to migrate our carbon tax costs. 
 
 Hydraulic Fracturing Operations - The U.S. and Canadian federal governments, along with certain U.S. state and Canadian provincial governments, continue to review aspects of the scientific, regulatory and policy framework under which hydraulic fracturing operations are conducted. Most of these governments are primarily engaged in the collection, review and assessment of technical information regarding the hydraulic fracturing process and have not provided specific details with respect to any significant actual, proposed or contemplated changes to the hydraulic fracturing regulatory construct. However, certain environmental and other groups have made claims that hydraulic fracturing techniques are harmful to surface water and drinking water sources and continue to suggest that additional Environmental Regulations may be needed to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process. Further, certain governments in jurisdictions where we do not currently operate have considered or implemented moratoriums on hydraulic fracturing until further studies can be completed and some governments have adopted, and others have considered adopting, Environmental Regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations or result in an outright ban of hydraulic fracturing in oil and natural gas operations. 
 
 Seismic Activity - Some areas of North America are experiencing an increased frequency of localized seismic activity which has been associated with oil and natural gas operations. Although the occurrence and risk of seismicity in relation to oil and natural gas operations is generally very low, it has been linked to the underground disposal of produced water and, in some instances, has been correlated with hydraulic fracturing activities. This has prompted legislative and regulatory initiatives intended to address these concerns. These initiatives have the potential to (a) require additional seismic monitoring (b) restrict the volume of produced water injected in certain disposal wells (c) restrict the injection of produced water in certain underground formations and (d) modify or curtail hydraulic fracturing operations in certain areas. 
 
 The cost and effects of complying with existing and emerging Environmental Regulations (including those with respect to emissions, hydraulic fracturing operations and seismic activity) and proposed carbon taxes are not currently anticipated to be material to our operations, however federal, state, provincial and local regulations and programs are either under development or in the early stages of implementation and we are unable to accurately predict the total future impact of such regulations and programs. Increased Environmental Regulations and/or carbon taxes could (a) materially increase our cost of compliance and other operating costs and/or (b) impede or prevent development of our oil, NGLs and natural gas assets, reducing (i) the amount of oil, NGLs and natural gas we are ultimately able to produce from our reserves and (ii) our overall quantity of oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We are subject to risks and uncertainties arising out of government action in response to concerns over climate change that could reduce demand for the oil, NGLs and natural gas we produce increase our operating costs and limit the areas in which we may explore for, develop, and produce oil, NGLs and natural gas. 
 
 Public attention to issues concerning the existence and extent of climate change, and the role of human activity in it, continues to increase, with the oil and natural gas industry receiving heightened scrutiny regarding GHG emissions. Internationally, this has resulted in existing and pending international agreements to reduce GHG emissions globally, while in Canada and the United States, this has resulted in both national, regional and local legislation and regulatory programs. For example, On January 27, 2021, President Biden issued Executive Order 14008 entitled "Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad," directing the heads of various federal agencies, to the extent consistent with applicable law and in consultation with other agencies and stakeholders, to, among other things, (a) assess climate related risks to federal agencies (b) pause the issuance of new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and natural gas permitting and leasing practices (c) achieve a carbon-pollution free electricity sector by 2035 (d) procure clean and zero-emission vehicles for federal, state, local and tribal government fleets and (e) identify and eliminate federal fossil fuel subsidies. On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act (the IRA which contains tax inducements and other provisions that incentivize investment, development, and deployment of alternative energy sources and technologies, which could increase operating costs within the oil and 
 41 

gas industry and accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels. Additionally, an increasing number of states, local municipalities and other groups have made claims in federal and state courts against oil and natural gas companies , including Ovintiv, alleging that GHG emissions from oil and natural gas produced by such companies has contributed, and continues to contribute, to climate change. These allegations have included claims of public and private nuisance, trespass, negligence, strict liability and civil conspiracy. Some in the investment community (including, among others, shareholder s , bondholders, institutional lenders, investment advisors, pension and sovereign wealth funds and endowments) have also become increasing concerned with the causes of climate change and the role oil and natural gas companies play in any of its purported effects. This has led some in the investment community to shift all or part of their investment or funding allocations away from the oil and natural gas industry and others to modify the terms upon which funding is made available to the oil and natural gas industry . In other instances, it has led shareholder s to initiate lawsuits against the directors and management of oil and natural gas companies and/or bring shareholder proposals demanding that oil and natural gas companies increase climate disclosure change business practices or operations or appoint new board representation. 
 
 If initiatives and actions brought by private parties or additional governmental regulations with respect to climate change intensify, we could experience (a) a reduction in demand for the oil and natural gas we produce and sell (b) a material increase in our cost of compliance and other operating costs (c) difficulty in developing our oil and natural gas assets, reducing (i) the amount of oil, NGLs and natural gas we are ultimately able to produce from our reserves and (ii) our overall quantity of oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves (d) limitations on our ability to access capital markets and raise capital on satisfactory terms, or at all and (e) costly and time consuming litigation. While we are unable to accurately assess the probability and impact of potential climate change regulations, initiatives and actions, the occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing could have have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 During 2021, we initiated scenario planning analysis in alignment with recommendations of the Financial Stability Board s Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures TCFD ). This expanded climate-focused scenario planning framework, included forecasts of future demand and pricing in energy markets, as well as changes in government regulations and policy. Given the dynamic nature of the Company s business, the Company generally performs annual scenario analyses with five-year time horizons. When analyzing longer-term TCFD scenarios, we rely on external analysis for demand scenarios, carbon pricing, and comparison-pricing scenarios, which are then compared to our internally prepared base-case pricing analysis. Given the numerous estimates that are required to run these scenarios, our estimates could differ materially from actual results. Additionally, by electing to set and share publicly these metrics in our sustainability report and our commitment to expand upon its disclosures, our business may also face increased scrutiny related to ESG initiatives. 
 
 Enhanced scrutiny on ESG matters could have an adverse effect on our operations. 
 
 Our efforts to research, establish, accomplish and accurately report on our emissions goals, targets and strategies expose us to numerous operational, reputational, financial, legal and other risks. Our ability to reach our target emissions is subject to a multitude of factors and conditions, many of which are out of our control. Examples of such factors include evolving government regulation, the pace of changes in technology, the successful development and deployment of existing or new technologies and business solutions on a commercial scale, the availability, timing and cost of equipment, manufactured goods and services, and the availability of requisite financing and federal and state incentive programs. 
 
 Enhanced scrutiny on ESG matters related to, among other things, concerns raised by advocacy groups about climate change, hydraulic fracturing, waste disposal, oil spills, and explosions of natural gas transmission pipelines may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny, which may, in turn, lead to new state, provincial and federal safety and environmental laws, regulations, guidelines, and enforcement interpretations. These actions may cause operational delays or restrictions, increased operating costs, additional regulatory burdens, increased risk of litigation, and adverse impacts on our access to capital. Moreover, governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance, and the public may engage in the permitting process, including through intervention in the courts. Negative public perception could cause the permits we require to conduct our operations to be withheld, delayed, or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business. 
 
 We may face increased scrutiny from the investment community, other stakeholders and the media related to our emissions goals and strategies. As a result, we could damage our reputation if we fail to act responsibly in the areas 
 42 

in which it reports. Any harm to our reputation resulting from setting these metrics, expanding our disclosures, or our failure or perceived failure to meet such metrics or disclosures could adversely affect our business, financial performance, and growth. If our emissions goals and strategies to achieve them do not meet evolving investor or other stakeholder expectations or standards, our reputation, ability to attract and retain employees and attractiveness as an investment, business partner or acquirer could be negatively impacted. Similarly, our failure or perceived failure to fulfill emissions goals and targets, to comply with ethica l ESG or other standards, regulations, or expectations, or to satisfy various reporting standards with respect to these matters effectively could have the same negative impacts and further expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation. Even if we achieve our goals, targets and objectives, we may not realize all of the benefits that were expected at the time the goals were established. 
 
 Financial and Liquidity Risk 
 Downgrades in our credit ratings could increase our cost of capital and limit our access to capital, suppliers or counterparties. 
 
 Rating agencies regularly evaluate our credit, basing their credit ratings for our long-term and short-term debt securities on a variety of factors, including factors over which we have some control (e.g., our financial strength), as well as factors not entirely within our control (e.g., general macroeconomic trends and conditions affecting the oil and natural gas industry generally). There is no assurance that one or more of the Company s credit ratings will not be downgraded in the future, including below investment grade. 
 
 Our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are directly impacted by our credit ratings. A credit rating downgrade may increase the cost of borrowing under our existing credit facilities, limit access to our current commercial paper programs, limit our access to private and public markets to raise short-term and long-term debt capital, and negatively impact our overall cost of capital. Credit ratings may also be important to suppliers or counterparties when they seek to engage in certain transactions. If we experience downgrades in one or more of our credit ratings, we may be required to post collateral, letters of credit, cash or other forms of security as financial assurance for our performance under certain contractual arrangements with various counterparties including marketing, midstream (including gathering, processing and transportation providers), over-the-counter derivative, and construction counterparties. Additionally, certain of these arrangements contain financial assurance language that may, under certain circumstances, permit our counterparties to request additional collateral based on our credit rating. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could adversely affect our ability to execute portions of our business strategy, including hedging, and could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital position. 
 
 Our level of indebtedness may limit our financial flexibility. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had outstanding long-term unsecured senior notes of 3,176 million, 393 million in outstanding commercial paper and no outstanding balance under its revolving credit facilities. The terms of our various financing arrangements, including but not limited to the indentures relating to our outstanding senior notes and the credit agreements relating to our revolving credit facilities, impose restrictions on our ability to take a number of actions that we may otherwise desire to take, including incurring additional debt (including guarantees of indebtedness) and selling or creating liens on certain assets. 
 
 Our level of indebtedness could affect our operations by: 

requiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flows from operations to service indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for other purposes 

reducing our competitiveness compared to similar oil and natural gas companies that have less debt 

limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital investments and acquisitions 

limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry and 

increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions. 

Our ability to meet and service our debt obligations depends on our future operational performance. General economic conditions oil, NGLs or natural gas prices and financial, business and other factors may affect our operational performance. Many of these factors are beyond our control. If we are unable to satisfy our debt obligations with cash on hand, we may attempt to refinance or repay portions of our indebtedness, including with 
 43 

proceeds from a public securities offering or the sale of certain assets. No assurance can be given that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow s to pay the interest on our debt, or that funds from future borrowings, equity financings or asset sales will be available to pay or refinance our debt on terms that we consider favorable. Further, if we incur additional debt to finance asset or business acquisitions , we may decrease our liquidity by using a significant portion of our available cash or borrowing capacity to finance such acquisitions, and such acquisitions could result in a significant increase in our interest expense or financial leverage. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could adversely affect our ability to execute portions of our business strategy and could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital position. 
 Our risk management activities may prevent us from fully benefiting from an increase in oil, NGLs and natural gas prices and expose us to certain other risks. 
 
 We are exposed to, among other things, fluctuations in oil, NGLs and natural gas prices and foreign currency exchange rates. We actively monitor such exposures and, where we deem appropriate, utilize derivative financial instruments and physical delivery contracts to mitigate the potential impact of declines in oil, NGLs and natural gas prices and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Under U.S. GAAP, derivative financial instruments that do not qualify or are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are fair valued with the resulting changes recognized in current period net earnings. The utilization of derivative financial instruments may therefore introduce significant volatility into our reported net earnings. 
 
 The terms of our various risk management agreements and the amount of estimated production hedged may limit the benefits we receive from an increase in oil, NGLs and natural gas prices. We may also suffer financial loss if (a) we fail to produce anticipated volumes of oil, NGLs and natural gas, particularly during periods of increasing commodity prices or (b) counterparties to our risk management agreements fail to fulfill their obligations under the agreements, particularly during periods of declining commodity prices. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could adversely affect our ability to execute portions of our business strategy and could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital position. 
 
 The decision to return capital to shareholders, whether through cash dividends, share buybacks or otherwise, and the amount and timing of such capital returns is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will vary from time to time. 
 
 Although we currently intend to return capital to shareholders in the form of (a) a base quarterly cash dividend (b) variable cash dividends and/or (c) repurchases of our outstanding common stock (commonly known as share buybacks), the amount and timing of these returns of capital to shareholders may vary from time to time. The decision whether to return capital to shareholders, as well as the timing and amount of any return of capital to shareholders, is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors, which regularly evaluates our proposed capital returns to shareholders and the requirements, if any, under Delaware General Corporation Law DGCL ). Additionally, in the case of share buybacks, we may be limited in our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock by various governmental laws, rules and regulations which prevent us from purchasing our common stock during periods when we are in possession of material non-public information. Our repurchases may also be affected by the IRA, which was enacted in August 2022 and provides for, in part, a one percent excise tax on corporate stock repurchases. The level of dividends per share of common stock will also be affected by the number of outstanding shares of common stock and other securities that may be entitled to receive cash dividends or other payments. 
 The amount of cash available to return to shareholders, if any, can vary significantly from period to period for a number of reasons, including, among other things: our operational and financial performance fluctuations in the costs to produce oil, NGLs and natural gas the amount of cash required or retained for debt service or repayment amounts required to fund capital expenditures and working capital requirements our ability to access capital markets foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates any agreements relating to our indebtedness that restrict our ability to return capital to shareholders and the other risks set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The trading price of our securities, including our common stock, may deteriorate if we are unable to meet investor expectations with respect to the timing and amount of capital returns to shareholders, and such deterioration may be material. 
 
 44 

Regulation and Litigation Risk 
 
 We are subject to extensive federal, state, provincial and local government laws, rules and regulations that can adversely affect the cost, manner and feasibility of our business, and increased regulation in the future could increase costs, impose additional operating restrictions and cause delays. 
 
 All of our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, provincial, local and other laws, rules and regulations, including with respect to drilling operations completion operations, including the use of hydraulic fracturing the production of oil, NGLs and natural gas the disposal of produced water and other hazardous waste the gathering and transportation of oil, NGLs and natural gas the imposition of taxes royalty payments environmental matters, including air and water emissions or discharges free trade agreements worker health and safety and conservation policies, including policies related to environmentally sensitive areas and protected species. These laws, rules and regulations may impose substantial liabilities for our failure to comply, including the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties and the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting some or all of our activities in a particular area. 
 
 In the normal course of our business, we may be required to make large expenditures to comply with applicable governmental laws, rules, regulations, permits or orders. While we cannot predict the actions that future laws, rules and regulations may require or prohibit, our business could be subject to increased operating and other compliance costs and our operations may be delayed if existing laws, rules and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws, rules and regulations become applicable to our operations. Any such increases or delays could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We currently are, and from time to time in the future may be, subject to claims, litigation, administrative proceedings and regulatory actions that may not be resolved in our favor. 
 
 We currently are, and from time to time in the future may be, subject to claims, litigation, administrative proceedings and regulatory actions. The outcome of these matters may be difficult to assess or quantify, and there cannot be any assurance that such matters will be resolved in our favor. If we are unable to resolve such matters favorably, we or our directors, officers or employees may become involved in legal proceedings that could result in an onerous or unfavorable decision, including fines, sanctions, monetary damages or the inability to engage in certain operations or transactions. The defence of such matters may also be costly, time consuming and could divert the attention of management and key personnel away from our operations. We may also be subject to adverse publicity associated with such matters, regardless of whether such allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. As a result, such matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. See Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 The ability of Canadian and other non-resident shareholders to effect service of process or enforce remedies against Ovintiv, its directors, officers, experts, and assets may be limited. 
 
 We are incorporated in the State of Delaware and our principal place of business is in the United States. Most of our directors and officers are residents of the United States and many of the experts who provide us with services are residents of the United States. Additionally, most of our oil and natural gas assets and production are located in the United States. It may be difficult for our shareholders in Canada or other non-U.S. jurisdictions (each a "Foreign Jurisdiction") to (a) effect service of process within such Foreign Jurisdiction upon Ovintiv or certain of our directors, officers and representatives of experts who are not residents of the Foreign Jurisdiction (together, Non-Residents and (b) enforce the judgments of courts in an applicable Foreign Jurisdiction against Ovintiv and other Non-Residents based upon liability under the laws of such Foreign Jurisdiction, including the securities laws of any province within Canada. 
 45 

Tax Risks 
 
 U.S. and Canadian tax laws and regulations may change over time, and such changes may result in increased taxes on our business. 
 
 From time to time, legislation has been proposed that, if enacted into law, would make significant changes to U.S. and Canadian tax laws and regulations, including those specifically applicable to the oil and natural gas industry (such as the intangible drilling and development costs deduction under U.S. federal income tax law). On August 16, 2022, the IRA was signed into law. The IRA introduced a new 15 percent corporate alternative minimum tax CAMT ), effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022 on corporations with average adjusted financial statement income over 1 billion for any 3-year period preceding the tax year. Based on available guidance, the Company does not expect to exceed the 1 billion threshold to be subject to the CAMT in 2023 but may be subject to the CAMT in 2024. While we are unable to predict the timing, scope and effect of any proposed or enacted tax law changes, elimination of certain tax deductions, as well as any other changes to, or the imposition of new, federal, state or local U.S. or Canadian taxes (including the imposition of, or increases in, production, severance or similar taxes), could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We will continue to monitor and assess any proposed or enacted tax law changes to determine the impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary. 
 Additionally, U.S. and Canadian tax authorities could detrimentally change their administrative practices or may disagree with the way we calculate our tax liabilities or structure our arrangements and there are certain tax matters under governmental review for which the timing of resolution is uncertain. While we believe that our current provision for income taxes is adequate, certain tax authorities may reassess our taxes and such reassessments may be material. 
 
 Our corporate reorganization in January of 2020 may result in material Canadian and/or U.S. federal income taxes. 
 
 On January 24, 2020, Encana completed a corporate reorganization (the Reorganization ), which included among other things, our acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of Encana common stock in exchange for shares of Ovintiv common stock on a one-for-one basis and becoming the parent company of Encana and its subsidiaries and our subsequent migration from Canada to the United States, becoming a Delaware corporation (the U.S. Domestication ). The Reorganization and U.S. Domestication involved multiple complex U.S. and Canadian tax issues, including numerous assumptions and estimates of fair market value. While we believe that our analysis and application of both U.S. and Canadian tax laws to the Reorganization was correct, certain tax authorities may challenge our positions which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 General Risks 
 
 The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors have available resources in excess of our own. 
 
 The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive, and many competitors, including major integrated and independent oil and natural gas companies, as well as national oil companies, are larger and have substantially greater resources at their disposal than we do. We compete with these companies for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. Such competition can significantly increase costs and affect the availability of resources, which could provide our larger competitors a competitive advantage when acquiring equipment, leases and other properties. 
 
 We also compete with these companies for the personnel, including petroleum engineers, geologists, geophysicists and other key personnel, required to both (a) find, acquire, develop and operate our properties and (b) market our oil, NGLs and natural gas production. The experience, knowledge and contributions of our existing management team and directors to our immediate and near-term operations is of central importance for the foreseeable future. As such, the unexpected loss of services from, or retirement of any, of our key operations or management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation. In addition, the competition for qualified 
 46 

personnel in the oil and natural gas industry means there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain key personnel with the required specialized skills necessary for our business. 
 We could be adversely affected by security threats, including cyber-security threats and related disruptions. 
 
 We have become increasingly dependent upon information technology systems to conduct our daily operations. We depend on a variety of information technology systems to estimate oil, NGLs and natural gas reserve quantities process and record financial and operating data analyze seismic and drilling information and communicate with employees and third-party partners. This growing dependence on technology is accompanied by a greater sensitivity to cyber-attacks and information systems breaches. Unauthorized access to information systems by employees or third parties could corrupt or expose confidential, fiduciary, or proprietary information interrupt our communications or operations disrupt our business activities or interfere with our competitive position. Cybersecurity threat actors are becoming more sophisticated and coordinated in their attempts to access a company s information technology systems and data, including the information technology systems of cloud providers. Furthermore, geopolitical tensions or conflicts, such as Russia s invasion of Ukraine, may further heighten the risk of cybersecurity attacks. In addition, our vendors, suppliers and other business partners may separately suffer disruptions as a result of such security breaches which may directly or indirectly affect our business activities or our competitive position. 
 
 To protect our information assets and systems, we apply technical and process controls. However, such controls may not adequately prevent cyber-security breaches and we may not adopt all controls utilized by our peers. As cyber-attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to investigate, mitigate and remediate any potential vulnerabilities. We may also be subject to regulatory investigations or litigation relating to cyber-security issues. 
 
 Although we have not suffered any material losses related to a cyber-security breach to date, there is no assurance that we will not suffer material losses associated with cyber-security breaches in the future. If a cyber-attack were to successfully breach our information or operating systems, we could incur substantial remediation costs and suffer other negative consequences, including exposure to significant litigation risks. The potential for such occurrences subjects our operations to increased risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments 
 
 None. 
 
 Item 3. Legal Proceedings 
 
 Ovintiv is involved in various legal claims and actions arising in the normal course of the Company s operations. Although the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on Ovintiv s financial position, cash flows or results of operations. If an unfavorable outcome were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material impact on the Company s consolidated net earnings or loss for the period in which the effect becomes reasonably estimable. See Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, We currently are, and from time to time in the future may be, subject to claims, litigation, administrative proceedings and regulatory actions that may not be resolved in the Company s favor .

 Shareholders 
 
 The Company is authorized to issue up to 775,000,000 shares of stock consisting of: (a) 750,000,000 shares of common stock, par value 0.01 per share, and (b) 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value 0.01 per share. As at February 17, 2023, there were 243,643,104 shares of common stock outstanding held by 5,144 shareholders of record, and no shares of preferred stock outstanding. 
 
 Capital Return Information 
 
 In 2022, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of 0.20 per share of common stock for the first quarter and 0.25 per share of common stock for each of the second, third and fourth quarters (2021: 0.09375 per share of common stock for each of the first two quarters and 0.14 per share of common stock for the third and fourth quarters) and 0.95 per share of common stock annually (2021: 0.4675 per share of common stock annually). On February 27, 2023 the Board of Directors declared a dividend of 0.25 per share of Ovintiv common stock payable on March 31, 2023 to common shareholders of record as of March 15, 2023. The Company typically pays dividends quarterly to shareholders of record as of the 15 th day (or the previous business day) of the last month of each calendar quarter, with the last business day of the same month being the corresponding payment date however, the timing and amount of dividends, if any, is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. 
 
 On July 6, 2022, the Company announced it will increase cash returns to shareholders from 25 percent to 50 percent of Non-GAAP Cash Flow in excess of capital expenditures and base dividends in the form of share buybacks and/or variable dividends at the discretion of the Board. During 2022, the Company elected share buybacks under the capital allocation framework. 
 
 Although we currently intend to return capital to shareholders in the form of (a) a base quarterly cash dividend (b) variable cash dividends and/or (c) repurchases of our outstanding common stock (commonly known as share buybacks), the amount and timing of these returns of capital to shareholders may vary from time to time. The decision whether to return capital to shareholders, as well as the timing and amount of any return of capital to shareholders, is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors, which regularly evaluates our proposed capital returns to shareholders and the requirements, if any, under DGCL. See Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, The decision to return capital to shareholders, whether through cash dividends, share buybacks or otherwise, and the amount and timing of such capital returns is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will vary from time to time .

 Highlights 
 During 2022, the Company focused on executing its 2022 capital investment plan aimed at maximizing profitability through operational and capital efficiencies, minimizing the impact of inflation, delivering cash from operating activities and reducing long-term debt. Higher upstream product revenues in 2022 compared to 2021 resulted from higher average realized prices, excluding the impact of risk management activities. Increases in average realized natural gas and liquids prices of 65 percent and 35 percent, respectively, were primarily due to higher benchmark prices. Ovintiv continues to focus on optimizing realized prices from the diversification of the Company s downstream markets. 
 The Company delivered significant cash from operating activities of 3,866 million which included a net realized loss of 2,613 million on the settlement of commodity and foreign exchange risk management positions. 
 Significant Developments 

On May 9, 2022, Ovintiv announced an increase of 25 percent to its quarterly dividend payment representing an annualized dividend of 1.00 per share of common stock as part of the Company s commitment to returning capital to shareholders. 

On May 9, 2022, Ovintiv issued a notice to the trustee to redeem the Company s 1.0 billion, 5.625 percent senior notes due July 1, 2024. The senior notes were redeemed on June 10, 2022 with cash on hand and other existing sources of liquidity. The debt redemption will result in annualized interest savings of approximately 55 million. 

On July 6, 2022, Ovintiv elected to accelerate the increase in cash returns to shareholders as a result of the Company s continued strong financial performance and the previously announced asset sales. During the third quarter of 2022, the Company increased its cash return to shareholders from 25 percent to 50 percent of Non-GAAP Cash Flow in excess of capital expenditures and base dividends. Ovintiv delivered the additional shareholder returns through share buybacks under its NCIB program. 

During the third quarter of 2022, the Company closed its previously announced divestitures for portions of its Uinta and Bakken assets, and received combined proceeds of approximately 215 million, after closing and other adjustments. Both transactions were effective April 1, 2022. 

On September 28, 2022, the Company announced it had received regulatory approval for the renewal of its NCIB program, that enables the Company to purchase, for cancellation or return to treasury, up to approximately 24.8 million shares of common stock over a 12-month period from October 3, 2022 to October 2, 2023. The number of shares authorized for purchase represents approximately 10 percent of Ovintiv s issued and outstanding shares of common stock as at September 19, 2022. The Company continues to execute the NCIB program in conjunction with its capital allocation framework.

20 2 3 Outlook 
 Industry Outlook 
 Oil Markets 
 The oil and gas industry is cyclical and commodity prices are inherently volatile. Oil prices reflect global supply and demand dynamics as well as the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment. 
 Oil prices for 2023 will be impacted by the interplay between recessionary concerns, continued OPEC+ production restraint, increasing global demand for oil and continued supply uncertainties resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Recessionary concerns continue to have an impact on global demand as central banks maintain tight monetary policies. Supply and the accumulation of global oil inventories will be impacted by changes in OPEC+ production levels, the extent of decline in oil exports from Russia and changes in production by non-OPEC countries. 
 Natural Gas Markets 
 Natural gas prices are primarily impacted by structural changes in supply and demand as well as deviations from seasonally normal weather. 
 Natural gas prices for 2023 will be impacted by the interplay between natural gas production and associated natural gas from oil production, changes in demand from the power generation sector, changes in export levels of U.S. liquefied natural gas, impacts from seasonal weather, as well as supply chain constraints or other disruptions resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. 
 Company Outlook 
 The Company will continue to exercise discretion and discipline to optimize capital allocation throughout 2023 as the commodity price environment evolves. Ovintiv pursues innovative ways to maximize cash flows and minimize the impact of inflation to reduce upstream operating and administrative expenses. 
 Markets for oil and natural gas are exposed to different price risks and are inherently volatile. While the market price for oil tends to move in the same direction as the global market, regional differentials may develop. Natural gas prices may vary between geographic regions depending on local supply and demand conditions. To mitigate price volatility and provide more certainty around cash flows, the Company may enter into derivative financial instruments. As at December 31, 2022, the Company has hedged approximately 38.0 Mbbls/d of expected oil and condensate production and 397 MMcf/d of expected natural gas production for 2023. In addition, Ovintiv proactively utilizes transportation contracts to diversify the Company s sales markets, thereby reducing significant exposure to any given market and regional pricing. 
 Additional information on Ovintiv s hedging program can be found in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Capital Investment 
 The Company plans to spend approximately 2,150 million to 2,350 million on its full year 2023 capital investment program, focusing on maximizing returns from high margin liquids. In 2023, the Company expects to generate significant cash flows in excess of capital expenditures. 
 Ovintiv continually strives to improve well performance and lower costs through innovative techniques. Ovintiv s redesigned wet sand sourcing model, which incorporates on-site sand storage and delivery systems, helps to prevent mine and trucking delays, thereby increasing truck productivity to enable smooth integration with local mine access. This model increases operational efficiencies and contributes to well cost savings as well as providing increased resiliency against winter weather. Ovintiv's large-scale cube development model utilizes multi-well pads and advanced completion designs to maximize returns and resource recovery from its reservoirs. Ovintiv s disciplined capital program and continuous innovation create flexibility to allocate capital in changing commodity markets to 
 54 

minimize the impact of inflation , and maximize cash flows while preserving the long-term value of the Company s multi-basin portfolio. 
 Production 
 Ovintiv is strategically positioned in the current environment to maintain a relatively flat production profile while generating significant cash flows in excess of capital expenditures. 
 In 2023, the Company expects full year average total production volumes of approximately 500.0 MBOE/d to 525.0 MBOE/d, oil and plant condensate production volumes of approximately 165.0 Mbbls/d to 175.0 Mbbls/d, other NGLs production volumes of approximately 80.0 Mbbls/d to 85.0 Mbbls/d and natural gas production volumes of approximately 1,525 MMcf/d to 1,575 MMcf/d. 
 Operating Expenses 
 With increased activity in the oil and gas industry and strong commodity prices, inflationary pressures are expected to continue to elevate service and supply costs. Upward pressure on service and supply costs will continue to be impacted by supply chain disruptions, labor shortages and increased demand for fuel, electricity and steel. 
 
 Ovintiv continues to pursue innovative ways to minimize inflationary pressures with efficiency improvements and effective supply chain management to reduce upstream operating expenses. Efficiency improvements were driven by Ovintiv s innovative practices which include using the cube development approach to maximize simul-frac completions, increasing local wet sand storage, redesigning and re-using equipment, and improving longer lateral length developments. The Company quickly deployed innovations and best practices across its portfolio, ultimately maximizing the performance and overall efficiency of its operations. 
 In 2023, the Company expects to incur full year upstream transportation and processing costs of approximately 9.00 per BOE to 9.50 per BOE, upstream operating expenses of approximately 4.00 per BOE to 4.50 per BOE, and total production, mineral and other taxes of approximately four to five percent of upstream revenues. The Company s upstream operations refers to the summation of the USA and Canadian operating segments. 
 Long-Term Debt Reduction 
 Ovintiv remains focused on strengthening its balance sheet, reducing its long-term debt balance by 3.3 billion since the end of 2020. 
 In June 2022, Ovintiv redeemed its 1.0 billion, 5.625 percent senior notes due July 1, 2024, with cash on hand and other existing sources of liquidity. The debt redemption will result in annualized interest savings of approximately 55 million. 
 In 2022, the Company also repurchased in the open market, portions of certain senior notes totaling approximately 565 million in principal, plus accrued interest and premiums. The Company paid premiums of 22 million to complete the open market repurchases, which will result in annualized interest savings of approximately 33 million. 
 As at December 31, 2022, the Company had 393 million of commercial paper outstanding under its U.S. commercial paper U.S. CP programs and no outstanding balances under its revolving credit facilities. 
 Additional information on Ovintiv s long-term debt and liquidity position can be found in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this MD&A, respectively. 
 Additional information on Ovintiv s 2023 Corporate Guidance can be accessed on the Company s website at www.ovintiv.com .

Environmental, Social and Governance 
 Ovintiv recognizes climate change as a global concern and the importance of reducing its environmental footprint as part of the solution. The Company voluntarily participates in emission reduction programs and has adopted a range of strategies to help reduce emissions from its operations. These strategies include incorporating new and proven technologies and optimizing processes in its operations and working closely with third-party providers to develop best practices. The Company continues to look for innovative techniques and efficiencies to help maintain its commitment to emission reductions. 
 During the first quarter of 2022, the Company announced a Scope 1&2 GHG emissions intensity reduction target of 50 percent compared to 2019 levels, to be achieved by 2030. The GHG emissions reduction target is tied to the 2022 annual compensation program for all employees. 
 In May 2022, Ovintiv published its full year 2021 ESG results in its 2022 Sustainability Report which highlights the Company s progress in emissions intensity reductions. During 2021, the Company reduced its Scope 1&2 GHG emissions intensity by 24 percent compared to 2019 and reduced its methane emissions intensity by greater than 50 percent compared to 2019. 
 Ovintiv s constant pursuit of efficiencies and continuous improvements allowed the Company to eliminate routine flaring in its operations. The Company is in full alignment with the World Bank Zero Routine Flaring initiative, well ahead of the World Bank s target date of 2030. 
 Ovintiv is committed to diversity, equity and inclusion DEI ). The Company s social commitment framework, which is rooted in the Company s foundational values of integrity, safety, sustainability, trust and respect, fosters a culture of inclusion that respects stakeholders and strengthens communities. 
 Ovintiv remains committed to protecting the health and safety of its workforce. Safety is a foundational value at Ovintiv and plays a critical role in the Company s belief that a safe workplace is a strong indicator of a well-managed business. This safety-oriented mindset enables the Company to quickly respond to emergencies and minimize any impacts to employees and business continuity. Safety performance goals are incorporated into the Company s annual compensation program. Additional information on DEI and employee safety can be found in the Human Capital section of Item 1 and 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 Revenues 
 Ovintiv s revenues are substantially derived from sales of oil, NGLs and natural gas production. Increases or decreases in Ovintiv s revenue, profitability and future production are highly dependent on the commodity prices the Company receives. Prices are market driven and fluctuate due to factors beyond the Company s control, such as supply and demand, seasonality and geopolitical and economic factors. The Company s realized prices generally reflect WTI, NYMEX, Edmonton Condensate and AECO benchmark prices, as well as other downstream benchmarks, including Houston and Dawn. The Company proactively mitigates price risk and optimizes margins by entering into firm transportation contracts to diversify market access to different sales points. Realized prices, excluding the impact of risk management activities, may differ from the benchmarks for many reasons, including quality, location, or production being sold at different market hubs.

An increase of 28.58 per bbl, or 44 percent, in the average realized oil prices which increased revenues by 1,370 million. The increase reflected higher WTI and Houston benchmark prices which were both up 39 percent and the strengthening of regional pricing relative to the WTI benchmark price in the USA Operations and 

Lower average oil production volumes of 8.7 Mbbls/d decreased revenues by 208 million. Lower volumes were primarily due to natural declines in Permian and Anadarko (10.2 Mbbls/d) and the sale of Eagle Ford assets in the second quarter of 2021 (5.8 Mbbls/d), partially offset by successful drilling in Uinta and Bakken (9.0 Mbbls/d). 

 NGL Revenues 
 2022 versus 2021 
 NGL revenues were higher by 383 million compared to 2021 primarily due to: 

An increase of 22.84 per bbl, or 35 percent, in the average realized plant condensate price which increased revenues by 372 million. The increase reflected higher Edmonton Condensate and WTI benchmark prices which were up 43 percent and 39 percent, respectively, and changes in regional pricing relative to the WTI benchmark price 

An increase of 5.07 per bbl, or 19 percent, in the average realized other NGL prices which increased revenues by 162 million. The increase reflected higher other NGL benchmark prices and higher regional pricing and 

Lower average plant condensate production volumes of 6.9 Mbbls/d decreased revenues by 168 million. Lower volumes were primarily due to higher royalties resulting from higher commodity prices in Montney (2.8 Mbbls/d) and natural declines in Montney (2.7 Mbbls/d). 

 59 

Natural Gas Revenues 
 2022 versus 2021 
 Natural gas revenues were higher by 1,181 million compared to 2021 primarily due to: 

An increase of 2.31 per Mcf, or 65 percent, in the average realized natural gas prices which increased revenues by 1,259 million. The increase reflected higher NYMEX, Dawn and AECO benchmark prices which were up 73 percent, 72 percent and 56 percent, respectively and 

Lower average natural gas production volumes of 62 MMcf/d decreased revenues by 78 million primarily due to higher royalties resulting from higher commodity prices in Montney (95 MMcf/d) and the sales of Duvernay and Eagle Ford assets in the second quarter of 2021 (20 MMcf/d), partially offset by successful drilling in Montney (59 MMcf/d).

Income Tax Expense (Recovery) 
 2022 versus 2021 
 In 2022, Ovintiv recorded a lower income tax recovery of 100 million compared to 2021, primarily due to the resolution of prior years tax items recognized in 2021 and changes in valuation allowances. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, a valuation allowance of 1,299 million was reversed, of which 1,028 million was recognized as a result of positive earnings in the U.S. and Canada. Deferred income tax assets are routinely assessed for realizability, and consequently, after weighing both positive and negative evidence, the Company reversed an additional 271 million of the valuation allowance primarily due to positive forecasted earnings in the U.S. During the year ended December 31, 2021, a valuation allowance reversal of 558 million was recognized as a result of positive earnings in the U.S. and Canada. 
 Effective Tax Rate 
 The Company s annual effective income tax rate is primarily impacted by earnings, changes in valuation allowances, income tax related to foreign operations, state taxes, amounts in respect of prior periods, the effect of legislative changes, non-taxable items and tax differences on transactions. 
 The Company s effective tax rate was (2.2) percent for 2022, which is lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent primarily due to reductions in valuation allowances offset by certain non-taxable items. 
 The Company s effective tax rate was (14.3) percent for 2021, which was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent primarily due to the resolution of prior years tax items and changes in valuation allowances. 
 The determination of income and other tax liabilities of the Company and its subsidiaries requires interpretation of complex domestic and foreign tax laws and regulations, that are subject to change. The Company s interpretation of tax laws may differ from the interpretation of the tax authorities. As a result, there are tax matters under review for which the timing of resolution is uncertain. The Company believes that the provision for income taxes is adequate. 
 Additional information on income taxes can be found in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 The Company has the flexibility to access cash equivalents and a range of funding alternatives at competitive rates through committed revolving credit facilities as well as debt and equity capital markets. Ovintiv closely monitors the accessibility of cost-effective credit and ensures that sufficient liquidity is in place to fund capital expenditures and dividend payments. In addition, the Company may use cash and cash equivalents, cash from operating activities, or proceeds from asset divestitures to fund its operations and capital allocation framework or to manage its capital structure as discussed below. 
 The Company s capital structure consists of total shareholders equity plus long-term debt, including any current portion. The Company s objectives when managing its capital structure are to maintain financial flexibility to preserve Ovintiv s access to capital markets and its ability to meet financial obligations and finance internally generated growth, as well as potential acquisitions. Ovintiv has a practice of maintaining capital discipline and strategically managing its capital structure by adjusting capital spending, adjusting dividends paid to shareholders, issuing new shares of common stock, purchasing shares of common stock for cancellation or return to treasury, issuing new debt and repaying or repurchasing existing debt.

 A non-GAAP measure which is defined in the Non-GAAP Measures section of this MD&A. 

 In March, the Company commenced negotiations to amend and restate its committed revolving credit facilities. Effective April 1, 2022, the Company has access to two committed revolving U.S. dollar denominated credit facilities totaling 3.5 billion, which include a 2.2 billion revolving credit facility for Ovintiv Inc. and a 1.3 billion revolving credit facility for a Canadian subsidiary (collectively, the Credit Facilities ). Maturity dates for both credit facilities were extended to July 2026 and the Company has full access to these Credit Facilities. The Credit Facilities provide financial flexibility and allow the Company to fund its operations or capital investment program. At December 31, 2022, there were no outstanding amounts under the revolving Credit Facilities. 
 During the first quarter of 2022, Ovintiv s credit rating was upgraded to investment grade by one of its credit rating agencies driven by Ovintiv s significant debt reductions and improved commodity price assumptions used by the rating agency. All of Ovintiv s credit ratings are investment grade as at December 31, 2022. 
 Depending on the Company s credit rating and market demand, the Company may issue from its two U.S. CP programs, which include a 1.5 billion program for Ovintiv Inc. and a 1.0 billion program for a Canadian subsidiary. As at December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately 393 million of commercial paper outstanding under its U.S. CP program maturing at various dates with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.24 percent, which is supported by the Company s Credit Facilities. 
 67 

The Credit Facilities, uncommitted demand lines, and cash and cash equivalents, net of outstanding commercial paper provide Ovintiv with total liquidity of approximately 3.3 billion. At December 31, 2022, Ovintiv also had approximately 126 million in undrawn letters of credit issued in the normal course of business primarily as collateral security related to sales arrangements. 
 Ovintiv has a U.S. shelf registration statement under which the Company may issue from time to time, debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, warrants, units, share purchase contracts and share purchase units in the U.S. The U.S. shelf registration statement expires in March 2023 and is intended to be renewed by the Company. The ability to issue securities under the U.S. shelf registration statement is dependent upon market conditions and securities law requirements. 
 Ovintiv is currently in compliance with, and expects that it will continue to be in compliance with, all financial covenants under the Credit Facilities. Management monitors Debt to Adjusted Capitalization, which is a non-GAAP measure defined in the Non-GAAP Measures section of this MD&A, as a proxy for Ovintiv s financial covenant under the Credit Facilities, which requires Debt to Adjusted Capitalization to be less than 60 percent. As at December 31, 2022, the Company s Debt to Adjusted Capitalization was 19 percent. The definitions used in the covenant under the Credit Facilities adjust capitalization for cumulative historical ceiling test impairments recorded in conjunction with the Company s January 1, 2012 adoption of U.S. GAAP. Additional information on financial covenants can be found in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 Operating Activities 
 Net cash from operating activities in 2022 was 3,866 million and was primarily a reflection of the impacts from higher average realized commodity prices, partially offset by the effects of the commodity price mitigation program, lower production volumes and changes in non-cash working capital. 
 Additional detail on changes in non-cash working capital can be found in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Ovintiv expects it will continue to meet the payment terms of its suppliers. 
 68 

Non-GAAP Cash Flow in 20 2 2 was 4,110 million and was primarily impacted by the items affecting cash from operating activities which are discussed below and in the Results of Operations section of this MD&A. 
 2022 versus 2021 
 Net cash from operating activities increased 737 million compared to 2021 primarily due to: 

Higher realized commodity prices 3,163 million) 

 partially offset by: 

Higher realized losses on risk management in revenues compared to 2021 1,213 million), lower production volumes 437 million), higher transportation and processing expense 170 million), higher operating expense, excluding non-cash long-term incentive costs 169 million), current income tax recovery mainly due to the resolution of prior years tax items in 2021 of 156 million, changes in non-cash working capital 146 million) and higher production, mineral and other taxes 122 million). 

 Investing Activities 
 The Company s primary investing activities are capital expenditures, acquisitions and divestitures, and are summarized in Notes 2 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 2022 and 2021 
 Net cash used in investing activities in 2022 was 1,786 million primarily due to capital expenditures. Capital expenditures increased 312 million compared to 2021 due to timing of projects and inflationary cost pressures. 
 Acquisitions in 2022 were 286 million (2021 - 11 million), which primarily included property purchases in Permian with oil and liquids-rich potential. 
 Divestitures in 2022 were 228 million, which primarily included the sale of portions of Uinta assets located in northeastern Utah and Bakken assets located in northeastern Montana, as well as certain properties that did not complement Ovintiv s existing portfolio of assets. 
 Divestitures in 2021 were 1,025 million, which primarily included the sale of Eagle Ford assets in south Texas and Duvernay assets in west central Alberta, as well as certain properties that did not complement Ovintiv s existing portfolio of assets. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities has been impacted by the Company s strategic objective to return value to shareholders by repaying or repurchasing existing debt, purchasing shares of common stock and paying dividends. 
 2022 versus 2021 
 Net cash used in financing activities in 2022 decreased 151 million compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a net issuance of revolving long-term debt compared to a net repayment in 2021 1,343 million), partially offset by increased purchases of shares of common stock under the Company s NCIB program in 2022 compared to 2021 608 million), higher repayment of long-term debt associated with open market repurchases in 2022 and the early redemption of the Company s 2024 senior notes in June 2022 compared to the early redemptions of the Company s 2022 and 2021 senior notes in June and August 2021, respectively 497 million), and an increase in dividend payments in 2022 117 million). 
 69 

From time to time, Ovintiv may seek to retire or purchase the Company s outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for other debt or equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, the Company s liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. In 2022, the Company repurchased in the open market, approximately 565 million in principal , plus accrued interest and premiums, which included a portion of its 5.375 percent senior notes due January 2026, its 6.5 percent senior notes due August 2034, its 6.625 percent senior notes due August 2037, its 6.5 percent senior notes due February 2038 and its 5.15 percent senior notes due November 2041. The Company paid premiums of 22 million to complete the open market repurchases. 
 In June 2022, Ovintiv redeemed its 1.0 billion, 5.625 percent senior notes due July 1, 2024, with cash on hand and other existing sources of liquidity. The redemption resulted in a make-whole interest payment of 47 million. 
 The Company s long-term debt, including the current portion of 393 million, totaled 3,570 million at December 31, 2022. The Company s long-term debt at December 31, 2021 totaled 4,786 million. As at December 31, 2022, the Company has no fixed rate long-term debt due until 2026 and beyond. 
 In support of the Company s commitment to unlocking shareholder value, Ovintiv utilizes its capital allocation framework to increase returns to shareholders and maintain the Company s progress on debt reduction. Since the end of 2020, the Company reduced its total long-term debt balance by 3.3 billion. On July 6, 2022, Ovintiv elected to accelerate the increase in cash returns to shareholders as a result of the Company s continued strong financial performance and the asset sales that closed during the third quarter of 2022. During the third quarter of 2022, the Company increased its cash return to shareholders from 25 percent to 50 percent of Non-GAAP Cash Flow in excess of capital expenditures and base dividends. Ovintiv delivered the additional shareholder returns through share buybacks under its NCIB program. 
 For additional information on long-term debt, refer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 Dividends increased 117 million compared to 2021, as a result of Ovintiv increasing its quarterly dividend payments to an annualized dividend of 0.80 per share of common stock during the first quarter of 2022 and a further increase to an annualized dividend of 1.00 per share of common stock in the second quarter of 2022. The dividend increases reflect the Company s commitment to returning capital to shareholders. 
 Normal Course Issuer Bid 
 On September 28, 2022, the Company announced it had received regulatory approval for the renewal of its NCIB program, that enables the Company to purchase, for cancellation or return to treasury, up to approximately 24.8 million shares of common stock over a 12-month period from October 3, 2022 to October 2, 2023. The number of shares authorized for purchase represents approximately 10 percent of Ovintiv s issued and outstanding shares of common stock as at September 19, 2022. The Company will continue to execute the renewed NCIB program in conjunction with its capital allocation framework. 
 During 2022, the Company purchased for cancellation, approximately 14.7 million shares of common stock for total consideration of approximately 719 million. 
 For additional information on the NCIB, refer to Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 70 

Material Cash Requirements 
 Ovintiv s material cash requirements include various contractual obligations arising from long-term debt, operating leases, risk management liabilities and asset retirement obligations which are recognized on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company expects to fund long term material cash requirements primarily with cash from operating activities. 
 Interest payments include scheduled cash payments on finance leases, long-term debt, and other obligations. Additional information can be found in Notes 13 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Operating leases include drilling rigs, compressors, office and buildings, certain land easements and various equipment utilized in the development and production of oil, NGLs and natural gas, as well as The Bow building. The Company subleased approximately 50 percent of The Bow office space under the lease agreement. Additional information on leases can be found in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Risk management liabilities represent Ovintiv s net liability positions with counterparties. Ovintiv expects to significantly decrease its risk management positions in 2023 as a result of the Company s strengthened balance sheet position. Additional information can be found in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Contractual commitments relating to transportation and processing commitments, and drilling and field services can be found in Notes 13 and 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Further to the commitments discussed above, Ovintiv also has various obligations that become payable if certain future events occur relating to take or pay arrangements and guarantees on transportation commitments resulting from completed property divestitures as described in Notes 19, 24 and 26, respectively, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 In addition, the Company has obligations to fund the disposal of long-lived assets upon their abandonment as well as its obligations to fund its defined benefit pension and other post-employment benefit plans as described in Notes 16 and 22, respectively, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Other than the items discussed above, there are no other transactions, arrangements, or relationships with unconsolidated entities or persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s liquidity or the availability of, or requirements for, capital resources. 
 Contingencies

Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. For a discussion of the Company s significant accounting policies refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Changes in facts and circumstances or additional information may result in revised estimates, and actual results may differ from these estimates. Management considers the following to be its most critical accounting estimates that involve judgment. The following discussion outlines the accounting policies and practices involving the use of estimates that are critical to determining Ovintiv s financial results. Changes in the estimates and assumptions discussed below could materially affect the amount or timing of the financial results of the Company. 

Description 

Judgments and Uncertainties 

Upstream Assets and Reserve Estimates 
 As Ovintiv follows full cost accounting for oil, NGLs and natural gas activities, reserves estimates are a key input to the Company s depletion, gain or loss on divestitures and ceiling test impairment calculations. In addition, these reserves are the basis for the Company s supplemental oil and gas disclosures. 

Due to the inter-relationship of various judgments made to reserve estimates and the volatile nature of commodity prices, it is generally not possible to predict the timing or magnitude of ceiling test impairments. 

Ovintiv estimates its proved oil and natural gas reserves according to the definition of proved reserves provided by the SEC. The Company s estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data and must demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. The estimation of reserves is a subjective process. 

Revisions to reserve estimates are necessary due to changes in and among other things, development plans, projected future rates of production, the timing of future expenditures, reservoir performance, economic conditions, governmental restrictions as well as changes in the expected recovery associated with infill drilling, all of which are subject to numerous uncertainties and various interpretations. Downward revisions in proved reserve estimates due to changes in reserve estimates may increase depletion expense and may also result in a ceiling test impairment. 

Reserves are calculated using an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous 12 months, held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements. 

Decreases in prices may result in reductions in certain proved reserves due to reaching economic limits at an earlier projected date and impact earnings through depletion expense and ceiling test impairments. 

Ovintiv manages its business using estimates of reserves and resources based on forecast prices and costs as it gives consideration to probable and possible reserves and future changes in commodity prices. 

Ovintiv believes that the discounted after-tax future net cash flows from proved reserves required to be used in the ceiling test calculation are not indicative of the fair market value of Ovintiv s oil and natural gas properties or the future net cash flows expected to be generated from such properties. 

Goodwill Impairments 
 Goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually in December, at the reporting unit level which are Ovintiv s country cost centers. To assess impairment, the carrying amount of each reporting unit is determined and compared to the fair value of each respective reporting unit. Any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, over its fair value is recognized as an impairment and charged to net earnings. The impairment charge measured is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Subsequent measurement of goodwill is at cost less any accumulated impairments. 

The most significant assumptions used to determine a reporting unit s fair value include estimations of oil and natural gas reserves, including both proved reserves and risk-adjusted unproved reserves, estimates of market prices considering forward commodity price curves as of the measurement date, market discount rates and estimates of operating, administrative, and capital costs adjusted for inflation. In addition, management may support fair value estimates determined with comparable companies that are actively traded in the public market, recent comparable asset transactions, and transaction premiums. This would require management to make certain judgments about the selection of comparable companies utilized. 

Because quoted market prices for the Company s reporting units are not available, management applies judgment in determining the estimated fair value of reporting units for purposes of performing goodwill impairment tests. Ovintiv may use a combination of the income and the market valuation approaches. 

Downward revisions of estimated reserves quantities, increases in future cost estimates, sustained decreases in oil or natural gas prices, or divestiture of a significant component of the reporting unit could reduce expected future cash flows and fair value estimates of the reporting units and possibly result in an impairment of goodwill in future periods. 

72 

Description 

Judgments and Uncertainties 

The Company has assessed its goodwill for impairment at December 31, 2022 and no impairment was recognized. The reporting units fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying values and as a result were not at risk of failing the impairment test as at December 31, 2022. 

Asset Retirement Obligation 
 Asset retirement obligations are those legal obligations where the Company will be required to retire tangible long-lived assets such as producing well sites, processing plants, and restoring land at the end of oil and natural gas production operations. The fair value of estimated asset retirement obligations is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet when incurred and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The asset retirement cost, equal to the initially estimated fair value of the asset retirement obligation, is capitalized as part of the cost of the related long-lived asset. Changes in the estimated obligation are recognized as a change in the asset retirement obligation and the related asset retirement cost. Actual expenditures incurred are charged against the accumulated asset retirement obligation. Accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value. 

Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety, and public relations considerations. The asset retirement obligation is estimated by discounting the expected future cash flows of the settlement. The discounted cash flows are based on estimates of such factors as reserves lives, retirement costs, timing of settlements, credit-adjusted risk-free rates and inflation rates. Changes in these estimates impact net earnings through accretion of the asset retirement obligation in addition to depletion of the asset retirement cost included in property, plant and equipment. 

Derivative Financial Instruments 
 Ovintiv uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to market risks relating to commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company s policy is not to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Realized gains or losses from financial derivatives are recognized in net earnings as the contracts are settled. Unrealized gains and losses are recognized in net earnings at the end of each respective reporting period based on the changes in fair value of the contracts. 
 Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net earnings. Fair value estimates are determined using quoted prices in active markets, inferred based on market prices of similar assets and liabilities or valued using internally developed estimates. The Company may use various valuation techniques including the discounted cash flow or option valuation models. 

Ovintiv s derivative financial instruments primarily relate to commodities including oil, NGLs and natural gas. The most significant assumptions used in determining the fair value to the Company s commodity derivatives financial instruments include estimates of future commodity prices, implied volatilities of commodity prices, discount rates and estimates of counterparty credit risk. These pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to the period of the contract and market volatility as well as regional price differentials. These inputs may also be observable and corroborated by market data or unobservable and sourced from limited market activity, internally generated estimates or corroborated by third parties. Changes in these estimates and assumptions can impact net earnings, revenues and expenses. 

As Ovintiv has chosen not to elect hedge accounting treatment for the Company s derivative financial instruments, changes in the fair values of derivative financial instruments can have a significant impact on Ovintiv s results of operations. Generally, changes in fair values of derivative financial instruments do not impact the Company s liquidity or capital resources. Settlements of derivative financial instruments do have an impact on the Company s liquidity and results of operation. 

Income Taxes 
 Ovintiv follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recorded for the effect of any temporary difference between the accounting and income tax basis of an asset or liability, using the enacted income tax rates and laws expected to apply when the assets are realized and liabilities are settled. Current income taxes are measured at the amount expected to be recoverable from or payable to the taxing authorities based on the income tax rates and laws enacted at the end of the reporting period. The effect of a change in the enacted tax rates or laws is recognized in net earnings in the period of enactment. 

Tax interpretations, regulations, legislation and potential Treasury Department guidance, in the various jurisdictions in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate are subject to change and interpretation. As such, income taxes are subject to measurement uncertainty and the interpretations can impact net earnings through the income tax expense arising from the changes in deferred income tax assets or liabilities. 

73 

Description 

Judgments and Uncertainties 

Deferred income tax assets are assessed routinely for realizability. If it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets. 

Ovintiv considers available positive and negative evidence when assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, including historic and expected future taxable earnings, available tax planning strategies and carry forward periods. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions, particularly related to oil and natural gas prices. As a result, the assumptions used in determining expected future taxable earnings are consistent with those used in the goodwill impairment assessment. 

Ovintiv s interim income tax expense is determined using an estimated annual effective income tax rate applied to year-to-date net earnings before income tax plus the effect of legislative changes and amounts in respect of prior periods. 

The estimated annual effective income tax rate is impacted by expected annual earnings, changes in valuation allowances, state taxes, income tax related to foreign operations, the effect of legislative changes, and tax differences on divestitures and transactions. 

Ovintiv recognizes the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. A recognized tax position is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority. Liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to be settled within the next 12 months are included in other liabilities and provisions. 

The Company routinely assesses potential uncertain tax positions and, if required, establishes accruals for such amounts. The accruals are adjusted based on changes in facts and circumstances. Material changes to Ovintiv s income tax accruals may occur in the future based on the progress of ongoing audits, changes in legislation or resolution of pending matters. 

The Company is required to assess whether the unremitted earnings from its Canadian subsidiaries are considered to be permanently reinvested. Changes in repatriation plans are evaluated based on the specific facts and circumstances to determine how those changes affect the recognition and measurement of income tax liabilities and whether those changes in plans affect Ovintiv s ongoing assertions related to the indefinite reinvestment of basis differences. If the indefinite reinvestment assertion can no longer be made, a deferred tax liability is generally required for a book-over-tax outside basis difference attributable to the foreign subsidiaries. 

During the year ended December 31, 2022, Ovintiv concluded that a portion of the previously unremitted earnings from its foreign subsidiaries is no longer considered to be permanently reinvested. As a result of this change in assertion, the Company recorded a nominal deferred income tax liability on the undistributed earnings that were previously considered permanently reinvested. The Company has a taxable temporary difference of approximately 339 million in respect of unremitted earnings that continue to be permanently reinvested for which a deferred income tax liability of 17 million has not been recognized and becomes subject to taxation upon the remittance of dividends. The deferred tax liability considers U.S. federal, state and foreign withholding tax implications. 

Contingent Liabilities 
 Ovintiv is subject to various legal proceedings, environmental remediation, commercial and regulatory claims and liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues losses when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable, except for contingencies acquired in a business combination which are recorded at fair value at the time of the acquisition. If a loss is probable but the Company cannot estimate a specific amount for that loss, the best estimate within the range is accrued and if no amount is better within the range, the minimum amount is accrued. 

The establishment and evaluation of a contingent loss is based on advice from legal counsel, advisors or consultants and management s judgement. Actual costs can vary from such estimates for various reasons including: i) differing interpretation of the law, opinions on responsibility and assessments on the amount of damages ii) changes in status of litigation or claims and information available iii) differing interpretation of regulations by regulators or the courts iv) changes in laws and regulations and v) additional or developing information relating to extent and nature of environmental remediation and technology improvements. The Company continually monitors known and potential legal, environmental and other claims or contingencies based on available information. Future changes in facts and circumstances not currently foreseeable could result in the actual liabilities recorded exceeding the estimated amounts accrued.

Non-GAAP Measures 
 Certain measures in this document do not have any standardized meaning as prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, are considered non-GAAP measures. These measures may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers and should not be viewed as a substitute for measures reported under U.S. GAAP. These measures are commonly used in the oil and gas industry and by Ovintiv to provide shareholders and potential investors with additional information regarding the Company s liquidity and its ability to generate funds to finance its operations. Non-GAAP measures include: Non-GAAP Cash Flow, Non-GAAP Total Costs, Debt to Adjusted Capitalization and Debt to Adjusted EBITDA. Management s use of these measures is discussed further below. 
 Cash from Operating Activities and Non-GAAP Cash Flow 
 Non-GAAP Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure defined as cash from (used in) operating activities excluding net change in other assets and liabilities, and net change in non-cash working capital. 
 Management believes this measure is useful to the Company and its investors as a measure of operating and financial performance across periods and against other companies in the industry, and is an indication of the Company s ability to generate cash to finance capital investment programs, to service debt and to meet other financial obligations. This measure is used, along with other measures, in the calculation of certain performance targets for the Company s management and employees.

Total Operating Expenses and Non-GAAP Total Costs 
 Non-GAAP Total Costs is a non-GAAP measure which includes the summation of production, mineral and other taxes, upstream transportation and processing expense, upstream operating expense and administrative expense, excluding the impact of long-term incentive, restructuring and legal costs, and current expected credit losses. It is calculated as total operating expenses excluding non-upstream operating costs and non-cash items which include operating expenses from the Market Optimization, and Corporate and Other segments, depreciation, depletion and amortization, impairments, accretion of asset retirement obligation, long-term incentive, restructuring and legal costs, and current expected credit losses. When presented on a per BOE basis, Non-GAAP Total Costs is divided by production volumes. Management believes this measure is useful to the Company and its investors as a measure of operational efficiency across periods.

Debt to Capitalization and Debt to Adjusted Capitalization 
 Debt to Adjusted Capitalization is a non-GAAP measure which adjusts capitalization for historical ceiling test impairments that were recorded as at December 31, 2011. Management monitors Debt to Adjusted Capitalization as a proxy for the Company s financial covenant under the Credit Facilities which require Debt to Adjusted Capitalization to be less than 60 percent. Adjusted Capitalization includes debt, total shareholders equity and an equity adjustment for cumulative historical ceiling test impairments recorded as at December 31, 2011 in conjunction with the Company s January 1, 2012 adoption of U.S. GAAP.

Debt to EBITDA and Debt to Adjusted EBITDA 
 Debt to EBITDA and Debt to Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. EBITDA is defined as trailing 12-month net earnings (loss) before income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, and interest. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA adjusted for impairments, accretion of asset retirement obligation, unrealized gains/losses on risk management, foreign exchange gains/losses, gains/losses on divestitures and other gains/losses. 
 Management believes these measures are useful to the Company and its investors as a measure of financial leverage and the Company s ability to service its debt and other financial obligations. These measures are used, along with other measures, in the calculation of certain financial performance targets for the Company s management and employees.

Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about Ovintiv s potential exposure to market risks. The term market risk refers to the Company s risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil, NGL and natural gas prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The following disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. The forward-looking information provides indicators of how the Company views and manages ongoing market risk exposures. 
 COMMODITY PRICE RISK 
 Commodity price risk arises from the effect fluctuations in future commodity prices, including oil, NGLs and natural gas, may have on future revenues, expenses and cash flows. Realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to the Company s natural gas production. Pricing for oil, NGLs and natural gas production is volatile and unpredictable as discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. To partially mitigate exposure to commodity price risk, the Company may enter into various derivative financial instruments including futures, forwards, swaps, options and costless collars. The use of these derivative instruments is governed under formal policies and is subject to limits established by the Board of Directors and may vary from time to time. Both exchange traded and over-the-counter traded derivative instruments may be subject to margin-deposit requirements, and the Company may be required from time to time to deposit cash or provide letters of credit with exchange brokers or counterparties to satisfy these margin requirements. For additional information relating to the Company s derivative and financial instruments, see Note 24 under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 The table below summarizes the sensitivity of the fair value of the Company s risk management positions to fluctuations in commodity prices, with all other variables held constant. The Company has used a 10 percent variability to assess the potential impact of commodity price changes. Fluctuations in commodity prices could have resulted in unrealized gains (losses) impacting pre-tax net earnings as follows:

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK 
 Foreign exchange risk arises from changes in foreign exchange rates that may affect the fair value or future cash flows of the Company s financial assets or liabilities. The following table presents the foreign exchange rates for the respective years ended December 31.

As Ovintiv operates primarily in the United States and Canada, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. and Canadian dollars can have a significant effect on the Company s reported results. The table below summarizes selected foreign exchange impacts on Ovintiv s financial results when compared to the same periods in the prior years.

 Foreign exchange gains and losses also arise when monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated and settled, and primarily include: 

U.S. dollar denominated financing debt issued from Canada 

U.S. dollar denominated risk management assets and liabilities held in Canada 

U.S. dollar denominated cash and short-term investments held in Canada 

Foreign denominated intercompany loans 

 To partially mitigate the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations on future commodity revenues and expenses, the Company may enter into foreign currency derivative contracts. As at December 31, 2022, Ovintiv has entered into 400 million notional U.S. dollar denominated currency swaps at an average exchange rate of C 1.3160 to US 1, which mature monthly throughout 2023. 
 As at December 31, 2022, Ovintiv did not have any U.S. dollar denominated financing debt issued from Canada or foreign denominated intercompany loans that were subject to foreign exchange exposure. 
 The table below summarizes the sensitivity to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, with all other variables held constant. The Company has used a 10 percent variability to assess the potential impact from Canadian to U.S. foreign currency exchange rate changes. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have resulted in unrealized gains (losses) impacting pre-tax net earnings as follows:

INTEREST RATE RISK 
 
 Interest rate risk arises from changes in market interest rates that may affect the fair value or future cash flows from the Company s financial assets or liabilities. The Company may partially mitigate its exposure to interest rate changes by holding a mix of both fixed and floating rate debt and may also enter into interest rate derivatives to partially mitigate effects of fluctuations in market interest rates. 
 
 As at December 31, 2022, Ovintiv had floating rate revolving credit and term loan borrowings of 393 million. Accordingly, on a before-tax basis, the sensitivity for each one percent change in interest rates on floating rate revolving credit and term loan borrowings was 4 million (2021 - nil).

Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 
 
 Management Report 
 Management s Responsibility for Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
 The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company are the responsibility of Management. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared by Management in United States dollars in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and include certain estimates that reflect Management s best judgments. 
 
 Ovintiv s Board of Directors has approved the information contained in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Board of Directors fulfills its responsibility regarding the financial statements mainly through its Audit Committee, which has a written mandate that complies with the requirements of United States and Canadian securities legislation and the Audit Committee guidelines of the New York Stock Exchange. The Audit Committee meets at least on a quarterly basis. 
 
 Management s Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over the Company s financial reporting. The internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company s Management regarding the preparation and presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Management has assessed the design and effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as at December 31, 2022. In making its assessment, Management has used the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Based on our evaluation, Management has concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as at that date. 
 
 PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, was appointed by a vote of shareholders at the Company s last annual meeting to audit and provide independent opinions on both the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Company s internal control over financial reporting as at December 31, 2022, as stated in their Auditor s Report. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has provided such opinions.

Auditor s Report 
 
 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Ovintiv Inc. 
 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ovintiv Inc. and its subsidiaries (together, the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the Consolidated Financial Statements ). We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). 
 
 In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 
 Basis for Opinions 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for these Consolidated Financial Statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Consolidated Financial Statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audits of the Consolidated Financial Statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, 
 80 

accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the Consolidated Financial Statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 The impact of estimates of proved oil, natural gas liquids NGL ), and natural gas reserves on net oil and natural gas proved properties 
 
 As described in Notes 1 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has a net oil and natural gas proved properties balance of 8,087 million as of December 31, 2022 and depreciation, depletion, and amortization DD&A expense of 1,113 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company uses the full cost method of accounting for its acquisition, exploration, and development activities. Capitalized costs accumulated within each cost centre are depleted using the unit-of-production method based on proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves. Proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserve estimates are key inputs to the Company s depletion and ceiling test impairment calculations. A ceiling test impairment is recognized in net earnings when the carrying amount of a country cost centre exceeds the country cost centre ceiling. Management estimates its proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves according to the definition of proved reserves provided by the SEC. Management s estimates of proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data. Proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. The assumptions used by management to determine estimates of the proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves and the ceiling test impairment calculation include the average beginning-of-the-month prices during the 12-month period for the year, future production estimates, future production and development costs and estimates for abandonment and dismantlement costs associated with asset retirement obligations. The estimation of reserves is a subjective process. In determining the estimates of the proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves, management utilizes the services of specialists, specifically petroleum engineers. 
 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impact of estimates of proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves on net oil and natural gas proved properties is a critical audit matter are (i) significant judgment used by management, including the use of specialists, when developing the estimates of the proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves and performing the ceiling test impairment calculation and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, effort and subjectivity in performing procedures to evaluate the significant assumptions used in developing those estimates including the average beginning-of-the-month prices during the 12-month period for the year, future production estimates, future production and development costs, and estimates for abandonment and dismantlement costs associated with asset retirement obligations. 
 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management s estimates of proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves, the calculation of the full 
 81 

cost ceiling test and the calculation of DD&A expense. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating management s ceiling test impairment calculation and testing the unit-of-production depletion rate used to calculate depletion expense, testing the completeness, accuracy and relevance of underlying data and evaluating the appropriateness of the significant assumptions used by management in developing these estimates, including assumptions related to the average beginning-of-the-month prices during the 12-month period for the year, future production estimates, future production and development costs, and estimates for abandonment and dismantlement costs associated with asset retirement obligations. The work of management s specialists was used in performing procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the estimates of proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves. As a basis for using this work, the specialists qualifications were understood and the Company s relationship with the specialists was assessed . The procedures performed also included evaluation of the methods and assumptions used by the specialists, test s of the data used by the specialist s , and an evaluation of the specialists findings. Evaluating the significant assumptions also involved evaluating whether the assumptions used were reasonable considering the past performance of the Company and whether they were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit .

During the year ended December 31, 2022, a valuation allowance of million was reversed of which million was recognized as a result of positive earnings in the U.S. and Canada. Deferred income tax assets are routinely assessed for realizability, and consequently, after weighing both positive and negative evidence, the Company reversed an additional million of the valuation allowance primarily due to positive forecasted earnings in the U.S. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2021, a valuation allowance reversal of million was recognized as a result of positive earnings in the U.S. and Canada. During the year ended December 31, 2020, a valuation allowance of million was recorded as a result of cumulative three-year losses in the U.S. and Canada which was determined to be significant negative evidence to overcome. Included in the valuation allowance were capital losses in the amount of billion for Canadian tax purposes associated with the U.S. Domestication in the first quarter of 2020. If it is determined the capital losses can be utilized at a future date, a reduction in the valuation allowance will be recorded. 
 The effective tax rate of ) percent for the year ended December 31, 2022 is lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of percent primarily due to reductions in valuation allowances offset by certain non-taxable items.

 During the year ended December 31, 2022, Ovintiv concluded that a portion of the previously unremitted earnings from its foreign subsidiaries is longer considered to be permanently reinvested. As a result of this change in assertion, the Company recorded a nominal deferred income tax liability on the undistributed earnings that were previously considered permanently reinvested. The Company has a taxable temporary difference of approximately million in respect of unremitted earnings that continue to be permanently reinvested for which a deferred income tax liability of million has not been recognized and becomes subject to taxation upon the remittance of dividends.

Expected Credit Loss Allowance 

Ovintiv s trade receivables and accrued revenues primarily consist of production sales of oil, NGLs and natural gas, product optimization from marketing and recoveries from joint working interest partners. The Company s receivables are short dated with payments generally due within 30 to 60 days, with no financing element. 
 
 Trade receivables and accrued revenues are subject to credit risk which is the risk of loss from the potential of a counterparty failing to meet its obligation in accordance with agreed terms. Ovintiv s credit exposure related to product sales and derivative financial instruments are mitigated through the use of credit policies approved by the Board of Directors which govern credit practices that limit transactions according to counterparties credit quality, and regular monitoring and review of counterparties credit worthiness. The Company may also request collateral support, including standby letters of credit, from customers that purchase production. Receivables due from joint working interest partners include numerous counterparties ranging from large public companies to small private companies within the oil and gas industry. In the event of non-payment, Ovintiv may be able to mitigate losses through requiring prepayment of future costs and netting outstanding receivables against associated revenue payables to the interest owner. The Company monitors ongoing credit exposure through active review of counterparty balances against contract terms and due dates, timely dispute resolution, payment confirmation, consideration of the customers financial condition and general industry market conditions. 
 
 Ovintiv s estimated credit loss allowance is estimated using historical loss information, current industry conditions and payment practices, as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. Credit risk is assessed based on days outstanding and utilizes both internal credit assessments and publicly available credit information. As at December 31, 2022, the current period expected credit loss allowance was million (2021 - million). See Note 24 for more information on credit risk exposures.

 Ovintiv s Performance Share Unit PSU and Restricted Share Unit RSU stock-based compensation plans allow the Company to settle the awards either in cash or in the Company s common stock. Accordingly, Ovintiv issued million shares of common stock during the year ended December 31, 2022 (2021 - million shares of common stock) as certain PSU and RSU grants vested during the year. Certain PSUs and RSUs are classified as equity-settled if the Company has sufficient common stock held in reserve for issuance. These awards are included in the calculation of fully diluted net earnings (loss) per share of common stock if dilutive. 
 
 Ovintiv s stock options with associated Tandem Stock Appreciation Rights TSARs give the employee the right to purchase shares of common stock of the Company or receive cash. Historically, most holders of options have 
 110 

million shares of common stock to its reserve for issuance under its stock-based compensation plans. Subsequent to the shareholder approval, an aggregate of million shares of common stock were authorized and held in reserve for issuance. As at December 31, 2022, million shares of common stock remain available for issuance under the Company s stock-based compensation plans. Shares issued as a result of awards granted from stock-based compensation plans are generally funded out of the common stock authorized for issuance as approved by the Company s shareholders. 
 See Note 21 for further information on Ovintiv s outstanding and exercisable TSARs, PSUs and RSUs.

MMcf/d of natural gas gathering and compression and MMcf/d of natural gas processing under long-term service agreements with remaining terms ranging from nine to years and have various renewal terms providing up to a potential maximum of years. 
 Ovintiv has determined that VMLP is a variable interest entity and that Ovintiv holds variable interests in VMLP. Ovintiv is not the primary beneficiary as the Company does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact VMLP s economic performance. These key activities relate to the construction, operation, maintenance and marketing of the assets owned by VMLP. The variable interests arise from certain terms under the various long-term service agreements and include: i) a take or pay for volumes in certain agreements ii) an operating fee of which a portion can be converted into a fixed fee once VMLP assumes operatorship of certain assets and iii) a potential payout of minimum costs in certain agreements. The potential payout of minimum costs will be assessed in the eighth year of the assets service period and is based on whether there is an overall shortfall of total system cash flows from natural gas gathered and compressed under certain agreements. The potential payout amount can be reduced in the event VMLP markets unutilized capacity to third-party users. Ovintiv is not required to provide any financial support or guarantees to VMLP. 
 As a result of Ovintiv s involvement with VMLP, the maximum total exposure to loss related to the commitments under the agreements is estimated to be million as at December 31, 2022. The estimate comprises the take or pay volume commitments and the potential payout of minimum costs. The take or pay volume commitments associated with certain gathering and processing assets are included in Note 26 under Transportation and Processing. The potential payout requirement is highly uncertain as the amount is contingent on future production estimates, pace of development and downstream transportation constraints. As at December 31, 2022, accounts payable and accrued liabilities included million related to the take or pay commitment. percent as part of a company-wide reorganization in response to the low commodity price environment resulting from the global pandemic and the Company s planned reductions in capital spending. During 2021, the Company incurred total restructuring charges of million (2020 - million), before tax, primarily related to severance costs. The Company completed its reorganization work in 2022. 
 Restructuring charges are included in administrative expense presented in the Corporate and Other segment in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.

 CREDIT RISK 

 Credit risk arises from the potential that the Company may incur a loss if a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its obligation in accordance with agreed terms. While exchange-traded contracts are subject to nominal credit risk due to the financial safeguards established by the exchanges and clearing agencies, over-the-counter traded contracts expose Ovintiv to counterparty credit risk. Counterparties to the Company s derivative financial instruments consist primarily of major financial institutions and companies within the energy industry. This credit risk exposure is mitigated through the use of credit policies approved by the Board of Directors governing the Company s credit portfolio including credit practices that limit transactions according to counterparties credit quality. Mitigation strategies may include master netting arrangements, requesting collateral, purchasing credit insurance, and/or transacting credit derivatives. The Company executes commodity derivative financial instruments under master agreements that have netting provisions that provide for offsetting payables against receivables. Ovintiv actively evaluates the creditworthiness of its counterparties, assigns appropriate credit limits and monitors credit exposures against those assigned limits. As at December 31, 2022, Ovintiv s maximum exposure of loss due to credit risk from derivative financial instrument assets on a gross and net fair value basis was million and million, respectively, as disclosed in Note 23. The Company had significant credit derivatives in place and held collateral at December 31, 2022. 
 Any cash equivalents include high-grade, short-term securities, placed primarily with financial institutions with strong investment grade ratings. Any foreign currency agreements entered into are with major financial institutions that have investment grade credit ratings. 
 A substantial portion of the Company s accounts receivable are with customers and working interest owners in the oil and gas industry and are subject to normal industry credit risks. As at December 31, 2022, approximately percent (2021 - percent) of Ovintiv s accounts receivable and financial derivative credit exposures were with investment grade counterparties. 
 During 2015 and 2017, the Company entered into agreements resulting from divestitures, which may require Ovintiv to fulfill certain payment obligations on the take or pay volume commitments assumed by the purchasers. The circumstances that would require Ovintiv to perform under the agreements include events where a purchaser fails to make payment to the guaranteed party and/or a purchaser is subject to an insolvency event. The agreements expire in with a fair value recognized of million as at December 31, 2022 (2021 - million). The maximum potential amount of undiscounted future payments is million as at December 31, 2022, and is considered unlikely.

 CONTINGENCIES 
 Ovintiv is involved in various legal claims and actions arising in the normal course of the Company s operations. Although the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on Ovintiv s financial position, cash flows or results of operations. Management s assessment of these matters may change in the future as certain of these matters are in early stages or are subject to a number of uncertainties. For material matters that the Company believes an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible, the Company discloses the nature and a range of potential exposures. If an unfavorable outcome were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material impact on the Company s consolidated net earnings or loss for the period in which the effect becomes reasonably estimable. The Company accrues for such items when a liability is both probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Such accruals are based on the Company s information known about the matters, estimates of the outcomes of such matters and experience in handling similar matters.

 Definitions: 

a. 
 
 Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. 

b. 
 
 Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. 

c. 
 
 Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. 
 
 130 

MMBOE including production of MMBOE in 2022 due to the following: 

Revisions and improved recovery of oil, NGLs and natural gas were negative primarily due to changes in the approved development plan of MMBOE, negative price revisions of MMBOE from higher royalties in Canada due to higher 12-month average trailing prices, and MMBOE from revisions other than price, partially offset by MMBOE from infill drilling locations. 

Extensions and discoveries of oil, NGLs and natural gas increased proved reserves by MMBOE due to successful drilling leading to increased technical delineation, as well as new proved undeveloped locations resulting from updated development plans in Montney and Permian. 

Purchases of MMBOE were primarily properties with oil and liquids-rich potential in Permian. 

Sale of reserves in place decreased proved developed reserves by MMBOE primarily due to the divestiture of properties held in Uinta. 

 Total Proved reserves increased MMBOE including production of MMBOE in 2021 due to the following: 

Revisions and improved recovery of oil, NGLs and natural gas were negative primarily due to changes in the approved development plan of MMBOE, partially offset by positive performance revisions of MMBOE, higher 12-month average trailing prices of MMBOE and MMBOE from infill drilling locations. 

Extensions and discoveries of oil, NGLs and natural gas increased proved reserves by MMBOE due to successful drilling and technical delineation, as well as new proved undeveloped locations resulting from updated development plans in Montney, Permian and Anadarko . 

Purchases of MMBOE were primarily in Permian and a result of acreage trades . 

Sale of reserves in place decreased proved developed reserves by MMBOE primarily due to the divestitures of Eagle Ford located in south Texas and Duvernay located in west central Alberta. 

 Total Proved reserves decreased MMBOE including production of MMBOE in 2020 due to the following: 

Revisions and improved recovery of oil, NGLs and natural gas were negative primarily due to changes in the approved development plan of MMBOE and lower 12-month average trailing prices of MMBOE, partially offset by positive revisions from well performance and development strategy changes of MMBOE and from infill drilling locations of MMBOE. 

Extensions and discoveries of oil, NGLs and natural gas increased proved reserves by MMBOE due to successful drilling and technical delineation, as well as new proved undeveloped locations resulting from development plan changes in Permian, Montney, Anadarko and Uinta. 

Purchases of MMBOE were primarily in Permian and a result of the partition of certain Duvernay shale assets between Ovintiv and PCC.

Acquisition Costs 

Exploration Costs 

Acquisition costs primarily include costs incurred to acquire or lease properties. Exploration costs primarily include costs related to geological and geophysical studies and unevaluated costs associated with drilling and equipping exploratory wells. Ultimate recoverability of these costs and the timing of inclusion within the applicable country cost center s depletable base is dependent upon either the finding of proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves, expiration of leases or recognition of impairments. 
 135 

billion of oil and natural gas properties not subject to depletion or amortization primarily includes leasehold and mineral costs related to the acquisition of Permian. These acquisition costs are associated with acquired acreage for which proved reserves have yet to be assigned from future development. The Company continually assesses the development timeline of the acquired acreage. The timing and amount of the transfer of property acquisition costs into the depletable base are based on several factors and may be subject to changes over time from drilling plans, drilling results, availability of capital, project economics and other assessments of the property. The inclusion of these acquisition costs in the depletable base is expected to occur within to . The remaining costs excluded from depletion are related to properties which are not individually significant.

For greater clarity, this Policy shall not apply to any Incentive-Based Compensation awarded, granted or paid to an Executive prior to the Effective Date. 
 Where: 

the Corporation is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to its material non-compliance with any financial reporting requirement under applicable securities laws (the Restatement ), (the date upon which the Corporation is required to prepare such Restatement is hereinafter the Restatement Date 

the Executive received Incentive-Based Compensation referable to the financial years subject to the Restatement in excess of what the Executive would have been paid under the Restatement (the Overcompensation Amount and 

the Executive engaged in gross negligence, intentional misconduct or fraud which caused or significantly contributed to the Corporation s material non-compliance with applicable securities laws which resulted in the requirement for the Restatement; 

 the Board shall be entitled: 

where and to the extent the Overcompensation Amount has been previously paid, transferred or otherwise made available to the Executive, to require the Executive, by written demand, to reimburse the Corporation for the Overcompensation Amount; and 

where all or a portion of the Overcompensation Amount has not been paid, transferred or otherwise made available to the Executive, the right of the Executive to be so paid or have such benefit transferred or otherwise made available to him or her shall, to the extent required to reimburse the Corporation for such Overcompensation Amount, immediately terminate and be forfeited by the Executive and where required, cancelled by the Corporation to such extent and upon such date as may be specified by the Board; and 

to the extent the Overcompensation Amount is not immediately recovered upon demand from the Executive, whether via direct reimbursement, forfeiture and/or cancellation, to require a sufficient quantity or value of any compensation owing by the Corporation to the Executive including, without limitation, any unvested or unexercised awards under the LTIs (the Outstanding LTIs ), be immediately withheld and/or irrevocably cancelled by the Corporation to compensate for (or set off the value of same against) the Overcompensation Amount or any unrecovered portion thereof, and to bring any other actions against the Executive which the Board may deem necessary to recover the Overcompensation Amount. 

 The period of time during which the Corporation shall be entitled to seek recovery of the Overcompensation Amount from the Executive shall be three (3) years from the Restatement Date. Recoupment of Overcompensation Amounts under this Policy shall be initiated by the Corporation at the request of the Board, and all amounts recoverable or payable hereunder shall be paid to the Corporation or as directed by the Board. 
 If Applicable Rules require the Corporation to adopt a policy or provisions relating to the recoupment or recovery of incentive-based or other compensation based on restated financial statements which are inconsistent with or materially differ from this Policy and the Board adopts such policy or provisions to comply with Applicable Rules (the New Policy ), such New Policy shall replace and supersede this Policy and shall apply to Incentive-Based Compensation granted or awarded to the Executive following the effective date of the New Policy. Subject to Applicable Rules, this Policy shall continue to apply to Incentive-Based Compensation granted or awarded to the Executive prior to the effective date of the New Policy. This Policy may be terminated at any time by the Board.

December 31, 2022 Reserve Audit Opinion 

Alberta Montney Business Unit - SEC 

At the request of Ovintiv Inc. (the Company), McDaniel Associates Consultants Ltd. (McDaniel) has conducted a reserves audit of the estimates of the proved reserves as of December 31, 2022 associated with certain assets of the Company as prepared by the Company s engineering and geological staff based on the definitions and disclosure guidelines of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Our third-party reserves audit, completed on January 17, 2023 and presented herein, was prepared for public disclosure by the Company in filings made with the SEC in accordance with the disclosure requirements set forth in the SEC regulations. The estimated reserves shown herein represent the Company s estimated net reserves attributable to the leasehold and royalty interests and derived through in certain properties owned by the Company and the portion of those reserves audited by McDaniel, as of December 31, 2022. This report has been prepared for the Company s use in filing with the SEC and, in our opinion, the assumptions, data, methods and procedures used in the preparation of this report are appropriate for such purpose. 
 The properties audited by McDaniel account for a portion of the Company s total net proved reserves as of December 31, 2022. Based on the estimates of total Canadian net proved reserves prepared by the Company, the reserves audit conducted by McDaniel comprise 26 percent of the total proved reserves of the Company s Canadian Assets and 10 percent of the total proved reserves of the Company s total assets.

 January 31, 2023 

As prescribed by the Society of Petroleum Engineers in Paragraph 2.2(f) of the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information (SPE auditing standards), a reserves audit is defined as the process of reviewing certain of the pertinent facts interpreted and assumptions made that have resulted in an estimate of reserves prepared by others and the rendering of an opinion about (1) the appropriateness of the methodologies employed; (2) the adequacy and quality of the data relied upon; (3) the depth and thoroughness of the reserves estimation process; (4) the classification of reserves appropriate to the relevant definitions used; and (5) the reasonableness of the estimated reserve quantities. 
 Based on our audit, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by the Company, it is our opinion that the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by the Company in preparing their estimates of the proved reserves as of December 31, 2022 comply with current SEC regulations and that the overall proved reserves for the audited properties as estimated by the Company are, in aggregate, reasonable within the established audit tolerance guidelines of 10 percent as set forth in the SPE auditing standards. 
 The scope of the audit consisted of the independent detailed preparation of our own estimates of the proved reserves and the comparison of our proved reserve results to the estimates prepared by the Company for the Alberta Montney in the northwestern portion of the Province of Alberta. When compared on an entity-by-entity basis, some estimates prepared by the Company are greater than and some are less than those prepared by McDaniel. However, in our opinion, the estimates prepared by the Company are, in aggregate, reasonable and are within the established audit tolerance of plus or minus 10 percent and the estimates have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering practices and procedures. 
 For the purpose of this audit, only deterministic methods were used. The proved reserve estimates prepared by both the Company and McDaniel conform to the reserve definitions as set forth in the SEC s Regulation S-X Part 210.4-10(a) and as clarified in subsequent Commission Staff Accounting Bulletins. We believe that such assumptions, data, methods, and procedures are appropriate for the purpose served by the report.

 Numbers may not add due to rounding . 

Liquid hydrocarbons are expressed in standard 42-gallon barrels and shown herein as thousands of barrels (MBarrels). The natural gas liquids volumes shown include condensate. All gas volumes are reported on an as sold basis expressed in millions of cubic feet (MMCF) at the official temperature and pressure bases of the areas in which the gas reserves are located. 
 Reserves Included in This Report 
 In our opinion, the proved reserves presented in this report conform to the definition as set forth in the SEC s Regulations S-X Part 210.4-10(a). 
 The various proved reserve status categories are defined under the attachment entitled Petroleum Reserves Status Definitions and Guidelines in this report. The proved developed non-producing reserves included herein consist of the shut-in and behind pipe categories. 
 Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations. All reserve estimates involve an assessment of the uncertainty relating the likelihood that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the estimated quantities determined as of the date the estimate is made. The uncertainty depends chiefly on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of these data. The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two principal classifications, either proved or unproved. Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves and may be further sub-classified as probable and possible reserves to denote progressively increasing uncertainty in their recoverability.

Audit Data, Methodology, Procedure and Assumptions 
 The estimation of reserves involves two distinct determinations. The first determination results in the estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas and the second determination results in the estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions set forth by the SEC s Regulations S-X Part 210.4-10(a). The process of estimating the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves relies on the use of certain generally accepted analytical procedures. These analytical procedures fall into three broad categories or methods: (1) performance-based methods; (2) volumetric-based methods; and (3) analogy. These methods may be used singularly or in combination by the reserve evaluator in the process of estimating the quantities of reserves. Reserve evaluators must select the method or combination of methods which in their professional judgment is most appropriate given the nature and amount of reliable geoscience and engineering data available at the time of the estimate, the established or anticipated performance characteristics of the reservoir being evaluated and the stage of development or producing maturity of the properties. 
 McDaniel has prepared its report in accordance with SEC Regulation S-K, 229.1202 and Regulation S-X, 210.4-10. 
 The reserves evaluations prepared by the Company have been audited, not for the purpose of verifying exactness, but the reserves information, company policies, procedures, and methods used in estimating the reserves will be examined in sufficient detail so that McDaniel can express an opinion as to whether, in aggregate, the reserves information presented by the Company are reasonable. 
 Estimates of reserves quantities and their associated reserve categories may be revised in the future as additional geoscience or engineering data become available. Furthermore, estimates of reserves quantities and their associated reserve categories may also be revised due to other factors such as changes in economic conditions, results of future operations, effects of regulation by governmental agencies or geopolitical or economic risks as previously noted herein. 
 The proved reserves prepared by the Company, for the properties that McDaniel has audited, were estimated by performance methods, the volumetric method, analogy, or a combination of methods. Greater than 90 percent of the proved producing reserves attributable to producing wells and/or reservoirs that we reviewed were estimated by performance methods or a combination of methods. These performance methods include, but may not be limited to, decline curve analysis, material balance and/or reservoir simulation which utilized extrapolations of historical production and pressure data available through November 2022, in those cases where such data were considered to be definitive. The data utilized in this analysis were supplied to McDaniel by the Company or obtained from public data sources and were considered sufficient for the purpose thereof. 
 To estimate economically recoverable proved oil and gas reserves, many factors and assumptions are considered including, but not limited to, the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological, geophysical and engineering data which cannot be measured directly, economic criteria based on current costs and SEC pricing requirements, and forecasts of future production rates. Under the SEC regulations 210.4-10(a)(22)(v) and (26), proved reserves must be anticipated to be economically producible from a

given date forward based on existing economic conditions including the prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. 
 The initial SEC hydrocarbon prices in effect on December 31, 2022 for the properties audited by McDaniel were determined using the 12-month average first-day-of-the-month benchmark prices appropriate to the geographic area where the hydrocarbons are sold. These benchmark prices are prior to the adjustments for differentials as described herein. The table below summarizes the benchmark prices and price reference used by the Company for the geographic areas reviewed by McDaniel. In certain geographic areas, the price reference and benchmark prices may be defined by contractual arrangements. 
 The product prices which were actually used by the Company to determine the future gross revenue for the properties audited by McDaniel reflect adjustments to the benchmark prices for gravity, quality, local conditions, and/or distance from market, referred to herein as differentials. The differentials used by the Company were accepted as factual data and reviewed by McDaniel for their reasonableness based on a review of historical lease operating statements and marketing agreements. 
 The table below summarizes the Company s net volume weighted benchmark prices adjusted for differentials for the properties audited by McDaniel and referred to herein as the Company s average realized prices. The average realized prices shown in the table below were determined from the Company s estimate of the total future gross revenue before production taxes for the properties audited and the Company s estimate of the total net reserves for the properties audited by McDaniel for the geographic area. The data shown in the table below is presented in accordance with SEC disclosure requirements for the geographic area audited. 
 
 The effects of derivative instruments designated as price hedges of oil and gas quantities are not reflected in the Company s individual property evaluations. 
 Operating costs supplied by the Company are based on the operating expense reports of the Company and include only those costs directly applicable to the leases or wells for the properties audited by McDaniel. The operating costs include a portion of general and administrative costs allocated directly to the leases and wells. For operated properties, the operating costs include an appropriate level of corporate general administrative and overhead costs. Other costs include transportation and/or processing fees as deductions. The operating costs supplied by the Company were accepted as factual data and reviewed by McDaniel for their reasonableness; however, no independent verification of the data used by the Company was

conducted . No deduction was made for loan repayments, interest expenses or exploration and development prepayments that were not charged directly to the leases or wells. 
 Development costs supplied by the Company are based on authorizations for expenditure for the proposed work or actual costs for similar projects. The development costs supplied by the Company were accepted as factual data and reviewed by McDaniel for their reasonableness; however, no independent verification of the data used by the Company was conducted. The estimated net cost of abandonment, decommissioning and reclamation (ADR) costs were included by the Company for the properties audited. ADR costs include but are not limited to items such as: producing wells, suspended wells, service wells, gathering systems, facilities and surface land development. The Company s estimates of the net abandonment costs were accepted without independent verification. Current costs used by the Company were held constant throughout the life of the properties. 
 The estimates of proved reserves presented herein were based upon an audit of the properties in which the Company owns and derives an interest; however, McDaniel has not made any field examination of the property. No consideration was given in this report to potential environmental liabilities that may exist nor were any costs included by the Company for potential liabilities to restore and clean up damages, if any, caused by past operating practices. 
 The Company has informed McDaniel that they have provided to us all of the material accounts, records, geological and engineering data, and reports and other data required for this investigation. In performing our audit of the Company s forecast of future proved production, we have relied upon data supplied by the Company with respect to property interests owned or derived, production and well tests from examined wells, normal direct costs of operating the wells or leases, other costs such as transportation and/or processing fees, ad valorem and production taxes, recompletion and development costs, development plans, abandonment costs after salvage, product prices based on the SEC regulations, adjustments or differentials to product prices, geological structural and isochore maps, well logs, core analyses, and pressure measurements. McDaniel reviewed such factual data for its reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data supplied by the Company. We consider the factual data supplied to us by the Company to be appropriate and sufficient for the purpose of our audit of the Company s estimates of reserves. In summary, we consider the assumptions, data, methods and analytical procedures used by the Company and reviewed by us as appropriate for the purpose hereof, and we have used all such methods and procedures that we consider necessary and appropriate under the circumstances to render the conclusions set forth herein. 
 Audit Opinion 
 Based on our audit, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by the Company, it is our opinion that the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by the Company in preparing their estimates of the proved reserves as of December 31, 2022 comply with current SEC regulations and that the overall proved reserves for the audited properties as estimated by the Company are, in aggregate, reasonable within the established audit tolerance guidelines of 10 percent as set forth in the SPE auditing standards.

 Ladies and Gentlemen: 
 
 In accordance with your request, we have audited the estimates prepared by Ovintiv Inc. (Ovintiv), as of December 31, 2022, of the proved reserves and future revenue to the Ovintiv interest in certain oil and gas properties located in the SCOOP Property Group of the Anadarko Asset Area in Oklahoma, the Martin County Property Group of the Permian Asset Area in Texas, and the Central Basin Property Group of the Uinta Asset Area in Utah. It is our understanding that the proved reserves estimates shown herein constitute approximately 36 percent of Ovintiv's total proved reserves located in the United States and approximately 23 percent of all proved reserves owned by Ovintiv. We have examined the estimates with respect to reserves quantities, reserves categorization, future producing rates, future net revenue, and the present value of such future net revenue, using the definitions set forth in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Regulation S-X Rule 4-10(a). The estimates of reserves and future revenue have been prepared in accordance with the definitions and regulations of the SEC and, with the exception of the exclusion of future income taxes, conform to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932, Extractive Activities Oil and Gas. We completed our audit on or about the date of this letter. This report has been prepared for Ovintiv's use in filing with the SEC; in our opinion the assumptions, data, methods, and procedures used in the preparation of this report are appropriate for such purpose. 
 
 The following table sets forth Ovintiv's estimates of the net reserves and future net revenue, as of December 31, 2022, for the audited properties:

 There are no proved developed non-producing reserves at the price and cost parameters used in this report. 

The oil volumes shown include crude oil and condensate. Oil and natural gas liquids (NGL) volumes are expressed in millions of barrels (MMBBL); a barrel is equivalent to 42 United States gallons. Gas volumes are expressed in billions of cubic feet (BCF) at standard temperature and pressure bases. 
 
 When compared on a well-by-well basis, some of the estimates of Ovintiv are greater and some are less than the estimates of Netherland, Sewell Associates, Inc. (NSAI). However, in our opinion the estimates shown herein of Ovintiv's reserves and future revenue are reasonable when aggregated at the proved level and have been prepared in accordance with the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE Standards). Additionally, these estimates are within the recommended 10 percent tolerance threshold set forth in the SPE Standards. We are satisfied with the methods and procedures used by Ovintiv in preparing the December 31, 2022, estimates of reserves and future revenue, and we saw nothing of an unusual nature that would cause us to take exception with the estimates, in the aggregate, as prepared by Ovintiv. 

Reserves categorization conveys the relative degree of certainty; reserves subcategorization is based on development and production status. The estimates of reserves and future revenue included herein have not been adjusted for risk. Ovintiv's estimates do not include probable or possible reserves that may exist for these properties, nor do they include any value for undeveloped acreage beyond those tracts for which undeveloped reserves have been estimated. 
 
 Prices used by Ovintiv are based on the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month in the period January through December 2022. For oil volumes, the average ICE West Texas Intermediate price of 93.82 is adjusted for quality, transportation fees, and market differentials. For NGL volumes, the average Oil Price Information Service Mont Belvieu component prices are adjusted for quality, transportation fees, and fractionation fees and are weight-averaged by processing area using NGL component recovery factors. For gas volumes, the average ICE Henry Hub price of 6.36 is adjusted for energy content, market differentials, and gathering, processing, and transportation fees. All prices are held constant throughout the lives of the properties. The average adjusted product prices weighted by production over the remaining lives of the properties are 86.78 per barrel of oil, 37.32 per barrel of NGL, and 4.04 per MCF of gas. Average realized oil, NGL, and gas prices for each property group are shown in the following table:

Operating costs used by Ovintiv are based on historical operating expense records. These costs include the per-well overhead expenses allowed under joint operating agreements along with estimates of costs to be incurred at and below the asset area and field levels. Operating costs have been divided into field-level costs, per-well costs, and per-unit-of-production costs. Headquarters general and administrative overhead expenses of Ovintiv are included to the extent that they are covered under joint operating agreements for the operated properties. Capital costs used by Ovintiv are based on authorizations for expenditure and actual costs from recent activity. Capital costs are included as required for maintenance on existing wells, new development wells, and production equipment. Abandonment costs used are Ovintiv's estimates of reclamation costs and the costs to abandon the wells; these estimates do not include any salvage value for the lease and well equipment. Operating, capital, and abandonment costs are not escalated for inflation. 
 
 The reserves shown in this report are estimates only and should not be construed as exact quantities. Proved reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of engineering and geoscience data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible; probable and possible reserves are those additional reserves which are sequentially less certain to be recovered than proved reserves. Estimates of reserves may increase or decrease as a result of market conditions, future operations, changes in regulations, or actual reservoir performance. In addition to the primary economic assumptions discussed herein, estimates of Ovintiv and NSAI are based on certain assumptions including, but not limited to, that the properties will be developed consistent with current development plans as provided to us by Ovintiv, that the properties will be operated in a prudent manner, that no governmental regulations or controls will be put in place that would impact the ability of the interest owner to recover the reserves, and that projections of future production will prove consistent with actual performance. If the reserves are recovered, the revenues therefrom and the costs related thereto could be more or less than the estimated amounts. Because of governmental policies and uncertainties of supply and demand, the sales rates, prices received for the reserves, and costs incurred in recovering such reserves may vary from assumptions made while preparing these estimates. 
 
 It should be understood that our audit does not constitute a complete reserves study of the audited oil and gas properties. Our audit consisted primarily of substantive testing, wherein we conducted a detailed review of all 

properties located in the SCOOP Property Group of the A nadarko Asset Area, the Martin County Property Group of the Permian Asset Area , and the Central Basin Property Group of the Uinta Asset Area . In the conduct of our audit, we have not independently verified the accuracy and completeness of information and data furnished by Ovintiv with respect to ownership interests, oil and gas production, well test data, historical costs of operation and development, product prices, or any agreements relating to current and future operations of the properties and sales of production. However, if in the course of our examination something came to our attention that brought into question the validity or sufficiency of any such information or data, we did not rely on such information or data until we had satisfactorily resolved our questions relating thereto or had independently verified such information or data. Our audit did not include a review of Ovintiv ' s overall reserves management processes and practices. 
 
 We used standard engineering and geoscience methods, or a combination of methods, including performance analysis and analogy, that we considered to be appropriate and necessary to establish the conclusions set forth herein. As in all aspects of oil and gas evaluation, there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of engineering and geoscience data; therefore, our conclusions necessarily represent only informed professional judgment. 
 
 Supporting data documenting this audit, along with data provided by Ovintiv, are on file in our office. The technical person primarily responsible for conducting this audit meets the requirements regarding qualifications, independence, objectivity, and confidentiality set forth in the SPE Standards. Craig H. Adams, a Licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Texas, has been practicing consulting petroleum engineering at NSAI since 1997 and has over 11 years of prior industry experience. We are independent petroleum engineers, geologists, geophysicists, and petrophysicists; we do not own an interest in these properties nor are we employed on a contingent basis.
