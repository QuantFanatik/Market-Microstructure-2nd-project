 The report on assessment of compliance for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2022, furnished pursuant to Item 1122 of Regulation AB by
KeyBank National Association KeyBank ), as servicer, discloses that the
following material instance of noncompliance occurred with respect to its
platform: 

 The examination performed by Ernst Young LLP identified
an instance of material noncompliance with the servicing criteria set forth in
Item 1122(d)(4)(ix) of Regulation AB applicable to KeyBank during the year
ended December 31, 2022. During compliance testing, it was discovered, that not
all FlexARM loan mortgagors were offered loan rates within 45-60 days before
the rate change date, as required per the related pool asset documents. Per the
related note, if the holder fails to offer a loan rate within 45-60 days of any
change date a margin of 2.25 is to be used. Given the notification was not
made to the borrowers, a 3 margin was incorrectly applied. The noncompliance
in Item 1122 (d)(4)(ix) is related to a servicing portfolio which is wholly
owned by the investor and is not held in a publicly traded security. 

 The following remediation procedures have been initiated by
KeyBank: (i) the impacted mortgage loans are currently in the process of being
identified, (ii) investor contact has been initiated, (iii) corrective actions
are being considered and will be tracked and monitored by senior management,
(iv) procedures will be reviewed and revised, if necessary, to include new
tracking and action steps to prevent this situation from recurring in the
future, and (v) training will be provided to the relevant staff members to
prevent a recurrence.

ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH
THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA 

 Computershare Corporate Trust-
CMBS Platform 

The management Management of the Computershare Corporate Trust division of Computershare Trust Company,
National Association (the Company is responsible for assessing the
Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item
1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Management has determined that the servicing criteria are applicable to the
servicing platform for the period as follows: 

Purchase of corporate trust business . On November 1, 2021, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Wells
Fargo and certain of its affiliates sold substantially all of its
Corporate Trust Services CTS division to the Company, Computershare
Delaware Trust Company CDTC ), and Computershare Limited Computershare
Limited , and collectively with the Company and CDTC, Computershare ).
Virtually all CTS employees of Wells Fargo, along with most existing CTS
systems, technology, and offices transferred to Computershare as part of the
sale. 

For the CMBS Platform (defined
below) transactions and during the Period, the Company either (i) served
directly in the related trustee, securities administration, paying agent,
and/or related roles (collectively, the CMBS Platform Roles ), or (ii)
served as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related CMBS Platform
Roles. More specifically, since its acquisition of the Wells Fargo CTS
business on November 1, 2021, the Company has closed new CMBS transactions for
which, during all or a portion of the Period, it performed the related CMBS
Platform Roles directly (the Company s Direct Role Transactions ). 
The Company s Direct Role Transactions comprise a small percentage of the
overall CMBS Platform transactions. For a significant majority of CMBS
Platform transactions, the Company served, during all or a portion of the
Period, as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related CMBS Platform
Roles (the Company s Agent Role Transactions ). Wells Fargo had
not, as of the beginning of the Period, transferred to Computershare the CMBS
Platform Roles for the Company s Agent Role Transactions, and therefore the
Company performed, during all or a portion of the Period, virtually all of
Wells Fargo s contractual duties for such transactions as its agent. As a
result, for the Company s Agent Role Transactions, the Company and Wells Fargo
have determined that the Company is a party participating in the servicing
function with respect to the CMBS Platform, and accordingly, the Company is
taking responsibility for assessing its compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria (defined below) relevant to the servicing activities
performed by the Company for the CMBS Platform, as of and for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2022. 

Period : As of January 1, 2022 through and including December
31, 2022 (the Period ). 

Platform : The platform consists of commercial
mortgage-backed securities CMBS transactions backed by pools of
commercial mortgage loans and/or backed by CMBS for which the Company provides
trustee, securities administration, paying agent services, and/or related
roles, either directly in the related role for such services or as the agent of
the party performing such services, and for which either (a) some or all of the
issued securities for such CMBS transactions were publicly offered pursuant to
a registration statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, or (b) the issued securities for such CMBS transactions were privately
offered pursuant to an exemption from registration and the Company (and/or the
party for whom it acts agent) has an obligation under the transaction
agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing
criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the
platform excludes any transactions for which the offered securities were
issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by any agency or instrumentality of the
U.S. government or any government-sponsored entity (the CMBS Platform ). 
 Appendix A identifies the individual transactions defined by Management
as constituting the CMBS Platform for the Period. 

Applicable Servicing
Criteria : All servicing criteria
set forth in Item 1122(d) are applicable to either the Company s obligations,
or the obligations of the party for whom the Company ultimately acts as agent,
in either case under the related transaction agreements with respect to the
CMBS Platform for the Period (as applicable, the Company s Obligations ),
except for the following servicing criteria: 1122(d)(4)(ii),
1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(v), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii),
1122(d)(4)(viii), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi),
1122(d)(4)(xii), 1122(d)(4)(xiii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiv), which Management has
determined are not applicable to the Company s Obligations with respect to the
CMBS Platform for the Period; provided however that, with respect to the CMBS
Platform (a) servicing criterion 1122(d)(1)(v) is applicable only to the
Company s Obligations related to the aggregation of information received and
the conveyance of such information, in each case, as required by the
transaction agreements, and (b) servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is
applicable only to the Company s Obligations related to the process of making
or effecting an addition, removal or substitution to the asset pool in
accordance with the transaction agreements (the Applicable Servicing
Criteria ). 

Third
parties classified as vendors : 
With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(i), the Company has engaged a
vendor to handle certain Uniform Commercial Code filing obligations required by
the servicing criterion. With respect to servicing criterion
1122(d)(2)(vi), the Company has engaged a vendor for certain transactions in
the CMBS Platform to handle making payments to investors and/or third parties
by check, and such vendor also safeguards any unissued checks. In each
case, Management has determined that the vendor is not considered a servicer 
as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and Management elects to take
responsibility for assessing compliance with the portion of the servicing
criterion applicable to each vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and
Disclosure Interpretation C DI 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06 . The Company has policies and procedures in place
designed to provide reasonable assurance that the activities of each vendor
comply in all material respects with the servicing criterion applicable to the
vendor. Management is solely responsible for determining that the Company
meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for each vendor and
the related servicing criterion. 

With respect to the CMBS
Platform and the Period, Management provides the following assessment of the
Company s compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria: 

1. Management is responsible
for assessing the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 

2. Management has
assessed the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria, including
the servicing criteria for which compliance is determined based on C DI
200.06 , as described above. In performing this assessment, Management
used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in
paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. 

3. With respect to
Applicable Servicing Criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(iii), and
1122(d)(4)(iii), Management has determined that there were no activities
performed during the Period with respect to the CMBS Platform, because there
were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such
activities. 

4. Based on such
assessment for the Period, the Company has complied in all material respects
with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Period. 

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report
with respect to Management s assessment of the Company s compliance with the
Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Period.

ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH
THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA 

 Computershare
Corporate Trust- Document Custody Platform 

The management Management of
the Computershare Corporate Trust division of Computershare Trust Company,
National Association (the Company is responsible for assessing the
Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)
of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management
has determined that the servicing criteria are applicable to the servicing
platform for the period as follows: 

 Purchase of corporate trust business . On November 1, 2021, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Wells
Fargo and certain of its affiliates sold substantially all of its
Corporate Trust Services CTS division to the Company, Computershare
Delaware Trust Company CDTC ), and Computershare Limited Computershare
Limited , and collectively with the Company and CDTC, Computershare ).
Virtually all CTS employees of Wells Fargo, along with most existing CTS
systems, technology, and offices transferred to Computershare as part of the
sale. 

 For the Document Custody Platform (defined
below) transactions and during the Period, the Company either (i) served
directly in the related document custody services role (collectively, the Document
Custody Platform Role ), or (ii) served as agent for Wells Fargo who
remained in the related Document Custody Platform Role. More
specifically, since its acquisition of the Wells Fargo CTS business on November
1, 2021, the Company has closed new Document Custody transactions for which,
during all or a portion of the Period, it performed the related Document
Custody Platform Role directly (the Company s Direct Role Transactions ). 
The Company s Direct Role Transactions comprise a small percentage of the
overall Document Custody Platform transactions. For a significant
majority of Document Custody Platform transactions, the Company served, during
all or a portion of the Period, as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the
related Document Custody Platform Role (the Company s Agent Role
Transactions ). Wells Fargo had not, as of the beginning of the
Period, transferred to Computershare the Document Custody Platform Role for the
Company s Agent Role Transactions, and therefore the Company performed, during
all or a portion of the Period, virtually all of Wells Fargo s contractual
duties for such transactions as its agent. As a result, for the Company s
Agent Role Transactions, the Company and Wells Fargo have determined that the
Company is a party participating in the servicing function with respect to the
Document Custody Platform, and accordingly, the Company is taking
responsibility for assessing its compliance with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria (defined below) relevant to the servicing activities performed by the
Company for the Document Custody Platform, as of and for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2022. 

 Period : As of January 1, 2022 through and including December
31, 2022 (the Period ). 

 Platform : 
The platform consists of residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS transactions, commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS transactions,
and other asset-backed securities ABS transactions, in each case for
which the Company provides document custody services ,
either directly in the related role for such services or as the agent of the
party performing such services, and for which either (a) some or all of the
issued securities for such RMBS, CMBS, and ABS transactions were publicly
offered on or after January 1, 2006 pursuant to a registration statement
delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (b) the issued securities
for such RMBS, CMBS, and ABS transactions were privately offered on or after
January 1, 2006 pursuant to an exemption from registration and the Company
(and/or the party for whom it acts as agent) has an obligation under the
transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided
however that, the platform excludes any transactions for which the offered
securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by any agency or
instrumentality of the U.S. government or any government-sponsored entity,
other than certain RMBS transactions for which the offered securities were
issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company
(the Document Custody Platform ). Appendix A identifies
the individual transactions defined by Management as constituting the Document
Custody Platform for the Period. 

 Applicable Servicing Criteria : Management has determined that the servicing
criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(i),
1122(d)(4)(ii) and 1122(d)(4)(iii) are applicable to the Company s obligations,
or the obligations of the party for whom the Company ultimately acts as agent,
in either case under the related transaction agreements with respect to the
Document Custody Platform for the Period (as applicable, the Company s
Obligations ); provided however that, with respect to the Document Custody
Platform, servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable only as it relates
to the Company s Obligation to review and maintain the required loan documents
related to any additions, removals or substitutions in accordance with the
transaction agreements (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ). 
Management has determined that all other servicing criteria set forth in Item
1122(d) are not applicable to the Company s Obligations with respect to the
Document Custody Platform for the Period. 

 Third parties classified as vendors : With respect to servicing criteria
1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(ii), for certain ABS transactions included in the
Document Custody Platform, the Company has engaged a vendor to handle certain
aspects of maintaining and safeguarding pool assets, the security thereon, and
related documents as required by such servicing criteria. Management has
determined that the vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item
1101(j) of Regulation AB, and Management elects to take responsibility for
assessing compliance with the portion of servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(ii)
applicable to this vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and
Disclosure Interpretation C DI 200.06, Vendors Engaged by
Servicers C DI 200.06 . The Company has policies and
procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor s
activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria
applicable to the vendor. Management is solely responsible for
determining that the Company meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI
200.06 for the vendor and the related servicing criteria. 

 With respect to the Document Custody
Platform and the Period, Management provides the following assessment of the
Company s compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria: 

 1. Management is responsible for assessing
the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 

 2. Management has assessed the
Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria, including the
servicing criteria for which compliance is determined based on C DI
200.06 as described above. In performing this assessment, Management
used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in
paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. 

 3. With respect to Applicable
Servicing Criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii), Management has determined that there were
no activities performed during the Period with respect to the Document Custody
Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the
Company to perform such activities. 

 4. Based on such assessment for the
Period, the Company has complied in all material respects with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria for the Period. 

 PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report with respect to
Management s assessment of the Company s compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria for the Period.

Management s Report on Assessment of 2022 Compliance
with Applicable Regulation AB Servicing Criteria 

Greystone Servicing Company
LLC and Subsidiaries (the Asserting Party) is responsible for assessing its
compliance as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 (the Reporting
Period) with the servicing criteria set forth in Title 17, Section 229.1122(d)
of the Code of Federal Regulations. The assessment concerns the Asserting
Party s servicing efforts for its servicing Platforms, which consist of all
the commercial and multifamily loans serviced by the Asserting Party as
described in Appendix I. 

The Asserting Party is
responsible for assessing its compliance with the servicing criteria applicable
to it. The Asserting Party used the criteria in paragraph (d) of Section 1122
of Regulation AB (17 C.F.R.229.1122) to assess its compliance. The servicing
criteria applicable to the Platforms are listed in Appendix II as indicated. 

The Asserting Party has
engaged vendors to perform generalized work related to performing tax searches,
payment on taxes, reporting of tax information, and issuance of flood insurance
certifications. The Asserting Party has determined that these vendors are not
considered servicers as defined in item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and has
elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing
criteria applicable to these vendors as permitted by Section 200.06 of the
Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations (Section 200.06). The Asserting Party
has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance
that the vendor s activities comply in all material respects with the servicing
criteria applicable to those vendors. The Asserting Party requires these
vendors to provide to the Asserting Party a Report on Assessment of Compliance
with Regulation AB Servicing Criteria, as the means of assessing our compliance
with Servicing Criterion 1122 (d)(1)(ii). The Asserting Party has not
identified and is not aware of any material instances of noncompliance by the
vendors. 

The Asserting Party has
assessed its compliance with the applicable servicing criteria for the
Reporting Period and has concluded that the Asserting Party has complied, in
all material respects, with the applicable servicing criteria as of December
31, 2022, and for the Reporting Period with respect to the Platforms taken as a
whole. 

RSM US LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the
assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria for the
reporting period as set forth in this assertion.

Report of Independent Registered
Public Accounting Firm 

To the Board of Directors, The PNC
Financial Services Group, Inc. 

We have examined management s assertion, included in the
accompanying Management s Report on Assessment of Compliance with SEC
Regulation AB Servicing Criteria, that Midland Loan Services, a division of PNC
Bank, National Association Midland or the Company ), complied with the servicing
criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s
Regulation AB for all transactions serviced on the Enterprise! sm 
Loan Management System (the Platform as of December 31, 2022 and for the
year then ended excluding criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(B),
1122(d)(3)(i)(C), 1122(d)(3)(i)(D), 1122(d)(3)(ii), 1122(d)(3)(iii),
1122(d)(3)(iv), and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Company has determined are not
applicable to the servicing activities performed by them with respect to the
Platform. Midland s management is responsible for its assertion and for the
Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria based on our examination. 

As described in management s assertion, for servicing
criteria 1122(d)(1)(i), 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(iii), 1122(d)(4)(iv),
1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii), 1122(d)(4)(xi), and 1122(d)(4)(xii), the Company
has engaged certain vendors to perform the activities required by these
servicing criteria. The Company has determined that these vendors are not
considered servicers as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the
Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the
servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by Compliance and
Disclosure Interpretation 200.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance s
interpretations of the rules adopted under Regulation AB and the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act Interpretation 200.06 ). As permitted by Interpretation
200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place
designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in
all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor.
The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC
requirements to apply Interpretation 200.06 for the vendors and related
criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with
respect to the Company s determination of its eligibility to use Interpretation
200.06. 

Our examination was conducted in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and
in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
management s assertion about compliance with the applicable servicing criteria
is fairly stated, in all material respects, and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of
selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform,
testing of selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining
whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those
selected activities in compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our
procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities
performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our
procedures were not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that
may have occurred prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected
the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period
covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides, and that the
evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide, a reasonable
basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination
on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 

We are required to be independent and
to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical
requirements related to the engagement. 

In our opinion, management s
assertion that Midland complied with the aforementioned applicable servicing
criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 for all transactions
serviced on the Enterprise! Loan Management System is fairly stated, in
all material respects.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Audit Committee of
Computershare Trust Company, National Association 

We have examined management s
assertion, included in the accompanying Assessment of Compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria: Computershare Corporate Trust - CMBS Platform that
Computershare Trust Company, National Association (the Company complied with
the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange
Commission's Regulation AB for the commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS transactions backed by pools of commercial mortgage loans and/or
backed by CMBS for which the Company provides trustee, securities
administration, paying agent services, and/or related roles, either directly in
the related role for such services or as the agent of the party performing such
services, and for which either (a) some or all of the issued securities for
such CMBS transactions were publicly offered pursuant to a registration statement
delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (b) the issued
securities for such CMBS transactions were privately offered pursuant to an
exemption from registration and either the Company (and/or the party for whom
it acts agent) has an obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an
assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria under Item
1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform excludes any
transactions for which the offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or
guaranteed by any agency or instrumentality of the U.S. government or any
government-sponsored entity (the CMBS Platform ), as of December 31, 2022 and
for the year then ended (the Period ), excluding criteria 1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(iv),
1122(d)(4)(v), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii), 1122(d)(4)(viii),
1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii),
1122(d)(4)(xiii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiv), which Management has determined are not
applicable to either the Company s obligations, or the obligations of the party
for whom the Company ultimately acts as agent, in either case under the related
transaction agreements with respect to the CMBS Platform for the Period (as
applicable, the Company s Obligations provided however that, with respect
to the CMBS Platform (a) servicing criterion 1122(d)(1)(v) is applicable only
to the Company s Obligations related to the aggregation of information received
and the conveyance of such information, in each case, as required by the transaction
agreements, and (b) servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable only to
the Company s Obligations related to the process of making or effecting an
addition, removal or substitution to the asset pool in accordance with the
transaction agreements. 

As described in management's
assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(2)(vi), the Company
has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these
servicing criteria. The Company has determined that these vendors are not
considered servicers as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB,
and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance
with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by
Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06 of the SEC Division of
Corporation Finance s interpretations of the rules adopted under Regulation AB
and the Securities Act and the Exchange Act Interpretation
200.06 ). As permitted by Interpretation 200.06, the Company has asserted
that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable
assurance that the vendors' activities comply in all material respects with the
servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely
responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply
Interpretation 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in its
assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company's
determination of its eligibility to use Interpretation 200.06. 

Appendix A to management's
assertion identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities
defined by management as constituting the CMBS Platform. 

The Company s management is
responsible for its assertion and for the Company's compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management's assertion about the Company s compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established
by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether management s assertion about compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all material respects, and,
accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our
examination included testing of selected asset-backed transactions and
securities that comprise the CMBS Platform, testing of selected servicing
activities related to the CMBS Platform, and determining whether the Company
processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities
in compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our procedures were
limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the
Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not
designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred
prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or
amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this
report. We believe that our examination provides, and that the evidence
we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide, a reasonable basis for
our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on
the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 

We are required to be
independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with
relevant ethical requirements related to the engagement. 

In our opinion, management s
assertion that Computershare Trust Company, National Association complied with
the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2022 for the CMBS Platform is fairly stated, in all material
respects.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Audit Committee of Computershare Trust Company,
National Association 

We
have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Assessment
of Compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria: Computershare Corporate
Trust - Document Custody Platform that Computershare Trust Company,
National Association (the Company complied with the servicing criteria set
forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation AB
for the residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS transactions,
commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS transactions, and other
asset-backed securities ABS transactions, in each case for which the
Company provides document custody services, either directly in the related role
for such services or as the agent of the party performing such services, and
for which either (a) some or all of the issued securities for such RMBS, CMBS,
and ABS transactions were publicly offered on or after January 1, 2006 pursuant
to a registration statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, or (b) the issued securities for such RMBS, CMBS, and ABS transactions
were privately offered on or after January 1, 2006 pursuant to an exemption
from registration and the Company (and/or the party for whom it acts as agent)
has an obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of
Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform excludes any transactions
for which the offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by
any agency or instrumentality of the U.S. government or any
government-sponsored entity, other than certain RMBS transactions for which the
offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Company (the Document Custody Platform ), as of December 31,
2022 and for the year then ended (the Period ), excluding criteria
1122(d)(1)(i); 1122(d)(1)(iii); 1122(d)(1)(v); 1122(d)(2)(i-vii);
1122(d)(3)(i-iv); and 1122(d)(4)(iv-xv), which Management has determined are
not applicable to either the Company s obligations, or the obligations of the
party for whom the Company ultimately acts as agent, in either case under the
related transaction agreements with respect to the Document Custody Platform
for the Period (as applicable, the Company s Obligations provided however
that, with respect to the Document Custody Platform (a) servicing criterion
1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable only as it relates to the Company s Obligation to
review and maintain the required loan documents related to any additions,
removals or substitutions in accordance with the transaction agreements. 

As
described in management's assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i) and
1122(d)(4)(ii), the Company has engaged a vendor to perform the activities
required by these servicing criteria. The Company has determined that
this vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j)
of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for
assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to the vendor as
permitted by Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06 of the SEC
Division of Corporation Finance s interpretations of the rules adopted under
Regulation AB and the Securities Act and the Exchange Act Interpretation
200.06 ). As permitted by Interpretation 200.06, the Company has asserted that
it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable
assurance that the vendor's activities comply in all material respects with the
servicing criteria applicable to the vendor. The Company is solely
responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply
Interpretation 200.06 for the vendor and related criteria as described in its
assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company's
determination of its eligibility to use Interpretation 200.06. 

Appendix
A to management's assertion identifies the individual asset-backed transactions
and securities defined by management as constituting the Document Custody
Platform. 

The
Company s management is responsible for its assertion and for the Company's
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on management's assertion about the Company s compliance
with the applicable servicing criteria based on our examination. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with
attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all
material respects, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis,
evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. Our examination included testing of selected asset-backed
transactions and securities that comprise the Document Custody Platform,
testing of selected servicing activities related to the Document Custody
Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected
transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria. Our procedures were limited to the
selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during
the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to
detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to or
subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts
calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this
report. We believe that our examination provides, and that the evidence
we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide, a reasonable basis for
our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on
the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 

We
are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities
in accordance with relevant ethical requirements related to the engagement. 

In
our opinion, management s assertion that Computershare Trust Company, National
Association complied with the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as
of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 for the Document Custody Platform
is fairly stated, in all material respects.

compliance with the specified requirements is fairly stated, in all material
respects. An examination involves performing procedures to obtain evidence
about whether management s assertion is fairly stated, in all material
respects. The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depend on our
judgment, including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement of
management s assertion, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the

basis for our opinion.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

Management
Committee 

 Greystone
Servicing Company LLC and Subsidiaries 

We
have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management s
Report on Assessment of 2022 Compliance with Applicable Regulation AB Servicing
Criteria (Management s Assertion), that Greystone Servicing Company LLC and
Subsidiaries (the Company) complied with the servicing criteria set forth in
Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s (SEC) Regulation AB
for services by the Company that are encompassed by contractual obligations to
perform Regulation AB reporting (the Platforms), including only those
asset-backed securities transactions defined below, as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2022, excluding the criteria set forth in Appendix II, which
management has determined are not applicable to the activities performed by the
Company with respect to the Platforms covered by this report. Appendix I to
management s assertion identifies the individual asset-backed transactions
defined by management as constituting the Platforms. Management is responsible
for the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the
Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria based on our
examination. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly,
included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance
with the applicable servicing criteria, including tests on a sample basis of
the servicing activities related to the Platforms, determining whether the
Company performed those activities in compliance with the servicing criteria
during the specified period and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. Our procedures were limited to
selected servicing activities performed by the Company during the period
covered by this report and, accordingly, such samples may not have included
servicing activities related to each asset-backed transaction in the Platforms.
Further, an examination is not designed to detect noncompliance arising from
errors that may have occurred prior to the period specified above that may have
affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during
the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal
determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 

As
described in Management s Assertion, for servicing criterion 1122 (d)(1)(ii), the Company has engaged vendors to perform certain
activities required by this servicing criterion. The Company has determined
that these vendors are not considered servicers as defined in Item 1101(j) of
Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing
compliance with the servicing criterion applicable to these vendors as
permitted by Section 200.06 of the Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations
(Section 200.06). As permitted by Section 200.06, the Company has asserted that
it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable
assurance that the vendor's activities comply in all material respects with the
servicing criterion applicable to these vendors. The Company is solely
responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply Section
200.06 for the vendors and related criterion as described in its assertion, and
we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s determination of its
eligibility to use Section 200.06. 

In
our opinion, management s assertion that Greystone Servicing Company LLC and
Subsidiaries complied with the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as
of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, for the Platforms is fairly
stated, in all material respects.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

Rialto
Capital Advisors, LLC: 

We
have examined management of Rialto Capital Advisors, LLC s assertion, included
in the accompanying Management s Assertions on Compliance with Applicable
Regulation AB Servicing Criteria, that Rialto Capital Advisors, LLC (the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the
Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the commercial mortgage
loan platform (the Platform ), excluding criteria in Items 1122 (d)(1)(iii),
(d)(3)(i.C), (d)(3)(i.D), (d)(3)(ii), (d)(3)(iii), (d)(3)(iv), (d)(4)(v),
(d)(4)(ix), (d)(4)(x), (d)(4)(xi), (d)(4)(xii), (d)(4)(xiii), (d)(4)(xiv), and
(d)(4)(xv) (the servicing criteria ), as of and for the year ended December
31, 2022,which management has determined are not applicable to the activities
performed by the Company with respect to the Platform. Exhibit 1 to
management s assertion identifies the individual asset backed
transactions defined by management as constituting the Platform. Management is
responsible for the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria and its
assertion. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s
assertion about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria based on
our examination. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with
attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about
compliance with the servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all material
respects, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about
the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria, including tests on a
sample basis of the servicing activities related to the Platform, determining
whether the Company performed those selected activities in compliance with the
servicing criteria during the specified period, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our procedures were
limited to selected servicing activities performed by the Company during the
period covered by this report and, accordingly, such samples may not have
included servicing activities related to each asset backed transaction
included in the Platform. Further, an examination is not designed to detect
noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to the period
specified above that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or
reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe
that the evidence we obtained in our examination is sufficient and appropriate
to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

As
described in management s assertion, for servicing criteria Item
1122(d)(1)(ii), the Company has engaged vendors to perform certain activities
required by this servicing criteria. The Company has determined that these
vendors are not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of
Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing
compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to these vendors as permitted
by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06, Vendors Engaged
by Servicers C DI 200.06 ). As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Company
has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide
reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects
with the servicing criteria applicable to these vendors. The Company is solely
responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply
C DI 200.06 for these vendors and related criteria as described in its
assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s
determination of its eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 

Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance
with the servicing criteria. 

In
our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the
aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31,
2022, for the commercial mortgage loan platform, is fairly stated, in all
material respects.
