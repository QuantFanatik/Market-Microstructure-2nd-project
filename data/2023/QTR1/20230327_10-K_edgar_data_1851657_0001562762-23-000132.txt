December 31, 2022 Report contains 
forward-looking statements. 
Forward-
 looking 
statements 
are 
neither 
historical 
facts 
nor 
assurances 
of 
future 
performance. 
Instead, 
they 
are 
based 
on 
our 
current 
beliefs, 
 expectations and assumptions regarding the 
future of our business, 
future plans and strategies 
and other future conditions. In 
some cases, 
 you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such 
as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend, 
 may, predict, 
 project, target, potential, 
 seek, will, would, could, should, continue, 
 contemplate, plan, other 
 words and terms of similar meaning and the negative of these words or similar terms. 
 Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which may be beyond our control. We 
 caution 
you that 
forward-looking 
statements are 
not guarantees 
of future 
performance 
or outcomes 
and 
that actual 
performance 
and

 Item 1. Business. 

Overview 
 We 
are a purpose-driven 
biotechnology company 
committed to democratizing 
healthcare across the 
globe. Our vision 
is to disrupt the 
 existing treatment paradigm for 
chronic diseases, increasingly dominated by 
drugs, particularly monoclonal antibodies mAbs ), which 
 suffer 
from 
prohibitive 
costs 
and 
cumbersome 
administration. 
We 
believe 
our 
synthetic 
peptide 
vaccine 
platform Vaxxine 
 Platform has the 
potential to 
enable a 
new class 
of therapeutics 
that will 
improve the 
quality and 
convenience of 
care, reduce 
costs 
 and increase 
access to treatments 
for a wide 
range of indications. 
Our Vaxxine 
Platform is designed 
to harness the 
immune system 
to 
 convert 
the body 
into its 
own drug 
factory, 
stimulating 
the production 
of antibodies 
with a 
therapeutic 
or protective 
effect. 
While 
 traditional vaccines 
have been able 
to leverage this 
approach against infectious 
diseases, they have 
historically been unable 
to resolve 
 key challenges 
in the fight 
against chronic 
diseases. We 
believe our 
Vaxxine 
Platform has the 
potential to 
overcome these 
challenges 
 and 
has the 
potential to 
bring the 
efficiency 
of vaccines 
to a 
whole 
new class 
of medical 
conditions. 
Specifically, 
our technology 
is 
 designed 
to 
use 
synthetic 
peptides 
to 
mimic 
and 
optimally 
combine 
biological 
epitopes 
in 
order 
to 
selectively 
activate 
the 
immune 
 system, 
producing 
highly 
specific 
antibodies 
against 
only 
the 
desired 
targets, 
including 
self-antigens, 
making 
possible 
the 
safe 
and 
 effective 
treatment 
of 
chronic 
diseases 
by 
vaccines. 
The 
modular 
and 
synthetic 
nature 
of 
our 
Vaxxine 
Platform 
generally 
provides 
 significant speed and efficiency in candidate 
development and has generated multiple product candidates 
that we are designing to have 
 safety 
and 
efficacy 
equal 
to 
or 
greater 
than 
the 
standard-of-care 
treatments 
for 
many 
chronic 
diseases, 
with 
more 
convenient 
 administration and meaningfully lower costs. Our current pipeline consists of 
five chronic disease product candidates from early to late-
 stage development across multiple therapeutic areas, including Alzheimer s Disease AD ), Parkinson s Disease PD ), migraine and 
 hypercholesterolemia. Additionally, 
we believe our 
Vaxxine 
Platform may be 
used to disrupt 
the treatment paradigm 
for a wide 
range 
 of other 
chronic diseases, 
including any 
that are 
or could 
potentially be 
successfully treated 
by mAbs. 
We 
also will 
opportunistically 
 pursue infectious disease treatments. When the COVID-19 pandemic struck the world in March 2020, we quickly reallocated resources 
 to develop a 
vaccine candidate. We have 
assembled an industry-leading 
team with 
extensive experience developing and 
commercializing 
 successful drugs 
that is 
committed to 
realizing our 
mission of 
democratizing healthcare.

 Limitations of the Current Healthcare Paradigm 
 The current healthcare paradigm favors 
the development of drugs that 
are primarily intended for the 
U.S. market, for niche indications 
 and 
for 
treatment 
of 
disease 
rather 
than 
prevention. 
Furthermore, 
these 
drugs 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
sold 
at 
price 
points 
that 
are 
only 
 accessible to healthcare systems in developed countries. One class 
of drugs in particular exemplifies the current environment: biologics, 
 particularly mAbs. In 2019, biologics represented eight of 
the ten top selling drugs in 
the United States, of which seven 
were mAbs. The 
 global 
market 
for 
mAbs 
totaled 
approximately 
 163 billion 
in 
2019, 
representing 
approximately 
70 
of 
the 
total 
sales 
for 
all 
 biopharmaceutical products. 
 While mAbs can provide life-altering care with generally favorable safety characteristics and significant health benefits 
for the patients 
 who receive them, regular in-office transfusions and annual treatment costs, which can exceed 
hundreds of thousands of dollars, present 
 challenges to both 
patients and payors. These 
price and administration hurdles 
cause mAb treatments to 
be available to only 
a fraction 
 of the population who 
could benefit from them. 
Furthermore, mAbs are often restricted 
to moderate to severe disease 
and to later lines 
 of 
treatment 
due 
to 
their 
high 
cost. 
Based 
on 
internal 
estimates, 
less 
than 
1 
of 
the 
worldwide 
population 
is 
treated 
with 
mAbs. 
 Meanwhile, the 
alternative to mAbs 
treatments tends 
to be small 
molecules, which 
are sometimes more 
accessible to patients, 
but are 
 often comparatively 
less effective 
with more 
significant side 
effects. 
Collectively, 
this perpetuates 
a profound 
inequity in 
healthcare 
 access, domestically but even more so globally, 
that we believe represents a tremendous social and market opportunity. 

4 
 Our Solution 
 Monoclonal antibodies are developed, produced and purified outside the body and then transfused into the patient on a regular basis, as 
 frequently as bi-weekly. Therefore, mAbs are inherently 
less efficient than vaccines, which 
instead stimulate antibody production within 
 the patient s immune system, requiring both less active material and less frequent 
treatments. However, while traditional vaccines have 
 historically 
been 
successful addressing 
infectious 
diseases, previous 
attempts to 
utilize vaccines 
to address 
chronic 
disease have 
not 
 achieved both acceptable safety and efficacy. This limitation is driven by a 
traditional vaccine s inability to either stimulate the requisite 
 antibody 
response against 
harmful 
self-antigens, 
that is, 
break immune 
tolerance, 
or produce 
acceptable levels 
of reactogenicity, 
the 
 physical manifestation of the immune 
response to vaccination. Our 
Vaxxine Platform technology contains modular components custom-
 designed to 
mimic select 
biology and 
activate the 
immune system, 
enabling our 
product candidates 
to break 
immune tolerance 
when 
 targeting self-antigens, a 
property observed across multiple clinical 
and pre-clinical studies. Our 
Vaxxine 
Platform depends heavily on 
 intellectual property licensed from UBI 
and its affiliates, a related 
party and a commercial partner 
for us, who first 
developed the peptide 
 vaccine 
technology 
utilized 
by 
our 
Vaxxine 
Platform. 
The 
formulation 
of 
our 
peptide-based 
product 
candidates 
relies 
on 
contract 
 manufacturers at this time, including both related parties as well as third-party 
manufacturers. 

 We 
believe 
our 
Vaxxine 
Platform 
has 
the 
potential 
to 
generate 
product 
candidates 
with 
attributes 
that 
collectively 
offer 
significant 
 advantages over 
both mAbs 
and small 
molecule therapeutics, 
and that 
some of 
these advantages 
may allow 
for use 
in a first-line 
or a 
 prevention setting: 
 
 Cost
 : 
Monoclonal 
antibodies 
require 
costly 
and 
complex 
biological 
manufacturing 
processes. 
Our 
 manufacturing 
process 
is 
chemically 
based 
and 
highly 
scalable 
and 
requires 
lower 
capital 
expenditures. 
In 
addition, 
we 
design 
our 
 product 
candidates 
to 
generate 
antibody 
production 
in 
the 
body, 
thus 
requiring 
meaningfully 
less 
drug 
substance 
relative 
to 
mAbs, 
 leading to commensurately lower costs. 
 
 Administration
 : 
Our 
product 
candidates 
are 
designed 
to 
be 
injected 
in 
quarterly 
or 
longer 
intervals 
via 
 intramuscular injection similar to a flu shot. We 
believe this offers considerable 
convenience compared to mAbs, which can require 
up 
 to bi-weekly dosing via intravenous infusion or subcutaneous injections, and 
small molecules, which often require daily dosing. 
 
 Efficacy
 : In 
our 
clinical 
trials conducted 
to 
date, our 
product 
candidates 
have yielded 
high 
response 
rates 
 (95 or above at target 
dose levels) for UB-311, 
UB-312 and UB-612, high 
target-specific antibodies against 
self-antigens (as seen in 
 UB-311 and 
UB-312 clinical trials) 
and long durations 
of action for 
UB-311 (based 
on titer levels 
remaining elevated 
between doses) 
 and UB-612 
(based on half-life). 
See our descriptions 
of these clinical 
trials under 
 Our Product 
Candidates. We 
also believe that 
 the improved convenience of our product candidates 
as compared to mAbs has the potential to lead to increased 
adherence by patients. 
 Furthermore, 
our Vaxxine 
Platform enables 
the combining 
of target 
antigens into 
a single 
formulation. 
For indications 
that could 
be 
 treated more effectively with a multivalent approach, we believe our Vaxxine 
Platform would have an advantage over other modalities. 
 Finally, 
because our 
Vaxxine 
Platform is 
designed to 
elicit endogenous 
antibodies, we 
believe our 
product candidates 
may lessen 
or 
 avoid altogether the phenomenon of anti-drug antibodies which has limited 
the efficacy of certain mAbs over time. 
 
 Safety
 : Based on our clinical trials to date, our product 
candidates have been well tolerated. We 
aim to offer 
 product candidates with safety profiles at least comparable to the competing mAb or small molecule alternative for the relevant disease. 

5 
 Our Pipeline 
 The following chart reflects our current product candidate pipeline: 
 As used in the chart above, IND signifies a program 
has begun investigational new drug IND )-enabling studies. 
 Our pipeline 
consists of 
five lead 
programs focused 
on chronic 
disease, particularly 
neurodegenerative disorders, 
in addition 
to other 
 neurology and cardiovascular indications. 
 Neurodegenerative Disease Programs: 
 
 UB-311
 : Targets toxic 
forms of aggregated amyloid-beta A in the brain to fight AD. Phase 1, Phase 2a 
 and Phase 2a Long Term 
Extension LTE 
trials have shown UB-311 to be well tolerated in mild-to-moderate 
AD subjects over 
 three years of repeat dosing, with a safety profile comparable to placebo, with 
no cases of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-
 edema ARIA-E observed in the main Phase 2a trial, and only one case of 
ARIA-E in the LTE 
trial, which was clinically not 
 significant according to the study investigator. 
UB-311 was also shown to be immunogenic, with a high 
responder rate and antibodies 
 that bind to the desired target. We 
held an End of Phase 2 meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA and have 
 aligned upon a large scale efficacy trial, which, pending 
data, could potentially support initial licensure of UB-311 
for the treatment of 
 early AD. 
The FDA granted UB-311 Fast Track 
Designation in the second quarter of 2022. 
The expected timing of the Phase 2b 
 initiation will be determined based upon the timing of a strategic partnership. 
 
 UB-312
 : Targets toxic 
forms of aggregated -synuclein in the brain and peripheral tissues to fight PD and 
 other synucleinopathies, such as Lewy body dementia LBD and 
multiple system atrophy MSA ). Part A of a Phase 1 trial in 
 healthy volunteers has been completed and has shown UB-312 to be well tolerated, 
with no significant safety findings, and 
 immunogenic, 
with a high responder rate and antibodies that cross the blood-brain barrier BBB ). No serious 
adverse events were 
 observed in Part A of the Phase 1 trial. We 
have completed an end-of-treatment analysis of the ongoing Part 
B of the Phase 1 trial in 
 PD patients, which has similarly shown UB-312 to be well tolerated and immunogenic, 
with anti- -synuclein antibodies observed in 
 the serum and CSF of PD patients. 
We anticipate the 
completion of Part B of the trial in PD patients in mid-2023.

VXX-301
 : 
We 
are 
developing 
an 
anti-tau 
product 
candidate 
that 
has 
the 
potential 
to 
address 
multiple 
 neurodegenerative 
conditions, 
including 
AD, 
by 
targeting 
abnormal 
tau 
proteins 
alone 
and 
in 
potential 
combination 
with 
other 
 pathological proteins such as A to combat multiple pathological processes at once. Our lead candidate targets multiple epitopes of tau. 
 Next Wave Chronic 
Disease Programs: 
 
 UB-313
 : 
Targets 
Calcitonin 
Gene-Related 
Peptide CGRP to 
fight 
migraines. 
We 
have 
completed 
 enrollment in a first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial, which began in 
September 2022, and anticipate a topline readout in the mid-2023. 
 
 VXX-401
 : 
Targets 
proprotein 
convertase 
subtilisin/kexin 
type 
9 
serine 
protease PCSK9 to 
lower 
low-
 density lipoprotein LDL 
cholesterol and reduce 
the risk of cardiac 
events. As of March 
2023, we have begun 
dosing of subjects in 
 a first-in-human clinical trial of VXX-401 in Australia. 

6 
 Given the global COVID-19 pandemic and our Vaxxine 
Platform s applicability to infectious disease, we also have advanced a product 
 candidate that addresses SARS-CoV-2. 
 COVID-19 
 
 UB-612
 : Employs a multitope subunit protein-peptide approach to neutralizing the SARS-CoV-2 
virus, 
 meaning the product candidate is designed to activate both antibody and 
cellular immunity against multiple viral epitopes. 
A Phase 3 
 trial evaluating UB-612 as a heterologous boost against SARS-CoV-2, 
head-to-head versus homologous boosts of VNT162b2 
 (mRNA), ChAdOx1-S (adenovirus), and BIBP (inactivated virus), was initiated 
in the first half of 2022 with funding support from the 
 Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness Innovations CEPI ). 
In December 2022, we announced positive topline data: UB-612 met 
 primary and key secondary endpoints, eliciting non-inferior neutralizing 
antibody titers and seroconversion rates SCR(s) ), defined 
 as a 4-fold or greater increase in neutralizing antibodies from baseline, 
against both Wuhan and Omicron BA.5 variants as compared 
 to BNT162b2, and superior neutralizing antibody titers and SCRs against both variants 
as compared to ChAdOx1-S and BIBP. 

 Preliminary safety data show that UB-612 has been generally well tolerated 
with no serious adverse events reported through day 57 of 
 data cut-off. 
The trial is ongoing, with long-term safety and immunogenicity follow-up 
planned through 12 months. 
Phase 1 and 
 Phase 2 trials of UB-612 have also shown UB-612 to be well tolerated, 
with over 7,500 doses administered to over 3,750 subjects. In 
 March 2023 we completed rolling submissions for conditional/provisional 
authorization with regulatory authorities in the United 
 Kingdom and Australia, who will review under their established work 
share agreement.

We 
believe our Vaxxine 
Platform has application 
across a multitude 
of chronic and 
infectious disease indications 
beyond our 
existing 
 pipeline. We are developing additional product candidates that we believe may address significant unmet needs both within and beyond 
 our current pipeline s therapeutic areas. 
 Our Team 
 We have assembled 
an experienced group of executives with deep scientific, business and leadership 
expertise in pharmaceutical and 
 vaccine discovery and development, manufacturing, regulatory and commercialization. 
Mei Mei Hu, our co-founder and Chief 
 Executive Officer, has been a member 
of the executive committee of UBI since 2010. Our board of directors is chaired by our co-
 founder Louis Reese, who has been a member of the executive committee 
of UBI since 2014. Our research efforts are guided by 
 highly experienced scientists and physicians on our leadership team 
including Dr. Ulo Palm, our Chief Medical 
Officer, and Dr. 
Jean-
 Cosme Dodart, our Senior Vice 
President of Research. Our leadership team contributes a diverse range of 
experiences from leading 
 companies including Allergan, Amgen, Eli Lilly, 
LEO, Merck, Novavax, Novartis, and Schering-Plough, and were executives in 
 multiple successful mAb and vaccine launches.

As of December 31, 2022, we have assembled an exceptional team of approximately 
 92 employees, the majority of whom hold Ph.D., M.D., J.D. or Master s 
degrees. We also have 
a highly experienced scientific 
 advisory board consisting of leading doctors and scientists in relevant 
therapeutic areas.

Our Strategy 
 Our mission is 
to develop product candidates 
that improve the 
quality of care for 
chronic diseases and 
are accessible to 
all patients across 
 the globe. In order to achieve this mission, we seek to: 
 
 Advance our chronic disease pipeline through 
clinical stage development
 : We plan to advance UB-311, 
 UB-312, UB-313, and VXX-401 through clinical stage development 
for the treatment of chronic diseases, either ourselves or with a 
 strategic partner. We 
believe that our differentiated Vaxxine 
Platform will enable our product candidates, if approved and successfully 
 commercialized, 
to potentially disrupt the treatment paradigm for their respective indications. However, 
there can be no guarantee that 
 we will obtain regulatory approval or commercialize of any such product 
candidates.

Expand our pipeline of product 
candidates
 : Chronic diseases are prevalent 
globally and expected to worsen 
 over the next several decades. In furtherance of our mission, we plan to expand our pipeline by developing new product candidates that 
 address additional 
indications. In 
expanding our 
pipeline, we rely 
on our 
proprietary filtering 
methodology, 
which evaluates potential 
 product 
candidates 
across 
five 
principal 
criteria 
 
(i) 
probability 
of 
technical 
and 
regulatory 
success, 
(ii) 
addressable 
market, 
(iii) 
 development cost, (iv) competitive dynamics and (v) disruptive potential. 
 
 Opportunistically develop treatments for 
infectious diseases
 : While 
our core mission 
focuses on the 
treatment 
 of chronic diseases, we are committed to bringing accessible medicines to people around 
the world and will address infectious diseases 
 opportunistically. For 
example, when the COVID-19 pandemic struck the world, 
we rapidly deployed resources in pursuit of a product 
 candidate currently embodied in UB-612. 
 
 Expand 
and 
scale 
our 
existing 
capabilities
 : 
We 
are 
investing 
in 
our 
operational 
processes, 
facilities 
and 
 human capital to accelerate the speed with which we can bring 
product candidates through the development pipeline, and to 
strengthen 
 the capacity for developing more product candidates simultaneously. 

7 
 
 Continue to 
improve 
our Vaxxine 
Platform
 : In 
addition to, 
and in 
conjunction with, 
our product 
candidate 
 development 
efforts, 
we 
are 
continuously 
working 
to 
improve 
and 
enhance 
the 
richness, 
breadth 
and 
effectiveness 
of 
our 
Vaxxine 
 Platform. As our 
Vaxxine Platform further develops, we 
believe that 
we can 
both increase the 
number of product 
candidates in 
concurrent 
 development and efficiently advance product candidates 
through pre-clinical and clinical development. 
 
 Maximize the value of 
our product candidates through potential partnerships
 : We currently retain worldwide 
 rights for the majority 
of our product candidates 
and will consider entering 
into development and commercialization 
partnerships with 
 third parties that align with our mission on an opportunistic basis. 
 Background and Limitations of Traditional 
Vaccines and Monoclonal 
Antibodies 
 The immune 
system, the 
body s 
mechanism for 
fighting off 
potential threats, 
is comprised 
of cells 
that form 
the innate 
and adaptive 
 immune 
responses. 
The 
main 
purpose 
of 
the 
innate 
immune 
system 
is 
to 
immediately 
prevent 
the 
spread 
and 
movement 
of 
foreign 
 pathogens throughout the body. The adaptive immune response is specific to the pathogen presented to T-cells 
and B lymphocytes B-
 cells and leads to an enhanced response upon future encounters with those antigens. Antibodies represent an important tool within the 
 adaptive immune system s arsenal. Upon detection of a potential threat, B-cells produce antibodies that 
recognize, bind to and eliminate 
 the threatening pathogen. Over time, the immune system develops the 
ability to produce countless types of antibodies, each finely tuned 
 against a specific threat. 
 Generally, the immune system is able to function effectively by neutralizing 
viruses, bacteria and even self-generated cells and proteins 
 from within our own 
bodies that could cause 
harm if unchecked. 
However, as powerful 
as the immune system 
is, there are threats 
that 
 it 
cannot 
overcome 
on 
its 
own, 
generating 
the 
need 
for 
medicine. 
Conventional 
forms 
of 
medicine 
include 
small 
molecules 
(e.g., 
 antibiotics), which can inhibit 
or promote action within 
the body by, for instance, 
binding to a 
receptor on the surface 
of a cell, 
or directly 
 inducing toxic effects upon bacteria. These 
medicines do not necessarily modulate 
the immune system directly in 
order to work. Instead, 
 they work 
alongside it. 
While small 
molecules have 
provided substantial 
benefits to 
human health, 
they are 
typically not 
designed to 
 interact with the immune 
system. They may also 
have limited efficacy in cases 
where an immune 
response to a target can 
be used against 
 a chronic condition. 
 Vaccines 
 In the 
first part 
of the 
twentieth century, 
vaccines revolutionized 
healthcare by 
directly interacting 
with, and 
modulating, the 
immune 
 system training 
it to recognize 
a dangerous pathogen by 
introducing the immune system 
to a relatively 
harmless form of the 
pathogen, 
 its toxins 
or 
one 
of 
its surface 
proteins, 
thereby 
promoting 
the 
body s 
own 
production 
of binding 
antibodies. 
Once 
immunized 
to 
a 
 specific pathogen, the immune system can recognize it and generate the antibodies 
to fight it more quickly and robustly. 
 Traditional vaccine 
technologies have generally 
focused on the prevention 
of bacterial and viral 
infections and not on 
chronic disease. 
 In 
chronic 
disease 
settings, 
the 
disease-causing 
agents 
frequently 
come 
from 
within 
the 
body. 
These 
self-antigens 
are 
proteins 
that 
 become too abundant, 
misfolded or aggregated 
such that they can no 
longer perform their healthy 
function and even may 
induce toxic 
 effects. 
The 
body 
can 
sometimes 
produce 
antibodies 
against 
such 
proteins, 
but 
this 
often 
falls 
short 
of 
providing 
the 
right 
types of 
 antibodies in the right 
concentrations to ward off 
disease. Historically, vaccine technologies developed to target these 
proteins have been 
 unable 
to break 
immune tolerance 
 that 
is, the 
immune 
system s 
general 
avoidance 
of reactivity 
towards 
self-antigens 
 with 
an 
 acceptable level of reactogenicity. 
The challenges faced by 
prior efforts to advance 
vaccine technologies for chronic 
diseases included 
 low response rates, low titer levels, off- 
target responses and other 
safety concerns such as T-cell 
mediated inflammation. 
 Monoclonal Antibodies 
 The first 
mAbs were 
developed in 
the later 
part of 
the twentieth 
century. 
In contrast 
to vaccines, 
which prompt 
the body 
to produce 
 antibodies, mAbs are antibodies manufactured outside of 
the patient s body and then 
injected or infused into the body to recognize and 
 eliminate 
harmful 
targets. 
Monoclonal 
antibodies 
have 
revolutionized 
the 
standard-of-care 
treatment 
for 
many 
chronic 
diseases. 
 However, manufacturing mAbs is 
often an expensive 
and complex 
process and administering 
mAbs is 
cumbersome, sometimes 
requiring 
 infusions 
as frequently 
as bi-weekly. 
These factors 
have generally 
limited mAbs 
availability to 
moderate-to-severe 
disease, to 
later 
 lines of therapy and to wealthier geographies, thus denying 
access to a substantial portion of the patients who 
could benefit from them. 
 Finally, 
patients 
on 
mAbs 
often 
experience 
a 
loss 
of 
effectiveness 
over 
time 
due 
to 
a 
phenomenon 
known 
as 
anti-drug 
antibodies, 
 whereby the immune 
system begins to 
recognize therapeutic mAbs 
as foreign, and 
mounts a 
response against them, 
eventually mitigating 
 their efficacy. 
 Our Vaxxine 
Platform 
 Our Vaxxine 
Platform is designed to stimulate the patient s own immune system to generate antibodies and overcome the limitations of 
 traditional 
vaccines 
to 
target 
self-antigens 
safely 
and 
effectively 
in 
chronic 
diseases. 
Our 
product 
candidates 
have 
broken 
immune 
 tolerance against 
self-antigens consistently. 
As described 
in the 
section titled 
 Our Product 
Candidates below, 
across seven 
clinical 
 trials, 
we 
have 
consistently 
observed 
that our 
product 
candidates have 
stimulated 
the 
development 
of 
antibodies 
against the 
desired 

8 
 target at relevant doses in clinical trial subjects, including the elderly. We have observed favorable tolerability and reactogenicity of our 
 product 
candidates 
across 
studies 
of 
UB-311, 
UB-312 
and 
UB-612, 
with 
no 
significant 
safety 
findings 
to 
date. 
We 
aim 
to 
develop 
 product candidates that 
are more convenient, 
more cost-effective and 
more accessible to large 
patient populations, with safety 
profiles 
 at least comparable to, 
relevant mAbs and small 
molecule treatments. We believe our product candidates have 
the potential to eventually 
 not only capture meaningful market share from mAbs 
and small molecules, but more importantly, to provide therapeutic benefit to 
large 
 patient populations 
who currently 
receive neither 
form of 
treatment and 
thereby open 
up the 
broadest access 
to patients. 
This would 
 represent 
an 
unprecedented 
shift 
in 
the 
treatment 
paradigm, 
potentially 
providing 
better 
global 
access 
to 
treatments 
that 
have 
been 
 previously 
limited 
to 
the 
wealthiest 
nations. 
In 
particular, 
we 
believe 
our 
treatments 
for 
chronic 
disease 
could 
reflect 
the 
following 
 benefits as compared with the relevant mAbs and small molecule alternatives: 
 Characteristics of our Product Candidates versus Monoclonal Antibodies and Small 
Molecules 
 History and Design 
 Our Vaxxine 
Platform utilizes a peptide vaccine technology first developed by UBI and subsequently refined over the last two decades, 
 with more 
than three 
billion doses 
of animal 
vaccines 
commercialized 
to date. 
UBI initiated 
the development 
of this 
technology 
for 
 human use; the business focused on human use was then separated from UBI through two separate transactions: a spin-out from UBI in 
 2014 of operations 
focused on developing 
chronic disease product 
candidates that resulted 
in United Neuroscience, 
a Cayman Islands 
 exempted company UNS ), 
and a second 
spin-out from UBI 
in 2020 of 
operations focused on 
the development of 
a COVID-19 vaccine 
 that resulted 
in C19 Corp., 
a Delaware 
corporation COVAXX ). 
Our current 
company, 
Vaxxinity, 
Inc., was incorporated 
under the 
 laws of the State of Delaware on February 2, 2021 for the purpose of acquiring 
UNS and COVAXX 
in March of 2021. 

 On March 2, 
2021, in 
accordance with 
a contribution 
and exchange 
agreement among 
Vaxxinity, 
UNS, COVAXX 
and the 
UNS and 
 COVAXX 
stockholders party thereto (the Contribution and 
Exchange Agreement ), the existing equity holders of 
UNS and COVAXX 
 contributed their 
equity interests in 
each of 
UNS and COVAXX 
in exchange 
for equity interests 
in Vaxxinity 
(the Reorganization ). 
 In 
connection 
with 
the 
Reorganization, 
(i) all 
outstanding 
shares 
of 
UNS 
and 
COVAXX 
preferred 
stock 
and 
common 
stock 
were 
 contributed to 
Vaxxinity 
and exchanged 
for like 
shares of 
stock in 
Vaxxinity, 
(ii) the outstanding 
options to 
purchase shares 
of UNS 
 and COVAXX 
common stock were terminated and substituted with options 
to purchase shares of Class A common stock in Vaxxinity, 
 (iii) the 
outstanding 
warrant 
to 
purchase 
shares 
of 
COVAXX 
common 
stock 
was cancelled 
and 
exchanged 
for 
a 
warrant 
to 
acquire 
 Class A 
common 
stock 
in 
Vaxxinity, 
and 
(iv) the 
outstanding 
convertible 
notes 
and 
a 
related 
party 
not 
payable 
were contributed 
to 
 Vaxxinity 
and the former holders of such notes received Series A preferred stock in Vaxxinity. 
On December 31, 2022, COVAXX 
was 
 merged into Vaxxinity 
in order to simplify the corporate structure. 

 UBI has used 
its capabilities 
in peptide 
technology for 
innovations across an 
array of 
business endeavors: 
antibody testing 
for human 
 diagnostics, animal health 
vaccines and the manufacture 
of medical products. Its 
innovative products include one 
of the first approved 
 peptide-based blood antibody tests in the world (for HIV), one of the first approved 
peptide vaccines against an infectious disease in the 
 world in animal health (for a 
food-and-mouth disease virus) and one of 
the first approved peptide vaccines against 
a self-antigen in the 
 world in 
animal health 
(an anti-luteinizing 
hormone-releasing hormone LHRH vaccine 
used for 
the immunocastration 
of swine). 

9 
 Grant funding from 
the National Institutes 
of Health supported 
some of UBI s 
work in the 
fields of vaccines 
and antibody testing. 
To 
 commercialize its animal health 
vaccine business, UBI 
and its affiliates scaled 
up GMP vaccine manufacturing to 
over 500 million doses 
 per 
year 
and 
partnered 
with 
a 
top-ten 
animal 
health 
company 
for 
commercialization 
of 
its 
anti-LHRH 
vaccine; 
all 
together, 
UBI s 
 technology platform is utilized for the vaccination of approximately 25 
of the global swine population annually. 
 We are 
advancing our peptide-based Vaxxine 
Platform to develop product 
candidates that target chronic 
diseases and COVID-19. 
Our 
 Vaxxine 
Platform 
comprises 
a 
proprietary, 
custom, 
rationally 
designed 
antigen 
capable 
of 
evoking 
an 
immune 
response 
(an 
 immunogen 
formulated 
with 
a 
proprietary 
CpG 
oligonucleotide. 
The 
immunogen 
contains 
several 
advanced 
synthetic 
peptide 
 domains, 
including 
B-cell 
epitopes, 
T-helper Th 
peptide 
carrier 
constructs 
and 
peptide 
linkers. 
This 
composition 
enables 
us 
to 
 achieve 
a 
highly 
specific 
immune 
response 
to 
the 
target 
antigen, 
with 
limited 
inflammation 
and 
off-target 
effects 
that 
could 
cause 
 reactogenicity. This design process has evolved into a repeatable series of well-defined steps, 
which has enabled the development of our 
 current pipeline of product candidates. 
 Key Elements of our Vaxxine 
Platform Constructs and Formulations 
 When developing 
a product 
candidate, we 
use publicly 
available information 
and sophisticated 
bioinformatics tools 
to investigate 
the 
 entire protein structure of a 
target in a comprehensive manner 
to identify functional B-cell epitopes 
that may provide optimal antigens. 
 We 
then synthesize 
peptides that 
mimic these 
identified antigens 
to elicit 
highly specific 
antibodies against 
these B-cell 
epitopes. To 
 yield favorable tolerability profiles, we screen our product candidates for lack of toxicity as well as reactogenicity, 
and design them not 
 to elicit T-cell 
mediated inflammation. To 
enhance effectiveness, we 
seek to optimize the 
size and sequence of 
our custom peptides to 
 elicit a robust, specific antibody response when linked to a carrier molecule. 
 We 
then attach 
a proprietary 
carrier molecule, 
an artificial Th 
carrier peptide 
that delivers the 
synthetic peptide 
into cells. 
Traditional 
 vaccines have 
faced challenges 
in achieving 
specific responses 
because they 
rely on 
conjugating 
an antigen 
to a 
large toxoid 
carrier 
 molecule, to which most of 
the antibody response is directed, 
causing off-target effects 
such as inflammation. 
In our pre-clinical trials 
 and clinical trials to date, our product candidates have displayed specific immunogenicity, 
or the ability to stimulate a targeted immune 
 response, thereby greatly reducing potential off-target effects and increasing the potential for our 
product candidates to be well tolerated 
 and 
efficacious. 
We 
have 
observed 
that 
our 
carrier 
molecules 
have 
produced 
consistent 
results 
across 
multiple 
species 
and 
against 
 multiple targets in seven human clinical trials to date. 

10 
 Our Product Candidate Does Not Induce an Antibody Response against its Carrier Molecule 
 The graph above 
illustrates that our 
peptide carriers induce 
a strong immune response against 
the target antigen, and 
a minimal immune 
 response against themselves, as compared 
to traditional vaccines formulated with other types of carrier molecules. 
 Our 
peptide 
carriers 
have 
short sequence 
lengths; 
we 
design 
them with 
the aim 
that 
they are 
not 
antigenic on 
their own 
and 
do not 
 stimulate cytotoxic T-cells. 
The carriers sequences model 
those found in natural 
pathogens, so they are 
recognized by T-helper 
cells. 
 This encourages 
robust T-helper 
cell exposure 
and promotes activation 
of other 
immune cells. 
In turn, 
B-cells are exposed 
to the B-
 cell antigen and begin antibody production against the antigen, while avoiding 
an antibody response to the carrier. 
 Our library of peptide carriers enables the use of different 
carrier molecules or different combinations of carrier molecules, which 
 allows us to potentially regulate the speed of immune response onset as well as the magnitude 
and duration of that response. For 
 example, a longer duration of response would allow for less frequent dosing. 
In the case of vaccines for infectious diseases, where T-
 cell mediated activity is desirable, our Vaxxine 
Platform also affords the flexibility to design immunogen constructs that specifically 
 promote cytotoxic T-cell 
activity when warranted.

We 
utilize proprietary 
linker constructs 
to fuse 
our peptide 
carriers 
with our 
custom peptide 
antigens. 
These linkers 
are designed 
to 
 promote binding of both B-cell and 
T-helper epitopes to their respective receptors, contributing to a B-cell response. 
They may enhance 
 the 
immune 
response 
by 
enabling 
conformational 
changes 
to optimize 
presentation 
of 
the B-cell 
epitope 
to 
antigen-presenting 
cells 
 APCs ), such as dendritic cells DCs ). 
 Our 
Vaxxine 
Platform 
also 
enables 
the 
construction 
of 
candidates 
that 
target 
multiple 
epitopes 
in 
a 
single 
formulation, 
whether 
on 
 multiple 
targets 
or 
a 
single 
target. 
In 
certain 
cases, 
targeting 
multiple 
epitopes 
of 
a 
single 
target 
could 
promote 
increased 
target 
 engagement. 
Combinations of therapies 
targeting different molecular 
mechanisms are common 
in treating neurologic, cardiovascular, 
 psychiatric, 
metabolic, 
respiratory, 
infectious 
and 
oncologic 
disease. 
Our 
Vaxxine 
Platform s 
favorable 
cost 
of 
goods 
and 
efficient 
 manufacturing process 
could allow for 
viable multi-target 
therapies in a 
single formulation. 
This concept could 
be applied in 
an array 
 of potential therapeutic 
areas. Our current 
pipeline has candidates 
against amyloid- , -synuclein 
and tau; targeting 
of two or more 
of 
 these at the same time might prove more effective than any single-target therapy in some patients. Pre-clinical data to date suggests that 
 we can elicit 
antibody titers against 
all three targets in 
a single formulation. 
In contrast, multi-target therapy 
with mAbs would 
compound 
 the cost and administration burdens as compared to single-target 
mAb therapy.

 Immunogenicity of Single- Versus 
Multi-Target 
Formulations in Guinea Pigs 
 Guinea pigs (three per dose) 
were immunized with either single-target or 
multi-target formulations, then serum was 
drawn and antibody 
 titers compared 
via enzyme immunoassays EIA ). Multi-target 
formulations elicited 
similar titer 
levels against 
each target 
as their 
 corresponding single-target 
formulations. This suggests we can create product candidates with multiple neurodegenerative targets 
in a 
 single formulation and achieve sustainable titer levels. 
 Product Candidate Formulations 
 In 
addition 
to 
our 
immunogen 
construct, 
each 
product 
candidate 
formulation 
includes 
custom 
CpG 
oligonucleotides 
and 
adjuvant 
 selection. CpG oligonucleotides are 
negatively charged, and we 
utilize proprietary CpG configurations 
to stabilize the 
positively charged 
 peptides. This 
stabilization acts 
to optimize 
display of 
the B-cell 
epitope to 
the immune 
system. In 
this way, 
the primary 
function of 
 CpG oligonucleotides in our formulations is that of an excipient. 
 A potential secondary 
function of CpG 
is that of 
an adjuvant. 
Certain CpG configurations 
are known 
to act as 
immunostimulants and 
 promote direct cytotoxic 
T-cell activity, while others do not. 
Accordingly, our selection of the 
specific CpG modality 
is highly 
dependent 
 on the target 
indication. For infectious 
disease indications, the 
T-cell 
response generated by 
the CpG configuration 
is independent and 
 in addition to that of the T-cell 
response generated by the peptide carrier. 
 The final formulation includes the addition of an adjuvant, such as a well-recognized, alum-derived Adju-Phos or Alhydrogel to further 
 enhance the immunogenicity of our product candidate. 
Alum-derived adjuvants are commonly used in vaccines 
to promote an immune 
 response. This is not the same adjuvant used in other companies failed neurodegenerative 
vaccine candidates. 
 How our Product Candidates are Designed to Function 
 Our immunogens 
stimulate the 
body s 
adaptive immune 
system to 
produce antibodies 
against a 
variety of 
antigen targets, 
including 
 secreted 
peptides 
or 
proteins, 
degenerative 
or 
dysfunctional 
proteins 
and 
membrane 
proteins, 
as 
well 
as 
infectious 
pathogens. 
The 
 mechanism of action involves the following sequence of steps: 
 1. 
The immunogen is taken up by an APC, such 
as a DC. Antigen uptake leads to DC maturation and migration 
 to the draining lymph nodes where the DCs interact with CD4+ T-helper 
cells. 
 2. 
DCs engulf and 
process the antigen 
internally and present 
the T-helper 
epitope on major histocompatibility 
 complex MHC Class 
II molecules. 
The presentation 
activates immunogen 
-specific CD4+ 
T-helper 
cells causing 
them to 
mature, 
 proliferate and promote B-cell stimulatory activity. 
 3. 
B-cells with receptors that 
recognize the target 
B-cell epitope bind, internalize 
and process the immunogen. 
 The binding of the B-cell receptor to the immunogen provides the first activation 
signal to the B-cells. 
 4. 
When B-cells 
function 
as APCs 
and present 
the T-helper 
epitope on 
MHC Class 
II molecules, 
interaction 
 with immunogen-specific 
CD4+ T-helper 
cells provides 
a second 
activation signal 
to B-cells, 
which causes 
them to 
differentiate into 
 plasma cells. 
 5. 
B-cell 
epitope-specific 
plasma 
cells 
produce 
high 
affinity 
antibodies 
against 
the 
target 
B-cell 
epitope. 
Of 
 particular 
importance 
for 
targets 
located 
in 
the 
central 
nervous 
system CNS ), 
these 
antibodies 
are 
produced 
in 
sufficient 
 concentrations to cross the BBB. 

12 
 Overview of How our Product Candidates Function 
 Importantly, 
from both clinical trials 
and pre-clinical studies, 
we have observed 
the rapid expansion of 
antibodies upon administration 
 of a booster of our product candidates. Based 
on the available data to date, we can infer that 
while antibody titers decline with time after 
 administration, a small 
number of memory 
B-cells and antibody 
secreting cells are maintained 
in the lymphoid organs, 
spleen or bone 
 marrow. We 
believe this is important because if a 
patient misses a dose of our 
product candidate, they may be able to 
recall the antibody 
 response, and therefore the therapeutic effect of the antibodies, with 
a single booster, even after a long period of time 
has passed. 
 Vaxxine 
Platform Immunogenicity upon Re-dosing 
 As shown 
in 
the 
above 
graph, 
a 
rapid 
antibody 
response 
is elicited 
by 
a 
booster 
dose 
of 
UB-311 
given 
72 
weeks after 
the 
priming 
 regimen. 
 Furthermore, the antibodies elicited by our product candidates have different properties than those of mAbs 
targeting similar pathology. 
 In general, 
we aim 
to achieve 
binding affinity, 
specificity and 
functionality similar 
or improved 
compared to 
mAbs targeting 
similar 
 pathology. We 
use Bio-Layer Interferometry (ForteBio to compare the binding kinetics (K
 ON
 , K
 OFF
 , and K
 D) of antibodies elicited by 

13 
 our product candidates 
versus mAbs. We 
also use Western 
blot or slot blot 
to evaluate the binding 
specificity of antibodies elicited 
by 
 our product 
candidates against 
the normal, 
toxic, misfolded 
or aggregated 
forms of 
the target 
protein. We 
use immunohistochemical 
 analyses to observe the binding of antibodies to pathological inclusions on tissue sections, such as brain sections of patients. Moreover, 
 we use cell-based models and animal models to measure the induced 
antibodies functionality. Additionally, 
a major challenge in mAb 
 drug 
discovery 
is 
that 
mAbs 
are 
prone 
to 
induce 
an 
immune 
response 
against 
themselves, 
resulting 
in 
a 
potential 
 inactivation/neutralization of the mAb by the host (i.e., the patient). This is not a concern 
with our vaccine approach as each patient will 
 produce its own 
antibodies against the 
target. Finally, 
mAbs have a 
potential 
for off-target 
binding, which could 
result in non-specific 
 binding leading 
to safety and 
toxicity issues. 
We 
believe that 
this is unlikely 
to happen 
using our technology 
since antibodies 
elicited 
 by our product 
candidates are designed 
to break immune 
tolerance against specific 
targets and should 
not trigger an 
immune response 
 against other self-peptides or proteins. 
 Product Candidate Selection Process 
 Because our Vaxxine Platform may have applicability across 
a range of chronic 
diseases, we employ a 
proprietary filtering methodology 
 to best identify new product candidates for development. We 
evaluate potential product candidates across five principal criteria: 
 
 Probability 
of 
technical 
and 
regulatory 
success
 : 
We 
examine 
the 
probability 
of 
success 
for 
a 
product 
 candidate based on stage of development and therapeutic area, and then make target-specific 
adjustments for design difficulty, 
industry 
 knowledge and clarity of 
biological mechanism, general safety 
risk and estimated 
titer level required 
for therapeutic effect. This 
criterion 
 accounts for the known validity of a given target in the relevant 
disease context. 
 
 Market 
opportunity
 : 
We 
account 
for 
the 
prevalence, 
unmet 
need 
and 
drug 
market 
size 
for 
each 
likely 
 indication associated with a given target, as well as the number of potential 
indications. 
 
 Development cost
 : We 
estimate the 
cost of 
development through 
BLA submission, 
the time 
to submission 
 and the number of patient-years to proof-of-concept. 
 
 Competitive advantages
 : We 
evaluate the extent to 
which the advantages of 
our Vaxxine 
Platform compare 
 to the current and potential future standard of care, including convenience, dosing, 
safety, efficacy 
and cost. 
 
 Disruptive opportunities
 : We evaluate the 
extent to which the potential disruptive properties of our Vaxxine 
 Platform may play a 
role in treatment paradigms, 
including the ability to 
 leap-frog mAbs and treat 
patients in earlier lines 
of treatment, 
 to be used as a prophylactic, to include multiple targets in a single formulation 
and to be used as an adjuvant therapy. 
 After assigning 
values to each 
criterion for 
a given product 
candidate, we 
weight each criterion 
according to a 
confidential algorithm, 
 and thereby prioritize product candidates for development. We 
update these values on a regular basis based on new scientific literature, 
 trial results and our Vaxxine 
Platform advancements. 
 As an example, in light of these criteria, AD and other neurodegenerative diseases that involve misfolded proteins are an attractive area 
 for development. First, as the field has gained knowledge and clinical experience around the biology of targeting 
aberrant proteins with 
 antibodies, the relative technical, safety and regulatory risk has decreased. For instance, with two FDA-approved products targeting 
A 
 for AD, A 
has been validated 
as a target. 
Both AD and 
PD have high 
prevalence worldwide, 
and large unmet 
need with no 
disease-
 modifying products readily 
available to patients. 
Moreover, the 
underlying pathologies often 
begin years or 
decades before symptoms 
 may appear and as a result, early intervention in the disease state, as well as prevention or delay of onset strategies, may be optimal and 
 more 
practically 
achievable 
with 
a 
vaccine 
approach. 
While 
mAbs 
can 
target 
the 
pathology, 
they 
face 
the 
limitations 
of 
high 
cost, 
 cumbersome and 
inefficient administration 
and limited 
access, and 
are not 
suited for 
early treatment 
or prevention, 
which we 
believe 
 provides 
a disruptive opportunity for our Vaxxine 
Platform. 
 We 
do not 
currently 
evaluate oncology 
and infectious 
diseases through 
the above 
framework. We 
generally 
do not 
pursue oncology 
 targets 
given the 
hyper-segmentation 
of subjects 
common in 
clinical development 
efforts in 
oncology that 
leads to 
relatively narrow 
 labels, and 
due 
to the 
strengths of 
other new 
modalities such 
as cell-based 
therapy in 
this area. 
We 
only consider 
infectious disease 
 opportunistically. However, 
our approach with respect to oncology and infection diseases could change 
in the future. 
 We believe that our Vaxxine 
Platform, and our strategy more generally, 
will create a significant opportunity for drug development well 
 beyond our current pipeline 
of clinical and 
pre-clinical indications, in therapeutic 
areas including allergy (e.g., 
atopic dermatitis, 
chronic 
 rhinosinusitis, , food allergy), autoimmune disease 
(e.g., psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn s disease), pain (e.g., 
peripheral neuropathy, 
 diabetic neuropathy) and bone and muscle atrophy (e.g., sarcopenia, osteoporosis, 
osteopenia). 
 Underlying Drivers of Our Platform Advantages 
 Our Vaxxine Platform s 
properties drive the unique combination 
of attributes that we 
believe will be reflected in 
our product candidates: 

14 
 
 Cost
 : Our reliance 
on chemically linked, 
custom peptide sequences 
fuels cost efficiencies 
that we expect 
to 
 enable 
broad 
accessibility 
to 
our 
product 
candidates. 
Foremost 
among 
these 
relates 
to 
dosing. 
Monoclonal 
antibodies 
require 
more 
 physical material for annual dosing because the patient needs to be delivered the externally manufactured therapeutic antibodies, which 
 have high molecular weight. In contrast, our product candidates are designed to 
stimulate the body s immune system to produce its own 
 antibodies and 
have relatively 
low molecular 
weight. While 
an annual 
supply of 
mAbs doses 
may include 
grams or 
tens of 
grams of 
 drug substance, our current product candidates only 
require 1 to 2 milligrams each, or even less, leading 
to a relatively low annual cost 
 of goods. In 
our development programs 
to date, we 
have achieved 
a cost of 
goods amounting to 
a small fraction 
of the typical 
cost of 
 mAbs (as low as 

17 
 Generation of Antibodies Repeatable Across Clinical Studies, and Antibodies Bind Target 
with High 
 Specificity as Compared to Monoclonal Antibody 
 Across Phase 
1 and 
Phase 2a 
trials, UB-311 
generated an 
over 95 
response rates 
in subjects. 
In a 
comparative in 
vitro study 
with 
 aducanumab, we observed that UB-311 
elicited titer levels comparable to mAbs. 
 Phase 1 
and Phase 
2a trials 
of UB-311 
demonstrated a 
repeatable anti-A 
titer response. 
In an 
 in vitro
 
comparison of 
titers in 
serum 
 from 
subjects dosed 
with UB-311 
versus pre 
-immune serum 
spiked 
with aducanumab 
at the 
published 
C
 max 
 concentration 
following 
 10mg/kg administration 
(183 g/mL), antibodies 
generated by 
UB-311 
bond to 
A oligomers 
similarly to 
or greater 
than the 
mAb as 
 measured by EIA. 
 Exploratory analyses of clinical and 
imaging measures were conducted. Trends of changes in 
disease assessment scores suggest slowing 
 of cognitive 
decline. Changes 
in the 
CDR-SB assessment 
at week 
78 of 
the Phase 
2a Main 
Trial showed 
a 48 
slowing in 
cognitive 
 decline from baseline relative to the placebo group; changes 
in ADAS-Cog measurements showed a 50 slowing in decline 
relative to 
 placebo and showed a 54 slowing in decline in ADCS-ADL relative to placebo. 
 UB-311 Phase 2a Suggests Slowing of 
Cognitive Decline in Mild Alzheimer s Subjects (mITT) 
 UB-311 Phase 2a secondary endpoint data suggested possible slowing of clinical decline by up to 50 in subjects with mild AD. These 
 are exploratory analyses, 
and no statistical inference was performed.

In addition, 
functional 
MRI suggested 
marginal 
increases in 
connectivity 
in some 
brain regions 
and 
PET imaging 
showed a 
modest 
 reduction 
in amyloid 
plaque burden 
as measured 
by standard 
uptake value 
ratio. 
We 
believe these 
clinical and 
biomarker 
endpoints 
 suggest a causal 
effect of UB-311 impacting the 
underlying molecular pathology of 
the disease and 
slowing of clinical 
decline. Together, 
 these findings offer some evidence that UB-311 
may exhibit disease-modifying effects. 

18 
 UB-311 Phase 2a Analysis of Clinical and 
Biomarker Endpoints Suggests Overall Disease-Modifying Effect 
 Compared to 
placebo, UB-311 
low-frequency dosing 
and high-frequency 
dosing demonstrated 
slowing of overall 
disease progression 
 in an independent analysis conducted by Pentara Corporation. 

 The Phase 
2a Main 
Trial 
recapitulated 
the safety 
and tolerability 
profile of 
UB-311 
that was 
observed in 
an earlier 
Phase 1 
trial. No 
 subjects 
discontinued trial 
participation due 
to a treatment 
emergent adverse 
effect TEAE ). 
No ARIA-E 
was observed 
in quarterly 
 MRI 
scans. 
A -related 
imaging 
abnormalities 
related 
to 
microhemorrhages 
or 
hemosiderosis 
seemed 
similar 
between 
the 
UB-311 
 treatment groups and placebo group. 
In the Phase 2a Main Trial, 
six serious adverse events were 
observed, including three in the Q6M 
 dosing arm and one in the Q3M dosing arm. None were deemed related or likely related 
to UB-311. 
 Titers generated by UB-311 ramped up gradually over the course of several months, as opposed to titers following the administration of 
 anti-A mAbs, which reach C
 max
 
very rapidly. 
We believe this led to the relatively low rates of ARIA-E observed in our clinical studies 
 of UB-311 as compared to those observed in 
clinical studies of mAbs. No meningoencephalitis was observed. 
 Summary of Safety Data from UB-311 
Phase 1 and Phase 2a Trials 
 As depicted in 
the table above, 
UB-311 was well tolerated 
across Phase 1 and 
Phase 2a trials. 
The most common 
TEAE was site 
injection 
 reactivity, 
and there were no 
discontinuations or withdrawals due to TEAEs 
 An 
extension 
of 
the 
Phase 
2a 
Main 
Trial, 
the 
Phase 
2a 
LTE 
trial, 
involved 
the 
continued 
participation 
by 
34 
of 
the 
subjects 
who 
 participated in 
the Phase 
2a Main 
Trial for 
an additional 
78 weeks. 
The objective 
of the Phase 
2a LTE 
trial was 
to assess 
the longer-
 term tolerability of extended treatment 
with UB-311. Following a 
non-treatment period of up to 26 
weeks, participants in the LTE 
trial 
 were segmented 
into two 
groups: those 
previously on 
drug in 
the Phase 
2a Main 
Trial would 
receive two 
placebo doses 
and a 
single 

19 
 300 g priming dose at the start of 
the LTE 
treatment period and those previously on placebo 
would receive three 300 g priming doses 
 over 
an 
initial 
12-week 
period. 
Due 
to 
an 
error 
by the 
CRO responsible 
for 
administering 
blinded 
placebo 
and 
active doses 
to 
trial 
 subjects, which reduced the confidence of subsequently collected data, we decided to discontinue the LTE 
trial, having determined that 
 we had collected sufficient data 
on UB-311 s tolerability and immunogenicity. Analysis of the data collected before 
trial discontinuation 
 indicated that 
UB-311 
was well 
tolerated, with 
return of 
anti-A antibody 
titers to 
peak levels 
achieved after 
a gap 
of as 
long as 
12 
 months between 
doses and 
a continued 
trend toward 
evidence of 
disease modification. 
In the 
Phase 2a 
LTE 
trial, six 
serious adverse 
 events were observed. One case of ARIA-E was observed in the Phase 2a LTE 
trial in a subject 10 weeks after receiving a dose of UB-
 311, 
which was 
clinically not 
significant according 
to the 
study investigator. 
No serious 
adverse event 
was deemed 
related or 
likely 
 related 
to 
UB-311, 
and 
all 
such 
events 
were 
recovered/resolved 
by 
the 
end 
of 
the 
study. 
Exploratory 
analyses 
of 
the 
clinical 
data 
 generated in this portion of the trial suggested that subjects in the treatment cohorts showed sustained improvement, as measured by the 
 change in CDR-SB from baseline. 
 We completed 
an open-label Phase 1 trial of UB-311 in 19 subjects with mild-to-moderate 
AD between the ages of 51 to 78 years. The 
 primary 
objective 
of the 
trial was 
to 
assess safety 
and 
tolerability. 
Secondary 
measures 
included 
UB-311 
antibody 
titers along 
with 
 changes in 
the ADAS-Cog, MMSE 
and the Alzheimer s 
Disease Cooperative 
Study-Clinician s 
Global Impression 
of Change disease 
 assessment ratings. 
The 24-week, open 
label trial was 
designed as three 
intramuscular injections of 
300 g, the first 
dose administered 
 at the start of the trial, a second at week four and a third at week 12. An observation 
study included additional follow-up visits up to 48 
 weeks after 
the first 
injection to 
assess the long 
-term immunogenicity 
and safety 
of UB-311. 
In this 
trial, UB-311 
was well tolerated, 
 with the most common TEAE being injection site redness 
and swelling. No TEAE resulted in the discontinuation 
or withdrawal of any 
 study participant in the trial. 
In the Phase 1 
trial, one serious adverse 
event was observed: a 
case of herpes zoster 
deemed unlikely related 
 to UB-311. 
 Anti-A 
antibody 
titers, 
recorded 
among 
all 
study 
participants, 
approached 
a 
100-fold 
increase 
during 
weeks 
16 
to 
48 
after 
 administration of the 
third 300 g 
injection at 
week 12, 
demonstrating the ability 
of UB-311 to 
elicit a 
strong immune response. 
Durability 
 of the response was reflected in elevated anti-A antibody titers measurable 
well beyond the 24-week duration of the trial. 
 In a Western blot assay, 
we observed that UB-311 elicited antibody titers specific to toxic forms of A with minimal binding to normal, 
 non-plaque-causing, forms of A . 
 Pre-Clinical Data 
 Pre-clinical trials of 
UB-311 included 
multiple antibody titer 
studies involving mice, 
guinea pigs, macaques 
and baboons. Application 
 of 
specific 
transgenic 
animal 
models 
was 
intended 
to 
emulate 
both 
therapeutic 
and 
preventive 
treatment 
paradigms. 
These 
trials 
 demonstrated that UB-311 generated high antibody titers across multiple species that 
selectively target aggregated A and both slow the 
 accumulation of and reduce existing A pathology. 
 We also observed 
the ability of UB-311 induced antibodies to 
penetrate the BBB, as well as preferentially bind to toxic A aggregates. 
 In our study of UB-311 in cynomolgus monkeys, we tested five escalating dose levels of UB-311: 0 g, 30 g, 100 g, 300 g and 900 g. 
 Each dose 
level was administered 
on weeks zero, 
three and six 
by intramuscular 
injection and the 
cerebrospinal fluid CSF ): serum 
 ratio of 
UB-311 
calculated on 
week eight 
(two weeks 
after the 
last dose). 
This analysis 
concluded 
that UB-311 
antibody titers 
were 
 detectable in the CSF in a dose-dependent manner with CSF: serum antibody ratios of 0.1 to 0.2 , ratios similar 
to published data for 
 mAbs in development for neurodegenerative diseases. 
 UB-311 Shows Dependent Response in CSF in 
Pre-Clinical Study 
 The above graphs 
demonstrates that UB-311 
induces enough 
antibodies for BBB 
penetration, across 
five dose levels 
in a pre 
-clinical 
 study with cynomolgus monkeys.

 Development Plans for UB-311 
 We have completed 
a pre-Phase 3 meeting with the FDA and obtained guidance on the further development of 
UB-311. 
 Subject to the 
FDA s 
review, we 
plan to conduct 
a randomized, double-blinded, 
placebo-controlled Phase 
2b efficacy trial 
of UB-311 
 in approximately 
900 subjects 
with early 
AD. The 
Phase 2b 
trial will 
include subjects 
diagnosed 
with early 
AD with 
MMSE scores 
 between 22 and 30. We will also screen to enrich 
for positive amyloid PET, positive tau PET and positive 
plasma p-tau181, in quantities 
 consistent with an early AD population. Subjects in the active arm will receive UB-311 as three 300 g priming 
doses at weeks 0, 4 and 
 12, followed by 
four 300 g booster 
doses every three 
months thereafter. 
The primary objective 
of this trial will 
be to assess 
the effect 
 of UB-311 
on the 
decline of 
cognitive 
and functional 
performance as 
measured by 
the CDR-SB 
over the 
78-week 
treatment period. 
 Secondary endpoints 
will include 
the changes 
from baseline 
measurements of 
other validated 
clinical outcomes 
scores. The 
effect of 
 UB-311 on specific AD biomarkers will also be evaluated, including neurofilament light arm NfL ), p-tau, total-tau, brain amyloid as 
 measured by PET, 
A -40 and A -42, hippocampal volume and whole brain volume 
as measured by MRI, and an assessment of certain 
 CSF biomarkers. 
We 
plan to 
collaborate the 
development of 
UB-311 
with a 
strategic partner 
and plan 
to initiate 
the Phase 
2b trial 
in 
 collaboration with such strategic partner. 
 Assuming positive 
results in the 
Phase 2b trial, 
we intend to 
initiate (with the 
same partner) a 
Phase 3 trial 
in subjects with 
early AD. 
 The Phase 3 program may involve one, but more likely two, clinical trials, 
conducted at multiple international sites. Assuming 
positive 
 results in the Phase 2b trial, we may also seek FDA approval under the accelerated approval pathway, which allows for earlier approval 
 of drugs that treat 
serious conditions, and that 
fill an unmet medical 
need based on a 
surrogate endpoint. If 
such Phase 2b trial 
and the 
 Phase 
3 
program 
are 
successful, 
they 
may 
together provide 
sufficient 
data 
to enable 
BLA filing 
with 
the FDA, 
but 
there 
can be 
no 
 guarantee that these trials 
will lead to positive data 
or that we will not need 
to conduct additional trials or 
studies prior to a BLA 
filing 
 with the FDA. 
 We believe UB-311 
could also have a potential therapeutic benefit in a prophylactic setting for the prevention of AD in at-risk subjects. 
 We may seek to 
further develop UB-311 for the prevention of AD.

 Parkinson s disease currently affects approximately one million people in the United 
States and more than 
10 million people worldwide. 
 The economic 
burden of PD 
is estimated at 
 52 billion in 
the United States 
alone. PD is 
a chronic 
and progressive neurodegenerative 
 disorder that 
affects predominately 
dopamine-producing dopaminergic 
neurons in the 
substantia nigra 
area of the 
brain. Although 
 the 
mechanisms 
responsible 
for 
the 
dopaminergic 
cell 
loss in 
PD 
are 
not 
fully 
elucidated, 
several 
lines 
of 
evidence 
suggest 
that 
 - 
 synuclein plays a central role in the neurodegenerative process. 
 Alpha-synuclein 
is 
a 
protein 
highly 
expressed 
in 
neurons, 
mostly 
at 
presynaptic 
terminals, 
suggesting 
a 
role 
in 
synaptic 
vesicle 
 trafficking, 
synaptic 
functions 
and 
in 
regulation 
of 
neurotransmitter 
release 
at 
the 
synapse. 
Duplications, 
point 
mutations 
or 
single 
 nucleotide polymorphisms in 
the gene encoding 
 -synuclein are known 
to cause 
or increase the 
risk of developing 
PD or 
LBD. Mutations 
 have been shown to 
primarily alter the secondary 
structure of -synuclein, resulting 
in misfolded and aggregated 
forms of -synuclein 
 (i.e., pathological forms). While 
mutations in the 
 -synuclein gene are rare, 
aggregates of -synuclein in 
the form of 
Lewy bodies LB 
 and Lewy neurites are 
common neuropathological hallmarks 
of both familial and 
sporadic PD, suggesting a 
key role of -synuclein 
in 
 PD 
neuropathogenesis. 
Moreover, 
preformed 
fibrils 
of 
 -synuclein 
can 
induce 
the 
formation 
of 
LB-like 
inclusions 
and 
cellular 
 dysfunction in cell-based 
assays as 
well as 
in pre-clinical animal 
models. Together, these data strongly 
suggest that targeting 
pathological 
 forms of -synuclein has therapeutic potential. 
 Limitations of Current Therapies 
 Most approved therapeutic 
products are aimed 
at compensating for 
the dopaminergic deficits 
and only provide 
symptomatic relief. While 
 existing products can indeed provide meaningful symptomatic relief, they often produce significant side effects and lose 
their beneficial 
 effects overtime. On the other hand, there are no currently approved 
disease-modifying therapeutics for PD. 
 Immunotherapy approaches 
targeting -synuclein 
have been shown 
to ameliorate 
 -synuclein pathology 
as well 
as functional 
deficits 
 in mouse models 
of PD and 
are now being investigated 
in the clinic. These 
include passive immunization 
therapy using humanized 
or 
 human anti- -synuclein mAbs or 
active immunization therapy aimed 
at inducing a humoral response 
against pathological -synuclein. 
 These approaches have thus far 
demonstrated good tolerability profiles in 
Phase 1 clinical trials. A Phase 2 
clinical trial in PD subjects 
 with prasinezumab, a 
mAb that 
preferentially recognizes oligomeric 
and fibrillar forms 
of -synuclein, suggested 
reduced motor function 
 decline in subjects as compared with placebo; however, this Phase 2 trial 
did not meet its primary or secondary endpoints. 
Further trials 
 of prasinezumab 
in different 
patient 
populations 
remain ongoing. 
Even if 
approved 
as therapeutic 
for PD, 
we expect 
prasinezumab 
 would be burdened by the general challenges of cost and administration. 

21 
 Our Product Candidate: UB-312 
 We are 
developing UB-312, an anti- -synuclein 
product candidate, as a treatment 
for PD and other synucleinopathies. 
We believe 
that 
 UB-312 has 
the potential 
to be 
established as 
a disease-modifying 
treatment modality 
for PD, 
and possibly 
for LBD 
and MSA. 
Pre-
 clinical data indicated that UB-312 elicits 
antibodies that preferentially recognize pathological forms 
of a-synuclein and improves motor 
 performance in 
mouse models 
of -synucleinopathies. 
Preliminary clinical 
data from 
our ongoing 
Phase 1 
trial indicate 
that UB-312 
 elicits antibody 
levels sufficient 
to cross 
the BBB (i.e., 
detectable in 
CSF). In 
2018, the 
European Medical 
Agency EMA 
granted 
 UB-312 orphan designation for MSA. 
 Clinical Development 
 We have completed 
Part A of a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-escalating, 
single- center Phase 1 clinical trial of 
 UB-312 in which 50 healthy volunteers between the ages of 40 and 
85 years received three intramuscular doses of either UB-312 or 
 placebo. During this 44-week Part A trial, subjects received three doses 
(on weeks 1, 5 and 13) with escalating doses ranging from 
 40 g to 2,000 g. Immunogenicity was evaluated by measuring changes 
in serum anti- -synuclein antibody concentrations during the 
 course of the study. 
Data from Part A indicated that UB-312 is generally well tolerated, with no significant safety 
findings. Data from 
 Part A also suggested that UB-312 is highly immunogenic, with all individuals 
in the 300 g/dose group showing detectable anti- -
 synuclein antibodies in both serum and CSF samples. CSF: serum ratios 
appeared similar to those observed in UB-311 
non-human 
 primate studies (approximately 0.2 ), and to those observed in clinical trials of 
mAbs. Based on these results, we are now evaluating 
 two dosing regimens of UB-312 in Part B of the Phase 1 trial: three doses of 300 g, 
and one dose of 300 g followed by two doses of 
 100 g. Part B, which began enrollment in January 2022, is evaluating 
UB-312 and placebo in 20 PD subjects. In addition to the 
 endpoints evaluated in Part A, an exploratory endpoint involving a clinical 
assessment using the Movement Disorder Society 
 Unified Parkinson s Disease Response 
Score will be used. 
 The Michael J. Fox Foundation MJFF is funding a 2-year collaborative project 
between Vaxxinity, 
the Mayo Clinic, and 
 University of Texas Houston 
using CSF collected from individuals enrolled in Part B of the Phase 1 trial of 
UB-312. 
This work is 
 evaluating the potential of protein misfolding cyclic amplification PMCA to 
assess target engagement and will also aim to 
 characterize the anti- -synuclein antibodies produced after immunization 
with UB-312. Demonstrating whether pathological forms of 
 -synuclein are detectable in the CSF of PD subjects, and whether UB-312 
-derived antibodies alter CSF levels of -synuclein seeds 
 measured by PMCA, might provide a meaningful surrogate marker of 
target engagement. 

 UB-312 Demonstrated Dose-Dependent Response in Phase 1 Part A Trial 
Including Penetration of Titers into CSF 
 Across 
four cohorts, 
UB-312 demonstrated 
a dose-dependent 
immunogenic 
response. 
Antibodies generated 
by UB-312 
were 
readily 
 detectable in CSF, 
indicating BBB penetration with a CSF: serum ratio of approximately 
0.2 . 
 We paused dosing in high dose cohorts in Part A 
of the trial after one 
subject developed an adverse effect AE of special 
interest (i.e., 
 Grade 3 flu-like symptoms) shortly after 
receiving the second 1000 g dose of 
UB-312. Although this AE was 
transient and not a serious 
 adverse event SAE ), 
data collected until 
that point suggested 
that the 100 g 
and 300 g dose levels 
were well tolerated 
and yielded 
 relatively high anti- - synuclein titers. During the evaluation of the AE, the COVID-19 pandemic was becoming increasingly pervasive 
 throughout Europe, increasing 
the risk to healthy 
volunteers participating in 
the trial. We 
therefore did not resume 
dose escalation and 
 selected 100 g and 300 g doses for Part B in PD subjects. 
 An end-of-treatment analysis of the ongoing Part B of 
the Phase 1 trial in PD 
patients was completed in the fourth quarter of 2022. 
This 
 analysis has shown UB-312 
to be well tolerated and immunogenic, 
with anti- -synuclein antibodies observed 
in the serum and CSF of 
 PD patients. 
Three 
serious adverse 
events were 
observed 
in Part 
B, which 
remains 
blinded, 
meaning 
it remains 
unknown 
in which 
 treatment group they occurred (UB-312 or placebo). 

22 
 Pre-Clinical Data 
 We 
have 
conducted 
pre-clinical 
studies 
of 
UB-312 
across 
multiple 
animal 
species, 
including 
mice 
and 
guinea 
pigs. 
These 
trials 
 demonstrated 
that our 
product candidates, 
including UB-312, 
generated high 
antibody titers 
to -synuclein 
across animal 
species. In 
 addition, in vitro 
studies provided evidence 
that anti- -synuclein antibodies 
produced after UB-312 
immunization are highly 
selective 
 to pathological -synuclein, and do not bind to normal -synuclein. 
 UB-312 Demonstrates Selective Binding Towards 
 -Synuclein Fibrils and Ribbons 
 This in vitro slot blot analysis of sera 
from guinea pigs dosed with UB-312 
demonstrates that antibodies induced by UB-312 bind to 
 -
 synuclein fibrils 
and ribbons, 
the toxic 
forms of 
 -synuclein believed 
to underlie 
PD, more 
strongly 
than they 
bind to 
monomers, the 
 normal form of -synuclein 
in the body. 
We 
believe this preference 
will allow UB-312 antibodies 
to avoid altering normal functions 
of 
 -synuclein and selectively neutralize the toxic species 
 (Nimmo et al., Alzheimers Res Ther. 
2020;12:159).
 Anti- -synuclein 
antibodies 
produced 
by 
UB-312 
immunization 
specifically 
bind 
pathogenic 
species 
of 
 -synuclein, 
including 
 aggregated fibrils, 
oligomers and 
ribbons, while 
demonstrating low 
affinity for 
the monomer. 
This species 
selectivity contrasted 
with 
 Syn-1, a commercial research mAb used as a control, which failed to differentiate 
the toxic variants. 
 In an in vivo study of UB-312 using a transgenic mouse model of PD, we demonstrated prevention of motor deficits in treated animals, 
 which was associated 
with significant reduction 
of brain oligomeric 
forms of - 
synuclein. We 
believe this data 
supports the potential 
 of UB-312 to prevent behavioral motor deficits and reduce toxic forms of 
 -synuclein. 
 UB-312 Demonstrates Improvement in Motor Symptoms in Pre-Clinical 
Study 
 UB-312 
immunization 
in 
a 
transgenic 
mouse 
model -synuclein 
overexpression) 
demonstrates 
improvement 
in 
beam 
test 
and 
wire 
 hanging test, and reductions in -synuclein oligomers 
in various brain regions (Nimmo et al., Acta 
Neuropathol. 2022;143:55-73). 

23 
 We 
have also observed 
by immunohistochemistry 
that serum antibodies 
from guinea 
pigs dosed with 
UB-312 can 
bind to aberrant 
 -
 synuclein in PD, LBD and MSA brain sections. 
 Finally, 
antibodies 
derived 
from 
UB-312 
showed 
no 
off-target 
binding 
on 
human 
tissue 
sections. 
UB-312-treated 
transgenic 
mice 
 showed no signs of neuroinflammation, 
and GLP toxicity studies in rats indicated a 
good non-clinical safety and tolerability profile. We 
 believe 
our 
preclinical 
data 
suggest 
that 
UB-312 
may 
potentially 
induce 
a 
well-tolerated, 
strong 
and 
specific 
IgG 
response 
against 
 pathological forms of 
 a-synuclein 
 in PD subjects. 
 Development Strategy 
 While certain portions of this Phase 1 
trial were interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, Part 
A in 50 healthy volunteers was 
completed 
 in 2020, and we began dosing 
PD subjects in Part B in 
early 2022. In Part B 
we have included exploratory endpoints potentially relevant 
 to PD, such 
as total and 
free -synuclein 
in serum and 
CSF, 
in addition to 
T-cell 
ELISpot analyses and 
antibody characterization. 
We 
 expect to complete Part B in mid-2023. 
 Other Neurodegeneration Programs 
 We are 
actively engaged in additional 
initiatives related to neurodegenerative 
disorders. One of these programs 
focuses specifically on 
 tau-protein pathology and 
its involvement in 
diseases such 
as AD 
and related tauopathies. 
We believe that targeting different 
pathological 
 tau variants simultaneously 
may enhance treatment 
efficacy, 
which will most 
likely require targeting 
multiple epitopes concomitantly. 
 Using 
our 
Vaxxine 
Platform, 
we 
have 
constructed 
multi-epitope 
product 
candidates 
that 
have 
successfully 
demonstrated 
 immunogenicity and in vitro activity in various models. 
 We 
are also investigating 
the use of a 
multi-target of product 
candidates targeting 
A , -synuclein, and 
tau, as multiple proteins 
could 
 be implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. 
 Next Wave Chronic Disease 
Treatments 
 Pathological 
endogenous 
proteins self-proteins 
drive 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
chronic 
diseases. 
While 
mAbs 
and 
small 
molecules 
have 
 provided 
therapeutic 
benefits in 
the treatment 
of these 
diseases, inherent 
limitations of 
these drug 
classes have 
restricted 
access and 
 adherence to these treatment modalities globally. 
 Our next 
wave chronic 
disease program 
is initially 
focused on 
migraine and 
hypercholesterolemia. Monoclonal 
antibodies have 
been 
 approved in both therapeutic areas; however, 
their high costs have limited access and generally limited use to relatively 
severe disease. 
 We aim to develop 
product candidates in these therapeutic areas that could offer 
similar efficacy as mAbs at a meaningfully lower 
cost 
 and 
improved 
administrative 
convenience 
to 
patients, 
thereby 
potentially 
allowing 
for 
access 
to 
broader 
patient 
populations 
versus 
 mAbs, and greater efficacy than small molecules. 
 UB-313 
 An Overview of Migraine 
 Migraine 
is 
a 
chronic 
and 
debilitating 
disorder 
characterized 
by 
recurrent 
attacks 
lasting 
four 
to 
72 
hours 
with 
multiple 
symptoms, 
 including 
typically one 
-sided, pulsating 
headaches 
of moderate 
to severe 
pain 
intensity 
that are 
associated with 
nausea 
or vomiting, 
 sensitivity to sound 
and sensitivity 
to light. Over 
90 of the 
patients are unable 
to function 
normally during 
a migraine attack. 
Many 
 experience comorbid conditions such as depression, anxiety and insomnia. 
 The Migraine Research Foundation ranks migraine 
as the world s third most prevalent illness. 
The disease affects 39 million individuals 
 in the 
United States 
and approximately 
one billion individuals 
globally. 
Patients generally 
suffer from 
chronic or 
episodic migraines. 
 Chronic migraine is defined as 15 headache days or more 
per month, while episodic migraine is defined as fewer than 15 
headache days 
 per month. Both acute and prophylactic treatments are used to address 
chronic and episodic migraines. 
 CGRP s 
Role in Migraine 
 CGRP 
is 
a 
neuropeptide 
found 
throughout 
the 
body, 
including 
in 
the 
spinal 
cord. 
CGRP 
activates 
CGRP 
receptor 
in 
the 
 trigeminovascular system, which is located within pain-signaling pathways, intracranial arteries and mast cells. 
Activation of the CGRP 
 receptor has been demonstrated to induce migraine in migraineurs. Multiple anti-CGRP therapies have been approved for the treatment 
 of migraine. 

24 
 Limitations of Current Therapies 
 Since the early 1990s, there has been minimal 
improvement in the standard treatment for migraine. Treatments are characterized as elite 
 acute or 
prophylactic. Triptans 
are the 
current first-line 
prescription therapy 
for the 
acute treatment 
of migraine, 
with over 
15 million 
 annual prescriptions written in the United States. 
 Prophylactic medications approved for 
migraine include beta 
blockers, such as 
propranolol, topiramate, sodium valproate and 
botulinum 
 toxin, 
branded 
as 
Botox. 
However, 
many 
of 
these 
medications 
provide 
limited 
clinical 
benefit. 
In 
addition, 
they 
are 
often 
not 
well 
 tolerated, with AEs such as cognitive impairment, nausea, fatigue and sleep disturbance. 
 Therapeutics targeting 
the CGRP pathway 
represent an 
emerging treatment 
paradigm. Three 
anti-CGRP mAbs 
were approved 
by the 
 FDA in 2018 
for the prophylactic 
treatment of migraine in 
adults. These mAbs, 
erenumab-aooe (Aimovig), fremanezumab-vfrm (Ajovy) 
 and 
galcanezumab-gnlm 
(Emgality), 
are 
all 
administered 
subcutaneously. 
Their 
side 
effects 
are 
generally 
mild, 
including 
pain 
and 
 redness at the 
site of injection, 
nasal congestion 
and constipation. 
Studies show that 
these mAbs 
reduce the 
number of headache 
days 
 by 50 or more in approximately 50 of patients. Sales for marketed 
and clinical-stage anti-CGRP therapeutics are projected to reach 
 approximately 7.4 billion by 2026. Despite the 
commercial success that this class represents, 
many of these treatments require frequent 
 administration, creating inconvenience for patients. 
 Our Product Candidate: UB-313 
 We are 
developing UB-313 as a prophylactic 
treatment initially for chronic migraine. 
We believe 
UB-313 has the potential to improve 
 upon the current treatments for 
chronic migraine in multiple aspects: 
we expect UB-313 will 
require administration quarterly to annually 
 in 
contrast 
to 
monthly 
to 
quarterly 
for 
currently 
marketed 
mAbs 
and 
frequent 
administration 
for 
small 
molecules. 
Furthermore, 
a 
 potential long durability of 
response may offer physicians 
and patients the option to 
administer UB-313 in an 
office setting, which can 
 potentially improve adherence. We 
expect the cost of UB-313 treatment, if approved, to be lower than that of 
mAbs for migraine. 
 Pre-Clinical Studies 
 We 
have completed 
both in 
vitro and 
in vivo 
pre-clinical studies 
of UB-313. 
We 
used an 
in vivo 
proof-of-concept capsaicin-induced 
 dermal blood flow model in mice to demonstrate target engagement of the marketed CGRP-targeting mAbs. In this model, we 
observed 
 similar rates in reduction of dermal blood flow as fremanezumab in 
a head-to-head comparison against fremanezumab.

 25 
 Our 
 in vivo
 
studies of 
UB-313 have 
involved multiple 
animal species. 
High immunogenicity 
was observed 
in all 
pre-clinical species 
 tested. Characterization of 
the antibodies produced 
after immunization with UB-313 
indicated that they have 
limited, if any, 
off-target 
 potential, are 
primarily IgG1 and 
IgG2, potently bind 
to CGRP and 
potently block 
CGRP activity 
 in vitro
 . We 
refer to 
potency as 
the 
 amount 
of 
drug 
required 
to 
produce 
a 
pharmacological 
effect 
of 
given 
intensity 
and 
is 
not 
a 
measure 
of 
therapeutic 
efficacy. 
In 
a 
 comparison 
of 
binding 
affinities 
with 
fremanezumab 
and 
galcanezumab, 
UB-313-induced 
IgG 
antibodies 
demonstrated 
comparable 
 binding affinities. 
 UB-313 Demonstrated Induced Antibodies Comparable to Approved 
CGRP mAbs 
 We evaluated UB-313 formulations with two different adjuvants in comparison to fremanezumab and galcanezumab; both formulations 
 demonstrated comparable IgG to these two approved CGRP mAbs. 
 Additional 
 in vitro
 
studies using human SK-N-MC cells 
demonstrated that UB-313-induced IgG antibodies also 
had comparable 
 in vitro
 activity to CGRP-targeted mAbs. 
 UB-313 Induced IgGs Have Comparable In Vitro 
Activities to Marketed CGRP mAbs 
 In a cyclic 
AMP cAMP production 
assay conducted in 
human SK-N-MC cells, 
antibodies taken 
from the 
serum of guinea 
pigs 15 
 weeks following the first injection of UB-313 demonstrated similar proper 
ties to two approved CGRP mAbs. 
 Moreover, the binding potency of 
UB-313 was determined to be comparable to these mAbs.

 UB-313 Induced IgGs Demonstrate Comparable Binding Potencies to Marketed 
CGRP mAbs 
 Antibodies taken from the serum of guinea pigs 15 weeks 
following the first injection of UB-313 demonstrated similar 
binding potencies 
 to two approved CGRP mAbs as measured 
by ELISA. 
 Development Strategy 
 A single-site, 
randomized, placebo-controlled, 
first-in-human Phase 
1 clinical 
trial is 
underway in 
40 healthy 
volunteers, designed 
to 
 measure the 
safety, 
tolerability, 
and immunogenicity 
of multiple priming 
dose regimens of 
UB-313, was 
initiated in September 
2022. 

 The study 
is also 
measuring dermal 
blood flow 
following a 
capsaicin 
challenge at 
multiple timepoints, 
a well-established 
model for 
 CGRP 
target 
engagement 
and efficacy 
in 
the preventive 
treatment 
of 
migraine. 
The 
trial is 
fully 
enrolled, 
and 
we 
expect a 
topline 
 readout in the first half of 2023. 
 VXX-401 
 An Overview of Hypercholesterolemia 
 Hypercholesterolemia is the presence 
of high levels 
of cholesterol in 
the blood and 
typically results from 
a combination of 
environmental 
 and genetic 
factors. Cholesterol 
is transported 
in the 
blood plasma 
within particles 
called lipoproteins. 
Lipoproteins are 
classified by 
 their density: very 
low-density lipoprotein, intermediate 
density lipoprotein, LDL 
and high-density 
lipoprotein HDL ). All 
lipoproteins 
 carry 
cholesterol, 
but 
elevated 
levels 
of 
lipoproteins 
other 
than 
HDL, 
particularly 
LDL, 
are 
associated 
with 
the 
development 
of 
 cardiovascular 
disease. 
Approximately 
2 billion 
people 
worldwide 
have 
elevated 
levels 
of LDL, 
potentially 
putting 
them at 
risk 
for 
 cardiovascular disease. 
 Although hypercholesterolemia itself is asymptomatic, elevation of serum 
cholesterol can over time lead to atherosclerosis. Over many 
 years, elevated 
serum cholesterol 
contributes to 
formation of 
atheromatous plaques 
in the 
arteries. These 
plaque deposits 
can in 
turn 
 lead to progressive narrowing of the involved arteries. Smaller plaques may rupture and cause a clot to form and obstruct blood flow. A 
 sudden blockage of a coronary artery may result in a heart attack. 
A blockage of an artery supplying the brain can cause a stroke. If 
the 
 development 
of 
the 
stenosis 
or 
occlusion 
is 
gradual, 
blood 
supply 
to 
the 
tissues 
and 
organs 
slowly 
diminishes 
until 
organ 
function 
 becomes impaired. 
 PCSK9 is mainly expressed in the liver and, to a lesser extent, in the small intestine, kidney, 
pancreas and the CNS. The LDL receptors 
 LDLR at 
the cell 
surface bind 
and initiate 
ingestion of 
LDL particles 
from extracellular 
fluid into 
cells, leading 
to a 
reduction in 
 serum LDL 
levels. PCSK9 
protein plays 
a major 
regulatory role 
in cholesterol 
homeostasis, mainly 
by reducing 
LDLR levels 
on the 
 plasma membrane, 
which leads 
to decreased 
metabolism of 
LDL by 
the cells. 
Inhibition of 
PCSK9 prevents 
this reduction 
in LDLR 
 levels on the plasma membrane, and in consequence the cellular process of 
internalizing LDL particles, resulting in a reduction of LDL. 
 Limitations of Current Therapies 
 Statins are the most 
commonly used drugs to treat 
hypercholesterolemia and result in a 
pronounced reduction in LDL. The 
unambiguous 
 benefits of 
statins, together 
with the 
prevalence of 
coronary heart 
disease, have 
made statins 
the most 
highly prescribed 
drug class 
in 
 developed countries. 
However, 
many patients 
are unable 
to achieve 
targeted 
lipid levels 
despite intensive 
statin therapy. 
In addition, 
 continued patient adherence to statin 
therapy, 
which is necessary to maintain 
a lower risk for cardiac 
events, is variable but considered 
 to be low as low as 30 to 40 after two years in persons following a myocardial infarction. Importantly, at the transcriptional level, 

27 
 statins 
up-regulate 
not 
only 
LDLR, 
but 
also 
PCSK9, 
causing 
the 
so-called 
paradox 
of 
statin 
treatment. 
Although 
statins 
induce 
a 
 beneficial increase in LDLR, they also increase PCSK9, thus leading to LDLR degradation, which indirectly increases LDL, mitigating 
 the overall LDL reduction that 
statins otherwise cause. Given the 
limitations in efficacy and adherence, targeting PCSK9 
in combination 
 with statins treatment is an emerging treatment paradigm 
for hypercholesterolemia. 
 Two 
mAbs 
that 
inhibit 
activity 
have 
received 
FDA 
approval, 
alirocumab 
(Praluent) 
and 
evolocumab 
(Repatha). 
These 
drugs 
were 
 initially approved 
to treat 
the genetic 
condition 
heterozygous familial 
hypercholesterolemia, 
although 
the approved 
indications 
were 
 expanded 
after 
the 
publication 
of 
studies 
demonstrating 
that the 
use 
of 
a 
PCSK9 inhibitor 
in 
conjunction 
with 
a 
statin 
significantly 
 reduced the risk for major cardiovascular 
events, including heart attack, stroke, unstable 
angina requiring hospitalization or death 
from 
 coronary heart disease. In addition, inclisiran (Leqvio), an siRNA inhibitor of PCSK9 synthesis, was 
approved by the EMA in late 2020 
 for the treatment of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in addition 
to other dyslipidemia. 
 While alirocumab and evolucumab 
have demonstrated clinical benefit, 
their commercial potential has 
been limited by their 
pricing. Both 
 launched 
with 
a 
wholesale 
acquisition 
price 
exceeding 
 14,000 
annually, 
but 
prices 
for 
both 
were 
subsequently 
reduced 
in 
2018. 
 Nevertheless, this drug class generated sales 
of approximately 1.3 billion in 2020 
and is expected to 
grow to approximately 5.2 billion 
 by 2026, including the addition of inclisiran to the 
market. In addition, both are administered bi-weekly (evolocumab also allows 
for the 
 option of taking 
a higher dose 
monthly), which 
represents what we 
believe to be 
a frequent and 
inconvenient administration 
schedule 
 for patients. 
While inclisiran 
represents an 
improved administration 
schedule compared 
to alirocumab 
and evolucumab, 
as it must 
be 
 administered twice annually, 
we believe that it may encounter similar pricing challenges due to the published 
cost effectiveness price. 
 Our Product Candidate: VXX-401 
 We are developing VXX-401, an anti-PCSK9 
product candidate to treat 
hypercholesterolemia. We are dedicated to developing a 
product 
 candidate that has long-acting treatment duration, which we believe will offer a more convenient treatment regimen compared to the up 
 to 
bi-weekly 
dosing 
required 
by 
some 
mAbs. 
We 
believe 
that 
lower 
manufacturing 
costs 
commensurate 
with 
the 
requirement 
of 
 meaningfully less drug 
substance relative to 
mAbs, coupled with 
our ability to 
achieve commercial scale 
production rapidly may 
promote 
 expanded 
use 
of this 
drug 
class as 
a 
first-line 
therapy, 
allowing 
for 
treating 
a greater 
number 
of hypercholesterolemia 
patients 
than 
 currently treated with mAbs. 
 Pre-Clinical Studies 
 In August 2022 we announced 
the selection of VXX-401 
as our lead anti-PCSK9 vaccine candidate. 
In pre-clinical studies, VXX-401 
 generated therapeutic 
titer levels 
of anti-PCSK9 
antibodies, a 
high response 
rate among 
dosed animals, 
and robust 
reduction in 
LDL 
 across multiple species. 
 In two studies 
of VXX-401 in 
cynomolgus monkeys, 
VXX-401 reduced LDL-c 
by up to 54 , 
an effect sustained 
for a long 
duration. 

 In the first study, 3 monkeys received six 300 g IM injections of VXX-401, 
and 6 monkeys started on placebo with the same schedule. 

 At week 19 (final dose), 
3 of the 6 placebo 
monkeys were given 3mg/kg 
evolocumab to determine the 
comparability of the magnitude 
 of LDL reduction with 
VXX-401. 
LDL in monkeys treated 
with evolocumab reduced 
to approximately the level 
of those treated with 
 VXX-401, then returned to near-baseline, while LDL levels in 
the VXX-401-treated group remained low. 
 VXX-401 Reduces LDL up to 54 vs. Placebo, Comparable to a 
Single Dose of an Approved MAb 
 The 
VXX-401 
group 
(n=3) 
received 
a 
non-optimized 
vaccine 
formulation 
containing 
the 
same 
peptide 
immunogen 
as 
the 
VXX-401 
 clinical vaccine 
candidate and 
experienced up 
to a 54 
reduction in 
serum LDL-c from 
baseline. 
The placebo 
and VXX-401 groups 
 received IM injections at weeks 0, 3, 6, 13, 16, and 19. 
The evolocumab group received 
placebo IM injections at weeks 0, 3, 6, 13, and 
 16, and a dose of evolocumab at week 19. 

28 
 In the second study we explored a range of doses in 15 cynomolgus monkeys, which received either 0, 10, 30, 
100, 300, or 900 g/dose 
 by 0.5mL IM injection at weeks 
0, 3, and 6, with follow-up 
through week 24. 
In this study we found that 
three doses of VXX-401 could 
 product a sustained 
reduction of serum 
LDL, returning to near-baseline 
after 24 weeks. 
Furthermore, animals received 
a booster dose 
 of VXX-401 at week 24, which triggered a rapid anti-PCSK9 antibody response 
and a corresponding reduction in serum LDL. 
 Reduction in LDL Correlates with Anti-PCSK9 Antibodies Elicited by 
VXX-401 
 The left-hand panel shows the generation of serum anti-PCSK9 antibody 
titers in cynomolgus monkeys treated with 100 g VXX-401 
 at weeks 0, 3, 6, and 24 as measured by EIA. 
These levels correlate with serum LDL level over time, as 
depicted in the right-hand 
 panel, represented 
as a difference from controls. 
An adjuvant control group 
(n=3, not shown), was also included in the study; 
 animals in the adjuvant group did not produce 
an anti-PCSK9 antibody response, similar to the 
PBS control group. 
 A GLP toxicology study was completed in monkeys, which demonstrated 
that 5 doses of VXX-401 were safe and well tolerated, with 
 no clinical observations and no pathological findings. 
Importantly, we found that LDL 
reduction in VXX-401-treated monkeys in this 
 study was consistent with observations from preclinical efficacy 
studies, and supportive of moving VXX-401 into clinical trials.

Development Strategy 
 We 
have initiated 
a first-in-human 
Phase 1 
clinical trial 
of VXX-401 
in Australia 
in the 
first quarter 
of 2023. 
In this 
trial we 
aim to 
 evaluate 48 
subjects with 
elevated cholesterol, 
monitoring for 
safety, 
immunogenicity, 
and relevant 
biomarkers. 
We 
expect a 
topline 
 readout by early 2024. 
In a potential subsequent Phase 2 trial we may test VXX-401 alone and in combination 
with statins. 
 Next Stage Development Candidates 
 In addition to our 
initial focus on 
migraines and hypercholesterolemia, we 
believe our Vaxxine Platform can generate product 
candidates 
 for a range of chronic diseases. We 
are evaluating opportunities across multiple disease areas, including allergy 
(e.g., atopic dermatitis, 
 chronic 
rhinosinusitis, 
food 
allergy), 
autoimmune 
(e.g., 
psoriasis, 
psoriatic 
arthritis), 
pain 
(e.g., 
peripheral 
neuropathy, 
diabetic 
 neuropathy) and 
bone and muscle 
deterioration (e.g., 
sarcopenia, osteoporosis, 
osteopenia) indications 
as they may 
apply to geriatrics 
 and space travel health. 
 COVID-19 Program 
 An Overview of COVID-19 
 COVID-19, 
caused 
by 
SARS-CoV-2, 
has 
rapidly 
swept 
throughout 
the 
world. 
The 
World 
Health 
Organization WHO 
declared 
 COVID-19 a public health 
emergency of international 
concern. As of January 2023, 
there have been more 
than 694 million confirmed 
 COVID-19 cases and 
more than 
6.7 million deaths 
worldwide. Common 
symptoms of 
COVID-19 are 
fever, 
cough, lymphocytopenia 
 and 
chest 
radiographic 
abnormality. 
A 
proportion 
of 
patients 
recovering 
from 
COVID-19 
continue 
shedding 
virus 
for 
days, 
and 
 asymptomatic carriers may also transmit SARS-CoV-2, 
indicating a risk of a continuous and long-term pandemic. 
 SARS-CoV-2 
is an 
enveloped, 
single-stranded, 
positive-sense 
RNA virus 
belonging 
to 
the family 
 Coronavidae
 
within the 
genus 
 -
 coronavirus. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 
encodes one large Spike S protein that plays a pivotal role during viral attachment to the 
 host receptor, 
angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ACE2 ), 
and entry into host cells. The 
S protein is the major 
principal antigen target 
 for 
vaccines 
against 
human 
coronavirus, 
including 
SARS-Co-V-2. 
Neutralizing 
antibodies 
targeting 
the 
receptor 
binding 
domain 
 RBD subunit of 
the S protein 
block the virus 
from binding to 
host cells. Over 
90 of all 
neutralizing antibodies produced in 
response 
 to infection are directed to the RBD subunit, and mAbs that have shown 
therapeutic activity target epitopes on the RBD. 

29 
 Fifty vaccines are authorized for use in one or more 
countries around the world. Most of these vaccines are based on 
the S protein of the 
 SARS-CoV-2, 
but 
rely 
on 
different 
mechanisms 
for 
presentation 
or 
expression 
of 
the 
S 
antigen, 
including 
whole 
inactivated 
virus, 
 defective adenovirus 
vectors, or 
mRNA. All 
have been 
shown to 
be safe 
and effective 
in placebo- 
controlled clinical 
trials. Antiviral 
 drugs and mAbs have limited availability and effectiveness. 
 COVID-19 Vaccine 
Market 
 As of January 2023, over five billion people have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. 
Nearly all of these people received at least 
 one of three 
types of vaccine 
technologies: mRNA, adenovirus 
vector, or 
inactivated virus. 
As SARS-CoV-2 
continues to evolve 
and 
 spread, the market for booster vaccinations has also grown, with over 2.6 
billion doses sold to date. 
 We expect demand 
for booster vaccinations that are safe and well tolerated, offer long 
lasting immunity against emerging variants, and 
 allow 
for 
manageable 
storage 
and 
shipping 
conditions 
will 
last 
for 
the 
foreseeable 
future, 
particularly 
in 
low- 
and 
middle-income 
 countries LMICs ). 
We 
also 
anticipate 
demand 
for 
more 
types 
of 
vaccine 
technologies, 
beyond 
the 
readily 
available 
mRNA, 
 adenovirus vector, and inactivated virus vaccine 
options. 
 UB-612: Our COVID-19 Vaccine 
Initiative 
 We are developing 
UB-612 as a product candidate for boosting immunity 
to COVID-19 in vaccinated individuals. UB-612 is designed 
 to activate both antibody 
and cellular immunity against 
multiple viral targets. 
The vaccine is composed 
of a recombinant S1-RBD-sFc 
 fusion 
protein combined 
with rationally 
designed synthetic 
Th and 
CTL epitope 
peptides selected 
from 
the S2 
domain of 
the spike, 
 membrane M ), and 
nucleocapsid N proteins. 
These peptides 
bind to 
MHC class 
I and 
II receptors 
without significant 
genetic 
 restriction, so 
that they may 
be recognized broadly 
by the vast 
majority of the 
human population. Our 
mixture of peptides 
is designed 
 to elicit 
T-cell 
activation, memory 
recall and 
effector functions 
similar to 
those of 
natural SARS-CoV-2 
infection. The 
S1-RBD-sFc 
 fusion protein incorporates 
essential B-cell epitopes 
that promote the generation 
of neutralizing antibodies to 
the RBD of SARS-CoV-
 2. UB-612 
is formulated 
with Adju-Phos, 
an adjuvant 
widely used 
in many 
approved vaccines 
globally. 
For added 
safety, 
synthetic 
 peptides in UB-612 are 
adsorbed by our propriety 
CpG1 excipient, a Toll 
-like receptor 9 agonist 
molecule, known to help 
to stimulate 
 balanced T-cell immunity in humans. 
UB-612 can be 
stored and shipped 
at 2 
to 8 C 
(conventional cold chain refrigerated 
temperatures). 
 An EUA application for UB-612 was 
denied by the TFDA in 
August 2021 because the neutralizing antibody response 
generated by UB-
 612 
delivered 
in 
an 
accelerated 
two-dose 
primary 
immunization 
schedule, 
as 
compared 
to 
that 
of 
a 
designated 
adenovirus 
vectored 
 vaccine, 
did 
not 
meet 
the 
TFDA s 
specified 
evaluation 
criteria. 
We 
are 
now 
pursuing 
a 
path 
to 
authorization 
for 
UB-612 
as 
a 
 heterologous boost and have agreement with two high-income country regulators 
about our development approach. 
 Components of the UB-612 Multitope Vaccine 
Product Candidate 
 UB-612 s 
construct contains an S1-RBD-sFc fusion protein for its B-cell epitopes, plus five synthetic Th/CTL peptides for class I and II 
 MHC molecules 
derived from 
SARS-CoV-2 
S2, M 
and N 
proteins, 
and the 
UBITh1a peptide. 
These components 
are 
formulated with 
 CpG1, which binds the positively charged peptides by dipolar interactions and also serves as an adjuvant, which is then bound to Adju-
 Phos adjuvant to constitute the UB-612 product 
candidate. 
 Clinical Development 
 In March 2022, 
Vaxxinity 
initiated a Phase 3 
pivotal trial to compare 
the immune responses stimulated 
by homologous boosts 
mRNA 
 (BNT162b2), adenovirus (ChAdOx1-S), inactivated virus (Sinopharm 
BIBP) COVID-19 vaccines, to a heterologous boost of UB-612. 
 This is an active-controlled, 
randomized trial being conducted in 
the United States, Panama, and 
Philippines under a platform protocol 
 in 
944 
subjects 
16 
years 
and 
older 
who 
completed 
a 
two-dose 
primary 
immunization 
with 
one 
or 
more 
of 
the 
comparator 
vaccines 
 mentioned above. Eligible subjects 
have been randomized into one 
of two treatment arms 
to receive a single 
dose of UB-612 or 
an active 
 comparator. 
The primary 
objective of 
the study 
is to 
determine 
non-inferiority 
of UB-612-stimulated 
neutralizing 
antibodies against 
 those of the comparator vaccines. 
CEPI is co-funding this trial, which is expected to conclude in the second half of 2023. 

30 
 Following 
positive 
topline 
results 
announced 
in 
December 
2022, 
we 
have 
completed 
submissions 
for 
conditional/provisional 
 authorization 
with 
the 
Medicines 
and 
Healthcare 
products 
Regulatory 
Agency MHRA 
in 
the 
UK, 
and 
the 
Therapeutic 
Goods 
 Administration TGA 
in 
Australia 
in 
March 
2023. 
We 
expect 
that, 
if 
successful, 
these 
authorizations 
may 
enable 
the 
 commercialization of UB-612 in multiple countries including select 
LMICs. 
 Heterologous Booster Data: Phase 3 Trial 
Topline 
Results
 In the ongoing global pivotal Phase 
3 trial, UB-612 elicited strong 
neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 
when compared head-
 to-head 
to three 
globally 
authorized 
platform 
vaccines 
administered 
as homologous 
boosters, 
successfully 
meeting 
primary 
and 
key 
 secondary immunogenicity endpoints 
at topline readout. 
The primary endpoints 
of the trial 
are safety and 
live virus 
neutralizing antibody 
 titers against 
the Wuhan 
strain of 
SARS-CoV-2 
at day 
29. 
Secondary immunogenicity 
endpoints include 
neutralizing antibody 
titers 
 against Omicron 
BA.5 at 
day 29, 
SCRs at 
day 29, 
and kinetics 
of neutralizing 
and RBD 
binding IgG 
antibody responses 
through 12 
 months. 
The primary objective of the 
study is to determine non-inferiority 
of UB-612-stimulated neutralizing 
antibodies against those 
 of the comparator vaccines, where statistical non-inferiority is defined by the lower bound 
of the 95 confidence interval CI of the 
 geometric mean titer ratio GMR 
> 0.67. 
When delivered as a 
heterologous booster in populations previously 
vaccinated with Pfizer-
 BioNTech s 
BNT162b2, AstraZeneca s ChAdOx1-S, or Sinopharm s BIBP, 
UB-612 was shown to generate 
neutralizing antibody titers 
 28 days after administration that were: 
 
 Statistically 
non-inferior 
to, 
and 
directionally 
higher 
than, 
BNT162b2: 
1.04 
GMR 
against 
Wuhan 
(95 
CI: 
0.89, 
1.21; 
 p=0.6147), 1.11 GMR against Omicron 
BA.5 (95 CI: 0.94, 1.31; p=0.2171) 
 
 Statistically superior 
to ChAdOx1-S: 
1.92-fold higher 
geometric mean 
titers against 
Wuhan 
with UB-612 
(GMR=1.92; 95 
 CI: 1.44, 2.56; p -10 . 
SCR superiority was defined by the lower bound of the 95 CI 
 for the difference 
of the UB-612 
SCR minus the 
comparator SCR > 
0 . 
UB-612 SCR at 
day 29 was 
statistically non-inferior to, 
and 
 directionally higher than, BNT162b2 against both Wuhan and Omicron 
BA.5, statistically superior to ChAdOx1-S with 1.9-fold higher 
 SCR against Wuhan (23.6 absolute difference, p=0.0009) and 2.0-fold higher SCR 
against Omicron BA.5 (29.2 absolute difference, 
 p 
 31 
 Preliminary safety data from the 
Phase 3 trial shows that UB-612 
continues to be generally well tolerated; no 
serious adverse reactions 
 were reported. 
The trial remains ongoing, and the long term safety profile 
continues to be evaluated. 
The trial is expected to conclude 
 in the second half of 2023. 
 2-Dose Clinical Data 
 In early 2021, we completed an open-label dose escalation 
Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability and immunogenicity 
 of UB-612 
in healthy volunteers 
between the 
ages of 20 
and 55 in 
Taiwan. 
This six-month trial 
consisted of 
three 20-subject 
cohorts, 
 each receiving 
an initial 
dose at 
the start 
of the 
trial and 
a second 
dose on 
day 28: 
one 
cohort received 
two 10 g 
doses, the 
second 
 received two 
30 g doses, 
and the 
third received 
two 100 g 
doses. 
The mean 
titer of 
antigen-specific 
antibodies to 
UB-612 and 
the 
 seroconversion rate 
was evaluated 
throughout the 
duration of 
the trial 
to determine 
the humoral 
immune response 
and persistence 
of 
 immunogenicity. In addition, T-cell 
responses were evaluated 
by interferon- ELISpot assay and intracellular cytokine staining by flow 
 cytometry. 
The Phase 1 
clinical trial was 
sponsored by 
UBIA. UBIA conducted 
the trial on 
our behalf in 
accordance with one 
of our 
 related party master services agreements. 
 After one and 
two doses, 
UB-612 was considered 
to be 
generally safe and 
well tolerated, with 
a low 
frequency of 
solicited and unsolicited 
 AEs, which 
were all 
Grade 1 
(mild) in 
severity. 
After each 
vaccination, 
the most 
common AE 
was injection 
site pain, 
with no 
clear 
 difference in reactogenicity between dose levels. In all dose groups, there was a trend towards increased reactogenicity 
with increase in 
 dose. 
Three 
cases 
of 
mild 
allergic 
reactions 
were 
reported 
(e.g., 
itching 
at 
vaccine 
site), 
which 
were 
all 
resolved 
within 
1-3 
days. 
 Importantly, 
and in distinction 
to certain vaccines 
authorized for emergency 
use, no other 
increase in AEs 
was seen at 
second dose as 
 compared to first injection. We 
selected the highest dose (100 g) to take into a Phase 2 trial. 
 In an 
anti-S1-RBD ELISA 
assay, 
we observed 
that all 
three dose 
levels of 
UB-612 induced 
titer levels 
comparable to 
or greater 
than 
 those in sera from patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Furthermore, in 
a cytopathic effect viral neutralization assay (CPE VNT
 50), we 
 observed neutralizing titers comparable to those in sera from patients hospitalized 
with COVID-19. 
 Neutralizing activities of sample sera from the Phase 1 trial 
were assessed against live virus variants at the Viral and Rickettsial Disease 
 Laboratory of 
the California 
State Department 
of Public 
Health. The 
results indicate 
that UB-612 
induces viral 
neutralizing antibody 
 titers against the Alpha, Gamma and Delta variants of SARS-CoV-2, 
close to the neutralizing titer level against the original (wild-type, 
 WT) 
Wuhan 
strain, 
while 
the 
titer 
level 
against 
the 
Beta variant 
is lower 
in 
comparison. 
The 
latter 
finding 
is anticipated 
by 
results 
 published for other COVID-19 vaccines, as pointed out above. 
 Viral-neutralizing 
antibody titers 
(VNT
 50) up 
to 154 
days after 
the second 
dose (day 
196) in 
the Phase 
1 trial 
of UB-612 
remained at 
 52 of the maximum level 
observed following the second dose, 
on average. Based on 
the interim six-month cutoff, the 
UB-612-specific 
 neutralizing antibody half-life was estimated to be 195 days using 
an exponential model. 
 Time Course of SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Neutralization 
Responses after Vaccination 
 Data from a micro-neutralization assay 
of sera from subjects 
who received two 100 g 
doses of UB-612 
yielded an estimated 
neutralizing 
 titer half-life of 195 days (CI: 136, 349) using an exponential model. 

32 
 A randomized, 
placebo-controlled, 
multi-center Phase 
2 trial 
of UB-612 
in 3,850 
healthy volunteers 
aged 12 
to 85 
was conducted 
in 
 Taiwan. 
Subjects in 
this trial 
receive two 
doses of 
100 g UB-612, 
or placebo, 
28 days 
apart. The 
objectives of 
this trial 
include the 
 analysis of safety and immunogenicity of UB-612, in particular, antigen-specific antibodies to UB-612, the seroconversion rate and lot-
 to-lot consistency 
of antibody 
responses. An 
interim analysis 
of data 
from this 
Phase 2 
trial in 
healthy volunteers 
18 years 
and older 
 based on 
the data 
cut-off date 
of June 27, 
2021 was 
submitted to 
the TFDA 
as part 
of a 
filing for 
an EUA 
in Taiwan. 
The EUA 
was 
 denied in August 2021 by the TFDA. 

 In data from the Phase 2 trial, UB-612 appears well tolerated. 
AEs were generally mild, and no UB-612-related SAEs were 
 observed. Local injection site AEs occurred 
in half of the subjects, the most frequent being injection 
site pain. Systemic AEs 
 occurred in less than half of the subjects, and the 
incidence was similar in the active and placebo groups, 
except for muscle pain 
 which was more frequent in the active group. 
Aside from muscle pain, systemic reactions were comparable 
across the active and 
 placebo groups, with less than 10 of subjects in 
either group experiencing fever or chills. Systemic 
AEs were similar after the first 
 and second doses. The vast majority of AEs were mild (Grade 1), 
and all were self-limited. No subject had a severe (Grade 
3) local 
 reaction. The incidence of severe (Grade 
3) systemic reactions was

 Third immunization with UB-612 Produces Neutralizing 
Antibodies Against Omicron 

 Phase 1 extension subjects (n=15) received primary 
series with UB-612 100 g. Serum is taken 28 days after the second dose and 14 
 days after the third booster immunization 
administered 7-9 months after the primary series. Live virus neutralization

 Wuhan and Omicron 
are performed at VisMederi; 
results are expressed 
as virus neutralization antibody GMT 95 CI.
 An extension of the Phase 2, observer-blind, multicenter, 
randomized, placebo-controlled trial was sponsored by UBIA to evaluate the 
 immunogenicity, 
safety, tolerability, 
and lot consistency of a homologous booster dose of UB-612 in 
adolescents, younger adults, and 
 elderly adults. 
Adult subjects who completed the primary 2-dose UB-612 series in the main Phase 2 
trial were unblinded around and 
 offered a third dose of UB-612. 
The third dose of UB-612 stimulated both arms of adaptive immunity in subjects. 
The frequency of 
 solicited and unsolicited adverse events following the third dose was consistent with the 
safety profile observed after the first and 
 second doses. 

 Development Strategy 
 Based on our 
belief in UB-612 s 
potential utility 
as a heterologous 
booster dose (boosting 
the immunity 
of a subject 
who has already 
 received 
a 
different 
vaccine), 
we 
have 
completed 
rolling 
submissions 
for 
conditional/provisional 
authorization 
with 
regulatory 
 authorities in the United Kingdom and Australia, who will review under their 
established work share agreement.

We expect to complete the ongoing Phase 3 trial 
of UB-612 as a heterologous booster 
in the second half of 
2023, with continued support 
 from CEPI. 
 Competition 
 The 
pharmaceutical 
industry 
is 
characterized 
by 
rapidly 
advancing 
technologies, 
intense 
competition 
and 
a 
strong 
emphasis 
on 
 proprietary 
products. 
While 
we 
believe 
that 
our 
technology, 
the 
expertise 
of 
our 
executive 
and 
scientific 
teams, 
research, 
clinical 
 capabilities, development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face increasing competition 
 from multiple sources, 
including pharmaceutical and 
biotechnology companies, academic institutions, 
governmental agencies and 
public 
 and private research institutions both in the United States and abroad. 
 Many of our competitors may have significantly greater 
financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, 
 preclinical 
testing, 
conducting 
clinical 
trials, 
obtaining 
regulatory 
approvals 
and 
marketing 
approved 
products 
than 
we 
do. 
These 
 competitors 
also compete 
with us 
in recruiting 
and retaining 
qualified scientific 
and management 
personnel and 
establishing clinical 
 trial sites and 
patient enrollment for 
clinical trials, as 
well as in 
acquiring technologies complementary to, 
or necessary for, our 
programs. 
 Smaller or 
early stage 
companies may 
also prove 
to be 
significant competitors, 
particularly through 
collaborative arrangements 
with 
 larger or more established companies. 
 Vaccines 
 The global 
vaccine market 
is highly 
concentrated among 
a small 
number of 
multinational pharmaceutical 
companies: Pfizer, 
Merck, 
 GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi 
together control most of 
the global vaccine 
market. Other pharmaceutical 
and biotechnology companies, 
 academic institutions, governmental 
agencies and public and private 
research institutions are also working 
toward new solutions given 
 the continuing global unmet need. 

34 
 Neurodegenerative Disorders 
 We 
expect 
that, 
if 
approved, 
our 
product 
candidates 
will 
compete 
with 
currently 
approved 
therapies 
for 
management 
of 
 neurodegenerative diseases, such as 
AD and PD. 
In AD, four drugs are currently 
approved by the FDA for the treatment 
of symptoms 
 of AD, based 
on acetylcholinesterase AChE 
inhibition and NMDA 
receptor antagonism. In 
addition to the 
marketed therapies, we 
 are aware of 
several companies 
currently developing 
therapies for AD, 
including Eisai, 
Lilly, 
Hoffman-LaRoche, Abbvie, 
Johnson 
 Johnson, and Novartis. 
Biogen s aducanumab 
was approved by 
the FDA in June 
2021 under the 
accelerated approval pathway, 
which 
 allows for 
earlier approval 
of drugs 
that treat 
serious conditions, 
and that 
fill an 
unmet medical 
need based 
on a 
surrogate endpoint. 
 Aducanumab failed to achieve approval in Europe and 
Japan. 
Eisai and Biogen s lecanemab was approved by the FDA in 
January 2023 
 under an accelerated approval pathway. 
 Pharmaceutical treatments for PD address its symptoms only and do not treat the underlying causes of PD. The majority of prescription 
 drugs 
are 
dopaminergic 
medications 
and 
act 
by 
increasing 
dopamine, 
a 
neurotransmitter. 
We 
are 
aware 
of 
several 
companies 
with 
 product 
candidates 
at 
various 
stages 
of 
clinical 
development, 
including 
Sanofi, 
Kyowa 
Kirin, 
Cerevel 
Therapeutics 
and 
Hoffman- 
 LaRoche. Hoffman-LaRoche is developing prasinezumab, 
a mAb, as a potential treatment for PD. 

 CGRP-Directed Migraine Treatments 
 Six migraine treatments have been 
approved by the FDA that target 
CGRP. 
Four of these therapeutics are 
mAbs and were approved to 
 prevent or 
reduce the 
number of 
migraine episodes. 
These medications 
are galcanezumab 
(Emgality), which 
was developed 
by Lilly; 
 erenumab (Aimovig), 
which was 
developed by 
Amgen in 
collaboration with 
Novartis; fremanezumab 
(Ajovy), which 
was developed 
 by 
Teva; 
and 
eptinezumab 
(Vyepti), 
which 
was 
developed 
by 
Alder, 
acquired 
by 
Lundbeck. 
Ubrogepant 
(Ubrelvy), 
developed 
by 
 Allergan, 
was approved 
for 
the treatment 
of acute 
migraine episodes; 
rimegepant 
(Nurtec), 
also approved 
for 
the treatment 
of acute 
 migraine, 
is sold 
by Pfizer 
following 
its acquisition 
of Biohaven. 
Atogepant 
(Qulipta), developed 
by AbbVie, 
was approved 
for 
the 
 preventive treatment of episodic migraine. 
 PCSK-9 Inhibitors 
 Three companies 
currently have 
PCSK-9 inhibitors 
approved by 
the FDA 
to treat 
hypercholesterolemia: 
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals 
 developed alirocumab (Praluent), a mAb, in 
collaboration with Sanofi, and Amgen developed 
evolocumab (Repatha), another mAb, and 

 Novartis is commercializing inclisiran, an RNAi construct, to down-regulate 
synthesis of PCSK-9. 
 Collaborations 
 From 
time to 
time, we 
may 
enter 
into licensing 
and 
commercialization 
agreements 
when they 
align with 
our mission, 
including 
the 
 Platform 
License 
Agreement 
described 
under 
 Intellectual 
Property Platform 
License 
Agreement 
and 
the 
agreement 
with 
our 
 partner Aurobindo. 
 Aurobindo License Agreement 
 In 
December 
2020, 
we 
entered 
into 
an 
exclusive 
license 
agreement 
with 
Aurobindo 
(as 
amended, 
the 
 Aurobindo 
Agreement 
to 
 develop 
and 
commercialize 
UB-612 
to India 
and 
other 
territories. 
Pursuant 
to 
the Aurobindo 
Agreement, 
we 
granted 
Aurobindo 
an 
 exclusive license 
(with certain 
rights reserved 
to us) to 
develop, manufacture 
and commercialize UB-612 
in India 
and other countries 
 through 
UNICEF 
and 
a 
non-exclusive 
license 
to 
develop, 
manufacture 
and 
commercialize 
UB-612 
in 
other 
selected 
emerging 
and 
 developing markets. 

 The Aurobindo Agreement may be terminated (i) by Aurobindo, without 
cause at any time after three years following the effective 
 date or prior to such time if UB-612 fails to meet clinical endpoints or fails in development, 
(ii) by us, (a) if Aurobindo disputes the 
 patentability, enforceability 
or validity of our patent rights related to the UB-612 technology, 
(b) in case of a suit alleging Aurobindo s 
 use of the licensed intellectual property infringes a third party s 
intellectual property rights if we reasonably believe the license is no 
 longer commercially reasonable in light of such claim or (c) without cause 
at any time after four years following the effective date, 
 (iii) by either party in the event of the other party s 
material breach of its obligations under the Aurobindo Agreement (subject to 
a 
 cure period) or (iv) by either party in the event of the other party s 
insolvency.

Manufacturing 
 The manufacture of our 
product candidates encompasses both 
the manufacture of custom 
components and the 
formulation, fill and finish 
 of the final 
product. We 
do not currently 
own or operate 
manufacturing facilities 
for these processes. 
We 
currently rely upon 
contract 
 manufacturing organizations, including those mentioned below, 
to produce our product candidates for both pre-clinical and clinical use 
 and 
will continue 
to rely 
upon 
these 
relationships 
for 
commercial 
manufacturing 
if any 
of 
our 
product 
candidates 
obtain 
regulatory 

35 
 approval. 
Although 
we rely 
upon contract 
manufacturers, 
we also 
have 
personnel 
with extensive 
manufacturing 
experience that 
can 
 oversee the relationships with our manufacturing partners. 
 Historically, 
we 
have 
depended 
heavily 
on 
UBI 
and 
its 
affiliates 
for 
our 
business 
operations, 
including 
the 
provision 
of 
research, 
 development 
and 
manufacturing 
services. 
Currently, 
UBIA 
provides 
testing 
services 
for 
UB-312 
and 
UB-612, 
UBI 
Pharma 
Inc. 
 UBIP 
provides 
testing 
relating 
to 
formulation-fill-finish 
services 
for 
UB-312, 
and 
United 
BioPharma, 
Inc. UBP 
is 
the 
sole 
 manufacturer of protein for UB-612. Our commercial arrangements with UBI and 
its affiliates are described in more detail below. 
 Formulation-fill-finish services for UB-612 are provided by 
multiple contract manufacturers to ensure adequate capacity 
and minimize 
 supply 
chain 
risks. 
For 
supply 
of 
our 
other 
custom 
components, 
in 
addition 
to 
protein 
manufacturing 
conducted 
by 
UBP, 
we 
have 
 engaged third party 
CMOs, including C 
S Bio Co. CSBio 
as our primary 
peptide supplier for 
UB-612 peptides and Wuxi 
STA 
for 
 process development and manufacturing services of oligonucleotides. 

 UBI Group Manufacturing Partnership 
 We 
primarily 
rely 
on 
our 
relationships 
with 
third-party 
contract 
manufacturing 
organizations 
to 
produce 
product 
candidates for 
our 
 clinical trials. Historically, we have heavily depended on UBI as a manufacturing partner for these efforts. In support of our COVID-19 
 program (UB-612), we have entered into a master services agreement with UBP and an additional master services agreement with UBI, 
 UBIA and UBP. 
Pursuant to these 
agreements, UBI and 
its affiliates have 
provided research, development, 
testing and manufacturing 
 services to 
us and 
continue to provide 
manufacturing services 
for our 
protein. Payment 
terms are 
mutually agreed 
in connection 
with 
 each work order 
relating to services 
rendered. Our 
agreement with UBP 
will expire on 
the later of 
March 2024 and 
the completion of 
 all services 
under the 
last work 
order executed 
prior to 
such scheduled 
expiration and 
our agreement 
with UBI, 
UBIA and 
UBP will 
 expire on 
the later 
of September 
2023 and 
the completion 
of all 
services under 
the last 
work order 
executed prior 
to such 
scheduled 
 expiration. We also have a management 
services agreement with 
UBI pursuant to 
which UBI has 
provided research and prior 
back office 
 administrative services to us and acts as our agent with respect to certain matters relating our COVID-19 program. UBI is compensated 
 for its services on a cost-plus basis. The agreement terminates upon mutual 
agreement between the parties. 
 In support of our chronic disease pipeline, we 
have entered into master service agreements with 
each of UBI, UBIA and UBIP. Pursuant 
 to these agreements, UBI currently provides limited research services to us on a cost-plus 
basis, UBIA provides testing services related 
 to UB-312 clinical trial material already manufactured and UBIP has provided manufacturing, quality control, testing, validation, GMP 
 warehousing 
and supply 
services to 
us for 
UB-312 on 
payment terms 
agreed in 
connection with 
work orders 
relating to 
the services 
 rendered. UBI 
and its affiliates 
no longer provide 
clinical or manufacturing 
services for other 
programs. These agreements 
may all be 
 terminated for convenience upon 180 days notice or less. 
 We have 
also entered into a research 
and development services agreement 
with UBI. Pursuant to 
this agreement, UBI and 
its affiliates 
 may 
provide 
research 
and 
development 
services 
to 
us. 
Service 
fees 
payable 
by 
us 
to 
UBI 
for 
research 
and 
development 
projects 
 undertaken in accordance with the research and development 
plan would be determined by a joint steering committee 
and set forth in a 
 research and development plan. Any aggregate 
services fees payable by us under the research and 
development services agreement are 
 subject to 
a quarterly 
cap throughout 
the term of 
the agreement. 
The research 
and development 
services agreement 
expires in 
August 
 2026. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our ability 
to obtain 
and maintain 
intellectual property 
protection for 
our product 
candidates and 
core technologies 
is fundamental 
to 
 the 
long-term 
success 
of 
our 
business. 
We 
rely 
on 
a 
combination 
of 
intellectual 
property 
protection 
strategies, 
including 
patents, 
 trademarks, trade secrets, license agreements, 
confidentiality policies and procedures, nondisclosure 
agreements, invention assignment 
 agreements and technical measures designed to 
protect the intellectual property and 
commercially valuable confidential information and 
 data used in our business. 
 In summary, our patent estate includes issued patents and patent applications 
which claims cover our Vaxxine 
Platform and each of our 
 product candidates. As of December 31, 2022 our patent estate include 
d 
three U.S. issued patents, twelve U.S. patent applications, five 
 U.S. provisional 
patent applications, 
four pending 
Patent Cooperation 
Treaty PCT 
patent applications, 
60 issued 
non-U.S. patents 
 and 158 pending non-U.S. patent applications. 
 For our 
product 
candidates targeting 
the prevention 
and treatment 
of neurodegenerative 
disease, including 
claims covering 
UB-311, 
 UB-312, and 
anti-tau patent 
rights are 
provided by 
patents and 
patent applications, 
the majority 
of which 
are being 
prosecuted in 
the 
 United States, Australia, 
Brazil, Canada, China, 
the EPO, Hong 
Kong, Indonesia, India, 
Israel, Japan, the 
Republic of Korea, 
Mexico, 
 Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan and 
the United Arab Emirates directed to peptide vaccines for the prevention and treatment of 
 neurodegenerative 
diseases. 
These 
issued 
patents 
and 
patent 
applications, 
if 
issued, 
are 
expected 
to 
expire 
between 
2023 
and 
2043, 
 excluding any patent term adjustments or patent term extensions. 

36 
 For our product candidates directed 
to peptide immunogens targeting 
CGRP and formulations thereof for 
the prevention and treatment 
 of migraine, including UB-313, 
patent rights may be 
provided by a 
patent family being prosecuted 
in the United 
States, Australia, Brazil, 
 Canada, China, India, Indonesia, 
Japan, Mexico, Russia, 
the Republic of 
Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and the United

 patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire in 2039, excluding 
any patent term adjustments or patent term extensions. 
 For 
our 
product 
candidates 
targeting 
cholesterol 
and 
cardiovascular 
disease, 
including 
our 
anti-PCSK9 
product

formulations thereof 
for prevention 
and treatment 
of PCSK9-mediated 
disorders, we 
have pending 
patent applications 
in 
 the United States, 
Australia, Brazil, Canada, 
India, Indonesia, Japan, 
Mexico, the Philippines, 
the Republic of 
Korea, Taiwan, 
and the 
 United

if issued, 
are expected 
to expire 
in 2041, 
excluding any 
patent 
term adjustment 
or 
 patent term extension. 
 For our product 
candidates targeting SARS-CoV-2, including UB-612 for COVID-19, we 
have pending patent applications 
in the United 
 States, 
Australia, 
Brazil,

Russia, 
Saudi 
Arabia, 

 Taiwan, United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, four pending 
PCT patent applications and 
one provisional patent applications 
in the United 
 States. These patent applications, if issued, and any U.S. or non-U.S. patent issuing 
from the PCT or provisional patent applications, are 
 expected to expire between 2041 and 2042, excluding any patent term adjustments 
or patent term extensions. 
 For each product 
candidate utilizing the 
Vaxxine 
platform, additional patent 
rights directed to 
artificial T helper 
cell epitopes and 
to a 
 CpG delivery system 
are provided by patents 
and patent applications, the 
majority of which 
are being prosecuted 
in the United States, 
 Australia, Austria, 
Belgium, Brazil, 
Canada, Chile, 
China, Colombia, 
Denmark, 
the EPO, 
France, Germany, 
Hong Kong, 
Indonesia, 
 India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, 
the Netherlands, New Zealand, Peru, Philippines, the Republic of Korea, Russia, Singapore, 
 South 
Africa, 
Spain, 
Sweden, 
Switzerland/Liechtenstein, 
Taiwan, 
Thailand, 
the 
United 
Arab 
Emirates, 
the 
United 
Kingdom 
and 
 Vietnam. 
These issued patents 
and patent applications, 
if issued, are 
expected to expire 
between 2023 
and 2039, excluding 
any patent 
 term adjustments or patent term extensions. 
 The term of 
individual patents depends on 
the countries in 
which they are obtained. 
The patent term 
is 20 years 
from the earliest 
effective 
 filing date of 
a non-provisional patent 
application in most 
of the countries 
in which we 
file, including the 
United States. In 
the United 
 States, a 
patent s 
term may 
be lengthened 
by patent 
term adjustment, 
which compensates 
a patentee 
for administrative 
delays by 
the 
 USPTO in 
examining and 
granting a 
patent, or 
may be 
shortened if 
a patent 
is terminally disclaimed 
over an 
earlier filed 
patent. The 
 term of a patent 
that covers a drug 
or biological product 
may also be eligible 
for patent term extension 
when FDA approval 
is granted 
 for a 
portion of 
the term 
effectively 
lost as 
a result 
of the 
FDA regulatory 
review period, 
subject to 
certain limitations 
and provided 
 statutory and regulatory requirements are met. 
 In addition to our reliance on patent protection for our inventions, products and technologies, we also seek to protect our brand 
through 
 the procurement of 
trademark rights. We 
own registered trademarks 
and pending trademark 
applications for our 
brands, including our 
 Vaxxinity , United Neuroscience and COVAXX 
brands and other related 
names and logos, in 
the United States 
and certain foreign 
 jurisdictions. 
 Furthermore, we rely 
upon trade secrets 
and know-how and 
continuing technological innovation 
to develop and 
maintain our competitive 
 position. However, 
trade secrets and 
know-how can be 
difficult to protect. 
We 
generally control access 
to and use 
of our trade 
secrets 
 and know-how, through the use 
of internal and 
external controls, including 
by entering into 
nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements 
 with 
our 
employees 
and 
third 
parties. 
We 
cannot 
guarantee, 
however, 
that 
we 
have 
executed 
such 
agreements 
with 
all 
applicable 
 counterparties, that such agreements will not be breached or that these 
agreements will afford us adequate protection of our intellectual 
 property and proprietary rights. 
Furthermore, although we take 
steps to protect 
our proprietary information 
and trade secrets, 
third parties 
 may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and 
techniques or otherwise gain access 
to our trade secrets 
 or disclose our technology. 
As a result, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. For further discussion of the risks 
 relating to intellectual property, 
see Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property Rights. 
 Platform License Agreement 
 In August 2021, 
Vaxxinity 
entered into a 
license agreement (the 
 Platform License Agreement 
with UBI and 
certain of its 
affiliates 
 (collectively, the Licensors that expanded intellectual 
property rights previously licensed 
under the Original UBI 
Licenses (as defined 
 below). 
Pursuant to 
the Platform 
License Agreement, 
Vaxxinity 
obtained 
a worldwide, 
sublicensable 
(subject to 
certain conditions), 
 perpetual, fully paid-up, royalty-free (i) exclusive license (even 
as to the Licensors) under all patents owned or otherwise controlled 
by 
 the Licensors or 
their affiliates existing 
as of the effective 
date of the 
Platform License Agreement, 
(ii) exclusive license 
(except as to 
 the Licensors) under all patents owned 
or otherwise controlled by the 
Licensors or their affiliates arising 
after the effective date during 
 the term of the Platform 
License Agreement, and (iii) 
non-exclusive license under all 
know-how owned or otherwise 
controlled by the 
 Licensors or their affiliates existing as of the effective date or arising during the term of the Platform License Agreement, in each of the 
 foregoing 
cases, 
to 
research, 
develop, 
make, 
have 
made, 
utilize, 
import, 
export, 
market, 
distribute, 
offer 
for 
sale, 
sell, 
have 
sold, 
 commercialize or otherwise exploit 
peptide-based vaccines in the field 
of all human prophylactic and 
therapeutic uses, except for 
such 
 vaccines related 
to human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV), herpes 
simplex virus (HSE) 
and Immunoglobulin 
E (IgE). The 
patents and 
 patent applications licensed under the Platform License Agreement include claims directed to a CpG delivery system, artificial T helper 

37 
 cell 
epitopes 
and 
certain 
designer 
peptides 
and 
proteins 
utilized 
in 
UB-612. 
As 
partial 
consideration 
for 
the 
rights 
and 
licenses 
we 
 received pursuant to the Platform License Agreement, 
we granted UBI a warrant to purchase 1,928,020 
shares of our Class A common 
 stock UBI Warrant ). The UBI Warrant is exercisable at an exercise price 
of 12.45 per share 
(subject to adjustment pursuant thereto), 
 is not subject to vesting, and has a term of five years. 
 Vaxxinity 
has the first right to control 
the filing, prosecution, maintenance and 
enforcement of the licensed patents 
at Vaxxinity s 
own 
 expense, subject to 
the Licensors right 
to comment on 
and review any 
patent filings. The 
Platform License Agreement 
shall continue 
 until the parties mutually consent in writing to terminate the agreement. Upon such termination, 
all licenses granted under the Platform 
 License Agreement 
shall terminate 
and Vaxxinity 
will assign any 
regulatory documentation 
previously assigned 
to Vaxxinity 
back to 
 the Licensors. 
 Pricing, Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Sales of our product 
candidates in the United 
States will depend, in 
part, on the 
extent to which third-party 
payors, including government 
 health programs 
such as Medicare 
and Medicaid, 
commercial insurance 
and managed 
health care organizations 
provide coverage 
and 
 establish 
adequate 
reimbursement 
levels 
for 
such 
product 
candidates. 
The 
process 
for 
determining 
whether 
a 
third-party 
payor 
will 
 provide coverage for a pharmaceutical or biological product is typically separate from the process for setting the price of 
such a product 
 or for establishing 
the reimbursement rate 
that the payor 
will pay for the 
product once coverage 
is approved, and 
we may also need 
to 
 provide 
discounts 
to 
purchasers, 
private 
health 
plans 
or 
government 
healthcare 
programs, 
as 
increasingly, 
third-party 
payors 
are 
 requiring that 
drug companies 
provide them 
with predetermined 
discounts from 
list prices 
and are 
challenging the 
prices charged 
for 
 medical products. 
As a 
result, a 
third-party payor s 
decision to 
provide coverage 
for a 
pharmaceutical or 
biological product 
does not 
 imply that the reimbursement rate will be adequate for commercial 
viability, and inadequate reimbursement 
rates, including significant 
 patient 
cost 
sharing 
obligations, 
may 
deter 
patients 
from 
selecting 
our 
product 
candidates. 
Obtaining 
coverage 
and 
reimbursement 
 approval of 
a product 
from a third-party 
payor is 
a time-consuming 
and costly 
process that 
could require 
us to 
provide to 
each payor 
 supporting scientific, 
clinical and 
cost-effectiveness data 
for the use 
of our product 
on a payor 
-by-payor basis, 
with no 
assurance that 
 coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, 
 also known as a formulary, 
which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. 
 Further, 
no uniform 
policy 
for coverage 
and 
reimbursement 
exists in 
the United 
States, and 
coverage 
and reimbursement 
can differ 
 significantly from payor to 
payor. In general, factors a 
payor considers in 
determining coverage and reimbursement 
are based on 
whether 
 the product is a covered 
benefit under its health plan; 
safe, effective, and medically 
necessary, including 
its regulatory approval status; 
 medically appropriate for the specific patient; cost-effective; and neither experimental nor investigational. Third-party payors often rely 
 upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, but also have their own methods and 
 approval process apart 
from Medicare determinations. 
As such, one 
third-party payor s 
decision to 
cover a particular 
medical product 
 or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, and the level of coverage and 
 reimbursement can differ significantly from 
payor to payor. Even if favorable 
coverage and reimbursement status is attained for 
one or 
 more products for which we receive 
regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates 
may be implemented 
 in the future. 
 Product Approval and Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the 
United States, at the federal, 
state and local level, and 
other countries extensively 
regulate, among other 
 things, 
the 
research, 
development, 
testing, 
manufacture, 
quality 
control, 
approval, 
labeling, 
packaging, 
storage, 
record-keeping, 
 promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and 
export and import of products such 
as those 
 we are 
developing. 
Any product 
candidate 
that we 
develop 
must be 
approved 
by the 
FDA before 
it may 
be legally 
marketed 
in the 
 United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before 
it may be legally marketed in foreign countries. 

38 
 U.S. Drug Development Process 
 In the United 
States, the development, 
manufacturing and marketing 
of human drugs 
and vaccines are 
subject to extensive 
regulation. 
 The FDA 
regulates 
drugs 
under the 
Federal 
Food, 
Drug and 
Cosmetic Act FDCA 
and 
implementing 
regulations, 
and biological 
 products, including vaccines, under provisions of 
the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act PHSA ). Drugs and 
vaccines are also 
 subject 
to 
other 
federal, 
state 
and 
local 
statutes 
and 
regulations. 
The 
process 
of 
obtaining 
regulatory 
approvals 
and 
the 
subsequent 
 compliance 
with appropriate 
federal, state, 
local and 
foreign 
statutes and 
regulations 
require the 
expenditure 
of substantial 
time and 
 financial 
resources. 
Failure 
to 
comply 
with 
the 
applicable 
U.S. 
requirements 
at 
any 
time 
during 
the 
product 
development 
process, 
 approval process or after approval, may subject an 
applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions 
could include refusal 
 to approve 
pending applications, 
withdrawal 
of an 
approval, clinical 
hold, 
warning letters, 
product 
recalls, 
product 
seizures, total 
or 
 partial 
suspension 
of 
production 
or 
distribution, 
injunctions, 
fines, 
refusals 
of 
government 
contracts, 
debarment, 
restitution, 
 disgorgement or civil 
or criminal penalties. Any 
agency or judicial enforcement 
action could have a 
material adverse effect on 
us. The 
 process required by the FDA before a 
drug or biological product may be marketed in 
the United States generally involves the following: 
 
completion of 
nonclinical laboratory 
tests, animal 
studies and 
formulation and 
stability studies 
according to 
good laboratory 
 practices, or GLPs and other applicable regulations; 
 
submission to the FDA of an application for an IND, which must become 
effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
 
performance of 
adequate and 
well-controlled human 
clinical trials according 
to the 
FDA s 
good clinical 
practice regulations 
 commonly 
referred to 
as GCPs, 
among 
other requirements, 
to establish 
the safety 
and efficacy 
of the 
proposed drug 
for 
its 
 intended uses; 
 
submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA for a new drug; 
 
satisfactory completion 
of an FDA 
inspection of 
the manufacturing 
facility or 
facilities where 
the drug 
is produced 
to assess 
 compliance 
with 
the 
FDA s 
cGMP, 
to 
assure 
that 
the 
facilities, 
methods 
and 
controls 
are 
adequate 
to 
preserve 
the 
drug s 
 identity, strength, quality 
and purity; 
 
potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the 
data in support of the NDA or BLA; and 
 
FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA. 
 The 
lengthy 
process of 
seeking 
required 
approvals 
and 
the continuing 
need 
for 
compliance 
with 
applicable 
statutes 
and 
regulations 
 require the expenditure of substantial resources and approvals are inherently 
uncertain. 
 Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product 
candidate enters the pre-clinical study stage. Pre-
 clinical tests, 
also referred 
to as 
nonclinical studies, 
include laboratory 
evaluations of 
product chemistry, 
toxicity and 
formulation, as 
 well as animal studies 
to assess the potential safety 
and activity of the 
product candidate. The Consolidated Appropriations Act 
for 2023, 
 signed into law on December 29, 2022, (P.L. 
117-328) amended both the FDCA and PHSA to specify that nonclinical testing for drugs 
 and biologics, respectively, 
may, 
but is not 
required to, include 
in vivo animal 
testing. According to 
the amended language, 
a sponsor 
 may 
fulfill 
nonclinical 
testing 
requirements 
by 
completing 
various 
in 
vitro 
assays 
(e.g., 
cell-based 
assays, 
organ 
chips, 
or 
 microphysiological 
systems), 
in 
silico 
studies 
(i.e., 
computer 
modeling), 
other 
human 
or 
non-human 
biology-based 
tests 
(e.g., 
 bioprinting), or in vivo animal tests. 
 The conduct of 
the pre-clinical tests 
must comply with 
federal regulations 
and requirements including 
GLP. 
The sponsor must 
submit 
 the results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and 
 a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as 
part of the IND. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt 
by the FDA, 
 unless the FDA imposes a 
clinical hold within that 30-day 
time period. In such a case, 
the IND sponsor and the 
FDA must resolve any 
 outstanding concerns 
before the 
clinical trial 
can begin. 
The FDA 
may also 
impose clinical 
holds on 
a product 
candidate at 
any time 
 before or 
during clinical 
trials due 
to safety 
concerns or 
non-compliance. Accordingly, 
we cannot 
be sure 
that submission 
of an 
IND 
 will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, 
issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trial. 
 Clinical trials 
involve the 
administration of 
the product 
candidate to 
healthy volunteers 
or patients 
under the 
supervision of 
qualified 
 investigators, 
generally 
physicians 
not 
employed 
by 
or 
under 
the 
trial 
sponsor s 
direct 
control. 
Clinical 
trials 
are 
conducted 
under 
 protocols detailing, 
among other things, 
the objectives of 
the clinical trial, 
dosing procedures, 
subject selection 
and exclusion 
criteria, 
 and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety. 
Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Congress also 
 recently amended the FDCA, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2023, in order to require sponsors of a Phase 3 clinical 
 trial, or 
other pivotal 
study of 
a new 
drug to 
support marketing 
authorization, to 
design and 
submit a 
diversity action 
plan for 
such 
 clinical 
trial. 
The 
action 
plan 
must 
include 
the 
sponsor s 
diversity 
goals 
for 
enrollment, 
as 
well 
as 
a 
rationale 
for 
the 
goals 
and 
a 
 description of how the sponsor 
will meet them. Sponsors must 
submit a diversity action plan 
to the FDA by 
the time the sponsor submits 
 the 
relevant 
clinical 
trial protocol 
to the 
agency for 
review. 
The FDA 
may 
grant 
a 
waiver 
for 
some 
or all 
of the 
requirements 
for a 

39 
 diversity 
action 
plan. 
It is 
unknown 
at this 
time how 
the diversity 
action 
plan 
may 
affect 
Phase 3 
trial planning 
and 
timing 
or what 
 specific information 
FDA will 
expect in 
such plans, 
but if 
the FDA 
objects to 
a sponsor s 
diversity action 
plan or 
otherwise requires 
 significant changes to be made, 
it could delay initiation of 
the relevant clinical trial. Clinical 
trials must be conducted in 
accordance with 
 the FDA s 
regulations comprising the 
good clinical practices requirements. 
Further, each clinical 
trial must be reviewed 
and approved 
 by an independent 
IRB at or servicing 
each institution at which 
the clinical trial 
will be conducted. 
An IRB is charged 
with protecting 
 the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers 
such items as whether the risks to individuals participating 
in the clinical trials 
 are minimized and are 
reasonable in relation to 
anticipated benefits. The IRB 
also approves the form 
and content of the 
informed consent 
 that 
must 
be 
signed 
by 
each 
clinical 
trial 
subject 
or 
his 
or 
her 
legal 
representative 
and 
provide 
oversight 
for 
the 
clinical 
trial 
until 
 completed. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may 
overlap or be combined: 
 
 Phase 1
 . The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for 
safety, dosage 
 tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the 
case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, 
 especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer 
to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing may be 
 conducted in patients; 
 
 Phase 2
 . The drug is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects 
and safety 
 risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product 
for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal 
 dosage and dosing schedule; and 
 
 Phase 3
 . Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy 
and safety in an 
 expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These 
clinical trials are intended to establish the overall 
 risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 
Generally, a well-controlled 
Phase 3 clinical trial is 
 required by the FDA for approval of an NDA or BLA. 
 Post-approval clinical 
trials, sometimes referred 
to as Phase 
4 clinical trials, 
may be conducted 
after initial marketing 
approval. These 
 clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients 
in the intended therapeutic indication. 
 During all phases 
of clinical development, 
regulatory agencies require extensive 
monitoring and auditing 
of all clinical 
activities, clinical 
 data and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing 
the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA and 
 written IND safety 
reports must be 
promptly submitted to 
the FDA and the 
investigators for serious 
and unexpected adverse 
events or 
 any finding 
from tests in 
laboratory animals 
that suggests a 
significant risk 
for human 
subjects. Phase 1, 
Phase 2 
and Phase 3 
clinical 
 trials may 
not be 
completed successfully 
within any 
specified period, 
if at 
all. The 
FDA or 
the sponsor 
or its 
data safety 
monitoring 
 board may 
suspend a 
clinical trial 
at any 
time on 
various grounds, 
including a 
finding that 
the research 
subjects or 
patients are 
being 
 exposed to 
an unacceptable 
health risk. 
Similarly, 
an IRB 
can suspend 
or terminate 
approval of 
a clinical 
trial at 
its institution 
if the 
 clinical trial is 
not being conducted in 
accordance with the 
IRB s requirements or if the 
drug has been 
associated with unexpected serious 
 harm to patients. 
 Concurrently with clinical 
trials, companies usually 
complete additional nonclinical 
studies and 
must also 
develop additional information 
 about the chemistry 
and physical characteristics 
of the drug 
as well as 
finalize a process 
for manufacturing the 
product in commercial 
 quantities in accordance with 
cGMP requirements. The 
manufacturing process must be 
capable of consistently 
producing quality batches 
 of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality 
and purity of the final 
 drug. For biological products in particular, the PHSA 
emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for 
products whose attributes 
 cannot be precisely 
defined in 
order to help 
reduce the 
risk of 
the introduction of 
adventitious agents. Additionally, appropriate 
packaging 
 must 
be 
selected 
and 
tested, 
and 
stability 
studies 
must 
be 
conducted 
to 
demonstrate 
that 
the 
product 
candidate 
does 
not 
undergo 
 unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 U.S. Review and Approval Processes 
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product 
 development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions 
of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on 
 the 
chemistry 
of 
the 
drug, 
proposed 
labeling 
and 
other 
relevant 
information 
are 
submitted 
to 
the 
FDA 
as 
part 
of 
an 
NDA 
or 
BLA 
 requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to the payment of substantial fees; a waiver of 
 such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. 
 In addition, under the 
Pediatric Research Equity Act PREA ), 
an NDA or BLA or 
supplement to an NDA or 
BLA must contain data 
 to 
assess the 
safety 
and 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
drug for 
the 
claimed 
indications 
in all 
relevant 
pediatric 
subpopulations 
and 
to 
support 
 dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe 
and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for 
 submission of data or full 
or partial waivers. Unless 
otherwise required by regulation, PREA does 
not apply to any 
drug for an indication 
 for which orphan designation has been granted. 

40 
 The FDA reviews 
all NDAs or 
BLAs submitted to 
determine if they 
are substantially complete 
before it accepts 
them for filing. 
If the 
 FDA determines that an NDA or BLA is incomplete or the application is found to be non-navigable, the filing may be refused and must 
 be re-submitted for consideration. 
Once the submission is accepted 
for filing, the FDA begins an 
in-depth review of the NDA or 
BLA. 
 Under the goals and policies agreed to by the 
FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act PDUFA ), the FDA has 10 months from 
 acceptance of filing in which to 
complete its initial review of 
a standard NDA or BLA 
and respond to the applicant, and 
six months from 
 acceptance of 
filing for 
a priority 
NDA or 
BLA. The 
FDA does 
not always 
meet its 
PDUFA 
goal dates. 
The review 
process and 
the 
 PDUFA 
goal date 
may be 
extended by 
three months 
or longer 
if the 
FDA requests 
or the 
NDA or 
BLA sponsor 
otherwise provides 
 additional information or clarification regarding information already 
provided in the submission before the PDUFA 
goal date. 
 After the NDA or BLA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA or BLA 
to determine, among other things, whether 
 the proposed product is safe and effective for 
its intended use, and whether the 
product is being manufactured in accordance with 
cGMP 
 to assure and preserve the 
product s identity, 
strength, quality and purity. 
The FDA may refer applications 
for novel drug or biological 
 products or drug or 
biological products which present difficult questions 
of safety or efficacy to 
an advisory committee, typically a 
panel 
 that includes clinicians and 
other experts, for 
review, evaluation and a recommendation as 
to whether the 
application should be approved 
 and 
under 
what 
conditions. 
The 
FDA 
is 
not 
bound 
by 
the 
recommendations 
of 
an 
advisory 
committee, 
but 
it 
considers 
such 
 recommendations 
carefully 
when 
making 
decisions. 
During 
the 
drug 
approval 
process, 
the 
FDA 
also 
will 
determine 
whether 
a 
risk 
 evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks and to assure the safe 
 use 
of 
the 
drug. 
The 
REMS could 
include 
medication 
guides, physician 
communication 
plans, 
assessment 
plans 
and/or 
elements 
to 
 assure 
safe 
use, 
such 
as restricted 
distribution 
methods, 
patient 
registries 
or 
other 
risk 
minimization 
tools. 
The FDA 
determines 
the 
 requirement for a 
REMS, as well as 
the specific REMS 
provisions, on a 
case-by-case basis. If 
the FDA concludes 
a REMS is needed, 
 the 
sponsor 
of 
the NDA 
or BLA 
must 
submit 
a proposed 
REMS; the 
FDA will 
not 
approve 
the NDA 
or 
BLA without 
a 
REMS, 
if 
 required. 
 Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve 
 the product unless it 
determines that the manufacturing processes 
and facilities are in 
compliance with cGMP requirements 
and adequate 
 to assure consistent 
production of 
the product 
within required specifications. 
The FDA requires 
vaccine manufacturers 
to submit data 
 supporting 
the 
demonstration 
of 
consistency 
between 
manufacturing 
batches, 
or 
lots. 
The 
FDA 
works 
together 
with 
vaccine 
 manufacturers to develop a lot 
release protocol, the tests conducted on 
each lot of vaccine post-approval. Additionally, before approving 
 an NDA or 
BLA, the FDA 
will typically inspect the 
sponsor and one 
or more clinical 
sites to assure 
that the clinical 
trials were conducted 
 in 
compliance 
with 
IND 
study 
requirements 
and 
with 
GCPs. 
If 
the 
FDA 
determines 
that 
the 
application, 
manufacturing 
process 
or 
 manufacturing facilities are 
not acceptable it 
will outline the deficiencies 
in the submission and 
often will request 
additional testing or 
 information. 
 The NDA 
or BLA 
review and 
approval process 
is lengthy 
and difficult 
and the 
FDA may 
refuse to 
approve an 
NDA or 
BLA if 
the 
 applicable regulatory 
criteria are 
not satisfied 
or may 
require additional 
clinical data 
or other 
data and 
information. Even 
if such 
data 
 and 
information 
is submitted, 
the FDA 
may 
ultimately 
decide 
that the 
NDA or 
BLA does 
not satisfy 
the criteria 
for 
approval. 
Data 
 obtained from clinical 
trials are not always 
conclusive and the 
FDA may interpret 
data differently 
than we interpret 
the same data. An 
 approval 
letter 
authorizes 
commercial 
marketing 
of 
the 
drug 
with 
specific 
prescribing 
information 
for 
specific 
indications, 
while 
a 
 complete response 
letter indicates 
that the 
review cycle 
of the 
application is 
complete and 
the application 
will not 
be approved 
in its 
 present form. The complete response letter usually describes all of 
the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the 
FDA. 
 The deficiencies identified may 
be minor, 
for example, requiring labeling 
changes, or major, 
for example, requiring additional 
clinical 
 trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include 
recommended actions that the applicant might 
take to place the 
application 
 in a condition 
for approval. If 
a complete response 
letter is issued, 
the applicant 
may either submit 
new information, 
addressing all of 
 the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw 
the application. 
 If a product 
receives regulatory approval, 
the approval may be 
significantly limited to 
specific diseases and 
dosages or the 
indications 
 for use may 
otherwise be limited, 
which could restrict 
the commercial value 
of the product. Further, 
the FDA may require 
that certain 
 contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in 
the product labeling. In addition, 
the FDA may require 
post-marketing clinical 
 trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, which are designed to further assess a product s safety and effectiveness and 
may 
 require testing and 
surveillance programs to 
monitor the safety 
of approved products 
that have been 
commercialized. In addition, 
new 
 government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, 
or the FDA s 
policies may change, which 
 could impact the timeline for regulatory approval or otherwise impact ongoing 
development programs. 
 Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 The 
FDA is 
authorized 
to designate 
certain 
products 
for 
expedited 
development 
or review 
if 
they 
are intended 
to address 
an 
unmet 
 medical 
need 
in 
the 
treatment 
of 
a 
serious 
or 
life-threatening 
disease 
or 
condition. 
These 
programs 
include 
fast 
track 
designation, 
 breakthrough therapy designation and priority review designation. 
 The FDA has a fast track program 
that is intended to expedite or facilitate 
the process for reviewing new drugs 
and biologics that meet 
 certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs 
and biologics are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-
 threatening condition 
and preclinical or 
clinical data demonstrate 
the potential 
to address unmet 
medical needs 
for the condition. 
Fast 

41 
 track designation 
applies to 
the combination 
of the 
product and 
the specific 
indication for 
which it 
is being 
studied. The 
sponsor can 
 request the FDA to designate the product for fast track status any time before receiving NDA or BLA approval, but ideally no later than 
 the pre-NDA or pre-BLA meeting. 
 Additionally, 
a 
drug 
or 
biologic 
may 
be 
eligible 
for 
designation 
as 
a 
breakthrough 
therapy 
if 
the 
product 
is 
intended, 
alone 
or 
in 
 combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence 
 indicates 
that 
the 
product 
may 
demonstrate 
substantial 
improvement 
over 
currently 
approved 
therapies 
on 
one 
or 
more 
clinically 
 significant endpoints. The 
benefits of breakthrough 
therapy designation include 
the same 
benefits as fast 
track designation, plus 
intensive 
 guidance from the FDA to facilitate an efficient drug development 
program. 
 Any product 
submitted to 
the FDA 
for marketing, 
including under 
a fast 
track or 
breakthrough therapy 
designation program, 
may be 
 eligible for other 
types of FDA 
programs intended to 
expedite development and 
review, such as priority review 
and accelerated approval. 
 Any product is eligible for priority review if it 
treats a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide 
a significant 
 improvement 
in 
safety 
and 
effectiveness 
compared 
to 
available 
therapies. 
Priority 
review 
reduces 
the 
review 
time 
for 
an 
initial 
or 
 supplemental marketing application by four months. 
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later 
decide that the product no longer meets the conditions 
 for qualification or decide that the time 
period for FDA review or approval 
will not be shortened. Fast 
track designation, priority review, 
 and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval 
but may expedite the development or approval process. 
 Accelerated Approval Pathway 
 A product may be eligible 
for accelerated approval if it treats 
a serious or life-threatening condition and generally 
provides a meaningful 
 advantage over available therapies based on an effect on a surrogate endpoint 
that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a 
 clinical endpoint 
that can 
be measured 
earlier than 
irreversible morbidity 
or mortality 
("IMM") that 
is reasonably 
likely to 
predict an 
 effect on 
IMM or other 
clinical benefit. As 
a condition 
of accelerated approval, 
the FDA requires 
that a sponsor 
of a drug 
or biologic 
 receiving 
accelerated 
approval 
subsequently 
provide 
additional 
data 
confirming 
the 
anticipated 
clinical 
benefit, 
for 
example 
by 
 performing adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. If clinical benefit is not confirmed, accelerated approval may be 
 revoked. 

 In addition, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act for 
2023, Congress provided FDA additional statutory authority to 
mitigate 
 potential risks 
to patients 
from continued 
marketing of 
ineffective drugs 
previously granted 
accelerated approval. 
Under these 
recent 
 amendments 
to the 
FDCA, the 
agency may 
require a 
sponsor of 
a product 
granted 
accelerated approval 
to have 
a confirmatory 
trial 
 underway prior 
to approval. 
The sponsor 
must also 
submit progress 
reports on 
a confirmatory 
trial every 
six months 
until the 
trial is 
 complete, and 
such reports 
will be 
published on 
FDA s 
website. Failure 
to conduct 
required post-approval 
studies, or 
to confirm 
the 
 predicted clinical 
benefit of 
the product 
during post-marketing 
studies, allows 
the FDA 
to withdraw 
approval of 
the drug 
or biologic. 
 Congress also 
recently 
amended the 
law to 
give FDA 
the option 
of using 
expedited procedures 
to withdraw 
product 
approval if 
the 
 sponsor s confirmatory trial fails to verify the claimed clinical benefits 
of the product. 
 Granting of an EUA 
 The Commissioner 
of the 
FDA, under 
delegated authority 
from the 
Secretary of 
the U.S. 
Department of 
Health and 
Human Services 
 DHHS 
may, 
under 
certain 
circumstances, 
issue 
an 
Emergency 
Use 
Authorization, 
or 
EUA 
that 
would 
permit 
the 
use 
of 
an 
 unapproved drug product or unapproved use of an approved drug product. Before an EUA may be issued, the Secretary must declare an 
 emergency based on one of the following grounds: 
 
a 
determination 
by 
the 
Secretary 
of 
the 
Department 
of 
Homeland 
Security 
that 
there 
is 
a 
domestic 
emergency, 
or 
a 
 significant potential for a domestic emergency, involving a heightened risk of attack with a specified biological, chemical, 
 radiological or nuclear agent or agents; 
 
a determination by the Secretary of the Department of 
Defense that there is a military emergency, or a significant potential 
 for a military 
emergency, involving a heightened risk to 
U.S. military forces 
of attack with 
a specified biological, chemical, 
 radiological or nuclear agent or agents; or 
 
a determination by the 
Secretary of the DHHS that 
a public health emergency 
that affects, or has 
the significant potential 
 to affect, national 
security and that involves 
a specified biological, chemical, 
radiological or nuclear agent 
or agents, or a 
 specified disease or condition that may be attributable to such agent or 
agent. 
 In order to be the subject of an EUA, the FDA Commissioner 
must conclude that, based on the totality of scientific evidence 
available, 
 it is 
reasonable 
to believe 
that the 
product 
may be 
effective 
in diagnosing, 
treating or 
preventing a 
disease attributable 
to the 
agents 

42 
 described above, 
that the product s 
potential benefits 
outweigh its potential 
risks and that 
there is no 
adequate approved alternative 
to 
 the product. 
 Although an EUA cannot be issued until after 
an emergency has been declared by the Secretary 
of DHHS, the FDA strongly encourages 
 an entity with a possible candidate product, 
particularly one at an advanced stage of 
development, to contact the FDA center responsible 
 for the candidate product before a determination 
of actual or potential emergency. Such an entity may submit a 
request for consideration 
 that includes data 
to demonstrate that, 
based on the 
totality of scientific 
evidence available, it 
is reasonable to 
believe that the 
product 
 may 
be effective 
in diagnosing, 
treating 
or preventing 
the 
serious or 
life-threatening 
disease 
or 
condition. 
This 
is called 
a 
pre-EUA 
 submission and 
its purpose 
is to 
allow FDA 
review considering 
that during 
an emergency, 
the time 
available for 
the submission 
and 
 review of an EUA request may be severely limited. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Any drug 
or biological 
products for 
which we 
or our collaborators 
receive FDA 
approvals are 
subject to 
continuing regulation 
by the 
 FDA, includi 
ng, 
among 
other things, 
record-keeping 
requirements, reporting 
of adverse 
experiences 
with the 
product, providing 
the 
 FDA with updated 
safety and efficacy 
information, product sampling 
and distribution requirements, 
complying with certain 
electronic 
 records and 
signature requirements 
and complying 
with FDA 
promotion and 
advertising requirements, 
which include, 
among others, 
 standards 
for 
direct-to-consumer 
advertising, 
promoting 
drugs for 
uses or 
in patient 
populations 
that are 
not described 
in the 
drug s 
 approved 
labeling 
(known 
as 
 off-label 
use ), 
industry-sponsored 
scientific 
and 
educational 
activities, 
and 
promotional 
activities 
 involving the internet. 
 Failure to 
comply with 
FDA requirements 
can have 
negative consequences, 
including adverse 
publicity, 
enforcement letters 
from the 
 FDA, 
mandated 
corrective 
advertising 
or 
communications 
with 
doctors, 
and 
civil 
or 
criminal 
penalties. 
Although 
physicians 
may 
 prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers 
may not market or promote such off-label uses. 
 Manufacturers 
of 
our 
product 
candidates 
are 
required 
to 
comply 
with 
applicable 
FDA manufacturing 
requirements 
contained 
in 
the 
 FDA s 
cGMP 
regulations. 
cGMP 
regulations 
require, 
among 
other 
things, 
quality 
control 
and 
quality 
assurance 
as 
well 
as 
the 
 corresponding maintenance of 
records and documentation. 
Following approval, the FDA continues 
to monitor vaccine quality 
through 
 real-time monitoring of lots by requiring manufacturers to submit certain 
information for each vaccine lot. Vaccine 
manufacturers may 
 only distribute a lot 
following release by the 
FDA. Drug manufacturers and 
other entities involved in 
the manufacture and distribution 
 of 
approved 
drugs 
are 
required 
to 
register 
their 
establishments 
with 
the 
FDA and 
certain 
state agencies, 
and 
are 
subject to 
periodic 
 unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state 
agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. 
Accordingly, manufacturers 
 must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery 
 of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer 
or holder of an approved NDA or BLA, 
 including withdrawal 
of the 
product from 
the market. 
In addition, 
changes to 
the manufacturing 
process generally 
require prior 
FDA 
 approval before being implemented, and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional 
 labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. 
 U.S. Patent-term Extension 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of 
FDA approval of our product candidates, 
some of our U.S. patents may be 
eligible 
 for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term 
Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as 
 the Hatch-Waxman 
Amendments to 
the FDCA. 
The Hatch-Waxman 
Amendments 
permit extension 
of the 
patent 
term of 
up to 
five 
 years 
as compensation 
for 
patent 
term 
lost during 
product 
development 
and 
FDA regulatory 
review 
process. 
Patent-term 
extension, 
 however, 
cannot extend 
the remaining 
term of 
a patent 
beyond a 
total of 
14 years 
from the 
product s 
approval date. 
The patent-term 
 extension period is 
generally one-half the 
time between the effective 
date of an IND 
and the submission 
date of an 
NDA or BLA plus 
 the time between the submission date of an NDA or 
BLA and the approval of that application, except 
that the review period is reduced 
 by any time 
during which the applicant 
failed to exercise 
due diligence. Only 
one patent applicable 
to an approved drug 
is eligible for 
 the extension and 
the application for 
the extension must 
be submitted prior 
to the expiration 
of the patent. 
The U.S. Patent 
and Trademark 
 Office, or USPTO, 
in consultation with the 
FDA, reviews and approves 
the application for any patent 
term extension or restoration. 
In 
 the future, we 
may apply for 
extension of patent 
term for our 
currently owned or 
licensed patents to 
add patent life 
beyond its current 
 expiration date, 
depending on 
the expected 
length of 
the clinical trials 
and other factors 
involved in 
the filing of 
the relevant 
NDA or 
 BLA. 

U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 

 In general, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or the FCPA, prohibits 
offering to pay, paying, promising 
to pay, or 
 authorizing 
the payment 
of money 
or anything 
of value 
to a 
foreign 
official 
in order 
to influence 
any act 
or decision 
of the 
foreign 
 official in 
his or her 
official capacity 
or to secure 
any other improper 
advantage in order 
to obtain or 
retain business for 
or with, or 
in 
 order to direct business to, any person. The prohibitions apply not only to payments made to any foreign official, but also those made 
 to any foreign political party or official thereof, to any candidate for foreign 
political office or to any person, while knowing that all 
 or a portion of 
the payment will be 
offered, given, or 
promised to anyone 
in any of the 
foregoing categories. Foreign 
officials under 

43 
 the FCPA include officers or employees of 
a department, agency, or instrumentality 
of a foreign 
government. The term 
 instrumentality 
 is broad and can include state-owned or state-controlled entities. 

 Importantly, United States authorities 
that enforce the FCPA, 
including the Department of Justice, deem most health care professionals 
 and other employees 
of foreign hospitals, 
clinics, research facilities 
and medical schools 
in countries with 
public health care 
or public 
 education systems to be foreign officials under the FCPA. 
When we interact with foreign health care professionals and researchers in 
 testing and marketing our products abroad, 
we must have policies and procedures in place 
sufficient to prevent us and agents 
acting on 
 our behalf 
from providing 
any bribe, 
gift or 
gratuity, 
including excessive 
or lavish 
meals, travel 
or entertainment 
in connection 
with 
 marketing our future 
products and services or securing 
required permits and approvals 
such as those needed 
to initiate clinical trials in 
 foreign jurisdictions. 
The FCPA 
also obligates 
companies whose 
securities are 
listed in 
the United 
States to 
comply with 
accounting 
 provisions requiring the maintenance of books and records that 
accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the 
corporation, including 
 international subsidiaries, and the development and maintenance of an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international 
 operations. The Securities and Exchange Commission is involved with the books 
and records provisions of the FCPA. 
 Regulation in Europe and Other Regions 
 In addition 
to regulations 
in the 
United 
States, we 
and 
our collaborators 
are subject 
to a 
variety 
of regulations 
in other 
jurisdictions 
 governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution 
of our products. 
 Whether 
or not 
we or 
our collaborators 
obtain 
FDA approval 
for 
a product, 
we must 
obtain the 
requisite 
approvals 
from regulatory 
 authorities 
in 
foreign 
countries prior 
to 
the 
commencement 
of 
clinical 
trials or 
marketing 
of 
the 
product 
in 
those 
countries. 
Certain 
 countries outside 
of the 
United States 
have a 
similar process 
that requires 
the submission 
of a 
clinical trial 
application much 
like the 
 IND 
prior 
to 
the 
commencement 
of 
human 
clinical 
trials. 
In 
the 
European 
Union, 
for 
example, 
a 
CTA 
must 
be 
submitted 
to 
each 
 country s 
national health 
authority and 
an independent 
ethics committee, much 
like the FDA 
and IRB, respectively. 
Once the CTA 
is 
 approved in accordance with a country s 
requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. 
 The requirements and process governing the conduct 
of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement 
vary from country 
 to country. 
In all 
cases, the 
clinical trials 
are conducted 
in accordance 
with GCPs and 
the applicable 
regulatory requirements 
and the 
 ethical principles on human subjects research that have their origin in 
the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 To 
obtain regulatory 
approval of 
an investigational 
drug or 
biological product 
under European 
Union regulatory 
systems, we 
or our 
 strategic partners must 
submit a marketing 
authorization application. The 
application in the European 
Union is similar to 
that required 
 in the United States, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific 
document requirements. 
 For other 
countries outside 
of the European 
Union, such as 
countries in 
Asia, Europe 
and Latin America, 
the requirements 
governing 
 the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical 
 trials are conducted in accordance with GCPs 
and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that 
have their origin 
 in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 Employees and Human Capital Resources 
 As of December 31, 2022, 
we employed 87 full-time 
employees and 2 part-time 
employees. Of these 87 
full-time employees, 83 
were 
 located in the United States, 2 were located in Ireland, 1 was located in 
Taiwan and 1 was located in the UK. 
As of March 15, 2023, we 
 employed 76 full-time 
employees and 1 
part-time employee. 
Of these 76 
full-time employees, 
72 were located 
in the United 
States, 2 
 were located in Ireland, 1 was located in Taiwan and 1 was located in the UK. 
None of our employees are represented by a labor union 
 or are party to a collective bargaining agreement, 
and we have had no labor-related work stoppages. 

 Compensation, Benefits, Recruitment and Retention Strategy 
 We aim to focus on attracting, motivating and retaining 
talented employees with relevant experience who 
can contribute to the sustained 
 performance of the Company and its day-to-day operations. 
 We believe our total compensation package helps recruit and retain our employees. We strive to provide compensation and benefits that 
 are competitive to market and create 
incentives to attract and retain employees. Our 
compensation package includes market-competitive 
 pay, 
broad-based 
stock grants, 
health 
care and 
401(k) plan 
benefits, 
paid 
time off 
and family 
leave, 
among 
others. We 
also provide 
 annual incentive bonus 
opportunities that are 
tied to both 
company performance as 
well as individual 
performance to foster 
a pay-for-
 performance culture. 
 Scientific Advisory Board 
 We have assembled a highly qualified scientific advisory board composed of advisors who have deep expertise in 
the fields of biologics 
 and vaccine development, as well as in the relevant therapeutic areas for our 
product candidates.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 Investing in our Class A 
common stock involves a high degree 
of risk. 
The following information sets forth risk 
factors that could cause 
 our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements we have made in this Annual Report on Form 
 10-K 
and 
those 
we 
may 
make 
from 
time 
to 
time. 
You 
should 
carefully 
consider 
the 
risks described 
below, 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
other 
 information contained 
in this Report 
and our other 
public filings, before 
you decide to 
purchase shares of 
our Class A 
common stock. 
 Our business, financial 
condition or results 
of operations could 
be harmed by 
any of these 
risks. The risks 
and uncertainties described 
 below are not the 
only ones we face. 
Additional risks not presently 
known to us or 
other factors not perceived 
by us to 
present significant 
 risks to our business at this time also may impair our business operations. 

 Summary Risk Factors 
 Our business is 
subject to a 
number of risks, including 
risks that may 
prevent us from achieving 
our business objectives or 
may adversely 
 affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. These risks are discussed more fully under Part II, Item 1A. 
 Risk Factors. The following is a summary of some of the principal risks we face: 

clinical drug development 
involves a lengthy and expensive 
process, and if our 
pre-clinical development or clinical 
trials 
 are prolonged or delayed or do not achieve expected results, we may be unable 
to commercialize our product candidates; 

we depend on intellectual property licensed from UBI and its affiliates, the termination of which could result in the loss of 
 significant rights; 

even if we obtain regulatory approval of, or commercialize, any of our product candidates in one 
or more jurisdictions, we 
 may never obtain approval for, or commercialize 
, 
our product candidates in other jurisdictions; 

after receipt 
of regulatory 
approval for 
a product 
candidate, our 
products will 
remain subject 
to regulatory 
scrutiny and 
 post-marketing 
requirements, which 
may include 
burdensome post-approval 
trial or 
risk management 
requirements that 
 may 
adversely 
impact 
the 
financial 
results 
of 
any 
future 
commercialization 
efforts 
or 
cause 
us 
to 
choose 
not 
to 
 commercialize the product candidate; 

if we 
are able 
to commercialize 
any product 
candidate, the 
successful commercialization 
of such 
product candidate 
will 
 depend 
on 
the 
extent 
governmental 
authorities, 
private 
health 
insurers 
and 
other 
third-party 
payors 
provide 
coverage, 
 adequate reimbursement levels and favorable pricing policies; 

the manufacture of peptide-based medicines is complex and manufacturers 
often encounter difficulties in production; 

we have no history of commercializing pharmaceutical products, which may make it difficult to evaluate the prospects for 
 our future viability; 

the regulatory landscape that 
will govern our 
product candidates is 
uncertain, and changes in 
regulatory requirements could 
 result in delays or discontinuation of development of our product candidates or 
unexpected costs; 

developments by competitors may render our products or technologies obsolete or non-competitive or may reduce 
the size 
 of our markets; 

our capital resources may 
not be sufficient to 
successfully complete the development 
and commercialization of our 
product 
 candidates, which could delay, 
limit, reduce or terminate our development or commercialization efforts; 

we have incurred significant losses since inception, and we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future 
and may never 
 achieve or maintain profitability; 

conflicts of interest and disputes exist and may further 
arise between us and UBI and its affiliates, and 
these conflicts and 
 disputes might ultimately be resolved in a manner unfavorable to us; 
 
we will need to expand our organization, and we 
may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could 
disrupt 
 our operations; 

the 
dual-class 
structure 
of 
our 
common 
stock 
and 
the 
Voting 
Agreement 
(as 
defined 
below) 
will 
have 
the 
effect 
of 
 concentrating voting power, which will significantly 
limit your ability to influence significant corporate decisions; 

46 
 
we rely on contract manufacturers for the manufacture of raw materials 
for our research programs, pre-clinical studies and 
 clinical trials and we 
do not have long-term contracts 
with many of these 
parties, which could impact our 
ability to develop 
 and commercialize our products; 

undetected errors or defects in our production could harm our reputation 
or expose us to product liability claims; 

we rely on 
in-licensed intellectual property 
and technology, 
and the loss 
of such rights, 
our licensors inability 
or refusal 
 to enforce or defend 
such rights, and any requirement 
to pay amounts under 
current or future agreements 
could harm our 
 business; 

the 
degree of 
protection 
afforded 
by our 
intellectual 
property 
rights is 
uncertain 
because 
such rights 
offer 
only limited 
 protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep a competitive 
advantage; 

we have previously 
identified and remediated 
material weaknesses, in 
our internal control 
over financial reporting 
and if 
 we 
are 
unable 
to 
maintain 
an 
effective 
system 
of 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting, 
or 
if 
we 
discover 
material 
 deficiencies in 
the future, 
we may 
not be 
able to 
accurately report 
our financial 
results or 
prevent fraud, 
and as 
a result, 
 shareholders 
could lose 
confidence in 
our financial 
and other 
public reporting, 
which would 
harm our 
business and 
the 
 trading price of our Class A common stock; 

cyberattacks 
or 
other 
failures 
in 
our 
or 
our 
third-party 
vendors , 
contractors 
or 
consultants 
telecommunications 
or 
 information 
technology 
systems 
could 
result 
in 
information 
theft, 
compromise, 
or 
other 
unauthorized 
access, 
data 
 corruption and significant disruption of our business 
operations, and could harm our reputation and subject 
us to liability, 
 lawsuits and actions from governmental authorities; and 

we are 
subject to 
privacy, 
tax, anti-corruption 
and other 
stringent laws, 
regulations, policies 
and contractual 
obligations 
 across multiple jurisdictions and changes in, or our failure to comply with, such laws, 
regulations, policies and contractual 
 obligations could adversely affect our business, financial 
condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 Risks Related to the Discovery and Development of Product Candidates 

 Clinical drug development 
involves a 
lengthy and expensive 
process with uncertain 
timelines and 
uncertain outcomes, 
and results 
 of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future results. If our pre-clinical development or clinical trials are prolonged or 
 delayed, 
or if 
we do 
not or 
cannot achieve 
the results 
we expect, 
we may 
be unable 
to obtain 
required regulatory 
approvals, 
and 
 therefore be unable to commercialize our product candidates on a timely basis or at 
all. 
 Our business is 
dependent on 
the successful development, 
regulatory approval 
and commercialization 
of product 
candidates based on 
 our 
Vaxxine 
Platform. 
If 
we 
and 
our 
collaborators 
are 
unable 
to 
obtain 
approval 
for 
and 
effectively 
commercialize 
our 
product 
 candidates, our 
business would 
be significantly 
harmed. Even 
if we 
complete the 
necessary pre-clinical 
studies and 
clinical trials, 
the 
 regulatory 
approval 
process 
is 
expensive, 
time-consuming 
and 
uncertain, 
and 
we 
may 
not 
be 
able 
to 
obtain 
approvals 
for 
the 
 commercialization of any product candidates we may develop. 
Changes in regulatory approval policies, changes in or the enactment 
of 
 additional statutes 
or regulations, 
or changes 
in regulatory 
review processes, 
may cause delays 
in the 
approval of 
a particular 
product 
 candidate or 
rejection of 
an application 
for a 
particular product 
candidate. We 
have not 
obtained regulatory 
approval for 
any product 
 candidate to date, 
and it is 
possible that none 
of our existing 
product candidates 
or any product 
candidates we may 
seek to develop 
in 
 the future will ever 
obtain regulatory approval. 
Any regulatory approval we 
ultimately obtain may be 
limited or subject to restrictions, 
 including labeling 
requirements, or 
post-approval commitments 
that render 
the approved 
product not 
commercially viable. 
While our 
 enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay ELISA 
test has 
received an 
EUA from 
the FDA, 
there can 
be no 
assurance that 
any of 
our 
 product candidates will receive an EUA or regulatory approval 
or that there will not be changes 
in formulation, whether required by any 
 regulatory 
authority 
or 
at 
our 
determination 
for 
operational 
or 
scientific 
reasons, 
affecting 
the 
use 
of 
our 
products. 
Further, 
some 
 countries may not rely on an EUA or regulatory approval issued by another jurisdiction, and we may be required 
to seek separate EUAs 
 or regulatory approval from different regulatory authorities in different jurisdictions. See Risk Factors Even 
if we obtain approval of 
 any 
of our 
product 
candidates 
in 
one 
jurisdiction, 
we 
may never 
obtain 
approval 
for or 
commercialize 
any 
of our 
products 
in 
other 
 jurisdictions, which would limit our ability to realize their full market potential. 

 To 
obtain the requisite 
regulatory approvals to 
market and sell 
any of our 
product candidates, we 
must demonstrate through 
extensive 
 pre-clinical studies and clinical trials that our products are safe and effective in humans. Clinical testing is 
expensive and can take many 
 years to complete, and its outcome 
is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur 
at any time during the clinical trial process. 
The results of 
 pre-clinical studies and early clinical trials of our product candidates may not be 
predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials and 
 results from post-hoc 
data analysis may not 
be predictive of 
final results and 
may not support 
product approval. 
Product candidates in 
 later 
stages 
of 
clinical 
trials may 
fail 
to 
show 
the desired 
safety 
and 
efficacy 
characteristics 
despite 
having 
progressed 
through 
pre-
 clinical 
studies 
and 
initial 
clinical 
trials. 
For 
example, 
an 
EUA 
for 
UB-612 
was 
denied 
by 
the 
TFDA 
in 
August 
2021 
because 
the 
 neutralizing antibody response 
generated by UB-612, 
as compared 
to a 
designated adenovirus vectored 
vaccine, did not 
meet the 
TFDA s 
 specified evaluation 
criteria. 
If results 
from our 
clinical trials 
differ from 
previous reports 
or market 
expectations, such 
as a 
potential 

47 
 development of 
market expectations 
that COVID-19 
boosters or 
vaccines be 
developed specifically 
to address 
certain variants 
which 
 we 
fail 
to 
satisfy, 
or 
if 
we 
fail 
to 
obtain 
a 
required 
regulatory 
approval, 
the 
price 
of 
our 
Class 
A 
common 
stock 
could 
decrease 
 substantially. Several 
companies in the biopharmaceutical 
industry have suffered 
significant setbacks in advanced 
clinical trials due to 
 lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier 
trials. Our ongoing and future clinical trials may 
 not be successful. 
 Further, 
while 
we 
have 
conducted 
limited 
head-to-head 
comparisons 
in 
pre-clinical 
studies 
of 
UB-313 
and 
VXX-401, 
we 
have 
not 
 conducted a head-to-head 
comparison of any 
competing products to 
any of our 
chronic disease product 
candidates in any 
clinical trial 
 to date. We have compared the 
published data for certain 
of our competitors products 
to the clinical 
trial results of certain 
of our product 
 candidates. Accordingly, 
the value 
of comparisons 
of our 
product candidates 
to any 
alternative products 
in this report 
may be 
limited 
 because they are not derived from a head-to-head clinical trial, rather they are from trials that were conducted under different protocols, 
 at different sites, 
with different patient 
populations, at different 
times and results 
were analyzed using 
non-standardized assays performed 
 internally or by different clinical 
research organizations CROs ). Without 
head-to-head data, we will be unable 
to make comparative 
 claims for our product candidates, if 
any such product candidate is approved. Future 
clinical trials may not confirm the comparisons 
or 
 analyses we have made to date. 
 Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory authorities legal requirements, regulations or guidelines and 
 are 
subject 
to oversight 
by these 
governmental 
agencies 
as well 
as Institutional 
Review Boards IRBs 
at 
the 
medical 
institutions 
 where the clinical 
trials are conducted. 
In addition, clinical 
trials must be conducted 
with supplies of 
our product candidates 
produced 
 in 
accordance 
with 
current 
good 
manufacturing 
practices cGMP 
and 
other 
legal 
and 
regulatory 
requirements. 
Defects 
in 
 manufacturing 
of 
a 
clinical 
trial 
batch 
or 
a 
failure 
of 
a 
batch 
to 
meet 
all quality 
control 
test 
specifications 
could 
result 
in 
delays 
to 
 initiation 
of our 
clinical 
trials. 
We 
depend 
on medical 
institutions 
and 
CROs to 
conduct 
our 
clinical 
trials in 
compliance 
with 
good 
 clinical 
practice GCP ), 
and 
other 
applicable 
laws 
and 
regulations. 
Failure 
to 
follow 
and 
document 
adherence 
to 
such 
laws 
and 
 regulations may 
lead to 
significant delays 
in the 
availability of 
product for 
our clinical 
trials, result 
in the 
termination of 
or a 
clinical 
 hold being 
placed on 
one or 
more of 
our clinical 
trials, or 
delay or 
prevent submission 
or approval 
of marketing 
applications for 
our 
 product candidates. 
 To the extent our CROs fail to enroll participants for 
our clinical trials, fail to conduct the 
trial in accordance with the trial 
protocol GCP 
 or are 
delayed for 
a significant 
time in 
the execution 
of trials, 
including 
achieving full 
enrollment, we 
may be 
affected 
by increased 
 costs, program 
delays or 
both, which 
may harm 
our business 
and 
delay 
our 
ability to 
seek approval 
for our 
product 
candidates. For 
 example, 
due 
in part 
to an 
error by 
the CRO 
responsible 
for administering 
blinded placebo 
and active 
doses to 
trial subjects, 
which 
 reduced the confidence 
of subsequently collected 
data, we decided 
to discontinue a 
Phase 2a LTE trial for 
UB-311. In that case, 
however, 
 we determined that we had collected sufficient data on UB-311 s 
tolerability and immunogenicity. 

 The completion of clinical trials 
for our clinical product 
candidates may be delayed, suspended or 
terminated because of many factors, 
 including but not limited to: 
 
the delay or refusal of regulators or IRBs to authorize us to commence a clinical trial 
at a prospective trial site; 
 
changes in regulatory requirements, policies and guidelines; 
 
delays or failure to reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites, the terms of which 
 can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among 
different CROs and trial sites; 
 
delays in patient enrollment and variability in the number and types of patients 
available for clinical trials; 
 
negative or 
inconclusive results, 
which may 
require us 
to conduct 
additional pre-clinical 
or clinical 
trials or 
to abandon 
 product candidates that we expect to be promising; 
 
delays in manufacturing and control of clinical trial materials; 
 
shortages of materials required for the production of our product candidates; 
 
disruptions from events surrounding the Russia-Ukraine conflict 
 
the timing, scope and effectiveness of U.S. and international 
governmental, regulatory, 
fiscal, monetary and public health 
 responses to the COVID-19 pandemic; 
 
safety or tolerability 
concerns causing us 
to suspend or 
terminate a trial 
if it is 
determined that 
the participants are 
being 
 exposed to unacceptable health risks; 

48 
 
lower than anticipated retention rates of patients and volunteers in clinical trials and difficulty in maintaining contact with 
 patients after treatment, resulting in incomplete data; 
 
failure of us, our CROs or clinical trial sites to comply with regulatory requirements; 
 
failure of our CROs or clinical trial sites to meet their contractual 
obligations to us in a timely manner, 
or at all, deviating 
 from the clinical trial protocol or dropping out of a trial; 
 
delays relating to adding new clinical trial sites; 
 
delays in establishing necessary pre-clinical or clinical data; 
 
the occurrence of unexpected severe or serious product-related adverse 
events in a clinical trial; 
 
the quality or stability of the product candidate falling below acceptable standards; 
 
the inability to produce or obtain sufficient quantities of the 
product candidate to complete clinical trials on time, 
or delays 
 in sufficiently developing, characterizing or controlling 
a manufacturing process suitable for clinical trials; 
 
supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures; 
 
the lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial; 
 
developments 
observed 
in 
trials 
conducted 
by 
competitors 
for 
related 
technology 
that 
raises 
general 
concerns 
from 
 regulatory authorities about risk to patients of similar vaccine technology; 
 
the determination that a product candidate will not be producible in relevant quantities 
at the manufacturing stage; 
 
the failure of regulatory authorities such as the FDA, MHRA or TGA to approve our manufacturing processes or facilities 
 or those of contract manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial 
supplies; and 
 
the transfer 
of manufacturing processes 
to larger-scale 
facilities operated 
by contract manufacturers 
or by us, 
and delays 
 or failure by our contract manufacturers or us to make any necessary changes to 
such manufacturing process. 
 In addition, 
pre-clinical and 
clinical data 
are often 
susceptible to 
varying interpretations 
and analyses 
and results 
from post-hoc 
data 
 analysis 
may 
not 
be 
predictive 
of 
final 
results 
and 
may 
not 
support 
product 
approval. 
Many 
companies 
that 
believed 
their 
product 
 candidates performed 
satisfactorily in 
pre-clinical studies 
and clinical 
trials have 
nonetheless failed 
to obtain 
marketing approval 
for 
 their product candidates. Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and in determining when or whether 
 regulatory approval 
will be obtained 
for any of 
our product candidates. 
Additionally, 
the FDA typically 
does not accept 
post-hoc data 
 analyses 
as support 
for 
regulatory 
approval. 
Even 
if 
we 
believe 
the 
data 
collected 
from 
clinical 
trials of 
our 
product 
candidates 
are 
 promising, such data 
may not be sufficient 
to support approval by 
regulatory authorities. Regulatory 
authorities may disagree 
with the 
 design or implementation of our clinical 
trials and may disagree with 
our interpretation of data from pre-clinical 
studies or clinical trials. 
 In some instances, there can be significant variability in safety or efficacy results between different trials of the same product candidate 
 due 
to 
numerous 
factors, 
including 
changes 
in 
trial 
procedures 
set forth 
in 
protocols, 
differences 
in 
the 
size and 
type 
of 
the 
patient 
 populations, adherence to the dosing 
regimen and other trial 
procedures and the rate of 
dropout among clinical trial participants. 
Further, 
 none 
of 
our 
trials 
to 
date 
of 
UB-311 
have 
been 
large 
enough 
to 
determine 
whether 
their 
assessments 
of 
efficacy 
were 
statistically 
 significant. Therefore, we are 
able to report 
potential trends on 
such measures, but 
we will 
not be able 
to make more 
definitive statements 
 about 
the 
efficacy 
of 
our 
product 
candidates 
until 
we 
complete 
clinical 
trials 
that 
are 
adequately 
powered 
to 
demonstrate 
statistical 
 significance of clinically meaningful results. 
 Moreover, for AD, 
given the difficulties in assessing 
whether a product candidate is disease-modifying 
in terms of interrupting disease 
 pathology and delaying cognitive decline, 
we plan to include in our 
trial designs for UB-311 biomarker endpoints and, if 
our trial results 
 warrant, may apply 
for regulatory approval 
based on biomarker 
data. While the 
FDA recently approved 
aducanumab based on biomarker 
 data, there is no assurance that the FDA will accept biomarker data for other product 
candidates, including UB-311, in the future. 

 Even if 
we obtain 
approval 
of 
any 
of our 
product 
candidates 
in one 
or 
more 
jurisdictions, 
we may 
never obtain 
approval 
for or 
 commercialize any 
of our 
products in 
other jurisdictions, 
which would 
limit our 
ability to 
realize the 
full market 
potential 
of our 
 product candidates. 
 To 
market 
any 
products, 
we 
must 
establish 
and 
comply 
with 
numerous 
and 
varying 
regulatory 
requirements 
in 
different 
countries 
 regarding safety and efficacy and obtain relevant approvals to market 
our product candidates. As discussed in another risk factor above 

49 
 
 Clinical drug 
development involves 
a lengthy 
and expensive 
process) an 
EUA for 
UB-612 was 
denied by 
the TFDA 
in August 
 2021. Approval by a 
foreign regulatory authority in any 
other jurisdiction does not ensure 
approval by comparable regulatory authorities 
 in other countries or jurisdictions, including approval by the FDA in the United States. The failure to 
obtain approval in one jurisdiction 
 may delay or otherwise negatively 
impact our ability to obtain approval elsewhere. 
In addition, clinical trials conducted in 
one country 
 may 
not 
be 
accepted 
by 
regulatory 
authorities 
in 
other 
countries. 
Approval 
procedures 
vary 
among 
countries 
and 
even 
if 
we 
have 
 obtained 
approval 
in 
one 
country, 
approval 
in 
other 
countries 
can 
involve 
additional 
product 
testing 
and 
validation 
and 
additional 
 administrative review periods. 
 Seeking 
regulatory 
approvals 
in 
different 
countries 
could 
result 
in 
additional 
and 
unexpected 
costs 
for 
us, 
including 
as 
a 
result 
of 
 additional required pre-clinical studies or clinical trials which would be costly and time-consuming. 
Satisfying regulatory requirements 
 is costly, 
time-consuming, uncertain 
and may be 
subject to unanticipated 
delays. In addition, 
our failure to 
obtain regulatory 
approval 
 in any country may delay or have negative effects on the process for regulatory approval in other countries. Apart from our ELISA test, 
 which 
has 
been 
approved 
for 
sale 
by 
the 
FDA 
through 
an 
EUA, 
we 
do 
not 
have 
any 
product 
candidates 
approved 
for 
sale 
in 
any 
 jurisdiction, including international 
markets. We 
do not have experience 
in obtaining regulatory approval 
in international markets, and 
 we 
will 
be 
relying 
on 
our 
collaboration 
partners 
such 
as 
UBIA 
to 
assist 
us 
in 
this 
process. 
If 
we 
fail 
to 
comply 
with 
regulatory 
 requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required approvals, our ability to realize the full market potential 
of our 
 products will be harmed. 
 Interim, top-line and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we 
announce or publish from time to time may change as more 
 patient data become available 
and are also subject 
to audit and verification 
procedures that could result 
in material changes in 
the 
 final data. 
 From time to time, 
we may publicly disclose 
preliminary or top-line data from 
our pre-clinical studies and 
clinical trials, which are 
based 
 on a preliminary analysis 
of then-available data, and 
the results and related findings 
and conclusions are subject 
to change following a 
 more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular study 
or trial. We also may make assumptions, estimations, calculations 
 and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and 
we may not have received or had the opportunity to 
fully and carefully evaluate all 
 data. 
As 
a 
result, 
the 
top-line 
or 
preliminary 
results 
that 
we 
report 
may 
differ 
from 
future 
results 
of 
the 
same 
studies, 
or 
different 
 conclusions or considerations may qualify such 
results, once additional data have been received and fully 
evaluated. Top-line data 
also 
 remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final 
data being materially different from the preliminary 
data 
 we previously published. As a result, top-line data should be viewed with 
caution until the final data are available. 
 From time 
to time, 
we may 
also disclose 
interim data 
from our 
pre-clinical studies 
and clinical 
trials. Interim 
data from 
clinical trials 
 that we 
may complete 
are subject 
to the 
risk that 
one or 
more of 
the clinical 
outcomes may 
materially 
change as 
patient enrollment 
 continues 
and 
more 
patient 
data 
become 
available 
or 
as 
patients 
from 
our 
clinical 
trials continue 
other 
treatments 
for 
their 
disease. 
 Adverse 
differences 
between 
preliminary 
or 
interim 
data 
and 
final 
data 
could 
significantly 
harm 
our 
business 
prospects. 
Further, 
 disclosure of interim data by us or by our competitors could result in volatility 
in the price of our Class A common stock. 
 For instance, 
in the fourth 
quarter of 2022 
we announced conclusions 
from an end-of-treatment 
analysis of Part 
B of our 
Phase 1 trial 
 of UB-312 in PD patients, and top-line results of our Phase 3 trial of 
UB-612. 
These conclusions remain subject to change following a 
 more comprehensive 
review of 
the data, 
or following 
additional data 
which from 
the same 
respective trials 
or programs 
that support 
 different conclusions. 
 Further, others, 
including regulatory authorities, 
may not accept or 
agree with our assumptions, 
estimates, calculations, conclusions 
or 
 analyses 
or 
may 
interpret 
or 
weigh 
the 
importance 
of 
data 
differently, 
which 
could 
impact 
the 
value 
of 
the 
particular 
program, 
the 
 approvability 
or 
commercialization 
of 
the 
particular 
product 
candidate 
or 
product 
and 
the 
Company 
in 
general. 
In 
addition, 
the 
 information 
we 
choose 
to 
publicly 
disclose 
regarding 
a 
particular 
study 
or 
clinical 
trial 
is 
based 
on 
what 
is 
typically 
extensive 
 information, and you or others may not agree with what we determine is material or otherwise appropriate information to include in our 
 disclosure. 
 If we encounter difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trials, our clinical development activities could be delayed and result in 
 increased costs and longer development periods or otherwise be adversely affected. 
 We 
will be 
required 
to identify 
and enroll 
a sufficient 
number of 
patients for 
our planned 
clinical trials. 
Trial 
participant 
enrollment 
 could be 
limited in 
future trials 
given 
that many 
potential participants 
may be 
ineligible because 
of pre-existing 
conditions, medical 
 treatments or other reasons. 
For example, the next 
phase of our UB-311 
development could be affected 
by worldwide effects resulting 
 from the 
Russia-Ukraine conflict 
and other 
geopolitical factors. 
We 
may not 
be able 
to initiate 
or continue 
clinical trials 
required by 
 applicable 
regulatory authorities 
or any 
of our 
other product 
candidates 
that we 
pursue if 
we are 
unable to 
locate and 
enroll 
enough 
 eligible patients or volunteers to participate in these clinical trials. Patient 
enrollment is affected by other factors, as 
well, including the 
 incidence 
and 
severity 
of the 
disease 
under 
investigation; 
the 
design 
of 
the 
clinical 
trial 
protocol; 
the 
size and 
nature 
of 
the 
patient 
 population; 
the 
eligibility 
criteria 
for 
the 
trial 
in 
question; 
the 
perceived 
risks 
and 
benefits 
of 
the 
product 
candidate 
under 
trial; 
the 
 perceived safety 
and tolerability 
of the product 
candidate; the proximity 
and availability of 
clinical trial sites 
for prospective 
patients; 
 the availability 
of competing 
therapies and 
clinical trials; 
effects of 
the COVID-19 
pandemic on 
our clinical 
trial sites; 
our ability 
to 

50 
 monitor patients adequately 
during and after 
treatment; patient referral 
practices of physicians; clinicians 
and patients perceptions 
as 
 to the 
potential advantages 
of the 
drug being 
studied in 
relation to 
other available 
therapies, including 
standard-of-care and 
any new 
 drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating; and efforts 
to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials. 
 We 
also may 
encounter 
difficulties 
in identifying 
and enrolling 
such patients 
with a 
stage of 
disease appropriate 
for our 
ongoing or 
 future clinical 
trials. In 
addition, the 
process of 
finding and 
diagnosing patients 
may prove 
costly. 
Our inability 
to enroll 
a sufficient 
 number of 
patients for 
any of 
our clinical 
trials would 
result in 
significant delays 
or may 
require us 
to abandon 
one or 
more clinical 
 trials. 
 Even if 
we obtain 
regulatory approval 
for a 
product candidate, 
our products 
will remain 
subject to 
regulatory scrutiny 
and post-
 marketing requirements. 
 Any regulatory approvals that we may receive for our product candidates will 
require the submission of reports to regulatory authorities 
 and ongoing surveillance to 
monitor the safety and 
efficacy of the product 
candidate, may contain significant 
limitations related to use 
 restrictions for 
specified age gro 
ups, warnings, 
precautions or 
contraindications, and 
may include 
burdensome post-approval 
study or 
 risk management 
requirements. For 
example, the 
FDA may 
require a 
Risk Evaluation 
and Mitigation 
Strategy REMS 
to approve 
 our 
product 
candidates, 
which 
could 
entail 
requirements 
for 
a 
medication 
guide, 
physician 
training 
and 
communication 
plans 
or 
 additional elements 
to ensure 
safe use, 
such as 
restricted distribution 
methods, patient 
registries and 
other risk 
minimization tools. 
In 
 addition, if one 
of our product 
candidates is approved 
in the 
United States or 
abroad, it will 
be subject to 
ongoing regulatory requirements 
 for manufacturing, 
labeling, packaging, 
storage, advertising, 
promotion, sampling, 
record-keeping, conduct 
of post-marketing 
studies 
 and 
submission 
of 
safety, 
efficacy 
and 
other 
post- 
market 
information. 
Manufacturers 
and 
manufacturers 
facilities 
are 
required 
to 
 comply 
with extensive 
requirements by 
regulatory authorities, 
including 
ensuring that 
quality control 
and manufacturing 
procedures 
 conform to cGMP regulations. As such, we and our contract manufacturers will be subject to continual review and inspections to assess 
 compliance with cGMP and adherence to commitments 
made in any approved marketing application. Accordingly, 
we and others with 
 whom 
we 
work 
must 
continue 
to 
expend 
time, 
money 
and 
effort 
in 
all 
areas 
of 
regulatory 
compliance, 
including 
manufacturing, 
 production and quality control. 
 If a 
regulatory authority such 
as the 
FDA discovers previously 
unknown problems with 
a product, such 
as adverse 
events of 
unanticipated 
 severity 
or 
frequency, 
or 
problems 
with 
product 
quality 
or 
the 
facility 
where 
the 
product 
is 
manufactured, 
or 
disagrees 
with 
the 
 promotion, 
marketing 
or 
labeling 
of 
a 
product, 
such 
regulatory 
authorities 
may 
impose 
restrictions 
on 
that 
product 
or us, 
including 
 requiring withdrawal of the 
product from the market. 
If we fail 
to comply with applicable 
regulatory requirements, a regulatory authority 
 or 
enforcement 
authority 
may, 
among 
other 
things: 
issue 
warning 
letters; 
impose 
civil 
or 
criminal 
penalties; 
suspend 
or 
withdraw 
 regulatory approval; suspend any of 
our clinical trials; refuse to approve 
pending applications or supplements to 
approved applications 
 submitted 
by 
us; 
impose 
restrictions 
on 
our 
operations, 
including 
closing 
our 
contract 
manufacturers 
facilities; 
or 
seize 
or 
detain 
 products, or require a product recall. 
 Any government 
investigation of 
alleged violations 
of law 
could require 
us to 
expend significant 
time and 
resources in 
response and 
 could 
generate 
negative 
publicity. 
Any 
failure 
to 
comply 
with 
ongoing 
regulatory 
requirements 
may 
adversely 
affect 
our 
ability 
to 
 commercialize and generate 
revenue from our products. 
If regulatory sanctions 
are applied or if 
regulatory approval is withdrawn, 
our 
 business will be seriously 
harmed. Further, 
if a regulatory authority 
identifies previously unknown 
problems with our platform, 
any or 
 all of our product candidates may also be affected. 
 Furthermore, the burden of these requirements may outweigh any benefit or revenue that we could generate from product sales. Even if 
 we obtain 
regulatory approval 
for a 
product candidate 
, 
compliance with 
the many 
post-approval regulations 
may be 
so costly 
that it 
 becomes 
financially 
prudent 
to 
abandon 
the 
product 
or 
sell 
ownership 
of 
the 
underlying 
intellectual 
property 
at 
prices 
that 
are 
not 
 sufficient to recoup our investment in developing the product. 

 Moreover, the policies of regulatory authorities may change, and additional government 
regulations may be enacted that could prevent, 
 limit or delay regulatory 
approval of our product 
candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature 
or extent of government 
regulation 
 that may arise from 
future legislation or administrative or 
executive action, either in 
the United States 
or abroad. If we 
are slow or unable 
 to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption 
of new requirements or policies, or if we 
are not able to maintain regulatory 
 compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained 
and we may not achieve or sustain profitability. 
 We have no history of commercializing pharmaceutical products, which 
may make it difficult to 
evaluate the prospects for our 
future 
 viability. 
 We commenced operations through 
UNS and 
COVAXX in 2014 and 2020, 
respectively, and as Vaxxinity in March 
2021. Our operations 
 to date 
have been 
limited to 
organizing 
and staffing 
Vaxxinity, 
business planning, 
raising capital, 
developing our 
Vaxxine 
Platform, 
 identifying 
and 
testing 
potential 
product 
candidates 
and 
conducting 
clinical 
trials. 
We 
have 
a 
limited 
track 
record 
of 
successfully 
 conducting late-stage clinical trials, obtaining marketing approvals, manufacturing a commercial-scale product 
or arranging for a third-
 party 
to 
do 
so 
on 
our 
behalf, 
or 
conducting 
sales 
and 
marketing 
activities 
necessary 
for 
successful 
product 
commercialization. 
 Accordingly, 
you should consider 
our prospects considering 
the costs, uncertainties, 
delays and difficulties 
frequently encountered 
by 

51 
 companies in the early stages of development, especially clinical-stage biopharmaceutical companies such as ours. Any predictions you 
 make about our 
future success or 
viability may not 
be as accurate 
as they could 
be if we had 
a longer operating 
history or a 
history of 
 successfully developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products. 
 We 
may 
encounter 
unforeseen 
expenses, 
difficulties, 
complications, 
delays 
and 
other 
known 
or 
unknown 
factors 
in 
achieving 
our 
 business objectives. We will eventually need to 
transition from a 
company with a 
development focus to a 
company capable of 
supporting 
 commercial activities. We 
may not be successful in such a transition. 
 We 
expect our 
financial condition 
and operating 
results to 
continue to 
fluctuate significantly 
from quarter 
to quarter 
and year 
to year 
 due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, 
you should not rely upon the results of any quarterly or 
 annual periods as indications of future operating performance. 
 Our product candidates 
may cause undesirable 
side effects that 
could delay or 
prevent their regulatory 
approval, limit the 
commercial 
 profile of an approved label or result in significant negative consequences following 
regulatory approval, if any. 
 Undesirable 
side 
effects 
that 
may 
be 
caused 
by 
our 
product 
candidates 
could 
cause 
us, 
our 
collaboration 
partners 
or the 
regulatory 
 authorities 
to 
interrupt, 
delay 
or 
halt 
clinical 
trials and 
could 
result 
in 
a more 
restrictive 
label 
or 
the delay 
or 
denial 
of 
approval 
by 
 regulatory authorities. Results of our 
trials could reveal a 
high and unacceptable severity and 
prevalence of side effects. In 
such an event, 
 our trials could be 
suspended or terminated and regulatory 
authorities could order us to 
cease further development of 
or deny approval 
 of our 
product candidates 
for any 
or all 
targeted 
indications. The 
product-related 
side effects 
could 
affect 
patient 
recruitment 
or the 
 ability of enrolled 
patients to complete 
the trial or 
result in potential 
product liability 
claims. Any of 
these occurrences 
may harm 
our 
 business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects significantly. 
 Clinical trials assess a sample 
of the potential patient 
population. With a 
limited number of patients 
and duration of exposure, 
rare and 
 severe side effects of 
our product candidates 
may only be 
uncovered with a 
significantly larger number of 
patients exposed to 
the product 
 candidate. If our product candidates receive an EUA or regulatory approval and we or others identify undesirable side effects caused by 
 such product candidates (or 
any other similar products) 
after such approval, a 
number of potentially significant 
negative consequences 
 could result, including: 
 
regulatory authorities may withdraw or limit their approval of such 
product candidates and require us to take our approved 
 product(s) off the market; 
 
regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a boxed warning or a contraindication, or 
 submission of field alerts to physicians and pharmacies; 
 
we may be required to create a medication guide outlining the risks of such 
side effects for distribution to patients; 
 
we may be required to change the way such product candidates are distributed or administered, conduct additional clinical 
 trials or change the labeling of the product candidates; 
 
actual or potential drug-related side effects could negatively affect patient recruitment or 
the ability of enrolled patients to 
 complete a trial for our products or product candidates; 
 
market 
acceptance 
of 
our 
products 
by 
patients 
and 
physicians 
may 
be 
reduced 
and 
sales 
of 
the 
product 
may 
decrease 
 significantly; 
 
regulatory 
authorities 
may 
require 
a 
REMS 
plan 
to 
mitigate 
risks, 
which 
could 
include 
medication 
guides, 
physician 
 communication plans, 
or elements to 
assure safe use, 
such as restricted 
distribution methods, 
patient registries 
and other 
 risk minimization tools; 
 
we may be subject to regulatory investigations and government enforcement actions; 
 
we may decide or be required to remove such product candidates from 
the marketplace; 
 
we could be sued and potentially held liable for injury caused to individuals exposed 
to or taking our product candidates; 
 
sales of the product(s) may decrease substantially; and 
 
our reputation may suffer. 

52 
 Any of 
these events 
could prevent 
us from 
achieving or 
maintaining market 
acceptance of 
the affected 
product candidates 
and could 
 substantially increase 
the costs 
of commercializing 
our product 
candidates, if 
approved, and 
therefore could 
have a 
material adverse 
 effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations 
and prospects. 
 The regulatory landscape that will 
govern our product candidates 
is uncertain. Regulations that impact 
our product candidates are 
 still
 developing, 
and changes 
in regulatory 
requirements could 
result in 
delays or 
discontinuation 
of development 
of our 
product 
 candidates or unexpected costs in obtaining regulatory approval. 
 The regulatory requirements 
to which our product 
candidates will be subject 
are complex and 
uncertainties exist. Even with 
respect to 
 more established vaccine products, the regulatory landscape is still evolving, especially as it relates to novel adjuvants in vaccines, such 
 as 
CpG1, 
which 
we 
use 
at 
low 
concentration 
in 
our 
product 
candidates. 
Although 
regulatory 
authorities 
decide 
whether 
individual 
 clinical trial protocols may proceed, the review process and determinations of other reviewing bodies can impede or delay the initiation 
 of a 
clinical trial, 
even if 
another regulatory 
authority has 
reviewed the 
trial and 
authorizes its 
initiation. The 
FDA, for 
example, can 
 place an IND on clinical hold even if other regulatory agencies have provided a favorable review. 
In addition, adverse developments in 
 clinical trials involving novel adjuvants in vaccines, such as CpG1, conducted 
by others may cause regulatory authorities to change the 
 requirements for approval of any of our product candidates. 
 Complex regulatory environments exist 
in other jurisdictions in which 
we might consider seeking regulatory approvals 
for our product 
 candidates, further complicating 
the regulatory landscape. 
For example, 
in the 
European Union a 
special committee called 
the Committee 
 for Advanced Therapies 
was established within the 
European Medicines Authority 
in accordance with Regulation 
(EC) No 1394/2007 
 on 
advanced-therapy 
medicinal 
products ATMPs ), 
to 
assess 
the 
quality, 
safety 
and 
efficacy 
of 
ATMPs, 
and 
to 
follow 
scientific 
 developments in the field. 
 These various regulatory review committees and advisory groups and new or revised guidelines that they promulgate from time to time 
 may lengthen the 
regulatory review process, 
require us to perform 
additional studies or 
analyses, increase our development 
costs, lead 
 to changes 
in regulatory 
positions and 
interpretations, delay 
or prevent 
approval and 
commercialization 
of our 
product candidates 
or 
 lead to 
significant post-approval 
limitations or 
restrictions. We 
may face 
even more 
cumbersome and 
complex regulations 
than those 
 emerging for 
novel adjuvants. 
Furthermore, even 
if our 
product candidates 
obtain required 
regulatory approvals, 
such approvals 
may 
 later be withdrawn because of changes in regulations or the interpretation of 
regulations by applicable regulatory authorities. 
 Even if we receive regulatory 
approval to market any of 
our product candidates, we will 
be subject to ongoing obligations and 
continued 
 regulatory review, which may materially adversely affect 
our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Further, 
 other 
jurisdictions 
may 
consider 
our 
product 
candidates 
to be 
new 
drugs, 
not biologics 
or 
medicinal 
products, 
and 
require 
different 
 marketing applications. 
Even if a 
regulatory authority 
approves any 
of our product 
candidates, the 
manufacturing processes, 
labeling, 
 packaging, distribution, 
product sampling, 
adverse event 
reporting, storage, 
advertising, marketing, 
promotion and 
recordkeeping for 
 the product 
will be 
subject to 
extensive and 
ongoing regulatory 
requirements. These 
requirements include 
submissions of 
safety and 
 other post-marketing information and 
reports and registration, as well as 
continued compliance with cGMPs and 
GCPs for any clinical 
 trials that we conduct post-approval, all of which may result 
in significant expense and limit our ability to commercialize such products. 
 There also are 
continuing, annual program 
user fees for 
any marketed products. 
In the United States, 
biologic manufacturers 
and their 
 subcontractors 
are 
required 
to 
register 
their 
establishments 
with 
the 
FDA 
and 
certain 
state 
agencies 
and 
are 
subject 
to 
periodic 
 unannounced 
inspections 
by 
the 
FDA 
and 
certain 
state 
agencies 
for 
compliance 
with 
cGMP, 
which 
impose 
certain 
procedural 
and 
 documentation requirements upon us and our contract manufacturers. 
Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, 
and, 
 depending on the significance of the change, may require prior 
FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require 
 investigation and correction of 
any deviations from cGMP and 
impose reporting requirements upon 
us and any contract manufacturers 
 that we may 
decide to use. 
Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to 
expend time, money 
and effort in 
production and quality 
control 
 to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 
 Any regulatory approvals 
that we receive 
for our product candidates 
may also be subject 
to limitations on the 
approved indicated uses 
 for which the 
product may be marketed 
or to the conditions 
of approval, or 
contain requirements for 
potentially costly post-marketing 
 testing and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product. For example, the FDA has the authority to require a REMS as 
 part of a BLA 
or after approval, which may 
impose further requirements or restrictions 
on the distribution or 
use of an approved 
product, 
 such 
as 
limiting 
prescribing 
to 
certain 
physicians 
or 
medical 
centers 
that 
have 
undergone 
specialized 
training, 
limiting 
treatment 
to 
 patients who meet certain 
safe-use criteria and requiring 
treated patients to enroll in 
a registry. 
Later discovery of previously 
unknown 
 problems 
with 
a 
product, 
including 
adverse 
events 
of 
unanticipated 
severity 
or 
frequency, 
or 
with 
our 
contract 
manufacturers 
or 
 manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements 
may result in, among other things: 
 
restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, 
withdrawal of the product from the market, or voluntary 
or 
 mandatory product recalls; 
 
fines, warning letters, untitled letters or holds on clinical trials; 

53 
 
refusal by regulatory 
authorities to approve 
pending applications or 
supplements to approved 
applications, or suspension 
 or revocation of product approvals; 
 
requirements 
to 
conduct 
additional 
clinical 
trials, 
change 
our 
product 
labeling 
or 
submit 
additional 
applications 
or 
 application supplements; 
 
product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; 
 
mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and 
the issuance of corrective information; 
 
consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion 
from federal healthcare programs; 
 
the 
issuance 
of 
safety 
alerts, 
Dear 
Healthcare 
Provider 
letters, 
press 
releases 
and 
other 
communications 
containing 
 warnings or other safety information about the product; or 
 
injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
 In addition, regulatory policies may change or additional government regulations or legislation may be enacted that could prevent, limit 
 or delay regulatory 
approval of our 
product candidates, 
particularly in 
countries where 
elections may result 
in changes in 
government 
 administration. If we 
fail to comply 
with existing requirements, 
are slow or 
unable to adapt 
to changes in 
existing requirements or 
the 
 adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any regulatory approval 
 that we 
may have 
obtained 
or face 
regulatory or 
enforcement 
actions, 
which may 
materially adversely 
affect our 
business, financial 
 condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 The FDA 
strictly regulates 
the promotional 
claims that 
may be made 
about prescription 
products in 
the United States. 
In particular, 
a 
 product may not 
be promoted for 
uses that are not 
approved by the 
FDA as reflected in 
the product s 
approved labeling. If 
we receive 
 marketing approval 
for a 
product candidate, 
physicians may 
nevertheless prescribe 
it to 
their patients 
in a 
manner that 
is inconsistent 
 with the approved label. If we are found to have promoted such off-label uses, we may become subject to significant liability. The FDA 
 and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to 
 have improperly 
promoted off 
-label uses 
may be 
subject to 
significant sanctions 
. 
Federal and 
state government 
agencies have 
levied 
 large civil and criminal 
fines against companies for 
alleged improper promotion and 
has enjoined several companies 
from engaging in 
 off-label 
promotion. 
The 
FDA 
has 
also 
requested 
that 
companies 
enter 
into 
consent 
decrees 
or 
permanent 
injunctions 
under 
which 
 specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. 
 Any government 
investigation of 
alleged violations 
of law 
could require 
us to 
expend significant 
time and 
resources in 
response and 
 could generate negative 
publicity. Any 
failure to comply 
with ongoing regulatory 
requirements may significantly 
and adversely affect 
 our ability to commercialize our product candidates. 
 A 
breakthrough 
therapy 
designation 
or 
fast 
track 
designation 
by 
the 
FDA 
for 
a 
product 
candidate 
may 
not 
lead 
to 
a 
faster 
 development or regulatory review 
or approval process, and 
it would not 
increase the likelihood that 
the product candidate will 
receive 
 marketing approval. 
 In 2022 the FDA 
granted fast track designation 
to UB-311. We 
may in the future 
seek a fast track designation 
for other of our product 
 candidates, or 
a breakthrough 
therapy designation 
for any 
of our 
product candidates. 
A breakthrough 
therapy is 
defined as 
a product 
 candidate that is 
intended, alone or 
in combination with 
one or 
more other drugs, 
to treat 
a serious or 
life-threatening disease or 
condition, 
 and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies 
 on one or more clinically significant endpoints, 
such as substantial treatment effects observed early in 
clinical development. For product 
 candidates that 
have been 
designated as 
breakthrough therapies, 
interaction and 
communication between 
the FDA 
and the 
sponsor of 
 the trial 
can help 
to identify the 
most efficient path 
for clinical 
development while minimizing 
the number 
of patients 
placed in ineffective 
 control regimens. Product candidates designated as breakthrough therapies by the FDA are also eligible for priority review if supported 
 by clinical data at the time of the submission of the BLA. 
 Designation 
as a 
breakthrough 
therapy is 
within the 
discretion of 
the FDA. 
Accordingly, 
even if 
we believe 
that one 
of our 
product 
 candidates meets the criteria for 
designation as a breakthrough therapy, 
the FDA may disagree and instead 
determine not to make such 
 designation. In any 
event, the 
receipt of 
a breakthrough therapy 
designation for a 
product candidate may 
not result in 
a faster 
development 
 process, review or approval compared 
to product candidates considered for approval 
under conventional FDA procedures and 
it would 
 not assure ultimate approval by 
the FDA. In addition, even 
if one or more of our 
product candidates qualify as breakthrough 
therapies, 
 the FDA may later 
decide that the product 
candidate no longer meets 
the conditions for qualification 
or it may 
decide that the time 
period 
 for FDA 
review or 
approval will 
not be 
shortened. Further, 
certain of 
our product 
candidates, including 
UB-612, are 
not eligible 
for 
 breakthrough therapy designation, and we will be unable to take advantage 
of such designation for such product candidates. 

54 
 Fast track designation 
is designed to facilitate 
the development and 
expedite the review of 
therapies to treat 
serious conditions and 
fill 
 an 
unmet 
medical 
need. 
Programs 
with 
fast 
track 
designation 
may 
benefit 
from 
early 
and 
frequent 
communications 
with 
the 
FDA, 
 potential priority review 
and the ability to submit 
a rolling application for 
regulatory review. 
Fast track designation 
applies to both the 
 product 
candidate and 
the specific 
indication for 
which 
it is 
being studied. 
However, 
even if 
one or 
more of 
our product 
candidates 
 qualify for fast track designation, we 
may not be able to 
meet the criteria of the 
fast track designation, or if our 
clinical trials are delayed, 
 suspended or terminated, or put on clinical hold due to unexpected adverse events or issues with clinical supply, we will not receive the 
 benefits associated 
with the 
fast track 
program. Furthermore, 
fast track 
designation does 
not change 
the standards 
for approval. 
Fast 
 track designation alone does not 
guarantee qualification for the FDA s 
priority review procedures. 
Fast track designation also does not 
 guarantee our product candidate will be approved in a timely manner, 
if at all. 
 We 
plan to 
seek approval 
of certain 
product candidates 
through the 
use of 
an accelerated 
approval pathway. 
If we 
are unable 
to 
 obtain 
such 
approval, 
we 
may 
be 
required 
to 
conduct 
additional 
pre-clinical 
studies 
or 
clinical 
trials 
beyond 
those 
that 
we 
 contemplate, which 
could increase 
the expense 
of obtaining, 
and delay 
the receipt 
of, necessary 
marketing approvals. 
Even if 
our 
 product candidates receive accelerated approval from regulatory authorities, if our confirmatory 
trials do not verify clinical benefit, 
 or if 
we do 
not comply 
with rigorous 
post-marketing 
requirements, such 
regulatory authorities 
may seek 
to withdraw 
accelerated 
 approval. 
 We are developing certain product 
candidates for the 
treatment of serious 
or life-threatening conditions, including 
UB-311, and therefore 
 may decide to seek approval 
of such product candidates under 
the FDA s 
accelerated approval pathway. 
A product may be eligible 
for 
 accelerated 
approval 
if 
it is 
designed 
to 
treat 
a 
serious 
or 
life-threatening 
disease 
or 
condition 
and 
generally 
provides 
a 
meaningful 
 advantage over available therapies upon a determination that the 
product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint or 
intermediate 
 clinical endpoint 
that is 
reasonably likely 
to predict 
clinical benefit. 
The FDA 
considers a 
clinical benefit 
to be 
a positive 
therapeutic 
 effect 
that is 
clinically meaningful 
in the 
context of 
a given 
disease, such 
as irreversible 
morbidity or 
mortality. 
For the 
purposes of 
 accelerated approval, 
a surrogate 
endpoint is 
a marker, 
such as a 
laboratory measurement, 
radiographic image, 
physical sign 
or other 
 measure that 
is thought 
to predict 
clinical benefit 
but is 
not itself 
a measure 
of clinical 
benefit. An 
intermediate clinical 
endpoint is 
a 
 clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality that is reasonably likely to predict an 
 effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. 
 The accelerated approval pathway may be used 
in cases in which the advantage 
of a new drug over 
available therapy may not be a direct 
 therapeutic 
advantage but 
is a 
clinically important 
improvement from 
a patient 
and public 
health perspective. 
If granted, 
accelerated 
 approval is usually 
contingent on the 
sponsor s agreement to 
conduct, in a 
diligent manner, additional post-approval 
confirmatory studies 
 to verify and describe the 
drug s clinical benefit. If the sponsor fails 
to conduct such studies in 
a timely manner, or if such 
post- approval 
 studies fail to validate the drug s predicted 
clinical benefit, the FDA may withdraw its approval of the drug on an expedited basis. 
 If we decide 
to submit a 
BLA seeking accelerated 
approval or receive 
an expedited regulatory 
designation for our 
product candidates, 
 there can be 
no assurance that 
such submission or 
application will be 
accepted or that 
any expedited development, 
review or approval 
 will be granted on a timely basis, or at all. Failure to obtain accelerated approval or 
any other form of expedited development, review or 
 approval for a product candidate would result in a longer time period to commercialization of such product candidate, 
if any, and could 
 increase the cost of development of such product candidate, which could harm 
our competitive position in the marketplace. 

 Because we are developing product candidates for the treatment or prevention 
of diseases in which there is little clinical experience 
 using new technologies, there is increased risk that the FDA or other foreign 
regulatory authorities may not consider the endpoints 
 of our clinical trials to provide clinically meaningful results and that these results may 
be difficult to analyze. 
 As we are developing 
novel treatments and preventative 
measures for diseases in which 
we believe there is 
limited clinical experience 
 with new endpoints and 
methodologies, there is heightened 
risk that the applicable 
regulatory authorities may 
not consider the clinical 
 trial endpoints to provide clinically 
meaningful results, and the resulting 
clinical data and results may be more 
difficult to analyze. It is 
 difficult to determine 
how long it will 
take, if ever, 
or how much it 
will cost to obtain 
regulatory approvals for 
our product candidates 
 in the 
United States 
or other 
jurisdictions, if 
ever. 
Further, approvals 
by one 
regulatory authority 
may not 
be indicative 
of what 
other 
 regulatory authorities may require for approval. 
 During the regulatory review process, we 
will need to identify success 
criteria and endpoints such that 
regulatory authorities will be able 
 to determine the 
clinical efficacy and 
safety profile of any 
product candidates we 
may develop. Because 
our initial focus is 
to identify 
 and develop product 
candidates to treat 
or prevent diseases 
in which there 
is little clinical 
experience using new 
technologies, there is 
 heightened risk that regulatory authorities may not consider the clinical trial endpoints that we propose to provide clinically meaningful 
 results. In addition, the resulting clinical data and results may be difficult 
to analyze. 
 In the United 
States, the FDA also 
weighs the benefits 
of a product against 
its risks, and the 
FDA may view 
the efficacy results 
in the 
 context of safety as 
not being supportive of 
regulatory approval. Foreign regulatory authorities 
may make similar comments 
with respect 
 to these endpoints and data. 
Any product candidate we may 
develop will be based on 
a novel technology that 
makes it difficult to predict 
 the time and cost of development and of subsequently obtaining regulatory 
approval. 

55 
 We and our collaboration partners have conducted and intend to conduct additional clinical trials for selected product candidates at 
 sites outside the United States, and for any of our product candidates for which we seek approval in the United States, the FDA may 
 not accept data from trials conducted in such locations or may require additional U.S.-based 
trials. 
 We 
and our 
collaboration partners have 
conducted, currently 
are conducting 
and intend in 
the future to 
conduct, clinical trials 
outside 
 the United States, including but not limited to Australia, Belgium, Netherlands, 
Panama, Philippines and Taiwan 
. 
 Although the FDA may accept data from 
clinical trials conducted outside the United States, 
acceptance of these data is subject 
to certain 
 conditions imposed by the FDA. For 
example, the clinical trial must be conducted 
by qualified investigators in accordance with 
GCPs, 
 and the FDA must be able to validate the trial data through an on-site inspection, if necessary. 
Generally, the patient population for any 
 clinical trial conducted outside of the United States must be representative of the population for which we 
intend to seek approval in the 
 United States. There 
can be no assurance 
that the FDA will 
accept data from 
trials conducted outside 
of the United 
States. If the FDA 
 does not accept the 
data from any clinical trials 
that we or our collaboration 
partners conduct outside the 
United States, it would likely 
 result in the need 
for additional clinical 
trials, which would be 
costly and time-consuming 
and delay or permanently 
halt our ability to 
 develop and 
market these 
or other 
product candidates 
in the 
United States. 
In other 
jurisdictions, there 
is a 
similar risk 
regarding the 
 acceptability of clinical trial data conducted outside of that jurisdiction. 
 In addition, 
there are risks 
inherent in 
conducting clinical 
trials in multiple 
jurisdictions, inside 
and outside 
of the United 
States, such 
 as: 
 
regulatory and 
administrative requirements 
of the jurisdiction 
where the 
trial is conducted 
that could 
burden or limit 
our 
 ability to conduct our clinical trials; 
 
foreign exchange fluctuations; 
 
manufacturing, customs, shipment and storage requirements; 
 
cultural differences in medical practice and clinical research; and 
 
the risk that 
the patient populations 
in such trials are 
not considered representative 
as compared to 
the patient population 
 in the target markets where approval is being sought. 
 If 
any 
of 
our 
product 
candidates 
receive 
EUA 
or 
regulatory 
approval, 
such 
products 
may 
not 
achieve 
broad 
market 
acceptance 
 among government agencies, physicians, 
patients, the medical community 
and third-party payors, in which case 
revenue generated 
 from their sales would be limited. 
 The 
commercial 
success 
of 
our 
product 
candidates 
and 
our 
ability 
to 
generate 
revenues 
from 
our 
products 
will 
depend 
upon 
their 
 acceptance 
among government 
agencies, physicians, 
patients, 
the medical 
community, 
and third-party 
payors. 
The degree 
of market 
 acceptance of our product candidates will depend on a number of 
factors, including: 
 
limitations 
or 
warnings 
contained 
in 
the 
approved 
labeling 
for 
a 
product 
candidate 
and 
any 
other 
product 
insert 
 requirements of regulatory authorities; 
 
changes in the standard of care for the targeted indications for 
any of our product candidates; 
 
limitations in the approved clinical indications for our product candidates; 
 
demonstrated clinical safety and efficacy compared 
to other products; 
 
the impact of disease variants, such as the Delta or Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2, 
on the efficacy and marketability of 
 our product candidates targeting such diseases; 
 
presence of significant adverse side effects, and the prevalence 
and severity of any side effects; 
 
sales, marketing and distribution support; 
 
availability of coverage and extent of reimbursement from managed 
care plans and other third-party payors; 
 
timing of market introduction and perceived effectiveness of our 
products as well as competitive products; 
 
continued projected growth of the markets in which our products compete; 

56 
 
the degree of cost-effectiveness of our product candidates; 
 
the impact of past product price increases and limitations on future price 
increases for our products; 
 
availability of alternative therapies; 
 
whether the product 
is designated under 
physician treatment guidelines 
as a first-line 
therapy or 
as a second or 
third-line 
 therapy for particular diseases; 
 
whether the product can be used effectively with other therapies to achieve 
higher response rates; 
 
adverse publicity about our product candidates or favorable publicity about 
competitive products; 
 
if and when we are able to obtain regulatory approvals for indications for our 
products; 
 
our ability to establish and maintain a continuous supply of our products for 
commercial sale; 
 
potential or perceived advantages or disadvantages of our products 
over alternative treatments; 
 
convenience and ease of administration of our products; and 
 
the effect of current and future healthcare laws. 
 If any 
of our product 
candidates are approved, 
but do 
not achieve an 
adequate level of 
acceptance by 
government agencies 
as well as 
 physicians, patients and the medical community, 
we may not generate sufficient 
revenue from these products, and we 
may not become 
 or 
remain 
profitable. 
In 
addition, 
efforts 
to 
educate 
the 
medical 
community 
and 
third-party 
payors 
on 
the 
benefits 
of 
our 
product 
 candidates may require significant resources and may never be 
successful. 
 We 
may 
focus 
on 
potential 
product 
candidates 
that 
may 
prove 
to 
be 
unsuccessful 
and 
such 
focus 
may 
require 
us 
to 
forego 
 opportunities to develop other product candidates that may prove to 
be more successful. 
 We may choose to focus 
our efforts and resources 
on a potential 
product candidate that ultimately 
proves to be 
unsuccessful, or to license 
 or purchase 
a marketed 
product that 
does not 
meet our 
financial expectations. 
Furthermore, we 
have limited 
financial and 
personnel 
 resources 
and 
are placing 
significant 
focus 
on the 
development 
of our 
lead product 
candidates, and 
as such, 
we may 
forgo 
or delay 
 pursuit 
of opportunities 
with other 
future product 
candidates that 
later prove 
to have 
greater commercial 
potential. 
Our spending 
on 
 current and 
future research 
and development 
programs and 
other future 
product candidates 
for specific 
indications may 
not yield 
any 
 commercially viable 
future product candidates 
and could result 
in spending on 
raw materials that cannot 
be repurposed. As 
a result of 
 our resource allocation decisions, 
we may fail 
to capitalize on 
viable commercial products or 
profitable market opportunities, be 
required 
 to forego or 
delay pursuit of 
opportunities with other 
product candidates or 
other diseases 
that may later 
prove to have 
greater commercial 
 potential, 
fail 
to 
identify 
novel 
product 
candidates 
that 
may 
be 
successful, 
or 
relinquish 
valuable 
rights 
to 
such 
product 
candidates 
 through 
collaboration, 
licensing 
or 
other 
arrangements 
in 
cases 
in 
which 
it 
would 
have 
been 
advantageous 
for 
us 
to 
retain 
sole 
 development 
and 
commercialization 
rights. 
If 
we 
are 
unable 
to 
identify 
and 
successfully 
commercialize 
additional 
suitable 
product 
 candidates, or if the 
additional product candidates we 
do identify and develop 
prove to be 
ineffective, incapable of being commercialized 
 on a large scale or 
otherwise fail to achieve market 
success, this would adversely impact 
our business strategy and our 
financial position. 
 Risks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital 
 We 
cannot 
assure 
you 
of 
the 
adequacy 
of 
our 
capital 
resources 
to 
successfully 
complete 
the 
development, 
and 
if 
approved, 
 commercialization 
of 
our product 
candidates, 
and a 
failure to 
obtain 
additional 
capital, could 
force 
us to 
delay, 
limit, reduce 
or 
 terminate one or more of our product development programs or commercialization 
efforts. 
 As of 
December 31, 2022, 
the Company 
had 87.9 
million of 
highly liquid 
assets to fund 
operations, including 
 33.5 million 
of cash 
 and 
cash 
equivalents, 
 53.4 
million 
of 
short-term 
investments, 
and 
a 
 1.1 
million 
restricted 
cash 
balance 
of 
which 
 1.0 
million 
is 
 restricted for the reimbursement of certain research and development expenses related to our UB-612 COVID-19 vaccine program. We 
 believe that we 
will continue to expend 
substantial resources for 
the foreseeable future developing 
our proprietary product 
candidates. 
 These 
expenditures 
will 
include 
costs 
associated 
with 
research 
and 
development, 
conducting 
pre-clinical 
studies 
and 
clinical 
trials, 
 seeking 
regulatory 
approvals, 
as 
well 
as 
launching 
and 
commercializing 
products 
approved 
for 
sale 
and 
costs 
associated 
with 
 manufacturing 
products. In 
addition, 
other unanticipated 
costs may 
arise. Because 
the outcomes 
of our 
anticipated 
clinical trials 
are 
 highly 
uncertain, 
we 
cannot 
reasonably 
estimate 
the 
actual 
amounts 
necessary 
to 
successfully 
complete 
the 
development 
and 
 commercialization of our proprietary product candidates. 

57 
 Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including but not 
limited to: 
 
the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing 
product candidates and maintaining our platform; 
 
the number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue; 
 
the rate 
of enrollment, 
progress, cost 
and outcomes 
of our clinical 
trials, which 
may or may 
not meet their 
primary end-
 points; 
 
the timing of, and cost involved in, conducting non-clinical studies that are regulatory 
prerequisites to conducting clinical 
 trials of sufficient duration for successful product registration; 
 
the cost of manufacturing clinical supply and establishing commercial supply 
of our product candidates; 
 
the costs 
and timing 
of preparing, 
filing and 
prosecuting patent 
applications, maintaining 
and enforcing 
our intellectual 
 property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims; 
 
tax and other 
compliance costs associated 
with operating in 
foreign jurisdictions (including 
any withholding requirements); 
 
the 
timing 
of, 
and 
the 
costs involved 
in, obtaining 
regulatory 
approvals 
for 
our product 
candidates 
if clinical 
trials are 
 successful; 
 
the timing of, and costs involved in, conducting post-approval studies that may 
be required by regulatory authorities; 
 
the cost of commercialization activities for 
our product candidates, including product 
manufacturing, pharmacovigilance, 
 marketing and distribution of product candidates 
generated from our platform and any 
other product opportunity for which 
 we receive marketing approval in the future; 
 
the terms and timing of any 
collaborative, licensing and other arrangements that we are 
currently party to or may establish, 
 including any required milestone and royalty payments thereunder 
and any non-dilutive funding that we may receive; 
 
the costs 
involved in preparing, 
filing, prosecuting, maintaining, 
defending and enforcing 
patent claims, 
including litigation 
 costs, if any, and the outcome 
of any such litigation; 
 
the timing, receipt 
and amount of sales 
of, or royalties 
or milestones on, 
our future products, 
if any, 
including the risk 
of 
 potential nonpayment by buyers of our future products, if any; 
 
the costs to recruit and build the organization including key executives needed to transform to a commercial organization; 
 and 
 
the costs of operating as a public company, 
including hiring additional personnel. 
 In addition, 
our operating 
plan may 
change as 
a result 
of many 
factors currently 
unknown to 
us. As 
a result 
of these 
factors, we 
may 
 need additional funds sooner than planned. We 
expect to finance future cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings, 
 strategic collaborations and debt financing. If sufficient funds on acceptable terms are not available 
when needed, or at all, we could be 
 forced to significantly reduce 
operating expenses and delay, limit, 
reduce or terminate one 
or more of 
our product development programs 
 or 
commercialization 
efforts, 
which 
would 
have 
a 
negative 
impact 
on 
our 
business, 
financial 
condition, 
results 
of 
operations 
and 
 prospects. 
 We 
have 
incurred significant 
losses since 
our 
inception, 
and we 
expect 
to incur 
losses for 
the foreseeable 
future and 
may 
never 
 achieve or maintain profitability. 
 We 
have incurred 
significant losses 
since our 
inception. We 
had net 
losses of 
approximately 75.2 
million, 137.2 
million and 
 40.0 
 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 
2021 and 2020, respectively. 
As of December 31, 2022, our consolidated accumulated 
 deficit was 304.7 million. Our expectation is that we will 
continue to incur losses as we continue our research and 
development of, and 
 seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates and maintain and develop new platforms, 
prepare for and begin to commercialize 
 any approved 
product candidates and 
add infrastructure 
and personnel to 
support our product 
development efforts 
and operations 
as a 
 public company. 
We 
have devoted 
substantially all of 
our financial 
resources and 
efforts to 
research and 
development, including 
pre-
 clinical studies and clinical trials 
and we anticipate that our 
expenses will continue to increase 
over the next several years as 
we continue 
 these activities. The 
net losses and 
negative cash flows 
incurred to date, 
together with expected 
future losses, have 
had, and may 
continue 
 to have, an 
adverse effect on 
our working capital. 
The amount of 
future net losses 
will depend, in 
part, on the 
rate of future growth 
of 
 our expenses and our ability to generate revenue. 

58 
 Because of the 
numerous risks and 
uncertainties associated 
with biopharmaceutical 
product development, 
we are unable 
to accurately 
 predict the timing 
or amount of 
increased expenses or 
when, or if, 
we will be 
able to achieve 
profitability. 
For example, our 
expenses 
 could increase if we are required by 
regulatory authorities such as the FDA to 
perform trials in addition to those that 
we currently expect 
 to perform, or 
if there are 
any delays in 
completing our currently 
planned clinical trials, 
the partnering process 
for our proprietary 
product 
 candidates or in the development of any of our proprietary product candidates. 
 Our revenue 
to date 
has been 
generated 
from the 
sales of 
our ELISA 
test and 
the sale 
of an 
option to 
negotiate a 
license with 
UNS 
 (which option has 
expired). Our ability 
to generate revenue 
and achieve profitability 
in the future 
depends in large 
part on our 
ability, 
 alone or with our collaborators, to achieve milestones and to successfully complete the development of, obtain the necessary regulatory 
 approvals for, 
and commercialize, 
our product 
candidates and 
Vaxxine 
Platform. We 
may never 
succeed in 
these activities 
and may 
 never generate revenue from 
product sales that is significant 
enough to achieve profitability. 
Even if we successfully obtain 
regulatory 
 approvals to market one or 
more of our product candidates, our revenues 
will be dependent, in part, upon 
the size of the markets in the 
 territories for which we gain regulatory approval and have commercial rights. If the markets for patient subsets that we are targeting are 
 not as significant as we estimate, we may 
not generate significant revenues from sales of such products, if approved. Even 
if we achieve 
 profitability in the future, 
we may not be able to 
sustain profitability in subsequent 
periods. Our failure to become 
or remain profitable 
 could depress our 
market value and 
could impair our 
ability to raise capital, 
expand our business, 
develop other product 
candidates or 
 continue our operations. A decline in our value could also cause you to lose all or 
part of your investment. 
 Raising additional 
capital may 
cause dilution 
to our 
shareholders, restrict 
our operations 
or require 
us to 
relinquish rights 
to our 
 technology or product candidates. 
 We expect our expenses to continue to increase in connection with our planned operations. To the extent that we raise additional capital 
 through the sale of our Class A common stock, convertible securities 
or other equity securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, 
 and the 
terms of 
these securities 
could restrict 
our operations 
or include 
liquidation or 
other preferences 
and anti-dilution 
protections 
 that could adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. 
The issuance of additional equity securities, or the possibility of such 
issuance, 
 may cause the 
market price of 
our Class A 
common stock to 
decline. In addition, 
debt financing, if 
available, may result 
in fixed payment 
 obligations and may involve agreements that 
include restrictive covenants that limit our 
ability to take specific 
actions, such as incurring 
 additional debt, 
making capital expenditures, 
creating liens, redeeming 
shares or declaring 
dividends, that 
could adversely impact 
our 
 ability to conduct our 
business. Securing financing could 
require a substantial amount 
of time and attention from 
our management and 
 may divert a disproportionate amount of their attention away from day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our management s 
 ability to oversee the development of our product candidates. 
 If we raise additional funds through collaborations or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have 
 to relinquish valuable 
rights to our 
technologies, future revenue 
streams or product 
candidates or grant 
licenses on terms 
that may not 
 be favorable to us. If 
we are unable to raise 
additional funds when needed, 
we may be required 
to delay, 
limit, reduce or terminate 
our 
 product 
development 
or 
future 
commercialization 
efforts 
or 
grant 
rights 
to 
develop 
and 
market 
product 
candidates 
that 
we 
would 
 otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. 
 We cannot 
be certain that additional funding 
will be available on acceptable terms, 
or at all. If we are unable 
to raise additional capital 
 in sufficient 
amounts or 
on terms 
acceptable to 
us, we 
may have 
to significantly 
delay, 
scale back 
or discontinue 
the development 
or 
 commercialization 
of our 
product candidates 
or other 
research and 
development 
initiatives. Our 
current or 
future license 
agreements 
 may also be terminated if we are unable to meet the payment or other obligations 
under the agreements. 
 Changes in 
or reinterpretations 
of tax 
laws and regulations, 
including their 
application to 
us or our 
customers as 
reviewed by 
the 
 relevant tax authorities, may have a material adverse 
effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition 
and prospects. 
 We are 
subject to complex and evolving 
tax laws and regulations. New 
income, sales, use or other 
tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations 
 or ordinances could be enacted at any 
time, which could affect the tax treatment of 
any of our future domestic and 
foreign earnings. Any 
 new 
taxes 
could 
adversely 
affect 
our 
domestic 
and 
international 
business 
operations, 
and 
our 
business 
and 
financial 
performance. 
 Further, 
existing tax laws, 
statutes, rules, regulations 
or ordinances could 
be interpreted, changed, 
modified or applied 
adversely to us 
 or our customers. 
Future changes in 
applicable tax laws 
and regulations, or 
their interpretation and 
application, could have 
an adverse 
 effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations 
and prospects. 
 In addition, 
our determination 
of our 
tax liability 
is subject 
to review 
by applicable 
tax authorities. 
Any adverse 
outcome 
of 
such a 
 review could harm our 
results of operations, cash 
flow and overall financial condition. 
The determination of our tax 
liabilities requires 
 significant 
judgment 
and, 
in 
the 
ordinary 
course 
of 
business, 
there 
are 
many 
transactions 
and 
calculations 
where 
the 
ultimate 
tax 
 determination is complex and uncertain. 

59 
 Our ability 
to use 
our net 
operating loss 
carryforwards and 
other tax 
attributes to 
offset future 
taxable income 
may be 
subject to 
 certain limitations. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had U.S. federal net operating loss 
carryforwards NOLs of 165.1 million, which may be available to 
 offset future 
taxable income, if 
any, 
and have no 
expiration date but 
are limited in 
their usage to 
an annual deduction 
equal to 80 
of 
 annual 
taxable 
income. 
In general, 
under 
Sections 382 
and 
383 
of 
the Internal 
Revenue 
Code 
of 1986, 
as amended 
(the Code ), 
a 
 corporation that 
undergoes 
an ownership 
change, generally 
defined as 
a greater 
than 50 
change by 
value in 
its equity 
ownership 
 over a three-year period, is subject to limitations on its ability 
to utilize its pre-change NOLs and its research and other 
tax attributes to 
 offset 
future 
taxable 
income. 
Our 
existing 
NOLs 
and 
tax 
attributes 
may 
be 
subject 
to 
limitations 
arising 
from 
previous 
ownership 
 changes, and if we 
undergo future ownership changes, our ability 
to utilize NOLs and 
research and tax attributes could 
be further limited 
 by Sections 382 
and 383 of 
the Code. For 
these reasons, we 
may not be 
able to utilize 
a portion of 
our existing NOLs 
or research and 
 tax attributes. 
 Adverse 
developments 
affecting 
financial 
institutions, 
companies 
in 
the 
financial 
services 
industry 
or 
the 
financial 
services 
 industry generally, 
such as 
actual events 
or concerns 
involving liquidity, 
defaults or 
non-performance, 
could adversely 
affect 
 our operations and liquidity. 
 Actual events involving 
limited liquidity, 
defaults, non-performance or 
other adverse developments 
that affect financial 
institutions or 
 other companies 
in the financial 
services industry or 
the financial services 
industry generally, 
or concerns or 
rumors about any 
events 
 of these kinds, have in the past and may in the future 
lead to market-wide liquidity problems. For example, on 
March 10, 2023, Silicon 
 Valley 
Bank, or 
SVB, was 
closed by 
the California 
Department of 
Financial Protection 
and Innovation, 
which appointed 
the Federal 
 Deposit 
Insurance 
Corporation, 
or 
the 
FDIC, 
as 
receiver. 
As 
of 
March 
10, 
2023, 
we 
had 
approximately 
11 
of 
our 
cash 
and 
cash 
 equivalent balances 
on deposit 
with SVB. 
Since then, 
we have 
moved substantially 
all of 
our cash 
and cash 
equivalent deposits 
that 
 were at SVB to another major U.S. financial institution. 
 Although a statement by the 
U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve and 
the FDIC stated that 
all depositors of SVB would 
 have 
access to 
all of 
their 
money 
after 
only 
one 
business 
day 
following 
the 
date 
of 
closure 
and 
we 
and 
other 
depositors 
with 
SVB 
 received such access on March 
13, 2023, uncertainty and liquidity 
concerns in the broader financial 
services industry remain. Inflation 
 and rapid 
increases in 
interest rates 
have led 
to a decline 
in the trading 
value of 
previously issued 
government securities 
with interest 
 rates below current market 
interest rates. The 
U.S. Department of 
Treasury, FDIC and Federal Reserve Board 
have announced a 
program 
 to provide 
up to 
 25 billion 
of loans 
to financial 
institutions secured 
by such 
government securities 
held 
by financial 
institutions to 
 mitigate the risk 
of potential losses 
on the sale 
of such instruments. 
However, widespread 
demands for customer 
withdrawals or other 
 needs of 
financial institutions 
for immediate 
liquidity may 
exceed the 
capacity of 
such program. 
There is 
no guarantee 
that the 
U.S. 
 Department of Treasury, FDIC and Federal Reserve Board will 
provide access to uninsured 
funds in the future 
in the event of 
the closure 
 of other banks or financial institutions in a timely fashion or at all. 
 Our 
access 
to 
our 
cash 
and 
cash 
equivalents 
in 
amounts 
adequate 
to 
finance 
our 
operations 
could 
be 
significantly 
impaired 
by 
the 
 financial institutions 
with which 
we have 
arrangements directly 
facing liquidity 
constraints or 
failures. For 
example, as 
we expect 
to 
 continue to maintain 
balances at one 
or more banks 
and financial institutions 
that exceed federally insured 
limits, in the 
event of a 
closure 
 of any such 
banks or institutions 
we may not 
be able to 
recover our uninsured 
balances. Even if 
the U.S. Department 
of the Treasury, 
 the Federal Reserve and the FDIC provide that depositors would have access to all of their balances, there may be a delay in our ability 
 to access such funds. 
In addition, investor concerns 
regarding the U.S. or 
international financial systems could 
result in less favorable 
 commercial financing terms, including 
higher interest rates 
or costs and 
tighter financial and 
operating covenants, or 
systemic limitations 
 on access to credit and liquidity 
sources, thereby making it more 
difficult for us to acquire financing 
on acceptable terms or at all. Any 
 material decline 
in available 
funding or our 
ability to access 
our cash 
and cash equivalents 
could adversely 
impact our ability 
to meet 
 our operating 
expenses, result in 
breaches of our 
contractual obligations 
or result in 
violations of federal 
or state wage 
and hour laws, 
 any of which could have material adverse impacts on our operations and 
liquidity. 
 Risks Related to the Manufacturing of Our Product Candidates 
 The formulation of peptide-based medicines is complex and manufacturers often encounter difficulties in production. If we, UBI or 
 any 
of 
our 
other 
contract 
manufacturers 
encounter 
difficulties, 
our 
ability 
to 
provide 
product 
candidates 
for 
clinical 
trials 
or 
 products, if approved, to patients or future customers could be delayed 
or halted. 
 The 
formulation 
of 
peptide-based 
medicines 
is 
complex 
and 
requires 
significant 
expertise 
and 
capital 
investment, 
including 
the 
 development 
of advanced 
manufacturing techniques 
and analytics. 
We 
are currently 
dependent on 
contract manufacturers, 
including 
 UBI, its affiliates, 
CSBioa, Pii, and 
WuXi STA 
, 
to conduct the manufacturing 
and supply activities for 
our product candidates and 
the 
 underlying 
component 
parts, 
but 
may 
choose 
to 
conduct 
these 
manufacturing 
activities 
ourselves 
in 
the 
future. 
If 
our 
contract 
 manufacturers are unable to manufacture our product candidates in clinical quantities or, 
when necessary, in commercial quantities 
and 
 at 
sufficient 
yields, 
then 
we 
will 
need 
to 
identify 
and 
reach 
supply 
arrangements 
with 
additional 
third 
parties. 
Further, 
our 
product 
 candidates may 
be in competition 
with other products 
for access to 
these facilities and 
may be subject 
to delays in 
manufacture if 
our 
 contract manufacturers 
give other 
products higher 
priority. 
We 
and our 
contract manufacturers 
must comply 
with cGMP, 
regulations 

60 
 and guidelines for the manufacturing of our product candidates used in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials and, if approved, marketed 
 products. If we 
or our contract 
manufacturers do not 
receive any regulatory 
approvals, or lose 
existing approvals, required 
to manufacture 
 our 
product 
candidates, 
production 
and 
fulfilment 
of 
orders 
will 
be 
delayed, 
which 
may 
materially 
adversely 
affect 
our 
business. 
 Manufacturers 
of 
biotechnology 
products 
often 
encounter 
difficulties 
in 
production, 
particularly 
in 
scaling 
up 
and 
validating 
initial 
 production. Furthermore, 
if microbial, 
viral or other 
contaminations are 
discovered in 
our product 
candidates or 
in the manufacturing 
 facilities 
where 
our 
product 
candidates 
are 
made, 
such 
manufacturing 
facilities 
may 
be 
closed 
for 
an 
extended 
period 
of 
time 
to 
 investigate and remedy the 
contamination. Shortages of raw 
materials may also 
extend the period 
of time required 
to develop our 
product 
 candidates. 
 Manufacturing 
these 
products 
requires 
facilities 
specifically 
designed 
for 
and 
validated 
for 
this 
purpose 
and 
sophisticated 
quality 
 assurance 
and 
quality 
control 
procedures 
are 
necessary. 
Slight 
deviations 
anywhere 
in 
the 
manufacturing 
process, 
including 
filling, 
 labeling, packaging, storage and shipping and quality control and testing, may result in lot failures, product recalls or spoilage. 
Further, 
 delays in our clinical trials or in 
any regulatory approvals may result in the expiration of 
manufactured product, which could in turn lead 
 to further 
delays. When 
changes are 
made to 
the manufacturing 
process, we 
may be 
required to 
provide pre-clinical 
and clinical 
data 
 showing 
the 
comparable 
identity, 
strength, 
quality, 
purity 
or 
potency 
of 
the 
products 
before 
and 
after 
such 
changes. 
The 
use 
of 
 biologically 
derived ingredients 
can also 
lead to 
allegations 
of harm, 
including infections 
or allergic 
reactions, or 
closure of 
product 
 facilities due to possible contamination. 
 In addition, 
there are 
risks associated 
with large 
scale manufacturing 
for clinical 
trials or 
commercial 
scale including, 
among others, 
 cost overruns, potential problems 
with process scale-up, process 
reproducibility, stability issues, compliance with cGMP, lot consistency 
 and timely availability of 
raw materials. Even if we 
obtain marketing approval for any 
of our product candidates, 
there is no assurance 
 that we or our manufacturers will be 
able to manufacture the approved product 
to specifications acceptable to regulatory authorities, 
to 
 produce it in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements for the 
potential commercial launch of the product or to meet 
potential future 
 demand. 
If we 
or our 
manufacturers are 
unable to 
produce sufficient 
quantities for 
clinical trials, 
advance 
purchase commitments 
or 
 commercialization, more 
generally, 
our development and 
commercialization efforts 
would be impaired, 
which would have 
an adverse 
 effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations 
and prospects. 
 We cannot assure 
you that any disruptions or other issues relating to the manufacture of any of our product candidates will not occur in 
 the future. Any delay or interruption in the supply of 
clinical trial supplies could delay the completion of planned clinical trials, 
increase 
 the costs 
associated 
with maintaining 
clinical trial 
programs and, 
depending 
upon the 
period of 
delay, 
require us 
to commence 
new 
 clinical trials at 
additional expense or 
terminate clinical trials 
completely. 
Any adverse developments 
affecting clinical 
or commercial 
 manufacturing 
of 
our 
product 
candidates 
or 
products 
may 
result 
in 
shipment 
delays, 
inventory 
shortages, 
lot 
failures, 
product 
 withdrawals or recalls or other interruptions in the supply of our product candidates. We may also have to take inventory write-offs 
and 
 incur other 
charges and 
expenses for 
product candidates 
that fail 
to meet 
specifications, undertake 
costly remediation 
efforts 
or seek 
 more costly manufacturing alternatives. Accordingly, failures or difficulties 
faced at any level 
of our supply chain 
could delay or impede 
 the development 
and commercialization 
of any 
of our 
product candidates 
and could 
have an 
adverse effect 
on our 
business, financial 
 condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 We 
and our 
contract manufacturers 
and suppliers 
could be 
subject to 
liabilities, fines, 
penalties or 
other sanctions 
under federal, 
 state, 
local 
and 
foreign 
environmental, 
health 
and 
safety 
laws 
and 
regulations 
if 
we 
or 
they 
fail 
to 
comply 
with 
such 
laws 
or 
 regulations or otherwise incur costs that could have a material adverse effect 
on our business. 
 We currently rely on and 
expect to continue 
to rely on 
contract manufacturers for 
the manufacturing and 
supply of our 
product candidates 
 and custom 
components. 
We 
and these 
contract manufacturers 
are subject 
to various 
federal, state, 
local and 
foreign 
environmental, 
 health 
and 
safety 
laws 
and 
regulations, 
including 
those 
governing 
laboratory 
procedures 
and 
the 
generation, 
handling, 
labeling, 
 transportation, use, 
manufacture, storage, 
treatment and disposal 
of hazardous 
materials and wastes 
and worker 
health and safety. 
We 
 do 
not 
have 
control 
over 
a 
manufacturer s 
or 
supplier s 
compliance 
with 
environmental, 
health 
and 
safety 
laws 
and 
regulations. 
 Liabilities they incur pursuant to these laws and regulations 
could result in significant costs or in certain circumstances, 
an interruption 
 in operations, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial 
condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 With 
respect to 
any hazardous 
materials or 
waste which 
we are 
currently, 
or in 
the future 
will be, 
generating, handling, 
transporting, 
 using, manufacturing, storing, 
treating or disposing of, 
we cannot eliminate the 
risk of contamination or 
injury from these materials 
or 
 waste, including 
at third-party 
disposal sites. 
In the 
event of 
such contamination 
or injury, 
we could 
be held 
liable for 
any resulting 
 damages and liability. We 
also could be subject to significant civil or criminal fines and penalties, cessation of operations, investigation 
 or remedial 
costs or 
other sanctions 
for failure 
to comply 
with applicable 
environmental, health 
and safety 
laws. In 
addition, we 
may 
 incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or 
 future laws and regulations 
may impair our research, 
development or production efforts 
or otherwise have a material 
adverse effect on 
 our business. 

61 
 Undetected errors or defects in our production could harm our reputation or expose us to 
product liability claims. 
 Undetected errors and defects in the cGMP materials used in the production of our product candidates could 
result in a lower quality of 
 any products we produce, 
and could give rise to 
reputational harm to us 
and to the contract manufacturers 
with whom we work. 
If any 
 such 
errors 
or defects 
are discovered, 
we may 
incur 
significant 
costs, 
the attention 
of our 
key 
personnel 
could 
be diverted, 
or other 
 significant 
problems 
may 
arise. We 
may 
also 
be 
subject 
to warranty 
and 
liability 
claims 
for 
damages 
related 
to errors 
or 
defects 
in 
 products made with our cGMP 
materials. In addition, if 
we do not meet industry or 
quality standards, if applicable, 
such products may 
 be subject 
to recall. 
A material 
liability claim, 
recall or 
other occurrence 
that harms our 
reputation or 
decreases market 
acceptance of 
 such products could harm our business and operating results. 
 Risks Related to Our Reliance on UBI, Collaborators and Other Third Parties 
 Conflicts of interest 
and disputes have 
and may arise 
between us and 
UBI and its 
affiliates, and 
these conflicts and 
disputes might 
 ultimately be resolved in a manner unfavorable to us. 
 UBI is 
our 
largest 
stockholder, 
the licensor 
of certain 
of our 
intellectual 
property and 
is a 
commercial 
partner for 
the Company. 
In 
 addition, Dr. Chang Yi 
Wang, UBI s 
founder, holds shares of our common stock. 
Our co-founders (Mei Mei Hu and Louis Reese), one 
 of their affiliates and UBI 
(collectively, our principal stockholders ), are party to a 
voting agreement (the Voting Agreement, ), which 
 provides Mei 
Mei Hu with 
the authority (and 
irrevocable proxies) 
to vote the 
shares of capital 
stock held 
by the stockholders 
party to 
 the Voti 
ng Agreement at her 
discretion on all matters to 
be voted upon by 
stockholders. 
Our CEO, Mei Mei Hu, 
our Chairman, Louis 
 Reese and 
our shareholder 
and former 
director James 
Chui, also 
serve on 
and constitute 
a majority 
of the 
board of 
directors of 
UBI. 

 UBI s 
equity interests 
in the Company, 
and the overlapping 
directorships, could 
give rise 
to conflicts 
of interest, 
in particular 
when a 
 decision could favor the 
interests of UBI (or its affiliates) 
or us over the other. 
Further, we have 
historically depended heavily on 
UBI 
 and its affiliates 
for our business operations, 
including the provision of 
research, development and 
manufacturing services. 
While we 
 have taken steps to separate our operations from those of UBI and currently anticipate taking additional steps to lessen our dependence, 
 we still have ongoing relationships with 
UBI and its affiliates. With 
respect to our UB-612 program, 
we have partnered with UBIA for 
 the 
development 
of 
UB-612 
in Taiwan, 
UBIP for 
the 
formulation-fill-finish 
services, 
and 
UBP as 
the 
sole 
manufacturer 
of 
protein. 
 Relating to our 
chronic disease pipeline, 
we continue to 
work with UBIP 
and UBIA for 
the production 
and testing of 
clinical material 
 for our UB-312 program. 
 Conflicts of 
interest may 
arise with 
respect to 
existing or 
possible future 
commercial arrangements 
between us 
and UBI 
or any 
of its 
 affiliates in which the 
terms and conditions of the 
arrangements are subject to negotiation 
or dispute. For example, conflicts 
of interest 
 could arise over matters such as: 
 
disputes over the 
cost or 
quality of the 
manufacturing and testing 
services provided to 
us by UBI 
with respect to 
our product 
 candidates; 
 
the allocation of UBI s resources as between 
our business objectives and UBI s 
own objectives; 
 
a 
decision 
whether 
to 
engage 
UBI 
or 
its 
affiliates 
in 
the 
future 
to 
manufacture, 
test 
and 
supply 
of 
additional 
custom 
 components or product candidates for us; 
 
decisions as to which particular product candidates we will commit sufficient 
development efforts to; or 
 
business opportunities unrelated to our current products that may be attractive both 
to us and to the other company. 
 We 
also cannot 
guarantee conflicts 
of interest 
will not 
arise in 
connection with 
the negotiation 
or execution 
of any 
future agreement 
 with UBI, its affiliates or any other related party. 

 Further, we have 
been advised that there is currently 
an ongoing dispute within UBI between 
Dr. Wang 
and the other four members 
of 
 UBI s board of directors relating to certain corporate governance matters, including the overall management and 
control of UBI, as well 
 as its relationship with the Company. Specifically, 
we have been advised that Dr. Wang 
attempted to replace the UBI board of directors 
 in July and August 2021 and asserted that she is the majority shareholder of UBI, which we understand UBI s other directors dispute as 
 invalid and incorrect, respectively. 
This dispute has created 
risks and uncertainties for 
us, and this dispute or 
any resolution of it 
could 
 negatively impact us, including, without limitation, by impairing our ability to work with UBI and its affiliates 
as a commercial partner 
 in the future and/or otherwise adversely affecting other existing 
arrangements with or involving UBI or its affiliates. Late 
in the day on 
 November 9, 
2021, 
counsel 
to 
the 
Company 
received 
correspondence 
on 
behalf 
of 
Dr. 
Wang 
(the 
 Correspondence ). 
The 
 Correspondence 
outlined 
Dr. 
Wang s 
concerns 
that the 
preliminary 
prospectus 
for 
our initial 
public 
offering, 
subject to 
completion, 
 dated November 5, 2021 did 
not accurately describe the relationship 
between the Company and UBI, 
namely the Company s 
ability to 
 operate independently 
from UBI. The 
Correspondence also relayed 
Dr. Wang s 
concerns that the 
preliminary prospectus did 
not fully 
 describe 
the 
disruption 
to 
the 
Company s 
business 
that 
could 
result 
from 
the 
abovementioned 
dispute, 
including 
with 
respect 
to 
 intellectual property 
agreements among 
the Company 
and UBI 
and its 
affiliates. Various 
other claims 
have been 
made by 
Dr. 
Wang 

62 
 regarding 
UBI s 
corporate 
governance, 
the 
operations 
of 
the 
Company 
and 
the 
disclosures 
for 
our 
initial 
public 
offering, 
and 
the 
 Company cannot 
predict the 
course of this 
dispute. However, 
the Company 
has carefully considered 
Dr. 
Wang s 
concerns and, 
based 
 on the disclosures 
included in the 
preliminary prospectus and 
in the final 
prospectus for our 
initial public offering 
and the Company s 
 diligence efforts, the Company remains confident 
in the appropriateness and accuracy of its disclosures. 
 We 
will 
rely 
on 
contract 
manufacturers 
for 
the 
manufacture 
of 
raw 
materials 
for 
our 
research 
programs, 

 pre-clinical studies and clinical 
trials and we do not 
have long-term contracts with many 
of these parties. This reliance 
on contract 
 manufacturers increases 
the risk 
that we 
will not 
have sufficient 
quantities of 
such materials 
or product 
candidates that 
we may 
 develop and commercialize, or that such supply will not 
be available to us at an acceptable cost or on 
an acceptable timeline, which 
 could delay, prevent or impair our development 
or commercialization efforts. 
 We rely on 
contract manufacturers, including UBI and its affiliates, 
for the manufacture of raw materials for our clinical 
trials and pre-
 clinical and clinical 
development. We 
do not have a 
long-term agreement with some 
of the contract manufacturers 
we currently use to 
 provide 
pre-clinical 
and 
clinical 
raw 
materials. 
Certain 
of 
these 
manufacturers 
are 
critical 
to 
our 
production, 
and 
the 
loss 
of 
these 
 manufacturers to one 
of our competitors 
or otherwise, or 
an inability to 
obtain quantities at 
an acceptable cost 
or quality, 
could delay, 
 prevent 
or 
impair 
our 
ability 
to 
timely 
conduct 
pre-clinical 
studies 
or 
clinical 
trials, 
and 
would 
materially 
adversely 
affect 
our 
 development and commercialization efforts. 
 We expect to continue to rely on contract 
manufacturers for the commercial supply of 
any of our product 
candidates for which we obtain 
 marketing approval, if any. We may be unable to maintain or establish long-term agreements with contract manufacturers or to do so on 
 acceptable terms. 
Even if 
we are 
able to 
establish agreements 
with contract 
manufacturers, reliance 
on contract 
manufacturers entails 
 additional risks, including: 
 
the failure 
of the 
contract manufacturer to 
manufacture our product 
candidates according to 
our schedule, or 
at all, 
including 
 if our contract manufacturers give greater priority to the supply 
of other products over our product candidates or otherwise 
 do not satisfactorily perform according to the terms of the agreements between 
us and them; 
 
the reduction or termination of production or deliveries by suppliers, or 
the raising of prices or renegotiation of terms; 
 
the termination 
or nonrenewal 
of arrangements 
or agreements 
by our 
contract manufacturers 
at a 
time that 
is costly 
or 
 inconvenient for us; 
 
the breach by the contract manufacturers of our agreements with them; 
 
the failure of contract manufacturers to comply with applicable regulatory 
requirements; 
 
the failure of the contract manufacturer to manufacture our product 
candidates according to our specifications; 
 
the 
mislabeling 
of 
clinical 
supplies, 
potentially 
resulting 
in 
the 
wrong 
dose 
amounts 
being 
supplied 
or 
active 
drug 
or 
 placebo not being properly identified; 
 
clinical supplies not being delivered 
to clinical sites on time, leading 
to clinical trial interruptions, or of 
drug supplies not 
 being distributed to commercial vendors in a timely manner, 
resulting in lost sales; and 
 
the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of 
our intellectual property or other 
proprietary information, including our 
 trade secrets and know-how. 
 We 
do not 
have complete 
control over 
all aspects 
of the 
manufacturing process 
of, and 
are dependent 
on, our 
contract manufacturing 
 partners 
for 
compliance 
with 
cGMP 
regulations 
for 
manufacturing 
both 
custom 
components 
and 
finished 
products. 
Contract 
 manufacturers may not be able to comply with cGMP regulations or similar regulatory requirements outside of the United States. If our 
 contract 
manufacturers 
cannot 
successfully 
manufacture 
material 
that 
conforms 
to 
our 
specifications 
and 
the 
strict 
regulatory 
 requirements of applicable 
regulatory authorities, they 
will not be able 
to secure and/or maintain 
authorization for their manufacturing 
 facilities. In 
addition, we 
do not 
have full 
control over 
the ability 
of our 
contract manufacturers 
to maintain 
adequate quality 
control, 
 quality assurance and qualified 
personnel. Further, our manufacturing partners may 
be unable to 
successfully increase the manufacturing 
 capacity 
for any of 
our product candidates 
in a timely or 
cost-effective manner, 
or at all, and 
quality issues may 
arise during any 
such 
 scale-up 
activities. If 
regulatory authorities 
do not 
authorize these 
facilities for 
the manufacture 
of our 
product candidates 
or if 
they 
 withdraw 
any 
such 
authorization 
in 
the 
future, 
we 
may 
need 
to 
find 
alternative 
manufacturing 
facilities, 
which 
would 
significantly 
 impact our ability to develop, obtain marketing approval for or market our product candidates, if approved. Our failure, or the failure of 
 our 
contract 
manufacturers, 
to 
comply 
with 
applicable 
regulations 
could 
result 
in 
sanctions 
being 
imposed 
on 
us, 
including 
fines, 
 injunctions, civil penalties, delays, 
suspension or withdrawal of 
approvals, license revocation, seizures 
or recalls of product candidates 
 or drugs, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our 
product 
 candidates or drugs and harm our business and results of operations. 

63 
 We 
depend 
on 
strategic 
partnerships, 
collaborations 
and 
license 
agreements 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
research, 
development 
and 
 commercialization of our Vaxxine 
Platform and product candidates. If our existing or future partners, collaborators or licensees do 
 not perform 
as expected, 
if we fail 
to maintain any 
of these strategic 
partnerships, collaborations 
or license 
agreements, or 
if they 
 are 
not 
successful, our 
ability 
to 
commercialize 
our product 
candidates 
successfully and 
to generate 
revenues may 
be materially 
 adversely affected. 
 We 
have 
established 
and 
intend 
to 
continue 
to 
establish 
strategic 
partnerships, 
collaborations, 
licensing 
agreements, 
or 
other 
 arrangements with third parties. 
For our research, development 
and commercialization activities, we 
have depended, and will 
continue 
 to depend, on our partners to design and conduct their own clinical studies. As a result, these activities may not be able to be conducted 
 in the manner or on the time schedule we currently 
contemplate, which may negatively impact our business operations. 
While we have 
 certain contractual rights to information 
about pre-clinical and clinical developments 
and results under certain of our 
collaboration and 
 license 
agreements, 
including 
our 
agreements 
with 
UBIA 
and 
Aurobindo, 
we 
cannot 
be 
certain 
that 
clinical 
trials 
conducted 
in 
 connection with such collaboration 
programs will be 
conducted in a 
manner consistent with 
the best interests 
of our business. 
In addition, 
 if any 
of our 
partners, collaborators 
or licensees 
withdraw support 
for these 
programs or 
proposed products 
or otherwise 
impair their 
 development, our business could be negatively affected. 
Also, our inability to find 
a partner for any of 
our product candidates may result 
 in our termination of that specific product candidate program or evaluation of a product candidate in a particular 
indication. Because of 
 contractual restraints 
and the limited 
number of contract 
manufacturers with the 
expertise, required regulatory 
approvals and facilities 
 to 
manufacture 
our 
product 
candidates 
on 
a 
commercial 
scale, 
replacement 
of 
a 
contract manufacturer 
may 
be expensive 
and 
time-
 consuming and 
may cause 
interruptions in 
the production 
of our 
product candidates, 
which could 
delay our 
clinical trials or 
interrupt 
 our potential 
future commercial 
sales. Even 
if we 
find or 
establish a 
strategic partner, 
collaborator or 
licensee for 
one or 
more of 
our 
 product candidates, there is no assurance that upon the approval of one or more of such product candidates that such product candidates 
 will be successfully commercialized. 
 Furthermore, our licenses 
and collaboration agreements 
impose, and any 
future agreement we 
enter into may 
also impose, restrictions 
 on our ability to license certain of our intellectual property to third parties or to develop or commercialize 
certain product candidates or 
 technologies ourselves. 
 In the future, we may 
enter into additional collaborations or 
license agreements to fund our 
development programs or to gain 
access to 
 sales, marketing or 
distribution capabilities of 
other parties. While 
certain of our 
existing collaboration and 
license agreements, including 
 our agreements with Aurobindo, impose development or commercialization obligations 
on our collaborators or licensees, we cannot be 
 certain that our collaboration partners 
will allocate sufficient resources or 
attention to our collaboration 
programs, that they will 
progress 
 our collaboration 
programs consistent 
with the 
best interests 
of our 
business or 
that they 
will otherwise 
meet their 
obligations under 
 these agreements 
in a timely 
manner or 
at all. Our 
existing collaborations 
and licenses, 
and any future 
collaborations and 
licenses we 
 enter into, therefore may pose a number of risks, including the following: 
 
collaborators or licensees 
may have significant 
discretion in determining 
the efforts and 
resources that they 
will apply to 
 developing 
or 
commercializing 
our 
product 
candidates, 
and 
they 
may 
not 
sufficiently 
fund 
the 
development 
or 
 commercialization of a product candidate; 
 
collaborators and licensees may 
not perform their obligations as expected 
by us or by health authorities, 
such as the FDA 
 or comparable foreign regulatory authorities; 
 
collaborators and licensees may 
dissolve, merge, be bought or 
may otherwise become unwilling to fulfill 
the initial terms 
 of the collaboration with us, or we may be unwilling to continue our arrangement 
following such an occurrence; 
 
collaborators and licensees may fail 
to perform their obligations 
under their agreements or 
may be slow in 
performing their 
 obligations; 
 
collaborations and licensees 
may be terminated 
for the convenience of 
the collaborator or licensee 
and, if terminated, we 
 could be required to raise additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the 
applicable product 
 candidates; 
 
collaborators and licensees may not pursue commercialization of any 
product candidates that achieve regulatory approval 
 or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs 
based on clinical trial results, changes 
 in the collaborators or 
licensees strategic focus or available 
funding, or external factors, such 
as an acquisition, that 
divert 
 resources or create competing priorities, or due to the actual or perceived 
competitive situation in a specific indication; 
 
collaborators and licensees may delay clinical trials, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct 
 additional clinical trials or may require a new formulation of a product candidate 
for clinical testing; 

64 
 
collaborators and 
licensees could independently 
develop, or develop 
with third parties, 
products that compete 
directly or 
 indirectly with our products or product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to 
 be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more 
economically attractive than ours; 
 
product candidates discovered in collaboration with us may be viewed 
by our collaborators as competitive with their own 
 product candidates 
or products, 
which may 
cause collaborators 
to cease 
to devote 
resources to 
the commercialization 
of 
 our product candidates; 
 
disagreements with collaborators or licensees, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation and 
 breach of contract claims, payment obligations or the preferred course 
of development, might cause delays or termination 
 of 
the 
research, 
development 
or 
commercialization 
of 
products 
or 
product 
candidates, 
might 
lead 
to 
additional 
 responsibilities, 
including 
financial 
obligations 
for 
us 
with 
respect 
to 
products 
or 
product 
candidates, 
or 
delays 
or 
 withholding of payments due to us or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time- consuming and 
 expensive, and could 
limit our ability 
to execute on 
our strategies and 
delay or prevent 
our ability to 
devote resources to 
 other product candidates; 
 
collaborators or 
licensees may 
not properly 
obtain, maintain, 
enforce or 
defend our 
intellectual property 
or may 
use our 
 proprietary 
information 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
could 
jeopardize 
or 
invalidate 
our 
intellectual 
property 
or 
proprietary 
 information or expose us to potential litigation; and 
 
collaborators may infringe, misappropriate or 
otherwise violate the intellectual property 
of third parties, which 
may expose 
 us to litigation and potential liability. 
 If our collaborations and licenses related to the research, development 
and commercialization of product candidates do not result in the 
 successful 
development 
and 
commercialization 
of 
our 
product 
candidates, 
or 
if 
one 
of 
our 
collaborators 
or 
licensees 
terminates 
its 
 agreement with us, we may not receive any future research funding or milestone or royalty payments under the collaboration or license, 
 and we may be unable to continue the development and commercialization of the product candidate. 
Further, even if our collaborations 
 and licenses do result in successful development and commercialization of products, if one of our collaborators breaches its obligations 
 under its 
agreement with 
us or 
enters bankruptcy 
or insolvency, 
there may 
be a 
material delay 
in our 
receipt of 
payments under 
such 
 agreements, or 
we may 
never receive 
such payments. 
If we 
do not 
receive the 
payments we 
expect under 
these agreements, 
our own 
 development and commercialization activities could be delayed 
or prevented altogether, and we may need 
to secure additional resources 
 to develop our proprietary product candidates. Moreover, maintaining our relationships with 
our collaborators and licensees may divert 
 significant time and effort of our scientific staff and management team, which may harm our 
ability to effectively allocate our resources 
 to 
multiple 
internal 
and 
other projects. 
All of 
the 
risks 
relating 
to 
product 
development, 
regulatory 
approval 
and 
commercialization 
 described in this report also apply to the activities of our collaborators and 
licensees. 
 Additionally, 
subject to its contractual 
obligations to us, 
if one of our 
collaborators or licensors 
is involved in 
a business combination, 
 merger, 
acquisition 
or 
other 
similar 
transaction, 
the 
collaborator 
or 
licensor 
might 
deprioritize 
or 
terminate 
the 
development 
or 
 commercialization of 
any product candidate 
licensed to it 
by us. If 
one of our 
collaborators or licensors 
terminates its agreement 
with 
 us, we 
may be 
unable to 
attract new 
collaborators in 
a timely 
manner or 
at all, 
which may 
delay or 
prevent our 
ability to 
develop or 
 commercialize one or more of our product candidates. 
 We rely on third parties to conduct our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials and perform other tasks for us. If these third parties do 
 not successfully 
carry out 
their contractual 
duties, meet 
expected deadlines, 
or comply with 
legal and 
regulatory requirements, 
we 
 may not be able to 
obtain regulatory approval for 
or commercialize our product candidates 
and our business could be 
substantially 
 harmed. 
 We have relied upon and plan to continue to rely upon CROs to execute certain of our pre-clinical and 
clinical trials, and to monitor and 
 manage data for our ongoing pre-clinical 
and clinical programs and to provide 
us with significant data and other 
information related to 
 our projects, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. If such third parties provide inaccurate, misleading or incomplete data, our business, 
 financial condition and results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected. We 
have control over limited aspects 
 of our CROs 
activities; nevertheless, we 
are responsible for, 
and our reliance 
on CROs does 
not relieve us 
of our responsibilities 
for, 
 ensuring that each of 
our trials is 
conducted in accordance with the 
applicable protocol, legal, regulatory, scientific and 
ethical standards. 
 We 
and 
our CROs 
and 
other vendors 
are required 
to comply 
with cGMP, 
GCP, 
Good 
Laboratory 
Practice GLP 
and other 
laws, 
 regulations and 
guidelines enforced 
by applicable 
regulatory authorities 
for all 
of our 
product candidates 
during both 
pre-clinical and 
 clinical 
development. 
Regulatory 
authorities 
enforce 
these 
regulations 
through 
periodic 
inspections 
of 
study 
sponsors, 
principal 
 investigators, trial sites and other 
contractors. If we or any 
of our CROs or vendors 
fail to comply with applicable 
regulations, the data 
 generated in our pre-clinical and 
clinical trials may be 
deemed unreliable and regulatory authorities 
may require us to 
perform additional 
 pre-clinical 
and 
clinical 
trials 
before 
approving 
our 
marketing 
applications. 
We 
cannot 
assure 
you 
that 
upon 
inspection 
by 
a 
given 
 regulatory 
authority, 
such 
regulatory 
authority 
will 
determine 
that 
all 
of 
our 
clinical 
trials 
comply 
with 
cGCP 
regulations 
or 
other 
 applicable laws and regulations. 
Our failure to 
comply with applicable 
laws and regulations 
may require us 
to repeat clinical 
trials, which 
 would delay the regulatory approval process and require significant additional 
expenditures, which we may be unable to meet. 

65 
 If any of our 
relationships with these 
CROs terminates, we may 
not be able to 
enter into arrangements with 
alternative CROs or 
do so 
 on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner. 
We would also incur 
additional costs and delays while engaging a new CRO, 
 which we 
may not 
be able 
to engage 
on commercially 
reasonable terms 
or at 
all. In 
addition, our 
CROs are 
not our 
employees, and 
 except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such CROs, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time 
 and 
resources 
to 
our 
ongoing 
pre-clinical 
and 
clinical 
programs. 
If 
CROs 
do 
not 
successfully 
carry 
out 
their 
contractual 
duties 
or 
 obligations, 
meet 
expected 
deadlines, 
conduct 
our 
studies 
in accordance 
with 
regulatory 
requirements 
or 
our 
stated 
study 
plans 
and 
 protocols, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy 
of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere 
to 
 our protocols, regulatory requirements, 
or for other reasons, our clinical 
trials may be extended, delayed or 
terminated and we may not 
 be able to obtain 
regulatory approval for or 
successfully commercialize our product candidates 
in a timely manner or 
at all. For example, 
 due to an 
error by the 
CRO responsible for 
administering blinded placebo 
and active doses 
to trial subjects, 
which reduced the 
confidence 
 of subsequently collected 
data, we decided 
to discontinue a Phase 
2a LTE 
trial for UB-311. 
In that case, 
however, we 
determined that 
 we had collected 
sufficient data on UB-311 s tolerability and immunogenicity. CROs or 
any of our 
other collaborators may 
also generate 
 higher costs 
than anticipated. 
As a 
result, our 
results of 
operations and 
the commercial 
prospects for 
our product 
candidates could 
be 
 harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenue 
could be delayed. 
 Though we carefully manage our 
relationships with our CROs, there 
can be no assurance that 
we will not encounter challenges 
or delays 
 in the 
future or 
that these 
delays or challenges 
will not have 
a material 
adverse impact 
on our business, 
financial condition, 
results of 
 operations and prospects. 
 We 
do not have 
multiple sources of 
commercial supply for 
some of the 
components used in 
our product candidates, 
nor long-term 
 supply contracts with our 
existing suppliers, and 
certain of our suppliers 
are critical to our 
production. If we were 
to lose a critical 
 supplier or if an approved supplier experiences delays due to raw material constraints, it could have a material adverse effect on our 
 ability to complete 
the development of 
our product candidates. 
If we obtain 
regulatory approval for 
any of our 
product candidates, 
 we cannot guarantee that our suppliers will be able to meet our increased demands for 
supply. 
 We do not have multiple sources of commercial supply for 
each of the components used in 
the manufacturing of our product 
candidates, 
 nor do we have long-term supply agreements with all of our component suppliers. Manufacturing suppliers are subject to 
cGMP quality 
 and regulatory requirements, covering manufacturing, testing, quality control and record keeping relating to our product candidates and 
 are 
subject 
to 
ongoing 
inspections 
by 
applicable 
regulatory 
authorities. 
Manufacturing 
suppliers 
are 
also 
subject 
to 
licensing 
 requirements as well as local, state and federal regulations and regulations in foreign jurisdictions in which they operate. Failure by any 
 of our suppliers to comply with all applicable regulations and requirements 
may result in long delays and interruptions in supply. 
 The number of suppliers of the raw material components of our product candidates is limited. In the event it is necessary or desirable to 
 acquire supplies 
from alternative 
suppliers, we 
might not be 
able to 
obtain such 
supply on commercially 
reasonable terms, 
if at 
all. It 
 could also require significant time and expense to redesign our manufacturing processes to work with another company and redesign of 
 processes can trigger 
the need for conducting 
additional studies such 
as comparability or 
bridging studies. Additionally, 
certain of our 
 suppliers are critical to our production, and the loss 
of these suppliers to one of our competitors 
or otherwise would materially adversely 
 affect our 
development and commercialization 
efforts. Further, 
if such critical 
suppliers experience 
delays in their 
ability to 
supply of 
 components due to limited 
availability of raw 
materials or other 
difficulties which may be 
beyond our or 
their control, our 
manufacturing 
 efforts may be materially adversely affected. 
 As part of any marketing approval, regulatory authorities conduct inspections 
that must be successful prior to the approval of a product 
 candidate. Failure of manufacturing suppliers to successfully complete these regulatory inspections will result in delays. If supply 
from 
 the approved supplier is interrupted, an 
alternative vendor would need to be 
qualified through an NDA amendment 
or supplement, and 
 this could 
result 
in 
significant 
disruption 
in 
commercial 
supply. 
Regulatory 
authorities 
may 
also 
require 
additional 
studies 
if 
a 
new 
 supplier is relied upon 
for commercial production. Switching 
vendors may involve substantial 
costs and is likely 
to result in a delay 
in 
 our desired clinical and commercial timelines. 
 If we are unable to obtain the supplies we need at a reasonable 
price or on a timely basis, it could have a material 
adverse effect on our 
 ability 
to 
complete 
the 
development 
of 
our 
product 
candidates 
or, 
if 
we 
obtain 
regulatory 
approval 
for 
our 
product 
candidates, 
to 
 commercialize them. 
 Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property Rights 
 We depend on intellectual property 
licensed from UBI 
and its affiliates, the 
termination of which 
could result in 
the loss of 
significant 
 rights, which would harm our business. 
 We 
are dependent 
on technology, 
patents, know-how 
and proprietary 
information, both 
our own 
and those 
licensed from 
UBI and 
its 
 affiliates. We 
entered into the Platform 
License Agreement in August 
2021 pursuant to which 
we obtained a worldwide, 
sublicensable 
 (subject to 
certain conditions), 
perpetual, fully 
paid-up, royalty-free 
(i) exclusive 
license (even 
as to 
the Licensors) 
under all 
patents 
 owned or otherwise 
controlled by 
the Licensors or 
their affiliates existing 
as of the 
effective date 
of the Platform 
License Agreement, 

66 
 (ii) exclusive 
license (except 
as to 
the Licensors) 
under all 
patents owned 
or otherwise 
controlled by 
the Licensors 
or their 
affiliates 
 arising after the 
effective date during 
the term of the 
Platform License Agreement, 
and (iii) non-exclusive 
license under all know 
-how 
 owned 
or 
otherwise 
controlled 
by 
the 
Licensors 
or 
their 
affiliates 
existing 
as 
of 
the 
effective 
date 
or 
arising 
during 
the 
term 
of 
the 
 Platform License 
Agreement, in 
each of 
the foregoing 
cases, to 
research, develop, 
make, have 
made, utilize, 
import, export, 
market, 
 distribute, offer for sale, 
sell, have sold, 
commercialize or otherwise 
exploit peptide-based vaccines in 
the field of 
all human prophylactic 
 and therapeutic uses, except for such vaccines related 
to human immunodeficiency virus, herpes simplex virus 
and Immunoglobulin E. 
 The patents licensed to us 
under the Platform License Agreement 
include patents directed to a CpG 
delivery system, artificial T helper 
 cell epitopes and 
certain designer peptides 
and proteins that 
are used in 
our product candidates. 
Any termination of 
these licenses will 
 result in the loss of significant rights and will restrict our ability to develop 
and commercialize our product candidates. 
 Our 
reliance 
on 
in-licensed 
intellectual 
property 
and 
technology 
results 
in 
a 
number 
of 
risks 
to 
the 
development 
and 
 commercialization of our product 
candidates, including the loss 
of such rights, our 
licensors inability or refusal 
to enforce or 
defend 
 such rights, and the requirement to pay royalties, milestones, and other amounts. 
 Agreements under 
which we license 
intellectual property 
or technology 
to or from 
UBI, its affiliates 
and from other 
third parties may 
 be complex, 
and certain 
provisions in 
such agreements 
may be 
susceptible to 
multiple interpretations. 
The resolution 
of any 
contract 
 interpretation disagreement that may arise 
could narrow what we 
believe to be the 
scope of our 
rights to the relevant 
intellectual property 
 or technology or 
increase what we believe 
to be our 
financial or other 
obligations under the 
relevant agreement, either 
of which could 
 have 
a 
material 
adverse 
effect 
on 
our 
business, 
financial 
condition, 
results 
of 
operations 
and 
prospects. 
Moreover, 
if 
disputes 
over 
 intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair 
our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on 
commercially 
 acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates. Our business may 
also 
 suffer if 
any current or 
future licensors fail 
to abide by 
the terms of 
the license, if 
the licensors fail 
to enforce licensed 
patents against 
 infringing third parties, 
if the licensed patents 
or other rights are 
found to be invalid 
or unenforceable, or 
if we are unable to 
enter into 
 necessary licenses on 
acceptable terms or at 
all. In the event of 
a bankruptcy by one 
of our licensors, our 
intellectual property licenses 
 could 
also 
be 
affected. 
For 
example, 
while 
the 
U.S. 
Bankruptcy 
Code 
allows 
a 
licensee 
to 
retain 
its 
rights 
under 
its 
license 
 notwithstanding 
the bankrupt 
licensor s 
rejection of 
such license, 
such protections 
may not 
be available 
to us 
in the 
event a 
licensor 
 declares bankruptcy in 
a foreign jurisdiction. 
Our licensors may 
also own or 
control intellectual property 
that has not 
been licensed to 
 us and, 
as a 
result, we 
may be 
subject to 
claims, regardless 
of their 
merit, that 
we are 
infringing or 
otherwise violating 
the licensors 
 rights. 
 Furthermore, while we cannot currently determine the amount of the royalty obligations 
we would be required to pay on sales of future 
 products, 
if 
any, 
the 
amounts 
may 
be 
significant. 
The 
amount 
of 
our 
future 
royalty 
obligations 
will 
depend 
on 
the 
technology 
and 
 intellectual 
property 
we use 
in products 
that we 
successfully 
develop 
and commercialize, 
if any. 
Therefore, 
even 
if we 
successfully 
 develop and commercialize products, we may be unable to achieve 
or maintain profitability. 
 We believe 
the growth of our business may 
depend in part on our ability 
to acquire or in-license additional 
intellectual property rights, 
 including to advance 
our research or allow 
commercialization of our 
product candidates. If 
we are unable to 
obtain additional licenses 
 we need to develop 
and commercialize our product 
candidates, or if we 
obtain such licenses and 
they are terminated, we 
may be required 
 to expend considerable time 
and resources in an attempt 
to develop or license replacement 
technology. 
We may 
also need to cease use 
 of the compositions or methods covered by such third-party intellectual property rights, and our ability to license or develop alternative 
 approaches that do not infringe on such intellectual property rights may entail 
significant additional costs and development delays, even 
 if we were able to develop or license such alternatives, which may not be feasible. 
 The 
licensing 
and 
acquisition 
of 
third-party 
intellectual 
property 
rights 
is 
a 
competitive 
practice, 
and 
companies 
that 
may 
be 
more 
 established, or have greater resources 
than we do, may also be pursuing 
strategies to license or acquire 
third-party intellectual property 
 rights that we may consider necessary or attractive in order to commercialize our product 
candidates. More established companies may 
 have a competitive advantage over us due to their larger size and cash resources or greater clinical development 
and commercialization 
 capabilities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully complete such negotiations and ultimately acquire the rights 
 to the intellectual 
property surrounding 
the additional product 
candidates that 
we may seek 
to acquire. Even 
if we are 
able to obtain 
a 
 license under such intellectual property rights, any 
such license may be non-exclusive, which may allow our 
competitors access to the 
 same technologies licensed to us. 
 Licensing of intellectual property is of critical importance to 
our business and involves complex legal, business and scientific issues 
and 
 is complicated by the rapid pace of scientific discovery in our industry. 
Disputes may also arise between us and our licensors regarding 
 intellectual property subject to a license agreement, including those relating 
to: 
 
the scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation 
-related issues; 
 
whether and 
the extent to 
which our technology 
and processes infringe 
on intellectual property 
of the licensor 
that is not 
 subject to the license agreement; 
 
our right to sublicense patent and other rights to third parties under 
collaborative development relationships; 

67 
 
our compliance with reporting, financial or other obligations under the license 
agreement; 
 
the amount and timing of payments owed under license agreements; and 
 
the allocation of ownership of inventions 
and know-how resulting from 
the creation or use of intellectual property 
by our 
 licensors and by us and our partners. 
 We 
may 
also 
not 
be 
able 
to 
fully 
protect 
our 
licensed 
intellectual 
property 
rights 
or 
maintain 
our 
licenses 
under 
our 
licensing 
 arrangements. Our existing and future 
licensors could retain the 
right to prosecute, maintain, 
defend and enforce the 
intellectual property 
 rights licensed to us, in 
which case we would 
depend on the ability and 
will of our licensors to 
do so. Our licensors 
may take different 
 approaches 
to prosecuting 
patents than 
we would, 
and 
it is 
possible our 
inability to 
control such 
activities could 
harm our 
business. 
 Furthermore, our licensors 
may determine not 
to pursue litigation 
against other companies 
or may pursue 
such litigation less 
aggressively 
 than we would. 
We 
may also rely 
upon obtaining the 
consent of our 
licensors to settle 
legal claims. If 
our licensors do 
not adequately 
 protect or enforce such licensed intellectual property, competitors 
may be able to use such intellectual property and erode or negate any 
 competitive advantage we may have, which could materially harm our business, negatively affect 
our position in the marketplace, limit 
 our ability to commercialize our products and product candidates and delay or 
render impossible our achievement of profitability. 
 If disputes over intellectual property that we have 
licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our 
current licensing arrangements 
 on acceptable 
terms or 
at all, 
we may 
be unable 
to successfully 
develop 
and commercialize 
the affected 
product candidates. 
We 
are 
 generally also subject to all of the same risks with respect to protection of intellectual property that we license as we are for intellectual 
 property that we own, 
which are described below. 
If we or our licensors 
fail to adequately protect 
this intellectual property, 
our ability 
 to develop or commercialize our products could suffer. 
 Furthermore, our existing license agreements may impose, and we expect that future license agreements will impose, various diligence, 
 milestone payment, 
royalty and other 
obligations on us 
and if our 
licensors, licensees or 
collaborators conclude 
that we have 
failed to 
 comply with our obligations under 
these agreements, including due 
to the impact of 
the COVID-19 pandemic on 
our business operations 
 or our use of the intellectual property licensed to us in a manner the licensor believe 
is unauthorized, or we are subject to a bankruptcy, 
 we may be required to pay damages and the licensor may have the right to terminate the license. Any of the foregoing could result in us 
 being unable to develop, manufacture and 
sell products that are 
covered by the licensed technology 
or enable a competitor to 
gain access 
 to the 
licensed technology. 
We 
might not 
have the 
necessary rights 
or the 
financial resources 
to develop, 
manufacture or 
market our 
 current or future product candidates without the rights granted under our licenses, and the loss of sales or potential sales in 
such product 
 candidates could have a material adverse effect on our 
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 Moreover, 
our rights 
to our 
in-licensed patents 
and patent 
applications may 
depend, in 
part, on 
inter- 
institutional or 
other operating 
 agreements between the 
joint owners of 
such in-licensed patents 
and patent applications 
or the owners 
of such in-licensed 
patents and 
 patent applications and their affiliates. We may not be aware of each 
party s rights and obligations under such inter-institutional or other 
 operating agreements and, as such, the ownership of our in-licensed patents and patent applications may be uncertain. If one or more of 
 these 
owners 
breaches 
such 
inter-institutional 
or 
other 
operating 
agreements, 
our 
rights 
to 
such 
in-licensed 
patents 
and 
patent 
 applications may be adversely affected. In 
addition, the development of certain of our product candidates may 
be funded by grants that 
 impose 
certain pricing 
limitations on 
such product 
candidates and 
limit our 
ability to 
commercialize such 
product 
candidates 
and 
to 
 achieve 
or 
maintain 
profitability. 
Any 
of 
the 
foregoing 
could 
have 
a 
material 
adverse 
effect 
on 
our 
competitive 
position, 
business, 
 financial conditions, results of operations and prospects. 
 We 
may 
be 
required 
to 
license 
or 
obtain 
rights 
to 
use 
third 
party 
intellectual 
property 
or 
technology 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
 development and commercialization of our product candidates. 
 We 
may 
not be 
aware of 
all technologies 
developed 
or under 
development 
by third 
parties, and 
other 
pharmaceutical 
companies 
or 
 academic institutions may also have filed or may be planning to file patent applications potentially relevant to our business and product 
 candidates. The 
technologies used 
in connection 
with the 
formulations of 
our product 
candidates may 
also be 
covered by 
intellectual 
 property rights held 
by others. From 
time to time, 
in order to 
avoid infringing these 
third-party patents, we 
may be required 
to license 
 technology from additional 
third parties to further 
develop, manufacture, use, 
sell or commercialize our 
product candidates, or that 
we 
 otherwise deem 
necessary for 
our business 
operations. We 
may fail 
to obtain 
any such 
licenses at 
a reasonable 
cost or 
on reasonable 
 terms, if 
at all, 
and as 
a result 
we may 
be unable 
to develop 
or commercialize 
the affected 
product candidates, 
and we 
may have 
to 
 abandon development of the relevant research programs or product candidates, 
which would harm our business. 
 If we are unable to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our products or product candidates, or if the duration or 
 scope of our 
intellectual property protection 
is not sufficiently 
broad, our ability 
to commercialize our 
product candidates successfully 
 and to compete effectively may be materially adversely affected. 
 Our success depends on our ability 
to obtain and maintain patent and 
other intellectual property protection in the 
United States and other 
 countries 
with respect 
to our 
current 
and future 
proprietary product 
candidates. We 
rely upon 
a combination 
of patents, 
trade 
secret 

68 
 protection 
and 
confidentiality 
agreements 
to 
protect 
the 
intellectual 
property 
related 
to 
our 
technology, 
manufacturing 
processes, 
 products and 
product candidates. 
We, 
UBI and 
our other 
collaborators and 
licensors have 
primarily sought 
to protect 
our proprietary 
 positions by 
filing patent 
applications in 
the United 
States and 
abroad related 
to our proprietary 
technology, 
manufacturing processes 
 and product 
candidates that 
are important 
to our business. 
Despite our 
or our 
third party 
collaborators or 
licensors efforts 
to protect 
 these proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may be able to obtain and use information that 
we regard as proprietary. Third parties may 
 also seek to invalidate our patents or those of our licensors. If we are unable to obtain rights to required third-party intellectual property 
 rights or 
maintain 
the existing 
intellectual 
property 
rights we 
have, 
we may 
be required 
to expend 
significant 
time and 
resources 
to 
 redesign our 
technology, 
product candidates 
or the methods 
for manufacturing 
them or to 
develop or 
license replacement 
technology, 
 all of which may not be feasible on a technical or 
commercial basis. We could also lose expected revenues under license agreements we 
 maintain 
with 
third 
parties. 
If 
we 
are 
unable 
to 
obtain 
or 
maintain 
our 
intellectual 
property, 
we 
may 
be 
unable 
to 
develop 
or 
 commercialize the affected technology and product candidates or could lose revenue, either of which could 
harm our business, financial 
 condition, results of operations and prospects significantly. 
 The patent prosecution process is 
expensive and time-consuming, and we may 
not be able to 
file and prosecute all 
necessary or desirable 
 patent applications at a 
reasonable cost or in 
a timely manner or 
in all jurisdictions 
where protection may be 
commercially advantageous. 
 It is also 
possible that we 
may fail to 
identify patentable aspects 
of our research 
and development output 
before it is 
too late to 
obtain 
 patent protection. 

 In addition, we, UBI or our other collaborators and licensors, may only pursue, obtain or maintain patent protection in a limited number 
 of countries. Because 
patent applications in 
the United States, 
Europe and many 
other foreign jurisdictions 
are typically not 
published 
 until 18 months after filing, or 
in some cases not at all, 
and because publications of discoveries 
in scientific literature lag behind 
actual 
 discoveries, we cannot be 
certain that we or our 
licensors were the first to 
make the inventions claimed 
in any of our owned 
or any in-
 licensed issued patents 
or pending patent 
applications, or 
that we or 
our licensors were 
the first to 
file for protection 
of the inventions 
 set forth in our patents or patent 
applications. As a result, we may not 
be able to obtain or maintain protection for 
certain inventions, and 
 there 
can 
be 
no 
assurance 
that 
the 
patents 
we 
file, 
or 
those 
that 
are 
issued, 
will 
not 
be 
vulnerable 
to 
claims 
of 
invalidity 
or 
 unenforceability. 
 Even if 
patents do 
successfully issue, 
our owned 
or in-licensed 
patents may 
not adequately 
protect our 
intellectual property, 
provide 
 exclusivity 
for 
our products 
or product 
candidates, 
prevent 
others 
from 
designing 
around our 
claims or 
otherwise 
provide 
us with 
a 
 competitive advantage. Competitors 
may use our technologies 
in jurisdictions where we 
have not obtained or 
are unable to adequately 
 enforce patent protection 
to develop their 
own products and, 
further, may 
export otherwise infringing 
products to territories 
where we 
 have patent protection, but enforcement 
is not as strong as that in 
the United States and Europe. 
These products may compete with 
our 
 products, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not 
be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing with us. 
 We also cannot offer any assurances about 
which, if any, patents will 
issue, the breadth of 
any such patents or 
whether any issued patents 
 will 
be 
found 
invalid 
or 
unenforceable 
or 
will 
be 
threatened 
by 
third 
parties. 
In 
addition, 
third 
parties 
may 
challenge 
the 
validity, 
 enforceability, ownership, inventorship or scope of any of our patents. Any successful challenge to any of our patents or our in-licensed 
 patents could 
deprive us 
of rights 
necessary for 
the successful 
commercialization 
of any 
product candidate 
that we 
may develop 
and 
 could impair or eliminate our ability to collect future 
revenues and royalties with respect to such products or product 
candidates. If any 
 of our 
patent 
applications 
with 
respect to 
our 
product 
candidates fail 
to issue 
as patents, 
if 
their breadth 
or strength 
of protection 
is 
 narrowed 
or 
threatened, 
or 
if they 
fail 
to 
provide 
meaningful 
exclusivity 
or 
competitive 
position, 
it could 
dissuade 
companies 
from 
 collaborating with us or otherwise adversely affect our 
competitive position. 
 In addition, 
patents have 
a limited 
lifespan. In 
the United 
States, for 
example, the 
natural expiration 
of a 
patent is 
generally 20 
years 
 after its effective 
filing date. Various 
extensions may be available, 
however, the 
life of a patent and 
the protection it affords 
is limited. 
 Given the amount of time required for the development, testing, regulatory review 
and approval of new product candidates, our patents 
 protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. If we encounter delays in obtaining 
 regulatory approvals, the period of time during which we 
could market a product under patent 
protection could be further reduced. Even 
 if patents covering 
our product candidates 
are obtained, once 
such patents expire, 
or if such patents 
are waived or 
suspended, we may 
 be vulnerable to competition from 
similar or biosimilar products. 
Any expiration, waiver or suspension 
of our patent or 
other intellectual 
 property protection 
by the U.S. 
or other 
foreign governments 
could lead 
to the launch 
of a 
similar or 
biosimilar version 
of one 
of our 
 products and would likely result 
in an immediate and substantial reduction 
in the demand for our product, which 
could have a material 
 adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations 
and prospects. 
 We may not be able to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights in all jurisdictions, and 
we cannot guarantee that the patent 
 rights we have will prevent others from competing with us. 
 The 
patent 
position 
of 
pharmaceutical 
companies 
is 
generally 
uncertain 
because 
it 
involves 
complex 
legal, 
scientific 
and 
factual 
 considerations 
for which 
legal principles 
remain unsolved. 
The standards 
applied by 
the United 
States Patent 
and Trademark 
Office 
 USPTO and foreign patent offices in 
granting patents are not 
always applied uniformly or predictably, and can 
change. Additionally, 
 the laws 
of some 
foreign countries 
do not 
protect intellectual 
property rights 
to the 
same extent 
as the 
laws of 
the United 
States, and 
 many companies have encountered significant challenges in protecting 
and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. We 
may face 
 similar challenges. 
The legal 
systems of 
certain countries, 
particularly 
certain developing 
countries, do 
not favor 
the enforcement 
of 

69 
 patents and 
other intellectual 
property rights, 
particularly those 
relating to 
biotechnology, 
which could 
make it 
difficult for 
us to 
stop 
 the 
infringement, 
misappropriation 
or 
other 
violation 
of 
our 
patents 
or 
other 
intellectual 
property, 
including 
the 
unauthorized 
 reproduction of our manufacturing 
or other know-how or 
the marketing of competing 
products in violation of 
our intellectual property 
 rights generally. 
Any of these outcomes 
could impair our 
ability to prevent 
competition from third 
parties, which may 
have a material 
 adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results 
of operations and prospects. 
 Further, 
the existence 
of issued 
patents does 
not guarantee 
our right 
to practice 
the patented 
technology or 
commercialize a 
patented 
 product candidate. 
Third parties 
may design 
around our 
patents, or 
have or 
obtain rights 
to patents 
which they 
may use 
to prevent 
or 
 attempt to prevent 
us from practicing our 
patented technology or commercializing 
any of our patented product 
candidates. As a result, 
 we could be prevented from selling 
our products unless we were able 
to obtain a license under such third-party patents, 
which may not 
 be available on commercially reasonable 
terms or at 
all. In addition, third 
parties may seek approval 
to market their 
own products similar 
 to 
or otherwise 
competitive 
with 
our 
products 
and 
such products 
may not 
violate 
our 
patent 
rights. 
We 
may 
also need 
to assert 
our 
 patents against third parties, including by filing lawsuits alleging patent 
infringement. In any such proceeding, a third party may assert, 
 and a court or 
agency of competent jurisdiction may 
find, our asserted patents 
to be invalid or 
unenforceable. Any of the foregoing 
could 
 have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, 
results of operations and prospects. 
 There is a substantial amount of intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and 
we may become 
 party to, or 
threatened with, litigation 
or other adversarial 
proceedings regarding 
intellectual property rights. 
Proceedings to defend 
or 
 enforce our patent rights, 
whether or not successful 
and whether or 
not meritorious, could result 
in substantial costs and 
divert our efforts 
 and attention from other aspects of our business, could 
put our patents at risk of being invalidated or held 
unenforceable, or interpreted 
 more narrowly. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial or other resources to file and pursue such claims, which 
 often last for years before they are 
concluded. Some claimants may have substantially 
greater resources than we do and 
may be able to 
 sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation to a greater degree and for longer periods of time than we could. In addition, 
 patent holding companies 
that focus solely 
on extracting royalties 
and settlements by 
enforcing patent rights 
may target us, 
especially 
 as we gain greater visibility and market exposure 
as a public company. 
In addition, our enforcement of our patent rights could 
provoke 
 third parties 
to assert 
counterclaims against 
us. Third 
parties also 
may raise 
similar claims 
before administrative 
bodies in 
the United 
 States or abroad, even outside the context 
of litigation. We may not prevail in any lawsuits or 
administrative proceedings that we initiate 
 and the 
damages or 
other remedies 
awarded, if 
any, 
may not 
be commercially 
meaningful. If 
a third 
party were 
to prevail 
on a 
legal 
 assertion of invalidity 
or unenforceability, 
we could lose 
part or all 
of the patent 
protection on one 
or more of 
our product candidates, 
 which could result in 
our competitors and other 
third parties using our 
technology to compete with 
us. An adverse outcome 
in a litigation 
 or administrative proceeding 
involving our patents could 
limit our ability to assert our 
patents against competitors, affect 
our ability to 
 receive royalties or other licensing consideration from 
our licensees, and may curtail 
or preclude our ability to 
exclude third parties from 
 making, using and 
selling similar or 
competitive products. Any 
of these occurrences 
could have a 
material adverse effect 
on our business, 
 financial condition, 
results of operations 
and prospects. 
Accordingly, 
our efforts 
to enforce our 
intellectual property 
rights around 
the 
 world may be inadequate to 
obtain a significant commercial advantage 
from the intellectual property that 
we develop, acquire or license. 
 Many countries, including certain 
countries in Asia, have compulsory 
licensing laws under which a patent 
owner may be compelled 
to 
 grant licenses to third parties. In 
addition, many countries limit the enforceability of 
patents against government agencies or government 
 contractors. In these countries, 
the patent owner may 
have limited remedies, which 
could materially diminish the 
value of such patent. 
 If we 
or any 
of our 
licensors is 
forced to grant 
a license 
to third 
parties with respect 
to any patents 
relevant to 
our business, 
our competitive 
 position 
may be 
impaired, 
and our 
business, financial 
condition, results 
of operations 
and prospects 
may be 
adversely affected. 
Our 
 owned and in-licensed patents may be subject to a reservation of rights by one or more third parties. For example, the research resulting 
 in certain 
of our 
licensors 
patents and 
technology, 
including 
patents and 
technology 
relating to 
UB-612, 
was funded 
in part 
by the 
 Taiwanese government. 
As a result, the Taiwanese government 
may have certain rights to such patent rights and technology. 
 Furthermore, certain of our patents and technology, 
including patents and technology relating to UB-312, were funded in part by grants 
 from nonprofit 
third parties, 
including the 
MJFF and 
CEPI. We 
are required 
to fulfill 
certain contractual 
obligations with 
respect to 
 products 
created 
using 
such 
grant 
funding, 
including 
certain 
reporting 
requirements. 
If 
these 
grant 
proposals 
are 
awarded, 
or 
if 
we 
 receive 
funding 
from 
other 
nonprofit 
third 
parties 
in 
the 
future, 
we 
may 
be 
required 
to fulfill 
other 
contractual 
obligations, 
such 
as 
 publishing the 
results of our 
scientific studies, making 
certain products available 
at an affordable 
price in a 
list of clearly 
defined low 
 and 
lower-middle 
income 
countries 
and 
ensuring 
that 
certain 
products 
are 
available 
in 
geographic 
regions 
where 
there 
has 
been 
an 
 outbreak of an infectious disease at certain reduced economic rates. 
 If we or our 
licensors infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate intellectual property 
of third parties, we 
may face increased costs 
 or we may be unable to commercialize our product candidates. 
 Many of our current and former employees, consultants and 
independent contractors including our senior management, were previously 
 employed at universities or at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including some 
which may be competitors or potential 
 competitors. 
Although 
we 
try 
to 
ensure 
that 
our 
employees, 
consultants 
and 
independent 
contractors 
do 
not 
use 
the 
proprietary 
 information 
or 
know-how 
of 
others 
in 
their 
work 
for 
us, 
we 
may 
be 
subject 
to 
claims 
that 
we 
or 
these 
employees, 
consultants 
or 
 independent contractors 
have used 
or disclosed 
intellectual property, 
including trade 
secrets or 
other proprietary 
information, of 
such 
 individual s current 
or former employers, or that patents and 
applications we have filed to protect 
inventions of these individuals, even 

70 
 those related to one or more of our current or future 
product candidates, are rightfully owned by their former or concurrent employer. In 
 addition, while we 
typically require our employees, 
consultants and independent 
contractors who may be 
involved in the development 
 of intellectual property 
to execute agreements 
assigning such intellectual 
property to us, we 
may be unsuccessful 
in executing such 
an 
 agreement with each 
party who in 
fact develops intellectual 
property that we 
regard as our 
own, or such 
agreements may be 
breached 
 or alleged 
to be 
ineffective, and 
the assignment 
may not 
be self-executing, 
which may 
result in 
claims by 
or against 
us related 
to the 
 ownership of such intellectual property or may result in such intellectual property 
becoming assigned to third parties. 
 Third parties have, and may in the 
future have, U.S. and non-U.S. issued patents 
and pending patent applications relating to compounds, 
 methods of manufacturing 
compounds or methods 
of use for 
the treatment of 
the disease indications 
for which we 
are developing 
our 
 product candidates that 
may cover our product 
candidates. For example, 
we are aware of 
certain third-party U.S. 
and non-U.S. patents 
 and patent applications, including those of our competitors, 
that relate to anti-alpha synuclein binding molecules that may be construed 
 to cover 
the technology used 
in our anti-alpha 
synuclein vaccine product 
candidate. We 
are also aware 
of certain third-party 
U.S. and 
 non-U.S. 
patents 
and 
patent 
applications, 
including 
those of 
our 
competitors, 
that 
relate to 
coronavirus 
vaccines 
and 
treatments 
and 
 vaccines against other 
infectious diseases and we 
expect such third 
parties to have filed 
additional patent applications, 
which have not 
 yet been published and to file additional patent applications in the future. 
 In the event that any of these patent rights were asserted against us, we believe that we have defenses against any such action, including 
 that such patents 
would not be 
infringed by our 
product candidates and/or 
that such patents are 
not valid. However, 
if any such 
patent 
 rights were to 
be asserted against 
us and our 
defenses to such 
assertion were 
unsuccessful, unless 
we obtain a 
license to such 
patents, 
 we could be liable 
for damages, which could 
be significant and include 
treble damages and attorneys 
fees if we are 
found to willfully 
 infringe such 
patents. We 
could also 
be precluded 
from commercializing 
any product candidates 
that were ultimately 
held to 
infringe 
 such patents, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, 
financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 Uncertainties resulting from our participation in patent litigation or 
other proceedings could have a material adverse 
effect on our ability 
 to 
compete 
in 
the 
marketplace. 
Furthermore, 
because 
of 
the 
substantial 
amount 
of 
discovery 
required 
in 
certain 
jurisdictions 
in 
 connection 
with 
intellectual 
property 
litigation, 
there 
is 
a 
risk 
that 
some 
of 
our 
confidential 
information 
could 
be 
compromised 
by 
 disclosure during this 
type of litigation. 
There could also 
be public announcements 
of the results of 
hearings, motions or 
other interim 
 proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, the perceived value of our product 
 candidates 
or intellectual 
property 
could be 
diminished. 
Accordingly, 
the market 
price of 
our Class 
A common 
stock could 
decline. 
 Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect 
 on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 Changes to 
the patent 
law in 
the United 
States and 
other jurisdictions 
could increase 
the uncertainties 
and costs 
surrounding the 
 prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, thereby impairing our ability to protect 
 our technologies and product candidates. 
 As is the case 
with other biopharmaceutical 
companies, our success 
is heavily dependent 
on intellectual property, 
particularly patents. 
 Obtaining and 
enforcing patents 
in the 
biopharmaceutical industry 
involves both 
technological and 
legal complexity 
and is 
therefore 
 costly, 
time-consuming 
and inherently 
uncertain. Changes 
in either 
the patent 
laws or 
interpretation of 
the patent 
laws in 
the United 
 States or 
abroad could 
increase the 
uncertainties and 
costs surrounding 
the prosecution 
of patent 
applications and 
the enforcement 
or 
 defense of 
issued patents. 
For example, 
recent U.S. 
Supreme Court 
rulings have 
narrowed the 
scope of 
patent protection 
available in 
 certain 
circumstances 
and 
weakened 
the 
rights 
of 
patent 
owners 
in 
certain 
situations. 
Specifically, 
these 
decisions 
stand 
for 
the 
 proposition that patent 
claims that 
recite laws 
of nature are 
not themselves 
patentable unless those 
patent claims have 
sufficient additional 
 features 
that 
provide 
practical 
assurance 
that 
the 
processes 
are 
genuine 
inventive 
applications 
of 
those 
laws. 
What 
constitutes 
a 
 sufficient additional 
feature is 
uncertain. Furthermore, 
in view 
of these 
decisions, since 
December 2014, 
the USPTO 
has published 
 and continues 
to publish 
revised guidelines 
for patent 
examiners to 
apply when 
examining process 
claims for 
patent eligibility. 
This 
 combination of 
events has 
created uncertainty 
with respect 
to the 
validity and 
enforceability of 
patents, even 
once they 
are obtained. 
 Depending on future actions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could 
 change in 
unpredictable ways. 
In addition, 
the complexity 
and uncertainty 
of European 
and Asian 
patent laws 
have also 
increased in 
 recent years. 
Complying with 
these laws and 
regulations could 
have a material 
adverse effect 
on our existing 
patent portfolio and 
our 
 ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property in the future. 
 Obtaining and maintaining our patent protection, including patents licensed from 
third parties, depends on compliance with various 
 procedural, documentary, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental 
patent agencies, and our patent protection 
 could be reduced or eliminated for noncompliance with these requirements. 
 Periodic maintenance 
fees, renewal 
fees, annuity 
fees and 
various other 
governmental fees 
on patents 
and patent 
applications will 
be 
 due to 
be paid 
to the 
USPTO and 
various government 
patent agencies 
outside the 
United States 
over the 
lifetime of 
our patents 
and 
 patent applications and any patent rights we may own or license in the future. Additionally, 
the USPTO and various government patent 
 agencies 
outside 
the 
United 
States 
require 
compliance 
with 
a 
number 
of 
procedural, 
documentary, 
fee 
payment 
and 
other 
similar 
 provisions during the patent application process. In certain cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other 
 means in accordance with 
rules applicable to the 
particular jurisdiction. However, there are situations 
in which noncompliance 
can result 

71 
 in 
abandonment 
or 
lapse 
of 
the 
patent 
or 
patent 
application, 
resulting 
in 
partial 
or 
complete 
loss 
of 
patent 
rights 
in 
the 
relevant 
 jurisdiction. For example, certain of 
our patents which include claims 
utilized in our UB-311 anti-A vaccine product candidate 
recently 
 lapsed in certain European and Asian countries due to non-payment of fees. Noncompliance events that could result in abandonment or 
 lapse of a patent or patent application include failure to respond to official communications within prescribed 
time limits, non-payment 
 of 
fees 
and 
failure 
to 
properly 
legalize 
and 
submit 
formal 
documents. 
If 
we 
or 
our 
licensors fail 
to 
maintain 
the 
patents 
and 
patent 
 applications 
covering 
or 
otherwise 
protecting 
our 
technologies 
or 
our 
product 
candidates, 
our 
competitors 
may 
be 
able 
to 
enter 
the 
 market with 
similar or 
identical products 
or technology 
without infringing 
our patents, 
which could have 
a material 
adverse effect 
on 
 our business. 
In addition, 
to the 
extent that 
we have 
responsibility for 
taking any 
action related 
to the 
prosecution or 
maintenance of 
 patents or patent applications in-licensed 
from a third party, any failure 
on our part to 
maintain the in-licensed intellectual property 
could 
 jeopardize our rights 
under the relevant 
license and may 
have a material 
adverse effect 
on our business, 
financial condition, 
results of 
 operations and prospects. 
 If we do not 
obtain patent term extensions 
and data exclusivity 
for each of 
our product candidates, 
our business may be 
materially 
 harmed. 
 Depending upon 
the timing, duration 
and specifics of 
any FDA marketing 
approval in the 
United States of 
any product candidates 
we 
 may develop, one 
or more of our 
U.S. patents may be 
eligible for limited patent 
term extension under the 
Drug Price Competition 
and 
 Patent Term Restoration Action of 1984 Hatch-Waxman Amendments ). The Hatch-Waxman 
Amendments permit a patent extension 
 term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. A patent term extension cannot 
 extend the 
remaining term 
of a 
patent beyond 
a total 
of 14 
years from 
the date 
of product 
approval, only 
one patent 
applicable to 
an 
 approved drug may be extended and 
only those claims covering the approved 
drug, a method for using it, 
or a method for 
manufacturing 
 it may be extended. The 
length of the patent term 
extension is typically calculated as 
one half of the 
clinical trial period plus the 
entire 
 period of time 
during the review of 
the NDA or 
BLA by the 
FDA, minus any 
time of delay 
by the applicant 
during these periods. 
We 
 might not be granted a 
patent term extension at all, 
because of, for example, failure 
to apply within the 
applicable period, failure to apply 
 prior to the expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failure to satisfy any 
of the numerous applicable requirements. 
 In the 
European Union, 
a maximum 
of five 
and a 
half years 
of supplementary 
protection can 
be achieved 
for an 
active ingredient 
or 
 combinations of active 
ingredients of a 
medicinal product protected 
by a basic 
patent, if a 
valid marketing 
authorization exists (which 
 must be 
the first 
authorization to 
place the 
product on 
the market 
as a 
medicinal product) 
and if 
the product 
has not 
already been 
the 
 subject of 
supplementary protection. 
Although all 
countries in 
Europe must 
provide supplementary 
protection certificates, 
there is 
no 
 unified legislation among European countries and 
so supplementary protection certificates must 
be applied for and 
granted on a country-
 by-country basis. This can lead 
to a substantial cost to 
apply for and receive 
these certificates, which may vary 
among countries or not 
 be provided at all. Further, we may not receive an extension because of, for example, failing to exercise due diligence during the testing 
 phase or regulatory review 
process, failing to apply within applicable 
deadlines, failing to apply prior 
to expiration of relevant patents, 
 or otherwise 
failing to 
satisfy applicable 
requirements. Moreover, 
the length 
of the extension 
could be 
less than we 
request. If 
we are 
 unable to obtain patent term extension or if the term of any such extension is less than we request, our competitors may obtain approval 
 of competing products earlier than expected following our patent expiration, and our business, financial condition, results of operations 
 and prospects could be materially harmed. 
 If we 
are 
unable to 
protect 
the confidentiality 
of our 
proprietary 
information 
and trade 
secrets, the 
value 
of our 
technology 
and 
 products could be materially adversely affected. 
 In addition to patent protection, we also 
rely on trade secrets and confidentiality agreements 
to protect other proprietary information that 
 is not patentable or that we elect 
not to patent. To maintain the confidentiality of trade secrets and proprietary information, we enter into 
 confidentiality agreements with our 
employees, consultants, independent contractors, 
collaborators, contract manufacturers, CROs and 
 others upon the commencement of 
their relationships with us. These agreements 
require that all confidential information developed 
by 
 the individual or entity or made known to the 
individual or entity by us during the course of 
the individual s or entity s relationship with 
 us be kept confidential 
and not disclosed to 
third parties. Our 
agreements with employees as 
well as our personnel 
policies also generally 
 provide that any inventions conceived 
by the individual in the course 
of rendering services to us shall 
be our exclusive property or that 
 we may obtain full 
rights to such inventions 
at our election. However, 
we cannot guarantee that 
we have entered into 
such agreements 
 with each party that may 
have or has had access to 
our trade secrets or proprietary technology 
and processes and cannot guarantee 
that 
 individuals with 
whom we 
have these 
agreements will 
comply with 
their terms. 
In the 
event of 
unauthorized use 
or disclosure 
of our 
 trade secrets or proprietary information, these agreements, even if obtained, may not provide meaningful protection, particularly for our 
 trade secrets. 
 We may not have adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use 
or disclosure of our proprietary information in 
the case of a breach 
 of 
any 
such 
agreements 
and 
our 
trade 
secrets 
and 
other 
proprietary 
information 
could 
be 
disclosed 
to 
third 
parties, 
including 
our 
 competitors. Many 
of our partners 
also collaborate 
with our competitors 
and other 
third parties. The 
disclosure of 
our trade 
secrets to 
 our competitors, 
or more 
broadly, 
would impair 
our competitive 
position and 
may materially 
harm our 
business, financial 
condition, 
 results of operations and prospects. Costly and time-consuming 
litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine 
the scope of our 
 proprietary 
rights, 
and 
failure 
to 
maintain 
trade 
secret 
protection 
could 
adversely 
affect 
our 
competitive 
business 
position. 
The 
 enforceability of confidentiality 
agreements may vary from 
jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Courts 
outside the United States 
are sometimes 

72 
 less willing 
to protect 
proprietary information, 
technology and 
know-how. 
In addition, 
others may 
independently discover 
or develop 
 substantially 
equivalent 
or 
superior 
proprietary 
information 
and 
techniques, 
and 
the 
existence 
of 
our 
own 
trade 
secrets 
affords 
no 
 protection against such independent discovery. 
 If our 
trademarks and 
trade names 
are not 
adequately protected, 
we may 
not be 
able to 
build name 
recognition in 
our markets 
of 
 interest and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may 
be adversely affected. 
 We rely on our trademarks for 
name recognition by potential 
partners and customers in 
our markets of interest. 
However, our trademarks 
 or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined 
to be infringing on other marks. We 
may 
 not be 
able to 
protect our 
rights to 
these trademarks 
and 
trade names 
or may 
be forced 
to stop 
using 
these names 
or marks. 
During 
 trademark registration 
proceedings, we 
may receive 
rejections that 
we may 
be unable 
to overcome. 
In addition, 
in the USPTO 
and in 
 comparable agencies in many foreign jurisdictions, third parties are given an opportunity to oppose pending trademark applications and 
 to seek to cancel registered trademarks. Opposition 
or cancellation proceedings may be filed 
against our trademarks, and our trademarks 
 or trademark 
applications may 
not survive 
such proceedings. 
If we 
are unable 
to establish 
name recognition 
based on 
our trademarks 
 and trade 
names, we may 
not be able 
to compete 
effectively and 
our business, financial 
condition, results of 
operations and 
prospects 
 may be adversely affected. 
 Intellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats. 
 The degree of 
future protection afforded 
by our proprietary 
and intellectual 
property rights is 
uncertain because 
such rights offer 
only 
 limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to 
gain or keep our competitive advantage. For example: 
 
others may be able 
to develop products 
that are similar 
to, or better 
than, our product candidates 
in a way 
that is not 
covered 
 by the claims of the patents we license or may own currently or in the future; 
 
we, 
or 
our 
licensing 
partners 
or 
current 
or 
future 
collaborators, 
might 
not 
have 
been 
the 
first 
to 
make 
or 
file 
patent 
 applications 
for 
the 
inventions 
covered 
by 
issued 
patents 
or 
pending 
patent 
applications 
that 
we 
license 
or 
may 
own 
 currently or in the future; 
 
we may 
not have 
the financial 
or other 
resources necessary 
to enforce 
a patent 
infringement or 
other proprietary 
rights 
 violation action; 
 
we may choose not to file 
a patent for certain trade secrets 
or know-how, 
and a third party may subsequently 
file a patent 
 covering such intellectual property; 
 
our trade 
secrets or 
proprietary know-how 
may be 
unlawfully disclosed, 
thereby losing 
their trade 
secret or 
proprietary 
 status; 
 
our competitors or other third 
parties might conduct research and 
development activities in countries where 
we do not have 
 patent 
rights and 
then 
use 
the information 
learned from 
such activities 
to 
develop 
competitive 
products 
for 
sale in 
our 
 major commercial markets; 
 
it is possible that there are prior public disclosures that could invalidate our 
or our licensors patents; 
 
the patents of 
third parties or 
pending or future 
applications of third 
parties, if issued, 
may have an 
adverse effect on 
our 
 business; 
 
third parties could design around our patents, or independently 
develop trade secrets that provide them with an advantage 
 over us; 
 
any patents that 
we obtain may 
not provide us 
with any competitive 
advantages or may ultimately 
be found not 
to be owned 
 by us, or to be invalid or unenforceable; or 
 
we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable. 
 Should any of these events occur, they could significantly 
harm our business, financial conditions, results of operations and prospects. 

73 
 Risks Related to Our Business and Industry 
 Even if 
we, or 
any current 
or future 
collaborators, 
are able 
to commercialize 
any product 
candidate that 
we or 
they develop, 
the 
 successful commercialization of our product candidates will depend in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, private 
 health insurers 
and other 
third-party payors 
provide coverage 
and adequate 
reimbursement levels 
and implement 
pricing policies 
 favorable 
for 
our 
product 
candidates. 
Failure 
to 
obtain 
or 
maintain 
coverage 
and 
adequate 
reimbursement 
for 
our 
product 
 candidates, if approved, could limit our ability to market those products and decrease 
our ability to generate revenue. 
 The healthcare 
industry is 
acutely focused 
on cost 
containment, both 
in the 
United States 
and elsewhere. 
Government authorities 
and 
 third-party payors have attempted 
to control costs by limiting coverage 
and the amount of reimbursement. The 
insurance coverage and 
 reimbursement status of 
newly approved products 
is uncertain and failure 
to obtain or maintain 
adequate coverage and 
reimbursement 
 for 
our product 
candidates could 
limit our 
ability to 
generate revenue. 
Our business 
model is 
also focused 
on lowering 
the cost 
and 
 increasing the accessibility of healthcare. Even if we are successful in 
driving down the cost of healthcare, third- party payors 
may still 
 not view our product candidates, if approved, as cost-effective, and coverage and reimbursement may not be available to our patients or 
 may 
not 
be 
sufficient 
to 
allow 
our 
products, 
if 
any, 
to 
be 
marketed 
on 
a 
competitive 
basis. 
If 
coverage 
and 
reimbursement 
are 
not 
 available, or reimbursement is available only to limited 
levels, patient subpopulations of labeled indications, or otherwise 
restricted, we, 
 or any collaborators, may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates. Even if coverage is provided, the approved 
 reimbursement amount may not be high enough 
to allow us, or any collaborators, to establish or maintain pricing 
sufficient to realize a 
 sufficient return on our or their investments. Cost-control initiatives could also 
cause us to decrease any price we might 
establish for our 
 product candidates, 
which could 
result in 
lower than 
anticipated product 
revenues. Moreover, 
eligibility for 
reimbursement 
does not 
 imply that any product will be 
paid for in all cases or 
at a rate that covers 
our costs, including our costs related to 
research, development, 
 manufacture, 
sale and 
distribution. 
Reimbursement 
rates may 
vary, 
by way 
of example, 
according 
to the 
use of 
the product 
and the 
 clinical setting 
in which 
it is 
used. For 
products administered 
under the 
supervision of 
a physician, 
obtaining coverage 
and adequate 
 reimbursement may be difficult because of the higher costs often associated with administering such drugs. If the prices for our product 
 candidates, if approved, 
decrease or if governmental 
and other third-party payors 
do not provide adequate 
coverage or reimbursement, 
 our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will suffer, 
perhaps materially. 
 There is significant uncertainty related to the insurance 
coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. 
In the United States, 
 the CMS, 
the federal 
agency responsible 
for administering 
the Medicare 
program, makes 
the principal 
decisions about 
coverage 
and 
 reimbursement for new treatments under Medicare. Private 
payors may follow CMS to 
a substantial degree. It is 
difficult to predict what 
 CMS will decide with 
respect to reimbursement 
for novel products such 
as ours. In addition, 
certain Affordable Care 
Act marketplace 
 and other 
private payor 
plans are required 
to include 
coverage for 
certain preventative 
services, including 
vaccinations recommended 
 by the U.S. Centers 
for Disease Control s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ACIP without cost share obligations (i.e., 
 co- 
payments, 
deductibles 
or 
co-insurance) 
for 
plan 
members. 
For 
Medicare 
beneficiaries, 
some 
of 
our 
product 
candidates 
may 
be 
 covered 
for 
reimbursement 
under 
either 
the 
Part 
B 
program 
or 
Part 
D 
program 
depending 
on 
several 
criteria, 
including 
the 
type 
of 
 vaccine 
and 
the 
beneficiary s 
coverage 
eligibility. 
If 
our 
product 
candidates, 
once 
approved, 
are 
reimbursed 
only 
under 
the 
Part 
D 
 program, physicians 
may be 
less willing 
to use 
our products 
because 
of the 
claims adjudication 
costs and 
time related 
to the 
claims 
 adjudication process 
and collection 
of copayments 
associated with 
the Part 
D program. 
If our 
product candidates, 
once approved, 
are 
 reimbursed only under the Part B 
program, certain potential drawbacks 
associated with the Part B program, 
such as the time and effort 
 required to seek reimbursement 
after purchase, may make our 
product candidates less attractive to 
clinics or other potential customers. 
 Outside of Medicare, private 
insurance is likely 
to raise similar 
claims adjudication and copayment 
considerations, which may also 
make 
 our product candidates less attractive to potential customers using private 
insurance. 
 Outside the United 
States, certain countries 
set prices and 
reimbursement for pharmaceutical 
products, with limited 
participation from 
 the marketing authorization holders. We cannot be sure that such 
prices and reimbursement will be acceptable to 
us or our collaborators. 
 If the 
regulatory authorities 
in these 
jurisdictions set 
prices or 
reimbursement levels 
that are 
not commercially 
attractive for 
us or 
our 
 collaborators, 
our 
revenues 
from 
sales 
by 
us 
or 
our 
collaborators, 
and 
the 
potential 
profitability 
of 
our 
product 
candidates, 
in 
those 
 countries would 
be negatively 
affected. 
Additionally, 
some countries 
require approval 
of the 
sale price 
of a 
product before 
it can 
be 
 marketed. In many countries, the pricing 
review period begins after marketing or product 
licensing approval is granted. As a 
result, we 
 might obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular country, but then may experience delays in the reimbursement approval of 
 our product or be subject to price regulations that would delay our commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, 
 which could negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the 
sale of the product in that particular country. 
 Moreover, 
an increasing 
number of 
countries are 
taking initiatives 
to attempt 
to reduce 
large budget 
deficits by 
focusing cost-cutting 
 efforts on pharmaceuticals 
for their state-run 
healthcare systems. These 
international price control 
efforts have impacted 
all regions of 
 the world, notably in 
the European Union. In 
some countries, in particular 
in many Member States 
of the European Union, 
we may be 
 required 
to 
conduct 
a 
clinical 
trial 
or 
other 
studies 
that 
compare 
the 
cost-effectiveness 
of 
our 
product 
candidates 
to 
other 
available 
 therapies in order to 
obtain or maintain reimbursement 
or pricing approval. In 
addition, publication of discounts 
by third- party payors 
 or authorities may lead to further pressure on the prices or reimbursement 
levels within the country of publication and other countries. 
 If reimbursement of our products is 
unavailable or limited in scope 
or amount, or if pricing is set 
at unsatisfactory levels, our business, 
 financial condition, results of operations 
or prospects could be materially adversely 
affected. Cost-control initiatives 
could cause us, or 

74 
 any collaborators, 
to decrease the 
price we, or 
they, might 
establish for products, 
which could result 
in lower than 
anticipated product 
 revenues. Further, our competitors have 
more experience dealing with and contracting with payors for preferred coverage, which could 
 potentially 
put 
us 
at 
a 
competitive 
disadvantage. 
An 
inability 
to 
promptly 
obtain 
coverage 
and 
adequate 
payment 
rates 
from 
both 
 government-funded 
and private 
payors for 
any of 
our product 
candidates for 
which we, 
or any 
future collaborator, 
obtain marketing 
 approval could 
significantly harm 
our operating 
results, our 
ability to 
raise capital 
needed to 
commercialize products 
and our 
overall 
 financial condition. 
 Our business 
and current 
and future 
relationships with 
third-party 
payors, healthcare 
professionals and 
customers in 
the United 
 States and elsewhere will be subject to applicable healthcare laws and regulations, which 
could expose us to significant penalties. 
 Healthcare 
providers, 
physicians 
and 
third-party 
payors 
in 
the 
United 
States 
and 
elsewhere 
will 
play 
a 
primary 
role 
in 
the 
 recommendation 
and 
prescription 
of 
any 
product 
candidates 
for 
which 
we 
obtain 
marketing 
approval. 
Our 
current 
and 
future 
 arrangements with healthcare professionals, third-party payors and customers expose us to 
broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other 
 healthcare laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal civil False Claims Act, 
 that may constrain the business or 
financial arrangements and relationships through which we 
conduct clinical research, sell, market and 
 distribute any products for which we obtain marketing 
approval. In addition, we may be 
subject to physician payment transparency laws 
 and 
patient 
privacy 
regulation 
by 
the 
federal 
government 
and 
by 
the 
U.S. 
states 
and 
foreign 
jurisdictions 
in 
which 
we 
conduct 
our 
 business. 
 Efforts 
to ensure 
that our 
business arrangements 
with third 
parties will 
comply 
with applicable 
healthcare laws 
and regulations 
may 
 involve substantial costs. 
It is 
possible that governmental authorities 
will conclude that 
our business 
practices, including our 
relationships 
 with 
physicians 
and 
other 
healthcare 
providers, 
some 
of 
whom 
may 
recommend, 
purchase 
or 
prescribe 
our 
product 
candidate, 
if 
 approved, 
may 
not 
comply 
with 
current 
or 
future 
statutes, 
regulations 
or 
case 
law 
involving 
applicable 
fraud 
and 
abuse 
or 
other 
 healthcare laws and regulations. 
 If our operations are 
found to be in violation 
of any of these laws 
or any other governmental 
regulations that may 
apply to us, we 
may 
 be 
subject 
to 
significant 
civil, 
criminal 
and 
administrative 
penalties, 
including, 
without 
limitation, 
damages, 
fines, 
disgorgement, 
 individual imprisonment, exclusion 
from participation in government 
healthcare programs, such as 
Medicare and Medicaid, additional 
 reporting requirements and oversight if 
we become subject to a 
corporate integrity agreement or similar 
agreement to resolve allegations 
 of noncompliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring 
of our operations, which could have a material adverse effect 
on 
 our business. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found not to be in 
 compliance 
with 
applicable 
laws, 
they 
may 
be 
subject 
to 
criminal, 
civil 
or 
administrative 
sanctions, 
including 
exclusions 
from 
 participation in government healthcare programs, which could also materially 
affect our business. 
 Cyberattacks or 
other failures 
in our 
or our 
third-party vendors , 
contractors or 
consultants telecommunications 
or information 
 technology 
systems could 
result 
in information 
theft, compromise, 
or other 
unauthorized 
access, data 
corruption and 
significant 
 disruption 
of 
our 
business 
operations, 
and 
could 
harm 
our 
reputation 
and 
subject 
us 
to 
liability, 
lawsuits 
and 
actions 
from 
 governmental authorities. 
 The success of our research and development programs depends on data which is stored and transmitted digitally, the corruption or loss 
 of which could cause significant setback to one or all of our programs. We face a number of risks related to our use, processing, storage 
 and security of this critical information, including loss of access, inappropriate use or disclosure, inappropriate modification corruption, 
 unauthorized access or processing. Because we use third-party vendors and subcontractors 
to manage our sensitive information, we also 
 may 
not 
have 
the 
ability 
to 
adequately 
monitor, 
audit 
or 
modify 
the 
security 
controls 
over 
this 
critical 
information. 
Despite 
the 
 implementation of security measures, given the size and complexity of our internal information technology IT systems and those of 
 our 
third-party 
vendors, 
contractors 
and 
consultants, 
such 
IT 
systems 
are 
potentially 
vulnerable 
to 
breakdown 
or 
other 
damage 
or 
 interruption 
from 
service 
interruptions, 
system 
malfunction, 
natural 
disasters, 
terrorism, 
war, 
and 
telecommunication 
and 
electrical 
 failures. 
 Cyber threats are persistent 
and constantly evolving. 
Such threats, which may 
include ransomware or other 
malware, phishing attacks, 
 denial of services attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks 
and others, have increased in 
frequency, scope and potential impact in recent 
years, 
 which increase the difficulty of detecting and successfully 
defending against them. We may not be able to anticipate 
all types of security 
 threats, and, 
despite our 
efforts, we may 
not be able 
to implement 
preventive measures 
effective against 
all such security 
threats. The 
 techniques used by 
cyber criminals change frequently, 
may not be recognized 
until launched, and 
can originate from a 
wide variety of 
 sources, including outside groups such as external service providers, organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations or hostile foreign 
 governments 
or agencies. 
There 
can be 
no assurance 
that 
we or 
our 
third-party 
service 
providers, 
contractors 
or 
consultants will 
be 
 successful 
in 
preventing 
cyberattacks 
or 
successfully 
mitigating 
their 
effects. 
Our 
IT 
systems 
and 
those 
of 
our 
third-party 
service 
 providers, 
contractors 
or 
consultants 
are 
additionally 
vulnerable 
to 
security 
breaches 
from 
inadvertent 
or 
intentional 
actions 
by 
our 
 employees, 
third-party vendors, 
contractors, 
consultants, business 
partners and/or 
other third 
parties. These 
threats pose 
a risk 
to the 
 security of 
our systems 
and networks, 
the confidentiality 
and the 
availability, 
security and 
integrity of 
our data, 
and these 
risks apply 
 both to us and to third parties 
on whose systems we rely for the conduct of 
our business. If the IT systems of 
our third-party vendors and 
 other contractors 
and consultants 
become subject 
to disruptions 
or security 
breaches, we 
may have 
insufficient 
recourse against 
such 

75 
 third parties 
and we may 
have to 
expend significant 
resources to 
mitigate the 
impact of 
such an event, 
and to develop 
and implement 
 protections to prevent 
future events of 
a similar nature 
from occurring. 
Any cyberattack or 
destruction or 
loss of, unauthorized 
access 
 to, processing of, 
or exfiltration of 
data could have 
a material adverse 
effect on our 
business, financial condition, 
results of operations 
 and prospects. For example, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, or those 
of our third-party vendors 
 and other contractors and 
consultants, it could result in 
a material disruption or delay 
of the development of 
our product candidates. In 
 addition, we may suffer reputational harm or face litigation or adverse regulatory action as 
a result of cyberattacks or other data security 
 breaches, particularly those involving 
personal information or 
protected health information, 
and may incur 
significant additional expense 
 to implement 
further data 
protection measures. 
As cyber 
threats continue 
to evolve, 
we may 
be required 
to incur 
material additional 
 expenses in order to enhance our protective measures or to remediate any 
information security vulnerability. 
 We are 
subject to stringent privacy laws, 
information security laws, regulations, policies 
and contractual obligations related 
to data 
 privacy and security and changes in such laws, regulations, policies and contractual obligations could 
adversely affect our business, 
 financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 We 
are subject 
to data 
privacy 
and security 
laws and 
regulations 
that apply 
to the 
collection, transmission, 
storage, use, 
processing, 
 destruction, retention and security of personal 
information, which among other things, 
including additional laws or regulations relating 
 to 
health 
information. 
The 
legislative 
and 
regulatory 
landscape 
for 
privacy 
and 
data 
protection 
continues 
to 
evolve 
in 
jurisdictions 
 worldwide, and these laws may 
at times be conflicting. It 
is possible that these laws may 
be interpreted and applied 
in a manner that is 
 inconsistent with our practices and 
our efforts to comply 
with the evolving data protection rules 
may be unsuccessful. We 
must devote 
 significant 
resources 
to 
understanding 
and 
complying 
with 
this 
changing 
landscape. 
Failure 
to 
comply 
with 
federal, 
state 
and 
 international laws regarding privacy and security of personal information could expose us to penalties 
under such laws, orders requiring 
 that we 
change our 
practices, claims 
for damages 
or other 
liabilities, regulatory 
investigations and 
enforcement action, 
litigation 
and 
 significant 
costs for remediation, any of which could adversely affect our 
business. Even if we are not determined to 
have violated these 
 laws, 
government 
investigations 
into 
these 
issues 
typically 
require 
the 
expenditure 
of 
significant 
resources 
and 
generate 
negative 
 publicity, which have a 
material adverse effect 
on our 
business, financial condition, 
results of 
operations and prospects. 
Failure to comply 
 with any of these laws and 
regulations could result in enforcement action against 
us, including fines, criminal prosecution of employees, 
 claims 
for 
damages 
by affected 
individuals 
and damage 
to our 
reputation 
and 
loss of 
goodwill, 
any 
of which 
could have 
a material 
 adverse effect on our business, financial condition, 
results of operations and prospects. Additionally, if we are 
unable to properly protect 
 the 
privacy 
and 
security 
of 
personal 
information, 
including 
protected 
health 
information, 
we 
could 
be 
found 
to 
have 
breached 
our 
 contracts with certain third parties. 
 There are numerous U.S. federal and state laws 
and regulations related to the privacy and security of 
personal information. In particular, 
 HIPAA, 
as 
amended 
by 
the 
Health 
Information 
Technology 
for 
Economic 
and 
Clinical 
Health 
Act 
of 
2009 HITECH 
and 
their 
 respective implementing regulations, establish 
privacy and security 
standards that limit 
the use 
and disclosure of 
individually identifiable 
 health 
information, 
or 
protected 
health 
information, 
and 
require 
the 
implementation 
of 
administrative, 
physical 
and 
technological 
 safeguards to protect 
the privacy of 
protected health information 
and ensure the 
confidentiality, 
integrity and availability 
of electronic 
 protected health information. Determining 
whether protected health information 
has been handled in 
compliance with applicable privacy 
 standards 
and 
our 
contractual 
obligations 
can 
be 
complex 
and 
may 
be 
subject 
to 
changing 
interpretation. 
If 
we 
fail 
to 
comply 
with 
 applicable privacy 
laws, including 
applicable HIPAA 
privacy and 
security standards, 
we could 
face civil 
and criminal 
penalties. The 
 HHS has 
the discretion to 
impose penalties 
without attempting to 
first resolve 
violations. HHS 
enforcement activity can 
result in 
financial 
 liability 
and 
reputational 
harm, 
and 
responses 
to 
such 
enforcement 
activity 
can 
consume 
significant 
internal 
resources. 
Even 
when 
 HIPAA 
does not 
apply, 
failing to 
take appropriate 
steps to 
keep consumers 
personal information 
secure can 
constitute unfair 
acts or 
 practices in or affecting commerce and be construed as a violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission 
Act (the FTCA ), 
 15 U.S.C 45(a). The FTC 
expects a company s 
data security measures to be reasonable 
and appropriate in light of the 
sensitivity and 
 volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of 
its business, and the cost of available tools to 
improve security and 
 reduce vulnerabilities. 
Individually identifiable 
health information 
is considered 
sensitive data 
that merits 
stronger safeguards 
and the 
 FTC s guidance for appropriately securing consumers personal information 
is similar to what is required by the HIPAA Security Rule. 
 In addition, state 
attorneys general are authorized 
to bring civil actions 
seeking either injunctions 
or damages in response 
to violations 
 that 
threaten 
the privacy 
of state 
residents. 
We 
cannot 
be sure 
how 
these 
regulations 
will be 
interpreted, 
enforced 
or applied 
to our 
 operations. 
In addition 
to the 
risks associated 
with 
enforcement 
activities and 
potential 
contractual 
liabilities, our 
ongoing 
efforts 
to 
 comply with evolving laws and 
regulations at the federal and 
state level may be 
costly and require ongoing modifications 
to our policies, 
 procedures and systems. 
 Internationally, 
laws, 
regulations 
and 
standards 
in 
many 
jurisdictions 
apply 
broadly 
to 
the 
collection, 
transmission, 
storage, 
use, 
 processing, destruction, retention and 
security of 
personal information. For 
example, in the 
European Union, the 
collection, transmission, 
 storage, use, processing, destruction, retention and 
security of personal data 
is governed by 
the provisions of the 
General Data Protection 
 Regulation (the GDPR in addition to other applicable laws and 
regulations. The GDPR came into effect in May 2018, repealing 
and 
 replacing the European Union Data Protection Directive, and imposing revised data privacy and security requirements on companies in 
 relation to the processing 
of personal data of 
European Union data subjects. 
The GDPR, together with 
national legislation, regulations 
 and 
guidelines 
of 
the 
European 
Union 
Member 
States 
governing 
the 
collection, 
transmission, 
storage, 
use, 
processing, 
destruction, 
 retention 
and 
security 
of 
personal 
data, 
impose 
strict 
obligations 
with 
respect 
to, 
and 
restrictions 
on, 
the 
collection, 
use, 
retention, 
 protection, disclosure, transfer 
and processing of 
personal data. The 
GDPR also imposes strict 
rules on the 
transfer of personal data 
to 

76 
 countries outside the European Union that are 
not deemed to have protections for 
personal information, including the United States. The 
 GDPR authorizes fines 
for certain violations 
of up 
to 4 
of the 
total global annual 
turnover of 
the preceding financial 
year or 
 20 million, 
 whichever is greater. 
Such fines are in addition to 
any civil litigation claims by 
data subjects. Separately, 
Brexit has led and could 
also 
 lead to legislative and regulatory 
changes and may increase our compliance 
costs. As of January 1, 2021, and 
the expiry of transitional 
 arrangements agreed to between 
the United Kingdom and 
the European Union, data processing 
in the United Kingdom 
is governed by 
 a United Kingdom version of the GDPR (combining the GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018), exposing us to two parallel regimes, 
 each of which authorizes similar fines and other 
potentially divergent enforcement actions for certain 
violations. On June 28, 2021, the 
 European Commission 
adopted an 
adequacy decision 
for the 
United Kingdom, 
allowing for 
the relatively 
free exchange 
of personal 
 information 
between 
the 
European 
Union 
and 
the 
United 
Kingdom. 
Other 
jurisdictions 
outside 
the 
European 
Union 
are 
similarly 
 introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules and regulations, which could increase our compliance costs and the risks 
 associated with noncompliance. We cannot 
guarantee that we are, or will be, in compliance with all applicable international regulations 
 as they are enforced now or as they evolve. 
 We face potential 
liability related to the privacy of health information we obtain from clinical trials sponsored by 
us. 
 Most healthcare providers, 
including research 
institutions from which 
we obtain patient 
health information, are 
subject to privacy 
and 
 security regulations promulgated 
under HIPAA, 
as amended by the 
Health Information Technology 
for Economic and 
Clinical Health 
 Act. We 
do not believe that we are currently 
classified as a covered entity or business 
associate under HIPAA 
and thus are not directly 
 subject to its requirements 
or penalties. However, 
any person may be 
prosecuted under HIPAA s 
criminal provisions either 
directly or 
 under aiding-and-abetting or conspiracy principles. Consequently, 
depending on the facts and circumstances, we could 
face substantial 
 criminal penalties 
if we knowingly 
receive individually 
identifiable health 
information from 
a HIPAA 
-covered healthcare 
provider or 
 research 
institution 
that 
has 
not 
satisfied 
HIPAA s 
requirements 
for 
disclosure 
of 
individually 
identifiable 
health 
information. 
Even 
 when HIPAA 
does not 
apply, 
according to 
the FTC 
failing to 
take appropriate 
steps to 
keep consumers 
personal information 
secure 
 constitutes 
unfair 
acts or 
practices in 
or affecting 
commerce 
in violation 
of 
the FTCA. 
The 
FTC expects 
a company s 
data 
security 
 measures 
to 
be 
reasonable 
and 
appropriate 
in 
light 
of 
the 
sensitivity 
and 
volume 
of 
consumer 
information 
it 
holds, 
the 
size 
and 
 complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to 
improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Individually identifiable health 
 information is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. 
 In addition, we may maintain sensitive personally identifiable information, including health information, that we receive throughout the 
 clinical 
trial 
process, 
in 
the 
course 
of 
our 
research 
collaborations. 
As 
such, 
we 
may 
be 
subject 
to 
state 
laws, 
including 
the 
CCPA, 
 requiring notification 
of affected 
individuals and 
state regulators 
in the 
event of 
a breach 
of personal 
information, which 
is a broader 
 class of information 
than the health 
information protected by 
HIPAA. Our clinical trial programs outside 
the United States 
may implicate 
 international data protection laws, including the GDPR and legislation of 
the EU member states implementing it. 
 Our activities 
outside the 
United States 
impose additional 
compliance 
requirements and 
generate additional 
risks of 
enforcement 
for 
 noncompliance. Failure by our CROs and other contractors to comply with the strict rules on the transfer of personal data outside of the 
 EU 
into 
the 
United 
States may 
result 
in 
the imposition 
of criminal 
and 
administrative 
sanctions 
on such 
collaborators, which 
could 
 adversely affect 
our business. 
Furthermore, 
certain health 
privacy laws, 
data breach 
notification laws, 
consumer 
protection laws 
and 
 genetic testing laws may apply 
directly to our operations 
and/or those of our 
collaborators and may impose restrictions 
on our collection, 
 use and dissemination of individuals health information. 
 Moreover, patients 
about whom we or 
our collaborators obtain health 
information, as well as 
the providers who share 
this information 
 with us, may have statutory or 
contractual rights that limit our ability to 
use and disclose the information. We may be required to expend 
 significant capital 
and other 
resources to 
ensure ongoing 
compliance with 
applicable privacy 
and data 
security laws. 
Claims that 
we 
 have violated 
individuals privacy 
rights or 
breached our 
contractual obligations, 
even if 
we are 
not found 
liable, could 
be expensive 
 and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm 
our business. 
 If 
we 
or 
our 
contract 
manufacturers, 
CROs or 
other 
contractors 
or 
consultants 
fail 
to 
comply 
with 
applicable 
federal, 
state 
or 
local 
 regulatory privacy requirements, we could 
be subject to a range of regulatory 
actions that could affect our or 
our contractors ability to 
 develop 
and 
commercialize 
our 
product 
candidates 
and 
could 
harm 
or 
prevent 
sales 
of 
any 
affected 
products 
that 
we 
are 
able 
to 
 commercialize, or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of developing, commercializing and marketing our products. Any 
 threatened 
or 
actual 
government 
enforcement 
action 
could 
also 
generate 
adverse 
publicity 
and 
require 
that 
we 
devote 
substantial 
 resources 
that 
could 
otherwise 
be 
used 
in 
other 
aspects 
of 
our 
business. 
Increasing 
use 
of 
social 
media 
could 
give 
rise 
to 
liability, 
 breaches of data 
security or reputational 
damage. Any of 
the foregoing could 
have a material adverse 
effect on our 
business, financial 
 condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 We 
face substantial 
competition, which 
may result 
in others 
discovering, developing 
or commercializing 
products before 
or more 
 successfully than we do. 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong 
 emphasis on proprietary products. We 
face and will continue to face competition from 
third parties that use similar platforms and from 
 third parties focused on developing and commercializing other peptide and peptide-based product candidates. The competition 
is likely 

77 
 to 
come 
from 
multiple 
sources, 
including 
large 
and 
specialty 
pharmaceutical 
and 
biotechnology 
companies, 
academic 
research 
 institutions, government agencies and public and private research institutions. 
 Many 
of 
our 
potential 
competitors, 
alone 
or 
with 
their 
strategic 
partners, 
have 
substantially 
greater 
financial, 
technical 
and 
other 
 resources 
than 
we 
do, 
such 
as 
larger 
research 
and 
development, 
clinical, 
marketing 
and 
manufacturing 
organizations. 
Mergers 
and 
 acquisitions in the biotechnology 
and pharmaceutical industries may 
result in even greater 
concentration of resources among 
a smaller 
 number of competitors. Our commercial opportunity could be 
reduced or eliminated if competitors develop and 
commercialize products 
 that are safer, 
more effective, 
have fewer 
or less severe 
side effects, 
are more 
convenient or are 
less expensive than 
any products 
that 
 we may develop. 
Our competitors also 
may obtain 
FDA or other 
regulatory approvals 
for their products 
faster or earlier 
than we may 
 obtain approval 
for ours, 
which could 
result in 
our competitors 
establishing a 
strong market 
position before 
we are 
able to 
enter the 
 market. For example, some of our competitors have already received approval from regulatory authorities for their COVID-19 vaccines 
 and 
boosters 
to address 
variants 
of 
SARS-CoV-2. 
Additionally, 
technologies 
developed 
by our 
competitors 
may 
render 
our product 
 candidates uneconomical or obsolete, and we may not be successful in marketing our product candidates against competitors products. 
 In addition, the 
availability of our 
competitors products and 
the lack of complementary 
products offered 
by our sales and 
distribution 
 team as compared to competitors with more extensive product lines, could limit the 
demand and the prices we are able to charge for any 
 products that we may develop and commercialize. 
 Developments by 
competitors may 
render our 
products or 
technologies obsolete 
or non-competitive 
or may 
reduce the 
size of 
our 
 markets. 
 Our 
industry 
has 
been 
characterized 
by 
extensive 
research 
and 
development 
efforts, 
rapid 
developments 
in 
technologies, 
intense 
 competition and a strong 
emphasis on proprietary products. 
We expect our product candidates to face 
intense and increasing competition 
 as new 
products 
enter 
the relevant 
markets 
and 
advanced technologies 
become 
available. We 
face 
potential 
competition 
from many 
 different 
sources, 
including 
pharmaceutical, 
biotechnology 
and 
specialty pharmaceutical 
companies. 
Academic research 
institutions, 
 governmental 
agencies 
and 
public 
and 
private 
institutions 
are 
also 
potential 
sources 
of 
competitive 
products 
and 
technologies. 
Our 
 competitors may 
have or 
may develop 
superior technologies 
or approaches 
and have 
different business 
models from 
us which 
do not 
 focus 
on 
democratizing 
healthcare 
and 
on 
lower 
cost, 
all of 
which 
may 
provide 
them 
with 
competitive 
advantages. 
Many 
of 
these 
 competitors may also have 
compounds already approved or in development 
in the therapeutic categories that 
we are targeting with 
our 
 product candidates. The 
global vaccine market 
is highly concentrated 
among a small 
number of multinational 
pharmaceutical companies: 
 Pfizer, 
Merck, GlaxoSmithKline 
and Sanofi 
together control 
most of 
the global 
vaccine market. 
While we 
are not 
aware of all 
of our 
 competitors efforts, there 
are approximately fifty 
COVID-19 vaccines currently 
approved for use in one 
or more countries around 
the 
 world. We also face substantial competition in therapeutic areas outside of COVID-19. For example, the FDA approved aducanumab in 
 June 2021 
as the first FDA-approved immunotherapy for AD, and lecanemab 
in January 2023, and multiple approved products exist in 
 the fields of migraine 
and hypercholesterolemia, 
including products that 
act on the same 
therapeutic targets as 
our vaccine candidates. 
 In 
addition, 
many 
of 
our 
competitors, 
either 
alone 
or 
together 
with 
their 
collaborative 
partners, 
may 
operate 
larger 
research 
and 
 development programs or have substantially greater financial resources than 
we do, as well as greater experience in: 
 
developing product candidates; 
 
undertaking pre-clinical testing and clinical trials; 
 
obtaining BLA approval by the FDA; 
 
obtaining comparable foreign regulatory approvals of product candidates; 
 
formulating and manufacturing products; 
 
launching, marketing and selling products; and 
 
competing for market share, obtaining reimbursement and securing payor 
contractors for preferential coverage. 
 If these competitors 
access the marketplace 
with safer, more effective, 
or less 
expensive therapeutics, our 
product candidates, if 
approved 
 for commercialization, 
may not be 
profitable to sell 
or worthwhile to 
continue to develop. 
Technology 
in the pharmaceutical 
industry 
 has undergone rapid and significant change, and we expect that it will 
continue to do so. Any compounds, products or processes that we 
 develop may 
become obsolete 
or uneconomical 
before we 
recover any 
expenses incurred 
in connection 
with their 
development. The 
 success of 
our product 
candidates will 
depend upon 
factors such 
as product 
efficacy, 
safety, 
reliability, 
availability, 
timing, scope 
of 
 regulatory 
approval, 
acceptance 
and 
price, 
among 
other 
things. 
Other 
important 
factors 
to 
our 
success 
include 
speed 
in 
developing 
 product 
candidates, 
completing 
clinical 
development 
and 
laboratory 
testing, 
obtaining 
regulatory 
approvals 
and 
manufacturing 
and 
 selling commercial quantities of potential products. 
 Our product 
candidates are 
intended to 
compete directly 
or indirectly 
with existing 
products and 
products currently 
in development. 
 Even if approved and commercialized, 
our product candidates may fail to 
achieve market acceptance with hospitals, physicians, patients 

78 
 or 
third-party 
payors. 
Hospitals, 
physicians 
or 
patients 
may 
conclude 
that 
our 
products 
are 
less 
safe 
or 
effective 
or 
otherwise 
less 
 attractive than existing 
drugs. If our 
product candidates 
do not receive 
market acceptance for 
any reason, our 
revenue potential would 
 be diminished, which would materially adversely affect our ability 
to become profitable. 
 Many of 
our competitors 
have substantially 
greater capital 
resources, robust 
product candidate 
pipelines, established 
presence in 
the 
 market and expertise 
in research and development, 
manufacturing, pre-clinical and 
clinical testing, obtaining regulatory 
approvals and 
 reimbursement and 
marketing approved 
products than 
we do. 
As a 
result, our 
competitors may 
achieve product 
commercialization or 
 patent or 
other intellectual 
property protection 
earlier than 
we can. Smaller 
or early-stage 
companies may 
also prove 
to be significant 
 competitors, 
particularly 
through collaborative 
arrangements 
with large 
and 
established 
companies. 
These competitors 
also compete 
 with us in recruiting and retaining qualified clinical, regulatory, scientific, sales, marketing and management personnel and establishing 
 clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, 
our 
 programs. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced 
or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize 
products that are 
 safer, more 
effective, have fewer 
or less severe side 
effects, are more 
convenient, or are less expensive 
than any products that 
we may 
 develop or that would render any products that we may develop obsolete 
or noncompetitive. 
 We 
are subject to 
anti-corruption laws, including 
the U.S. Foreign 
Corrupt Practices Act FCPA ), 
and similar laws 
of non-U.S. 
 jurisdictions where we conduct business. If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be 
subject to civil or criminal penalties, other 
 remedial 
measures, and 
legal expenses, 
which could 
adversely affect 
our business, 
financial 
condition, 
results of 
operations 
and 
 prospects. 
 We are currently 
subject to anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA. 
The FCPA, the 
U.K. Bribery Act 2010 and other applicable anti-
 bribery and 
anti-corruption laws 
generally prohibit 
us, our 
employees and 
intermediaries from 
bribing, being 
bribed or 
making other 
 prohibited 
payments 
to 
government 
officials 
or 
other 
persons 
to 
obtain 
or 
retain 
business 
or 
gain 
other 
business 
advantages. 
In 
 furtherance of our 
goal to democratize healthcare, 
we intend to distribute 
any product candidates that 
are approved or receive 
an EUA 
 in various countries around the world, including countries with a heightened corruption risk. This may raise the risk of non-compliance 
 with anti-corruption laws and other rules and regulations prohibiting bribery and other crimes. We also participate in collaborations and 
 relationships 
with 
third 
parties 
whose 
actions 
could 
potentially 
subject 
us 
to 
liability 
under 
the 
FCPA 
or 
other 
jurisdictions 
anti-
 corruption laws, which in turn 
could result in internal and 
external investigations, associated legal costs 
and even civil fines 
and criminal 
 charges, any of which would divert 
time and resources away from 
our core business operations even 
if we and our 
employees and agents 
 do not violate laws and regulations. The FCPA 
also requires public companies to make and keep books and records 
that accurately and 
 fairly 
reflect the 
transactions of 
the corporation 
and to 
devise and 
maintain 
an adequate 
system of 
internal 
accounting controls. 
Our 
 business 
is 
heavily 
regulated 
and 
therefore 
involves 
significant 
interaction 
with 
public 
officials, 
including 
officials 
of 
non-U.S. 
 governments. Additionally, in many other countries, the health care providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are (directly or indirectly) 
 employed 
by 
their 
government, 
and 
the 
purchasers 
of 
pharmaceuticals 
are 
government 
entities; 
therefore, 
our 
dealings 
with 
these 
 prescribers and 
purchasers are 
subject to 
regulation under, 
but not 
limited to, 
the FCPA. 
In recent 
years, the 
SEC and 
Department of 
 Justice have also increased their FCPA 
enforcement activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies. 
 We are in the process of establishing a program to govern the 
compliance of any potential sales or marketing operations 
of our products, 
 should any of them be approved or receive an EUA. To 
date, we have not had a robust compliance program. We 
cannot ensure that our 
 operations to date 
have complied, and 
that our future 
operations will comply, with our 
compliance program or 
laws, rules and 
regulations 
 governing the sales and marketing 
of pharmaceutical products, government contracting and 
other aspects of our 
business. We have used, 
 and plan to use, a network of agents in countries around the world to conduct our sales and marketing operations. These agents will not 
 be our employees, 
and while we intend 
to have a robust 
diligence program in connection 
with engaging agents, 
our diligence program 
 and compliance program may not be sufficient to prevent 
wrong-doing. 
 There 
is also 
no assurance 
that we 
will be 
completely effective 
in ensuring 
our compliance 
with all 
applicable anti-corruption 
laws, 
 including the FCPA, 
particularly given the high level of complexity of these laws. We 
have adopted a code of conduct applicable to all 
 of our employees and contractors, but it is not always 
possible to identify and deter misconduct by 
these parties and other third parties, 
 and the precautions we take to detect 
and prevent this activity may not be effective in 
controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses 
 or in protecting 
us from governmental investigations 
or other actions, claims 
or lawsuits stemming from 
a failure to comply 
with such 
 laws or regulations. 
If we are 
not in compliance 
with the FCPA 
or other anti-corruption 
laws, we may 
be subject to 
criminal and civil 
 penalties, disgorgement 
and other 
sanctions and 
remedial measures, 
and legal 
expenses, which 
could have 
an adverse 
impact on 
our 
 business, financial 
condition, results of 
operations and 
prospects. Similarly, 
any investigation 
of any potential 
violations of the 
FCPA 
 or other 
anti-corruption laws 
by authorities 
in the 
United States 
or other 
jurisdictions where 
we conduct 
business could 
also have 
an 
 adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, results 
of operations and prospects. 
 As a result of our geographically diverse operations, we are more susceptible to 
certain risks. 
 We 
have 
operation 
in multiple 
countries. 
We 
have 
also used, 
and 
plan 
to use, 
a network 
of agents 
in countries 
around the 
world 
to 
 conduct 
our sales 
and marketing 
operations. 
If we 
are unable 
to manage 
the risks 
of our 
global operations, 
including fluctuations 
in 
 foreign exchange 
and inflation 
rates, international 
hostilities such 
as the 
Russia-Ukraine conflict, 
natural disasters, 
security breaches, 
 our ability to 
supply our 
product candidates on 
a timely 
and large scale 
basis in 
local markets, lead 
times for shipping, 
accounts receivable 

79 
 collection times, 
import or 
export licensing 
requirements, 
language barriers, 
failure to 
maintain compliance 
with our 
clients control 
 requirements 
and 
multiple 
legal and 
regulatory 
systems, 
our 
results 
of 
operations 
and 
ability to 
grow 
could 
be 
materially 
adversely 
 affected. 
In particular, 
our business 
and stock 
price may 
be affected 
by fluctuations 
in foreign 
exchange rates 
between currencies 
in 
 different jurisdictions in which operate or in which we may have 
sales in the future. 
 Certain 
legal 
and 
political 
risks 
are 
also 
inherent 
in 
foreign 
operations. 
Foreign 
sales 
of 
our 
product 
candidates 
could 
be 
adversely 
 affected by the imposition of governmental controls, political and economic 
instability, trade restrictions and changes in tariffs. In many 
 countries, the 
pricing of 
prescription pharmaceuticals 
is subject to 
governmental control. 
In these 
countries, pricing 
negotiations with 
 governmental 
authorities 
can 
take 
considerable 
time 
after 
the 
receipt 
of 
marketing 
approval 
for 
a 
drug. 
There 
is 
a 
risk 
that 
foreign 
 governments 
may nationalize 
private enterprises 
in certain 
countries where 
we may 
operate. In 
certain countries 
or regions, 
terrorist 
 activities and 
the response 
to such 
activities may 
threaten our 
operations more 
than in the 
United States. 
Social and cultural 
norms in 
 certain countries may not support compliance with our corporate 
policies, including those that require compliance with substantive laws 
 and regulations. Also, changes in 
general economic and political conditions in 
countries where we may 
operate are a risk 
to our financial 
 performance and 
future growth. Additionally, 
the need to 
identify financially and 
commercially strong partners 
for commercialization 
 outside the United 
States who will comply 
with the high manufacturing 
and legal and regulatory 
compliance standards we requir 
e 
is a 
 risk to our financial performance. As we operate our business globally, 
our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and 
 effectively manage these 
and other related risks. There 
can be no assurance that the 
consequences of these and other 
factors relating to 
 our international operations will not have an adverse effect on our 
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 We 
are 
exposed 
to 
potential 
product 
liability 
and 
professional 
indemnity 
risks 
that 
are 
inherent 
in 
the 
research, 
development, 
 manufacturing, marketing and use of pharmaceutical products. 
 The use of 
our investigational medicinal 
products in clinical 
trials, past sales 
of our ELISA 
test and the sale 
of any approved 
products 
 in the 
future may 
expose us 
to liability 
claims. These 
claims might 
be made 
by patients 
who use 
the product, 
health care 
providers, 
 pharmaceutical companies or others selling such products. Any claims against us, regardless of their merit, could be difficult and costly 
 to defend 
and could 
materially adversely 
affect 
the market 
for our 
product candidates 
or any 
prospects for 
commercialization 
of our 
 product candidates. 
 In addition, regulations vary significantly across jurisdictions regarding 
the clinical trial sponsor s responsibility to provide free 
medical 
 care and 
compensation to 
clinical trial 
participants who 
experience an 
injury or 
illness during 
the trial. 
For example, 
there is 
no legal 
 requirement in the United States for sponsors to provide free medical treatment or compensation to a participant injured during a study; 
 as a result, sponsors usually agree 
to pay for the medical care 
to diagnose and treat participant injuries to 
the extent related to the clinical 
 trial and 
typically do 
not pay 
unless the 
injury is 
determined to 
be related 
to participation 
in the 
trial. In 
contrast, India 
requires free 
 medical care 
until it 
is established 
that the 
injury is 
not related 
to the 
study and 
compensation for 
any injury 
that is 
determined to 
be 
 related 
to the 
study. 
In 2019, 
India s 
Ministry 
of Health 
and Family 
Welfare 
published 
the New 
Drugs 
and 
Clinical 
Trials 
Rules, 
 which increased a 
clinical trial sponsor s 
liability for injuries 
related to clinical 
trial trials. Under 
the regulation, sponsors 
are required 
 to (i) 
provide free 
medical management 
to participants 
that experience 
an injury 
that, in 
the investigator s 
opinion, is 
related to 
the 
 study or until 
it is established 
that the injury 
is not related 
to the study 
and (ii) compensate 
clinical trial participant 
s 
for trial-related 
 injuries. 
Clinical 
trials 
conducted 
in 
jurisdictions 
with 
broad 
compensation 
and 
medical 
care 
requirements 
could 
result 
in 
increased 
 overall research costs and adversely affect our ability to 
conduct clinical trials. 
 Although the clinical trial process is designed to identify and assess potential side effects, it is always possible that a product, even after 
 regulatory approval, 
may exhibit 
unforeseen side 
effects, including 
rare side 
effects more 
likely to 
be seen 
in commercial use 
than in 
 clinical studies. If any of our product candidates were to cause adverse side effects during clinical trials or after approval of the product 
 candidate, we may be exposed to substantial liabilities. Physicians and patients 
may not comply with any warnings that identify known 
 potential adverse effects and patients who should not use 
our product candidates. 
 To 
cover such 
liability claims, 
we purchase 
clinical trial 
insurances in 
the conduct 
of each 
of our 
clinical trials 
(typically conducted 
 through our CROs). 
It is 
possible that our 
liabilities could exceed 
our insurance coverage 
or that 
our insurance will 
not cover 
all situations 
 in which a claim against us could be made. We also intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products 
 if we receive marketing approval for any of our proprietary products. However, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a 
 reasonable cost or obtain insurance coverage that will be adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise. If a successful product liability 
 claim or series of claims is brought against us for uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured liabilities, our assets may not be sufficient 
 to cover such claims and our business 
operations could be impaired. Should 
any of the events described above 
occur, this could have 
a 
 material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, 
results of operations and prospects, including, but not limited to: 
 
decreased demand for our future product candidates; 
 
adverse publicity and injury to our reputation; 
 
withdrawal of clinical trial participants; 

80 
 
initiation of investigations by regulators; 
 
costs to defend the related litigation; 
 
a diversion of management s 
time and our resources; 
 
compensation in response to a liability claim; 
 
product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions; 
 
loss of revenue; 
 
exhaustion of any available insurance and our capital resources; and 
 
the inability to commercialize our products or product candidates. 
 We could be adversely affected if we are subject to negative publicity. We could also be adversely affected if any of our products or any 
 similar products distributed by other companies prove to be, or are asserted to be, harmful to patients. Any adverse publicity associated 
 with illness or other 
adverse effects resulting 
from patients use 
or misuse of 
our products or any 
similar products distributed 
by other 
 companies could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, 
results of operations or prospects. 
 If we need to expand our organization, we may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could disrupt our operations. 
 If we expand 
our organization, we 
may encounter difficulties 
in managing our 
growth, which could 
disrupt our operations. 
We 
expect 
 to experience 
significant growth 
in the 
number of 
our employees 
and the 
scope of 
our operations, 
particularly in 
the areas 
of clinical 
 development and regulatory affairs, 
as well as to support 
our public company operations. For 
example, we may build our 
own focused 
 sales, 
distribution 
and 
marketing 
infrastructure 
to 
market 
our 
product 
candidates, 
if 
approved, 
in 
markets 
around 
the 
world, 
which 
 involves significant expenses and risks. 
To manage these growth activities, we 
must continue to implement and 
improve our managerial, 
 operational and financial systems, expand 
our facilities and continue 
to recruit and train 
additional qualified personnel. Our 
management 
 may need to devote a significant amount of its attention to managing these growth activities. Due to our 
limited financial resources and 
 the limited experience of our management team in 
managing a company with such anticipated 
growth, we may not be 
able to effectively 
 manage 
the expansion of our operations, retain key employees or identify, recruit 
and train additional qualified personnel. Our inability 
 to manage the 
expansion or relocation 
of our 
operations effectively may 
result in 
weaknesses in 
our infrastructure, give 
rise to operational 
 mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of 
employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Our 
expected growth 
 could also 
require significant 
capital expenditures 
and may divert 
financial resources 
from other 
projects, such 
as the development 
of 
 additional 
product 
candidates. 
If 
we 
are 
unable 
to 
effectively 
manage 
our 
expected 
growth, 
our 
expenses 
may 
increase 
more 
than 
 expected, our ability 
to generate revenues 
could be reduced 
and we may 
not be able 
to implement our 
business strategy, 
including the 
 successful development and commercialization of our product candidates. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on 
 our business, financial condition, results of operations and 
prospects. Future growth would impose significant additional responsibilities 
 on our management, including: 
 
the need to identify, recruit, 
maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees, consultants and contractors; 
 
managing our internal development efforts effectively, including the clinical and 
regulatory review process for 
our product 
 candidates, while complying with our contractual obligations to contractors 
and other third parties; and 
 
improving our operational, financial 
and management controls, reporting 
systems and procedures. We 
currently rely, 
and 
 for the 
foreseeable future 
will continue 
to rely, 
in substantial 
part on 
certain related 
parties, independent 
organizations, 
 advisors and consultants to provide certain services, including 
substantially all aspects of regulatory approval, clinical trial 
 management and 
manufacturing. There 
can be no 
assurance that the 
services of independent 
organizations, advisors 
and 
 consultants will continue to 
be available to us on 
a timely basis when needed, 
or that we can find 
qualified replacements. 
 In addition, 
if we 
are unable 
to effectively 
manage our 
outsourced activities 
or if 
the quality 
or accuracy 
of the 
services 
 provided by consultants is compromised for any reason, our clinical 
trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we 
 may not be able 
to obtain regulatory approval of 
our product candidates or otherwise 
advance our business. There 
can be 
 no 
assurance 
that 
we 
will 
be 
able 
to 
manage 
our 
existing 
consultants 
or 
find 
other 
competent 
outside 
contractors 
and 
 consultants on economically reasonable terms, or at all. If we are not able to effectively expand our organization by hiring 
 new employees and 
expanding our groups 
of consultants and 
contractors, or we 
are not able to 
effectively build 
out new 
 facilities to 
accommodate 
this expansion, 
we may 
not be 
able to 
successfully 
implement 
the tasks 
necessary 
to further 
 develop 
and 
commercialize 
our 
product 
candidates 
and, 
accordingly, 
may 
not 
achieve 
our 
research, 
development 
and 
 commercialization goals. 

81 
 Many of the biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies that we compete against for qualified personnel and consultants have greater 
 financial and other resources, different risk 
profiles and a longer 
history in the industry 
than we do. If 
we are unable to 
continue to attract 
 and retain 
high-quality personnel 
and consultants, 
the rate 
and success 
at which 
we can 
discover and 
develop product 
candidates and 
 operate our business will be limited. 
 We only have a limited 
number of employees to manage and operate our business, which may lead to certain 
operational issues. 
 As of 
March 15, 2023 
we had 76 
full-time employees 
and 1 part 
-time employee. 
Our focus on 
the development 
of UB-612, 
UB-312, 
 UB-313, VXX-401 and other product candidates requires us 
to manage and operate our business in a highly efficient 
manner. We 
have 
 a 
limited 
number 
of 
employees upon 
which 
we 
rely 
to 
effectively 
manage 
and 
operate 
our 
business 
and 
we 
cannot 
assure you 
that 
 operational issues will not arise. 
 While we intend 
to identify, 
recruit, maintain, motivate 
and integrate additional 
employees, consultants and 
contractors to support 
our 
 growth, we cannot assure you that we will be able to hire and/or retain adequate staffing levels to develop our product candidates or run 
 our operations and/or to accomplish all of the objectives that we otherwise would 
seek to accomplish. 
 If 
we 
lose 
key 
management 
or 
scientific 
personnel, 
cannot 
recruit 
qualified 
employees, 
directors, 
officers 
or 
other 
significant 
 personnel or experience increases in our compensation costs, our business may 
materially suffer. 
 We 
are highly dependent on 
our management and directors. 
Due to the specialized 
knowledge each of our 
officers and key 
employees 
 possesses with respect to our product candidates and our operations, the loss of service of any of our officers or directors could delay or 
 prevent 
the successful 
enrollment and 
completion of 
our clinical 
trials. We 
do not 
carry key 
person life 
insurance on 
any officers 
or 
 directors. In general, the employment arrangements that we have with our executive officers do not prevent them from terminating their 
 employment with us at any time. Our agreements with our employees generally 
provide for at-will employment. 
 In addition, 
our future 
success and 
growth will 
depend in 
part on 
the continued 
service of 
our directors, 
employees and 
management 
 personnel 
and 
our 
ability 
to 
identify, 
hire 
and 
retain 
additional 
personnel. 
If 
we 
lose 
one 
or 
more 
of 
our 
executive 
officers 
or 
key 
 employees, 
our ability 
to implement 
our business 
strategy successfully 
could be 
seriously 
harmed. Furthermore, 
replacing 
executive 
 officers 
and 
key 
employees 
may 
be 
difficult 
or 
costly 
and 
may 
take 
an 
extended 
period 
of 
time 
because 
of 
the 
limited 
number 
of 
 individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to develop, gain regulatory approval of and 
commercialize 
 product candidates 
successfully. 
Competition to 
hire from 
this limited 
pool is 
intense, and 
we may 
be unable 
to hire, 
train, retain 
or 
 effectively incentivize 
these additional key 
personnel on acceptable 
terms given the competition 
among numerous pharmaceutical 
and 
 biotechnology companies for similar personnel. We 
also experience competition for the hiring of 
scientific and clinical personnel from 
 universities and research institutions. In addition, we 
rely on consultants and advisors, 
including scientific and clinical advisors, to 
assist 
 us in formulating our 
research, development and commercialization 
strategy. Our 
consultants and advisors may 
be engaged by entities 
 other than us 
and may have 
commitments under consulting 
or advisory contracts 
with other entities 
that may limit 
their availability to 
 us. If we are unable to continue to 
attract and retain high quality personnel, our ability to develop and 
commercialize product candidates 
 will be limited. 
 Many of our employees have become or will soon become vested in a substantial amount of our Class A common 
stock or a number of 
 common stock 
options. Our 
employees may 
be more 
likely to 
leave us 
if the 
shares they 
own have 
significantly appreciated 
in value 
 relative to 
the original 
purchase prices 
of the 
shares, or 
if the 
exercise prices 
of the 
options that 
they hold 
are significantly 
below the 
 market price 
of Class A 
our common 
stock. Our future 
success also depends 
on our ability 
to continue 
to attract and 
retain additional 
 executive officers and other key employees. 
 If we engage in future acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic collaborations, this may increase our capital requirements, dilute our 
 stockholders, cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities and subject us to other 
risks. 
 We may evaluate various acquisitions 
and collaborations, including licensing 
or acquiring complementary 
products, intellectual 
property 
 rights, technologies, or businesses. Any potential acquisition, joint venture, 
or collaboration may entail numerous risks, including: 
 
increased operating expenses and cash requirements; 
 
the assumption of additional indebtedness or contingent liabilities; 
 
assimilation 
of 
operations, 
intellectual 
property 
and products 
of 
an acquired 
company, 
including 
difficulties 
associated 
 with integrating new personnel; 
 
the diversion of our 
management s attention from our existing product 
programs and initiatives in 
pursuing such a strategic 
 merger or acquisition; 
 
retention of key 
employees, the loss 
of key personnel 
and uncertainties in 
our ability to 
maintain key business 
relationships; 

82 
 
risks and uncertainties associated with the other party to 
such a transaction, including the prospects of that party and 
their 
 existing products or investigational medicines and regulatory approvals; 
and 
 
our inability to generate revenue from acquired technology or 
products sufficient to meet our objectives in undertaking the 
 acquisition or even to offset the associated acquisition and 
maintenance costs. 
 In addition, if we undertake acquisitions, we may utilize our cash, issue dilutive securities, assume or incur debt obligations, incur large 
 one-time expenses and acquire intangible assets that could result in significant 
future amortization expense. 
 Moreover, we may 
not be able to locate suitable 
acquisition or strategic collaboration opportunities, 
and this inability could impair 
our 
 ability to grow or obtain access to technology or products that may be important 
to the development of our business. 
 We 
or 
the 
third 
parties 
upon 
whom 
we 
depend 
may 
be 
adversely 
affected 
by 
natural 
disasters 
or 
pandemics 
and 
our 
business 
 continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect 
us from a serious disaster. 
 Natural disasters or 
pandemics, other than 
or in addition 
to COVID-19 and 
including any potential 
future waves of 
COVID-19, could 
 severely 
disrupt 
our 
operations 
and 
have 
a 
material 
adverse 
effect 
on 
our 
business, 
results 
of 
operations, 
financial 
condition 
and 
 prospects. For 
example, our 
headquarters and 
main laboratory 
is located 
on the 
Eastern coast 
of Florida, 
a location 
that is at 
a higher 
 risk of exposure to hurricanes. If a hurricane 
or natural disaster causes us to 
sustain significant damage to our Florida 
headquarters and 
 main laboratory, 
or if we must shut down 
our operations there for an 
extended period of time, our business 
and financial results would 
 be adversely impacted. 

 If a natural 
disaster, power 
outage, pandemic, such 
as the COVID-19 
pandemic, or other 
event occurred 
that prevented us 
from using 
 all or 
a significant 
portion of 
our headquarters, 
that damaged 
critical infrastructure, 
such as 
the manufacturing 
facilities on 
which we 
 rely, 
or that 
otherwise 
disrupted 
operations, 
it may 
be difficult 
or, 
in certain 
cases, 
impossible for 
us to 
continue 
our business 
for 
a 
 substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity 
plans we have in place may prove inadequate in the event of a 
 serious disaster or similar 
event. We may incur substantial expenses as 
a result of 
the limited nature of 
our disaster recovery and 
business 
 continuity plans, which could have a material adverse effect 
on our business. 
 Unstable market and economic conditions have had and may 
have further serious adverse consequences on our business, financial 
 condition and share price. 
 The 
global 
economy, 
including 
credit 
and 
financial 
markets, 
has 
experienced 
extreme 
volatility 
and 
disruptions, 
including 
severely 
 diminished liquidity and credit availability, 
declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment 
 rates and 
uncertainty about 
economic stability. 
For example, 
the COVID-19 
pandemic has 
resulted in 
widespread unemployment, 
an 
 economic slowdown and extreme volatility in the capital markets. While these 
effects of COVID-19 have abated as countries, including 
 the United States, have re-opened and the rate of vaccinations have increased, COVID-19 may cause further disruptions globally. 
If the 
 equity and 
credit markets 
further deteriorate, 
it may 
make any 
necessary debt 
or equity 
financing more 
difficult to 
obtain in 
a timely 
 manner or on favorable terms, more costly or more dilutive. In 
addition, there is a risk that one or more of 
our CROs, suppliers, contract 
 manufacturers 
or other 
third-party 
providers 
may 
not 
survive 
an 
economic 
downturn, 
or that 
industry 
trends 
with respect 
to 
pricing 
 models, supply chains and delivery mechanisms, among other things, deviate from our expectations. As a 
result, our business, results of 
 operations and price of our Class A common stock may be adversely affected. 
 Our insurance policies are expensive and protect us 
only from some business risks, which leaves 
us exposed to significant uninsured 
 liabilities. 
 Though 
we 
have 
insurance 
coverage 
for 
clinical 
trial 
product 
liability, 
we 
do 
not 
carry 
insurance 
for 
all 
categories 
of 
risk 
that 
our 
 business may encounter. Some of the policies we currently maintain include general liability, auto, renters , workers compensation and 
 directors and officers insurance. 
 Any additional product 
liability insurance coverage 
we acquire in the 
future may not be 
sufficient to reimburse 
us for any expenses 
or 
 losses we may 
suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming 
increasingly expensive and 
in the future 
we may not 
be able to 
maintain 
 insurance 
coverage 
at a 
reasonable 
cost or 
in sufficient 
amounts to 
protect 
us against 
losses due 
to liability. 
If we 
obtain 
marketing 
 approval for any 
of our product 
candidates, we intend 
to acquire insurance 
coverage to include 
the sale 
of commercial products; 
however, 
 we may be unable to obtain product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms or in adequate amounts. A successful product 
 liability 
claim 
or 
series 
of 
claims 
brought 
against us 
could 
cause 
our 
stock 
price 
to decline 
and, 
if 
judgments 
exceed 
our 
insurance 
 coverage, 
could 
adversely 
affect 
our 
results 
of 
operations 
and 
business, 
including 
preventing 
or 
limiting 
the 
development 
and 
 commercialization of 
any product candidates 
we develop. We 
do not carry 
specific biological or 
hazardous waste insurance 
coverage, 
 and our renters and 
general liability insurance policies 
specifically exclude coverage 
for damages and fines 
arising from biological 
or 
 hazardous waste exposure or contamination. 
Accordingly, in 
the event of contamination or injury, 
we could be held liable for damages 
 or be penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our resources, and our clinical trials or 
regulatory approvals could be suspended. 

83 
 Operations as a public company have made it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, 
 and we and have incurred substantially higher costs since becoming a public company. As a result, it has become more expensive for us 
 to 
obtain 
the 
coverage 
needed 
to 
attract 
and 
retain 
qualified 
people 
to 
serve 
on 
our 
board 
of 
directors, 
our 
board 
committees 
or 
as 
 executive officers. 
We 
do not know, 
however, if 
we will be able 
to maintain existing 
insurance with adequate 
levels of coverage. 
Any 
 significant uninsured 
liability may require 
us to pay 
substantial amounts, 
which would 
adversely affect 
our cash 
and cash equivalents 
 position and results of operations. 
 The 
coronavirus 
pandemic 
has 
caused 
interruptions 
or 
delays 
of 
our 
business 
plan 
and 
could 
continue 
to 
adversely 
affect 
our 
 business. 

 The COVID-19 
pandemic and related 
federal, state and 
local government 
responses to COVID-19 
and our responses 
to the pandemic 
 and such restrictions has and 
may continue to have 
a material adverse effect on 
our business, results of 
operations, liquidity and financial 
 condition. Our business has been disrupted and could be further disrupted to the extent our business partners 
are adversely impacted by 
 the COVID-19 pandemic. 

 The full extent 
to which the 
COVID-19 pandemic will continue 
to impact our 
business, development plans, 
business partners and 
clinical 
 trials will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. To 
the extent the pandemic continues to 
 adversely affect our business and financial condition, it 
may also have the effect of 
exacerbating many of the other risk 
factors discussed 
 herein, 
which could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Due to the vaccination rate, the demand for our COVID-19 product candidate 
may decrease significantly or disappear entirely. 
 We are pursuing 
a path to conditional and provisional approval of UB-612 
as a heterologous boost (boosting the immunity of a subject 
 who has already received a different vaccine) in the United Kingdom and Australia, respectively. Other companies have also responded 
 to the 
pandemic 
at a 
faster pace, 
and 
to date 
approximately 
fifty 
COVID-19 
vaccines are 
currently 
in use 
around the 
world. 
As our 
 competitors 
continue 
to 
develop, 
receive 
regulatory 
approval 
for 
and 
commercialize 
their 
own 
COVID-19 
vaccines 
and 
boosters, 
 demand for our COVID-19 product candidate may materially decrease 
or disappear entirely, along with a corresponding decrease in our 
 potential 
revenues. 
Further, 
the existence 
and 
significance 
of 
the 
opportunity 
to provide 
COVID-19 
boosters 
in 
the 
future 
is highly 
 uncertain, and there can be no assurance that we will commercially benefit from 
the development of a COVID-19 booster vaccine. 
 Risks Related to Our Class A Common Stock 

 An active trading market for our Class A common stock may not continue to be 
developed or sustained. 
 Prior to our initial public offering, 
there was no public market for 
our Class A common stock. 
Although our Class A common 
stock is 
 now listed on 
The Nasdaq Global 
Market, an active 
trading market for 
our shares of 
Class A common 
stock may never 
develop or 
be 
 sustained. 
If an 
active market 
for our 
Class A 
common stock 
does not 
develop or 
is not 
sustained, it 
may be 
difficult for 
you to 
sell 
 shares of our 
Class A common stock 
at an attractive price 
or at all. 
An inactive market may 
also impair our ability 
to raise capital by 
 selling shares of 
our common stock, 
our ability to 
motivate our employees 
through equity incentive 
awards, and our 
ability to acquire 
 other companies, products or technologies by using our common stock 
as consideration for such acquisitions. 
 The price of our Class A common stock has been volatile and may be further affected by market conditions beyond 
our control, and 
 purchasers of our Class A common stock could incur substantial losses. 
 Our results of operations 
have fluctuated and are likely 
to continue to fluctuate 
in the future. In addition, 
securities markets worldwide 
 have experienced, and 
are likely to continue to 
experience, significant price 
and volume fluctuations. This 
market volatility, 
as well as 
 general economic, market 
or political conditions, 
could subject the 
market price of 
our shares of 
Class A common 
stock to wide 
price 
 fluctuations 
regardless of 
our operating 
performance, 
which has 
caused and 
could further 
cause a 
decline 
in the 
market price 
of our 
 common stock. 
Price volatility 
may be 
greater if 
the public 
float and 
trading volume 
of shares 
of our 
Class A 
common stock 
is low. 
 Some factors that may cause the market price of our Class A common stock to fluctuate, in addition to the other risks mentioned 
in this 
 Report, include: 
 
our operating and financial performance and prospects; 
 
our 
announcements 
or 
our 
competitors 
announcements 
regarding 
new 
products 
or 
services, 
enhancements, 
significant 
 contracts, acquisitions or strategic investments; 
 
any delay in our 
development or regulatory 
filings for our product 
candidates and any adverse 
development or perceived 
 adverse development with respect to the applicable regulatory authority s 
review of such filings; 

84 
 
if any of 
our product candidates 
receives an EUA 
or regulatory approval, the 
terms of such 
approval and market acceptance 
 and demand for such product candidates; 
 
the success of any efforts to acquire or in-license additional technologies, 
products or product candidates; 
 
changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts who 
cover our Class A common stock; 
 
fluctuations in 
our financial 
results or, 
in the 
event we 
provide it 
from time 
to time, 
earnings guidance, 
or the 
financial 
 results or earnings guidance of companies perceived by investors to be 
similar to us; 
 
changes 
in 
our 
capital 
structure, 
such 
as 
future 
issuances 
of 
securities, 
sales 
of 
large 
blocks 
of 
common 
stock 
by 
our 
 stockholders, including our principal stockholders, or the incurrence of 
additional debt; 
 
additions and departure of key personnel; 
 
any disputes 
relating to 
our intellectual 
property, 
including any 
intellectual property 
infringement lawsuit 
or opposition, 
 interference or cancellation proceeding in which we may become involved; 
 
reputational issues, including reputational issues involving our competitors 
and their products; 
 
actions by institutional stockholders; 
 
changes in general economic and market conditions, including related to 
the COVID-19 pandemic; 
 
changes 
in industry 
conditions or 
perceptions 
or changes 
in the 
market 
outlook 
for 
the industry 
in 
which 
we compete, 
 including changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems; and 
 
changes in applicable laws, rules or regulations or regulatory actions affecting 
us or our clients and other dynamics. 
 These 
and 
other 
factors 
have 
caused 
and 
may 
further 
cause 
the 
market 
price 
for 
shares 
of 
our 
Class 
A 
common 
stock 
to 
fluctuate 
 substantially, which may further limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares 
of our Class A common stock 
and negatively 
 affect the liquidity of our Class A common stock. In addition, in the past, when the market price of 
a stock has been volatile, holders of 
 that 
stock 
sometimes 
have 
instituted securities 
class 
action 
litigation 
against 
the 
company 
that 
issued 
the 
stock. Securities 
litigation 
 against us, 
regardless of 
the merits 
or outcome, 
could result 
in substantial 
costs and 
divert the 
time and 
attention of 
our management 
 from the business, which could significantly harm our business, results of operation, 
financial condition or reputation. 
 The dual-class structure of 
our common stock and 
the Voting 
Agreement will have the 
effect of concentrating voting 
power, which 
 will significantly limit stockholders ability to 
influence the outcome of matters 
submitted to our stockholders for 
approval, including 
 the election 
of 
our board 
of directors, 
the adoption 
of 
amendments 
to 
our Charter 
and 
Bylaws and 
the approval 
of any 
merger, 
 consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets or other major corporate 
transaction. 
 Our Class A common 
stock has one vote 
per share, and our Class 
B common stock has 
ten votes per share. 
Our principal stockholders 
 have entered into the 
Voting 
Agreement. As of March 
15, 2023 on a fully 
diluted basis, Mei Mei Hu, as 
proxyholder under the 
Voting 
 Agreement, controls 
approximately 65.8 of 
the total voting 
power of our 
outstanding capital stock. 
The Voting 
Agreement provides 
 Mei Mei Hu with the authority (and irrevocable proxies) to direct the 
vote and vote the shares of capital stock held by the parties to the 
 voting agreement at her discretion on all matters to be voted upon by stockholders. The voting power covered by the Voting Agreement 
 may 
increase 
over 
time 
as the 
UBI Warrant 
is exercised 
and 
as our 
principal 
stockholders 
exercise 
or vest 
equity 
awards that 
were 
 outstanding at the time of the completion 
of our initial public offering. 
If all such equity awards held by 
our principal stockholders had 
 been exercised or vested and exchanged for shares of common stock and the UBI Warrant had been 
exercised in full for shares of Class 
 A common 
stock as of 
March 15, 2023, 
assuming no other 
equity awards 
had been exercised 
or vested, 
the Voting 
Agreement would 
 have covered, in the aggregate as of the completion of our initial public 
offering, approximately 68.2 of the total voting 
power of our 
 outstanding capital stock. 
As a 
result, if 
our principal stockholders 
retain all 
or a 
large portion their 
common stock, including 
the common 
 stock issuable upon 
the exercise or 
vesting of 
such principal stockholders 
outstanding equity 
awards or upon 
the exercise of 
the UBI 
 Warrant, 
our 
principal 
stockholders 
will 
be 
able 
to 
significantly 
influence 
(if 
not 
control) 
any 
action 
requiring 
the 
approval 
of 
our 
 stockholders, including 
the election 
of our 
board of 
directors, the 
adoption of 
amendments to 
our amended 
and restated 
certificate of 
 incorporation (the Charter and our amended 
and restated bylaws (the Bylaws and the approval 
of any merger, consolidation, sale 
 of 
all or 
substantially 
all of 
our 
assets or 
other 
major 
corporate 
transaction. 
Assuming 
our 
principal 
stockholders 
retain their 
equity 
 interests and the 
Voting 
Agreement remains 
in effect, 
our principal stockholders 
will effectively 
control all 
such matters submitted 
to 
 the stockholders for the foreseeable future. 
Our principal stockholders will also have 
the voting power to determine the composition 
of 
 our board of directors, which in turn will be able to determine matters affecting 
us, including, among others: 
 
any determination with respect to our business direction and policies, 
including the appointment and removal of officers; 

85 
 
the adoption of amendments to our Charter and Bylaws; 
 
determinations with respect to mergers, business combinations 
or disposition of assets; 
 
compensation and benefit programs and other human resources policy 
decisions; 
 
the payment of dividends on our common stock; and 
 
determinations with respect to tax matters. 
 Our principal stockholders may have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be 
 adverse to your 
interests. This concentrated 
control may have the 
effect of delaying, 
preventing or deterring 
a change in control 
of the 
 Company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their 
capital stock as part of a sale 
in the Company 
 and 
might 
ultimately 
affect 
the 
market 
price 
of 
our 
Class 
A 
common 
stock. 
In 
addition, 
each 
share 
of 
Class 
B 
common 
stock 
will 
 automatically convert 
into one 
share of 
Class A 
common stock 
upon any 
transfer, 
whether or 
not for 
value and 
whether voluntary 
or 
 involuntary or by operation of 
law, except 
for certain transfers described 
in our Charter, 
including, without limitation, certain 
transfers 
 for tax and estate planning purposes. Such issuances will be dilutive to 
holders of our Class A common stock. 

 We are an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company and will be 
able to avail ourselves of reduced disclosure 
 requirements applicable to 
emerging growth companies 
and smaller reporting 
companies, which could 
make our Class 
A common 
 stock less attractive to investors and adversely affect the market price 
of our Class A common stock. 
 We are an emerging 
growth company, as defined 
in the JOBS Act. We will remain an emerging 
growth company until the earliest of 
 (i) the last day of 
the fiscal year in which 
we have annual gross revenues 
of 1.235 billion or more; (ii) the 
date on which we have 
issued 
 more than 1.0 billion 
in non-convertible debt 
in the previous 
three years; (iii) 
the date we 
qualify as a 
 large accelerated 
filer under 
 the Exchange 
Act, which 
would occur 
at the 
end of 
a given 
fiscal year 
if the 
market value 
of our 
common stock 
that is 
held by 
non-
 affiliates 
is 700 million or more 
as of the 
last business day 
of the second fiscal 
quarter of such 
year (and we have 
been a public 
company 
 for at 
least 12 
months and 
have filed 
one annual 
report on 
Form 10-K); 
and (iv) 
the last 
day of 
the fiscal 
year ending 
after the 
fifth 
 anniversary of our 
initial public offering. 
For so long as 
we remain an 
emerging growth 
company, 
we are permitted 
and intend to 
rely 
 on 
exemptions 
from 
certain 
disclosure 
requirements 
that 
are 
applicable 
to 
other 
public 
companies 
that 
are 
not 
emerging 
growth 
 companies. These exemptions include: 
 
not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; 
 
not being 
required to 
comply with 
any requirement 
that may 
be adopted 
by the 
Public Company 
Accounting Oversight 
 Board regarding 
mandatory audit 
firm rotation 
or a 
supplement to 
the auditor s 
report providing 
additional information 
 about the audit and the financial statements; 
 
being 
required 
to provide 
only 
two 
years 
of audited 
financial 
statements 
in 
addition 
to 
any 
required 
unaudited 
interim 
 financial statements; 
 
permitting 
an 
extended 
transition 
period 
for 
complying 
with 
new 
or 
revised 
accounting 
standards, 
which 
allows 
an 
 emerging 
growth company 
to delay 
the adoption 
of certain 
accounting 
standards until 
those standards 
would otherwise 
 apply to private companies; 
 
reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and 
 
exemptions 
from 
the 
requirements 
of 
holding 
a 
nonbinding 
advisory 
vote 
on 
executive 
compensation 
and 
shareholder 
 approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 
 We 
may 
choose to 
take advantage 
of some, 
but not 
all, of 
the available 
exemptions. 
We 
have elected 
to use 
the extended 
transition 
 period for new or revised accounting 
standards during the period in which 
we remain an emerging growth 
company. To 
the extent that 
 we continue to qualify as a smaller reporting company, as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange 
Act, after we cease 
 to qualify as an emerging growth company, we will continue to be permitted to make certain reduced disclosures in our periodic reports 
 and other documents that we file with the SEC. We cannot predict whether investors will find our Class A common stock less attractive 
 as a result 
of our reliance 
on these exemptions. 
If some investors 
find our Class 
A common stock 
less attractive as 
a result, there 
may 
 be a less active trading market for our Class A common stock and our stock price 
may be more volatile. 

86 
 As long 
as our 
principal stockholders 
hold a 
majority of 
the voting power 
of our 
capital stock, 
we may 
rely on certain 
exemptions 
 from the corporate governance requirements of the Nasdaq available for 
 controlled companies. 
 We 
are 
a 
 controlled 
company 
within 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
corporate 
governance 
requirements 
of 
the 
Nasdaq 
because 
our 
principal 
 stockholders will continue to hold more than 50 of the voting power 
of our outstanding shares of capital stock as a result of our dual-
 class 
common 
stock 
structure 
and 
the 
Voting 
Agreement. 
A 
controlled 
company 
may 
elect 
not 
to 
comply 
with 
certain 
corporate 
 governance 
requirements of 
the Nasdaq. 
Accordingly, 
our board 
of directors 
will not 
be required 
to have 
a majority 
of independent 
 directors 
and 
our 
Compensation 
Committee 
and 
Nominating 
and 
Governance 
Committee 
will 
not 
be 
required 
to 
meet 
the 
director 
 independence 
requirements 
to 
which 
we 
would 
otherwise 
be 
subject 
until 
such 
time 
as 
we 
cease 
to 
be 
a 
 controlled 
company. 
 Accordingly, 
you will not 
have certain of the 
protections afforded 
to stockholders of 
companies that are subject 
to all of the 
corporate 
 governance requirements of the Nasdaq. 
 Your percentage ownership in us may be diluted by 
future issuances of capital stock, 
which could reduce your 
influence over matters 
 on which stockholders vote. 
 Pursuant to our Charter 
and Bylaws, our board 
of directors has the 
authority, without 
action or vote of 
our stockholders, to 
issue all or 
 any part of our authorized but unissued shares of common stock, including shares issuable upon the 
exercise of options, or shares of our 
 authorized but 
unissued preferred 
stock. Issuances 
of shares 
of common 
stock or 
shares of 
voting preferred 
stock would 
reduce your 
 influence over matters 
on which our stockholders 
vote and, in the 
case of issuances 
of shares of preferred 
stock, would likely result 
in 
 your interest in us being subject to the prior rights of holders of that preferred stock. 
 Future sales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock may 
depress the price of our shares. 
 If our stockholders 
sell a large number 
of shares of our 
Class A common stock, 
or if we issue 
a large number 
of shares of our 
Class A 
 common 
stock 
in 
connection 
with 
future 
acquisitions, 
financings 
or 
other 
circumstances, 
the 
market 
price 
of 
shares 
of 
our 
Class 
A 
 common stock could decline significantly. 
Moreover, the perception in the 
public market that our stockholders might sell shares of 
our 
 Class A common 
stock could depress 
the market price of 
those shares. In 
addition, sales of 
a substantial number of 
shares of our 
common 
 stock by our principal stockholders could adversely affect the market 
price of our Class A common stock. 
 We 
do not 
anticipate declaring 
or paying 
regular dividends 
on our 
Class A 
common stock 
in the near 
term, and 
any indebtedness 
 could limit our ability to pay dividends on our Class A common stock. 
 We have never declared and do not anticipate declaring or paying 
regular cash dividends on our Class 
A common stock in the near term. 
 We currently 
intend to use our future earnings, if any, to pay any debt obligations, 
to fund our growth and develop our business and for 
 general corporate purposes. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any cash dividends on 
your Class A common stock in the near term, 
 and the success of an investment in shares of our Class A common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in their value, which 
 is not certain to 
occur. There is no guarantee that shares of 
our Class A common stock 
will appreciate in value or even 
maintain the price 
 at which they are initially 
offered. Any future 
declaration and payment 
of cash dividends or other 
distributions of capital will 
be at the 
 discretion of our board of 
directors and the payment 
of any future cash dividends 
or other distributions of capital 
will depend on many 
 factors, including our financial 
condition, earnings, cash needs, 
regulatory constraints, capital requirements 
(including requirements of 
 our subsidiaries) and any other factors that our board of 
directors deems relevant in making such a determination. We cannot assure you 
 that we 
will establish 
a dividend 
policy or 
pay cash 
dividends in 
the future 
or continue 
to pay 
any cash 
dividend if 
we do 
commence 
 paying cash dividends pursuant to a dividend policy or otherwise. 
 Our Charter designates courts in the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of 
actions and proceedings 
 that may be 
initiated by our 
stockholders, and 
also provide that 
the federal district 
courts will be 
the exclusive forum 
for resolving 
 any complaint 
asserting a 
cause of 
action arising 
under the 
Securities Act, 
each of 
which could 
limit our 
stockholders 
ability to 
 choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, 
stockholders or employees. 
 Our Charter provides that, subject to limited exceptions, the Court of Chancery for the State 
of Delaware or other specified courts in the 
 State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum to the fullest extent of the law for: 
 
any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; 
 
any action asserting a 
claim of breach of 
a fiduciary duty owed by 
any of our directors, 
officers or other 
employees to us 
 or our stockholders; 
 
any action 
asserting a 
claim against 
us arising 
pursuant to 
any provision 
of the 
Delaware General 
Corporation Law 
(the 
 DGCL ), our Charter or our Bylaws; 
 
any action to interpret, apply, 
enforce or determine the validity of our Charter or Bylaws; and 

87 
 
any other action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs 
doctrine. 
 Our Charter also provides 
that the federal district 
courts of the United 
States of America will 
be the exclusive forum 
for the resolution 
 of 
any 
complaint 
asserting 
a 
cause 
of 
action 
against 
us 
or any 
of 
our 
directors, 
officers, 
employees 
or 
agents and 
arising 
under 
the 
 Securities Act. However, Section 22 
of the Securities 
Act provides that 
federal and state 
courts have concurrent 
jurisdiction over lawsuits 
 brought pursuant to the 
Securities Act or the rules and 
regulations thereunder. 
To the 
extent the exclusive forum provision 
restricts the 
 courts in which claims arising under the Securities Act may 
be brought, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce 
such a 
 provision. We 
note that 
investors cannot 
waive compliance 
with the 
federal securities 
laws and 
the rules 
and regulations 
thereunder. 
 This provision does not apply to claims brought under the Exchange Act. 
 Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice 
of and 
 to have consented to these provisions. These provisions may limit 
a stockholder s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum 
that it finds 
 favorable 
for disputes 
with us 
or our 
directors, officers 
or other 
employees, 
which may 
discourage 
such lawsuits 
against 
us and 
our 
 directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, 
if a court were to find these provisions of our Charter inapplicable to, or 
unenforceable 
 in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such 
 matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect 
our business or financial condition. 
 Delaware law and provisions in our Charter and 
Bylaws might discourage, delay or prevent a change 
in control of the Company or 
 changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our Class A common 
stock. 
 Provisions of 
our Charter 
and Bylaws 
and of 
state law 
may delay, 
deter, 
prevent or 
render more 
difficult a 
takeover attempt 
that our 
 stockholders might consider in their best interests, including the following 
provisions: 
 
our 
dual-class 
common 
stock 
structure 
and 
the 
Voting 
Agreement, 
which 
provide 
our 
principal 
stockholders 
with 
a 
 majority of the voting power 
of our capital stock will 
enable our principal stockholders to 
influence the outcome of matters 
 submitted to our 
stockholders for approval 
even if they 
own significantly less 
than a majority 
of the number 
of shares of 
 our outstanding common stock; 
 
our Charter does not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors; 
 
vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by our board of directors 
and not by stockholders; 
 
our 
stockholders 
may 
act 
by 
written 
consent 
only 
so 
long 
as 
the 
Voting 
Agreement 
is 
in 
effect 
and 
our 
principal 
 stockholders hold a majority of the voting power of then-outstanding shares 
of our capital stock; 
 
a special meeting of our stockholders may only be called by the chairperson of 
our board of directors, our Chief Executive 
 Officer, our President, a majority 
of our board 
of directors or, so 
long as the 
Voting 
Agreement is in 
effect and our principal 
 stockholders hold a majority of the voting power of then-outstanding shares 
of our capital stock, our stockholders; 
 
amendments 
to 
certain 
provisions 
of 
our 
Charter 
and 
stockholder-proposed 
amendments 
to 
our 
Bylaws 
require 
the 
 affirmative vote 
of the holders 
of at least 
66 2/3 in 
voting power of 
all the then 
outstanding shares of 
our capital stock 
 entitled to vote thereon at any time 
the Voting 
Agreement is not in effect or our 
principal stockholders do not hold, in the 
 aggregate, a majority of the voting power of then-outstanding shares of 
our capital stock; 
 
our Charter authorizes 
our board of directors, 
subject to the limitations 
imposed by Delaware 
law or the 
Nasdaq s listing 
 rules, without any 
further vote or 
action by our stockholders, 
to issue preferred 
stock in one or 
more series and 
to fix the 
 designations, powers, preferences, limitations and rights of the shares of 
each series; and 
 
advance notice procedures apply 
for stockholders to 
nominate candidates for election 
as directors or 
to bring matters 
before 
 an annual meeting of stockholders. 
 Such provisions or laws may prevent our stockholders from 
receiving the benefit from any premium to the market 
price of our Class A 
 common stock 
offered by 
a bidder 
in a takeover 
context. Even 
in the 
absence of 
a takeover attempt, 
the existence 
of these provisions 
 may adversely affect the prevailing 
market price of our Class A common 
stock if they are viewed as discouraging 
takeover attempts in 
 the future. 
 Provisions 
in 
our 
Charter 
and 
Bylaws, 
including 
the 
dual-class 
structure 
of 
our 
common 
stock, 
might 
discourage 
or 
prevent 
 institutional investors from purchasing or holding our Class A common stock, and, therefore, depress the trading price of 
our Class 
 A common stock. 
 Our governance structure and our Charter may negatively affect the 
decision by certain institutional investors to purchase or hold 
shares 
 of 
our 
Class 
A 
common 
stock. 
The 
holding 
of 
low-voting 
stock, 
such 
as 
our 
Class 
A 
common 
stock, 
may 
not 
be 
permitted 
by 
the 

88 
 investment policies of certain institutional investors or may be less attractive to the portfolio managers of certain institutional investors. 
 In addition, in July 2017, FTSE Russell and Standard Poor s announced that they would cease to allow 
most newly public companies 
 utilizing dual- 
or multi-class 
capital structures 
to be 
included in 
their indices. 
Affected indices 
include the 
Russell 2000 
and the 
S P 
 500, S P MidCap 
400 and S P 
SmallCap 600, which together 
make up the 
S P Composite 1500. Our 
dual-class common stock capital 
 structure may make 
us ineligible for inclusion 
in any of these and 
certain other indices, and 
as a result, mutual 
funds, exchange-traded 
 funds 
and other 
investment 
vehicles that 
attempt 
to passively 
track 
these indices 
would 
not 
invest in 
our 
stock. These 
policies 
may 
 depress our valuation compared to those of other similar companies that are 
included in such indices. 
 If securities 
or industry 
analysts do 
not publish 
research or 
publish inaccurate 
or unfavorable 
research about 
us, our business 
or 
 our market, or 
if they change 
their recommendation regarding 
our Class A common 
stock adversely, 
the trading price 
and trading 
 volume of our Class A common stock could decline. 
 The trading 
market for 
our Class 
A common 
stock will 
depend in 
part on 
the research 
and reports 
that securities 
or industry 
analysts 
 publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If no or few securities or industry analysts cover us, the price and trading 
 volume of 
our Class 
A common 
stock likely 
would be 
negatively impacted. 
If one 
or more 
of the 
securities or 
industry analysts 
who 
 cover us downgrade our Class A common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, the trading price of our Class A 
 common 
stock would 
likely decline. 
If analysts 
publish target 
prices for 
our Class 
A common 
stock that 
are below 
our then-current 
 public price of our 
Class A common 
stock, it could 
cause the trading 
price of our 
Class A common stock 
to decline significantly. Further, 
 if 
one 
or 
more of 
these 
analysts cease 
coverage 
of the 
Company 
or fail 
to 
publish 
reports on 
us 
regularly, 
demand 
for 
our 
Class A 
 common stock could decrease, which might cause our Class A common 
stock trading price and trading volume to decline. 
 General Risk Factors 
 We 
incur increased costs 
as a result 
of operating as 
a public company, 
and our management 
is required to 
devote substantial time 
 to new compliance initiatives. 
 As a public company, 
and particularly after we are no longer an 
 emerging growth company or 
 smaller reporting company, 
we will 
 incur significant legal, 
accounting and other expenses 
that we did not 
incur as a private 
company. 
In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act 
 and 
rules 
subsequently 
implemented 
by 
the 
SEC 
and 
the 
Nasdaq 
impose 
various 
requirements 
on 
public 
companies, 
including 
 establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls 
and corporate governance practices. Our management and 
 other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of 
time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, 
these rules and regulations have 
 increased our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some 
activities more time- consuming and costly. 
For example, these 
 rules and regulations have made it more difficult and more expensive 
for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance. 
 Pursuant to Section 
404, we are 
required to furnish 
a report by 
our management on 
our internal control 
over financial reporting, including 
 an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting 
issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. 
However, 
 while we remain an emerging growth company, we will not be required to include an 
attestation report on internal control over financial 
 reporting issued 
by our independent 
registered public accounting 
firm. To 
achieve compliance with 
Section 404 within 
the prescribed 
 period, we 
are engaged 
in a 
process to 
document and 
evaluate our 
internal control 
over financial 
reporting, which 
is both 
costly and 
 challenging. Further, 
despite our 
efforts, there 
is a 
risk that 
neither we 
nor our 
independent registered 
public accounting 
firm will 
be 
 able to 
conclude within 
the prescribed 
timeframe that 
our internal 
control over 
financial reporting 
is effective 
as required 
by Section 
 404. 
This 
could 
result 
in 
an 
adverse 
reaction 
in 
the 
financial 
markets 
due 
to 
a 
loss 
of 
confidence 
in 
the 
reliability 
of 
our 
financial 
 statements. In addition, if we are not able to continue to meet these requirements, 
we may not be able to remain listed on the Nasdaq. 
 Our independent 
registered public 
accounting firm 
may not 
be able 
to certify 
as to 
the effectiveness 
of our 
internal controls 
over 
 financial reporting, which could have a significant and adverse effect 
on our business and reputation. 
 As a public company, 
we are now required to comply 
with the SEC s rules 
implementing Sections 302 and 
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley 
 Act, which will require management to certify financial and 
other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an 
annual 
 management 
report 
on 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting. 
However, 
we 
are 
not 
required 
to 
have 
our 
 independent 
registered 
public 
accounting 
firm 
formally 
assess 
our 
internal 
controls 
for 
as long 
as 
we 
remain 
an 
 emerging 
growth 
 company as defined in the JOBS Act. 
 When formally evaluating 
our internal controls 
over financial reporting, 
we have identified 
and may identify 
further material weaknesses 
 that we may not be able to remediate 
in time to meet the applicable deadline 
imposed upon us for compliance with the 
requirements of 
 Section 404 
of the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 
In addition, 
if we 
fail to 
achieve and 
maintain the 
adequacy of 
our internal 
controls, as 
such 
 standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing 
 basis that 
we have 
effective internal 
controls over 
financial reporting 
in accordance 
with Section 
404 of 
the Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act. We 
 cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation, testing and any remediation actions or the impact of the 
same on our 
 operations. 
If we 
are not 
able to 
implement the 
requirements 
of 
Section 404 
of the 
Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act 
in a 
timely manner 
or with 
 adequate compliance, our 
independent registered public 
accounting firm may 
issue an 
adverse opinion due 
to ineffective internal 
controls 
 over financial 
reporting, and 
we may 
be subject 
to sanctions 
or investigation 
by regulatory 
authorities, such 
as the 
SEC. As 
a result, 

89 
 there could 
be a negative 
reaction in 
the financial 
markets due 
to a 
loss of confidence 
in the reliability 
of our 
financial statements. 
In 
 addition, we may 
be required to incur 
additional costs in improving 
our internal control 
system and the 
hiring of additional 
personnel. 
 Any such action could have a significant and adverse effect on our business and reputation, which could negatively affect our 
results of 
 operations or cash flows. 
 Further, we believe 
that any disclosure controls 
and procedures or internal controls and 
procedures, no matter how well-conceived 
and 
 operated, 
can 
provide 
only 
reasonable, 
not 
absolute, 
assurance 
that 
the 
objectives 
of 
the 
control 
system 
are 
met. 
These 
inherent 
 limitations include the facts that judgments in decision-making 
can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because 
of simple error or 
 mistake. Additionally, 
controls can be 
circumvented by 
the individual acts 
of some persons, 
by collusion of 
two or more 
people or by 
 an unauthorized 
override of the 
controls. Accordingly, 
because of the 
inherent limitations in 
our control system, 
misstatements due 
to 
 error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 We 
have 
in 
the 
past 
identified 
material 
weaknesses 
in 
our 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting, 
which 
have 
since 
been 
 remediated. If we 
are unable to 
develop and maintain 
an effective system 
of internal control 
over financial reporting, 
or if we 
discover 
 material deficiencies 
in the future, 
we may 
not be 
able to accurately 
report our 
financial results 
or prevent 
fraud, and 
as a 
result, 
 shareholders 
could lose 
confidence in 
our financial 
and other 
public reporting, 
which would 
harm our 
business and 
the trading 
 price of our Class A common stock. 
 Effective internal controls over financial 
reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial 
reports and, together with adequate 
 disclosure 
controls 
and 
procedures, 
are 
designed 
to 
prevent 
fraud. 
Any 
failure 
to 
implement 
required 
new 
or 
improved 
controls, 
or 
 difficulties 
encountered 
in 
their 
implementation, 
could 
cause 
us 
to 
fail 
to 
meet 
our 
reporting 
obligations. 
A 
material 
weakness 
is 
a 
 deficiency or a 
combination of deficiencies 
in internal control 
over financial reporting 
such that there is 
a reasonable possibility 
that a 
 material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented 
or detected on a timely basis. 

 During the 
preparation of 
our audited 
consolidated financial 
statements for 
the year 
ended December 
31, 2021, 
we identified 
certain 
 errors 
in 
our 
previously 
issued financial 
statements 
that 
were 
determined 
not 
to be 
material. 
Further, 
as disclosed 
in Item 
4 
of our 
 Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q during 
2022, we identified material weaknesses 
in the design and operation of 
our internal control over 
 financial 
reporting 
relating 
to 
maintaining 
and 
performing 
our 
financial 
close 
process, 
ensuring 
that 
formal 
processes 
exist 
for 
 identifying, analyzing and accounting for complex, non-routine transactions and proper segregation of duties 
and responsibilities within 
 our finance department. 
We have invested resources 
and taken 
measures to improve 
internal control over 
financial reporting to 
remediate 
 the control deficiencies that led to these material 
weaknesses. Although we have successfully remediated 
these material weaknesses, we 
 cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully remediate other material weaknesses that we may discover additional weaknesses 
 in the future. If 
we are unable to 
successfully prevent or remediate 
any future issues or 
if the design and 
operation of our internal 
controls 
 fails, it could result in material misstatements or omissions in our financial 
statements and potentially require us to restate our financial 
 statements, which may result in the trading value of our Class A common stock being 
materially adversely affected. 
 If 
our 
estimates 
or 
judgments 
relating 
to 
our 
critical 
accounting 
policies 
are 
based 
on 
assumptions 
that 
change 
or 
prove 
to 
be 
 incorrect, 
our operating 
results 
could 
fall 
below 
our publicly 
announced 
guidance 
or 
the expectations 
of 
securities 
analysts 
and 
 investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our Class A common stock. 
 The 
preparation 
of 
financial 
statements 
in 
conformity 
with 
U.S. 
generally 
accepted 
accounting 
principles GAAP 
requires 
 management 
to 
make 
estimates 
and 
assumptions 
that 
affect 
the 
amounts 
reported 
in 
our 
consolidated 
financial 
statements 
and 
 accompanying notes. We base our 
estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable 
 under the circumstances, the results of which form 
the basis for making judgments about the 
carrying values of assets, liabilities, equity, 
 revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. If our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from 
 our 
assumptions, 
our 
operating 
results 
may 
be 
adversely 
affected 
and 
could 
fall 
below 
our 
publicly 
announced 
guidance 
or 
the 
 expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline 
in the market price of our Class A common stock. 

 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. 
 
 None. 

 Item 2. Properties. 
 
 Facilities 
 Our principal executive offices 
are located in Merritt 
Island, Florida, 
where we sublease approximately 
9,900 square feet of 
office and 
 lab space 
from Space 
Florida. 
In April 
2022, we 
entered into 
a facility 
lease agreement 
for 4,419 
square feet 
of office 
space in 
New 
 York, 
New York, 
which will expire 
in March 2029. 
We 
do not 
currently own 
any real property. 
We 
believe that 
our current 
facilities 
 are adequate 
to meet 
our immediate 
needs and 
believe that 
we should 
be able 
to renew 
each of 
our leases 
and subleases 
without 
an 
 adverse impact on our 
operations. In addition, we 
believe that if we require 
additional office space 
or manufacturing facilities, we 
will 
 be able to obtain additional facilities on commercially reasonable terms. 

90 
 Item 3. Legal Proceedings. 
 
 From time 
to time we 
are a party 
to various 
litigation matters 
incidental to 
the conduct 
of our business. 
We 
are not presently 
party to 
 any 
legal proceedings 
the resolution 
of which 
we believe 
would 
have a 
material 
adverse effect 
on our 
business, prospects, 
financial 
 condition, liquidity, results 
of operation, cash flows or capital levels. 

 Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. 
 
 The disclosure required by this item is not applicable.

 PART 
II 
 
 Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, 
Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity 
Securities. 
 Market Price for the Common Stock 
 Our Class A 
common stock 
is listed on 
the Nasdaq 
Global Market 
under the 
symbol VAXX 
. As of 
March 15, 2023, 
the number 
of 
 shares 
of 
our 
Class 
A 
common 
stock 
outstanding 
was 
112,188,911 
held 
by 
approximately 
81 
shareholders 
of 
record, 
not 
including 
 shareholders whose shares are held in securities position listings. 

 Our Class B common stock is not listed on any exchange nor traded on any public market. As of 
March 15, 2023, the number of shares 
 of our Class B common stock outstanding was 13,874,132 held by 
approximately 4 shareholders of record. 
 Dividends 
 We 
have never declared 
or paid, and do 
not anticipate declaring 
or paying in 
the foreseeable future, 
any cash dividends 
on our capital 
 stock. Any future determination to declare and pay cash dividends will be 
at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance 
with 
 applicable laws 
and will 
depend on, 
among other 
things, our 
financial condition, 
results of 
operations, cash 
requirements, contractual 
 restrictions and such 
other factors as 
our board of 
directors deems relevant. 
Our ability to 
pay dividends may 
also be limited 
by covenants 
 of any future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur. 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

We did not 
repurchase any shares during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 
 There were no unregistered sales of equity securities during the fourth quarter 
of 2022. 
 Use of Proceeds 
 On November 15, 2021, the Company closed its IPO, as discussed in Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended 
 December 31, 2022. 
The aggregate net 
proceeds to us 
from the offering, 
after deducting underwriting 
discounts and commissions 
and 
 other offering expenses 
payable by us, were 
approximately 71.1 million. 
The proceeds from 
our IPO have been 
invested primarily in 
 U.S. Treasury 
securities and money 
market accounts. There 
has been no 
material change in 
the expected use 
of the net 
proceeds from 
 our IPO as described in our prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) under the Securities Act with the 
SEC on November 12, 2021. 
 Item 6. [Reserved]. 
 
 Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
Condition and Results of Operations. 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and 
results of operations should be read 
together with our 
 consolidated financial statements and related 
notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in 
this Report. We 
intend for 
 this discussion to provide you with information 
that will assist you in understanding our consolidated financial statements, 
the 
 changes in key items in those consolidated financial statements from 
year to year and the primary factors that accounted for those 
 changes.
 Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere 
in this Report, including information 
 with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related 
financing, includes forward-looking statements that 
involve risks, 
 uncertainties and assumptions. See the section of this Report titled Special Note 
Regarding Forward-Looking 
Statements for a 
 discussion of forward-looking statements. As a result 
of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors section of 
 this Report, our actual results could differ 
materially from management s 
expectations and the results described in or implied 
by the 
 forward-looking statements contained 
in the following discussion and analysis. 
 Overview 
 Vaxxinity 
is engaged in the development of 
rationally designed prophylactic and 
therapeutic vaccines to combat 
chronic disorders and 
 infectious diseases with large patient populations and 
unmet medical needs. While vaccines 
have traditionally been unable to effectively 
 and 
safely combat 
such disorders, 
we believe 
our platform 
could overcome 
the traditional 
hurdles facing 
vaccines 
in this 
area. 
Our 
 Vaxxine 
Platform relies 
on a synthetic 
peptide vaccine 
technology first 
developed by 
UBI and 
subsequently refined 
over the 
last two 
 decades. We 
believe our 
vaccines have 
the potential 
to combat 
conditions that 
have not 
yet been 
successfully treated, 
or which 
have 
 primarily been addressed with 
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) which, 
while generally effective, 
are extremely costly and 
cumbersome, 
 and 
thus 
have 
limited 
accessibility. 
Our 
pipeline 
primarily 
consists 
of 
five 
programs 
focused 
on 
chronic 
disease, 
spanning 

92 
 neurodegenerative disorders in 
addition to other 
neurology and cardiovascular 
indications. Given the globa 
l 
COVID-19 pandemic and 
 our Vaxxine 
Platform s 
applicability to 
infectious disease, 
we are also 
opportunistically advancing 
a product candidate 
that addresses 
 SARS-CoV-2. 
 We separated our business 
from UBI 
through two separate 
transactions: a 
spin-out from UBI 
in 2014 
of operations focused 
on developing 
 chronic 
disease 
product 
candidates 
that 
resulted 
in 
UNS, 
and 
a 
second 
spin-out 
from 
UBI 
in 
2020 
of 
operations 
focused 
on 
the 
 development of a 
COVID-19 vaccine that 
resulted in COVAXX. 
On February 2, 
2021, Vaxxinity 
was incorporated for 
the purpose of 
 reorganizing 
and 
combining UNS 
and 
COVAXX 
and 
did 
so 
on 
March 
2, 2021 
through 
the 
Reorganization. 
In connection 
with 
the 
 Reorganization, (i) all outstanding shares of UNS and COVAXX 
preferred stock and common stock were contributed to Vaxxinity 
and 
 exchanged for 
an aggregate of 
57,702,458 shares 
of our Class A 
common stock, 10,999,149 
shares of our 
Class B common 
stock and 
 58,175,751
 
shares of our Series A preferred stock, (ii) the 
outstanding options to purchase shares of UNS and COVAXX common stock 
 were terminated 
and substituted 
with options 
to purchase 
an aggregate 
of 19,712,504 
shares of 
our Class 
A common 
stock, (iii) 
the 
 outstanding warrant to 
purchase shares of COVAXX 
common stock was 
cancelled and exchanged 
for a warrant that 
is exercisable for 
 112,373 
shares of 
our Class 
A common 
stock, and 
(iv) the 
outstanding 
Convertible Notes 
and 
the Related 
Note were 
contributed 
to 
 Vaxxinity 
and the former holders of such notes received an aggregate of 
 4,047,344
 
shares of our Series A preferred stock. As a result of 
 the Reorganization, 
COVAXX 
and UNS became 
our wholly-owned 
subsidiaries. All shares 
of our Series 
A preferred stock 
converted 
 into shares of 
our Class A 
common stock concurrently with the 
closing of our initial 
public offering. The Reorganization was 
determined 
 to be a common control transaction, so the carrying values of all contributed assets and assumed liabilities remained unchanged and the 
 financial information 
for all 
periods in 
this section 
of the 
financial statements 
presented prior 
to the 
Reorganization 
are presented 
on 
 consolidated basis. Unless the context requires otherwise, in this section we use the terms Vaxxinity, 
 we, us and our to refer to 
 our operations (including through UNS and COVAXX) 
both prior to and after the Reorganization. 
 Since our spin-out transactions 
from UBI, we have 
focused on organizing 
and staffing our business, 
business planning, raising 
capital, 
 developing 
our 
Vaxxine 
Platform, 
identifying 
and 
testing 
potential 
product 
candidates 
and 
conducting 
clinical 
trials. 
We 
have 
also 
 developed a SARS CoV-2 
antibody ELISA test, which received an EUA from the FDA in January 2021. 
 Our current pipeline consists of six programs from early to 
late-stage development, including five programs focused on chronic disease: 
 UB-311, 
our leading 
neurology product 
candidate, which 
targets AD; 
UB-312, which 
targets PD 
and other 
synucleinopathies; VXX-
 301, an 
anti-tau product 
candidate which 
has the 
potential to 
address multiple 
neurodegenerative conditions, 
including AD; 
UB-313, 
 which 
targets 
CGRP 
to 
prevent 
migraines; 
and 
VXX-401, 
which 
targets 
PCSK9 
to 
reduce 
LDL 
cholesterol, 
a 
risk 
factor 
for 
 atherosclerotic 
heart 
disease. 
Through 
our 
Vaxxine 
Platform, 
we 
believe 
we 
may 
be 
able 
to 
address 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
other 
chronic 
 diseases, 
including 
chronic 
diseases that 
are 
or 
could 
potentially be 
successfully 
treated 
by 
mAbs, 
which 
increasingly 
dominate 
the 
 treatment paradigm but remain accessible only to a small proportion of patients who 
could potentially benefit from them. 
 In addition 
to our 
chronic disease 
pipeline, given 
our Vaxxine 
Platform s 
applicability to 
infectious disease 
and the 
ongoing need 
for 
 vaccines to address SARS-CoV-2, we are advancing an infectious disease 
product candidate, UB-612, as a heterologous booster against 
 COVID-19. 
We 
have 
reported 
topline 
results 
of 
a 
pivotal 
Phase 
3 
trial 
of 
UB-612, 
and 
have 
completed 
rolling 
submissions 
for 
 conditional/provisional authorization with regulatory authorities in the United 
Kingdom and Australia, respectively, 
in March of 2023. 

 To 
date, our revenue 
has been generated 
from the modest 
sales of our 
ELISA test and 
the sale of 
an option to 
negotiate a license 
with 
 UNS (which option 
has expired). As 
a result, 
our ability to 
generate revenue sufficient to 
achieve profitability will 
depend on the 
eventual 
 regulatory approval, and 
commercialization of one 
or more of 
our product candidates. 
We have not yet 
obtained any regulatory 
approvals 
 for our product candidates or conducted sales and marketing activities for 
our product candidates. 
 We have principally funded our operations through 
financing transactions. Through December 31, 2022, we received gross proceeds of 
 306.4 
million 
in 
connection with 
various 
financial 
instruments, 
including 
the 
sale of 
preferred 
and 
common 
stock, the 
issuance 
of 
 promissory notes (including convertible promissory notes Convertible Notes )), and the entry 
into simple agreements for future 
equity 
 SAFEs ). 

 Costs associated with research and development are the most significant component of our expenses. These costs can vary greatly from 
 period to period depending on the timing 
of various trials for our 
product candidates. We expect our allocated research and development 
 costs and 
general 
and 
administrative 
expenses 
could 
increase 
over 
time if 
we expand 
the number 
of product 
candidates that 
we 
are 
 advancing and 
incur increased 
costs as 
a result 
of operating 
as a 
public company. 
Further, 
we anticipate 
incurring greater 
selling and 
 marketing expenses if we commercialize any of our product candidates in the future. Our product candidates are 
in clinical stage or pre-
 clinical stage development. 
We 
have generated limited 
revenue to date, 
and have incurred significant 
operating losses since 
inception. 
 Net losses were 75.2 
million and 137.2 million 
for the years ended 
December 31, 2022 and 2021, 
respectively. 
As of December 31, 
 2022, 
we had an accumulated deficit of 304.7 million. We 
anticipate 
 our expenses and capital requirements may increase over time in 
 connection with expanding our operations, 
which could include:
 
 continuing pre-clinical studies, existing clinical trials, or initiating new 
clinical trials for product candidates UB-312, UB-313, 
 VXX-401, UB-612, and other product candidates; 

93 
 
 hiring additional 
clinical, quality 
control, medical, 
scientific and 
other technical 
personnel to 
support additional 
clinical and 
 research and development programs; 
 
 expanding operational, financial and management systems 
and infrastructure, expanding our facilities 
and increasing personnel 
 to support operations; 
 
 undertaking actions to meet the requirements and demands of being 
a public company; 
 
 maintaining, expanding and protecting our intellectual property portfolio; 
 
 seeking regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete 
clinical trials, including UB-612; and 
 
 undertaking pre-commercialization activities to establish sales, marketing 
and distribution capabilities for any product 
 candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval in regions where 
we elect to commercialize products on our own or 
 jointly with third parties. 
 As of 
the date 
of this 
Report, we 
expect our 
existing cash 
and cash 
equivalents will 
be sufficient 
to fund 
our operating 
expenses and 
 capital expenditure requirements 
for at least the 
next 12 months. We 
also believe that cash 
and cash equivalents will 
enable us to fund 
 our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into mid-2024. Thereafter, our viability will be dependent on our ability to 
 raise additional capital to finance operations, to successfully commercialize 
our product candidates, 
or to enter into collaborations with 
 third parties for 
the development of 
our product candidates. 
If we are 
unable to do 
any of the 
foregoing, we would 
be forced to 
delay, 
 limit, reduce or terminate our product 
candidate development or future commercialization 
efforts. Our estimates are 
based on a variety 
 of assumptions that 
may prove to 
be wrong, and 
we could exhaust 
our available capital 
resources sooner than 
expected. See 
Liquidity 
 and Capital Resources. 

 Business Update Regarding COVID-19 Pandemic 
 In March 
2020, the 
World 
Health Organization 
declared the 
COVID-19 
outbreak 
a pandemic. 
The onset 
of the 
pandemic led 
to our 
 institutional 
prioritization 
of 
COVID-19 
vaccine 
development 
efforts, 
which 
correlated 
with 
a 
relative 
decline 
in 
research 
and 
 development expenditures for our chronic disease product candidates. To date, our operations have not been negatively impacted by the 
 COVID-19 pandemic in 
a material manner. While 
the pandemic has 
subsided around the 
world since 2020, 
we cannot 
predict the 
specific 
 extent, duration 
or full 
impact that 
future outbreaks 
associated with 
new variants 
of the 
COVID-19 
virus may 
have on 
our financial 
 condition 
and 
operations. 
Potential impacts 
could 
include delays 
of the 
development 
of clinical 
supply 
materials, 
and 
enrollment 
of 
 patients in our 
studies may be delayed 
or suspended, as hospitals 
and clinics in 
areas where we are 
conducting trials may 
need to shift 
 resources to 
cope with 
COVID-19 and 
may limit 
access or 
close clinical 
facilities. Additionally, 
if our 
trial participants 
are unable 
to 
 travel to our clinical study sites 
as a result of quarantines or other restrictions 
resulting from COVID-19 outbreaks, we 
may experience 
 higher drop-out rates or delays in our clinical studies. The 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial performance will depend 
 on future developments, including the duration and spread of future outbreaks and related 
governmental advisories and restrictions. The 
 impact of 
future outbreaks 
on the financial 
markets and 
the overall 
economy are 
also highly 
uncertain and 
cannot be 
predicted. If 
the 
 financial markets and/or the overall economy are impacted for an 
extended period, our results may be materially adversely 
affected. See 
 Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business and Industry The ongoing 
coronavirus pandemic has caused interruptions or delays of 
 our business plan. Delays caused by the coronavirus pandemic may have a significant 
adverse effect on our business. 
 Components of Our Consolidated Results of Operations 
 Revenue 

 We recorded no revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 0.1 million, and 
 consisted of 
commercial sales 
of our 
ELISA tests. 
We 
do not 
expect to 
generate any 
meaningful revenue 
unless and 
until we 
obtain 
 regulatory approval of and commercialize or out-license our product candidates, 
and we do not know when, or if, this will occur. If our 
 development efforts 
for our product 
candidates are successful 
and result in 
commercialization, we may 
generate additional revenue 
in 
 the future from a combination 
of product sales or payments 
from collaboration or license agreements 
that we have entered into 
or may 
 enter 
into 
with 
third 
parties. 
See 
Risk 
Factors Risks 
Related 
to 
the 
Discovery 
and 
Development 
of 
Product 
Candidates. 
We 
have 
 incurred significant losses 
since our inception. 
We 
expect to incur losses 
for the foreseeable future 
and may never achieve 
or maintain 
 profitability. 

 Cost of Revenue 

 We recorded no cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
Cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 consists 
 of kit production costs consisting of materials, labor and overhead expenses directly related to ELISA tests 
sold and the costs of expired 
 ELISA tests, which are not available for commercial sale. 

94 
 If our development 
efforts in respect 
of our current 
pipeline of product 
candidates are successful and 
result in regulatory 
approval, we 
 expect our 
cost of revenue 
will increase in 
relative proportion 
to the level 
of our revenue 
as we commercialize 
the applicable 
product 
 candidate. We 
expect that 
cost of 
revenue will 
increase in 
absolute dollars 
as and 
if our 
revenue grows 
and will 
vary from 
period to 
 period as a percentage of revenue. 

 Research and Development Expenses 

 The design, initiation and execution of candidate discovery and development programs of our potential future product candidates is key 
 to our 
success and 
involves significant 
expenses. Prior 
to initiating 
these programs, 
project teams 
incorporating individuals 
from the 
 essential disciplines within Vaxxinity scope out the activities, timing, requirements, inclusion and exclusion 
criteria and the primary and 
 secondary endpoints. Once we have decided to proceed, 
our Vaxxine 
Platform enables the iteration of drug candidates in the discovery 
 phase through rapid, rational design 
and formulation. After we have 
identified drug candidates, the costs 
of scaling the formulation from 
 research grade 
to clinical 
grade, then 
to commercial 
grade, typically 
consumes significant 
resources. In 
addition, to 
internal research 
 and development, we utilize service providers, including related parties, to 
complete activities we lack the internal resources to handle. 
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred 
for research activities, including drug discovery efforts 
and the 
 development of our product candidates. We 
expense research and development costs as incurred, which include: 
 
 expenses incurred to conduct the necessary preclinical studies and clinical 
trials required to obtain regulatory approval; 
 
 expenses incurred under agreements with CROs that are primarily engaged in 
the oversight and conduct of our clinical trials, 
 preclinical studies and drug discovery efforts and contract 
manufacturers that are primarily engaged to provide preclinical 
 and clinical drug substance and product for our research and development programs; 
 
 other costs related to acquiring and manufacturing materials in connection 
with our drug discovery efforts and preclinical 
 studies and clinical trial materials, including manufacturing validation 
batches; 

costs related to investigative sites and consultants that conduct our clinical 
trials, preclinical studies and other scientific 
 development services; 
 
 employee-related expenses, including salaries and benefits, travel and 
stock-based compensation expense for employees 
 engaged in research and development functions; 
 
 costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements; and 
 
 facilities-related costs, depreciation and other expenses, which include 
rent and utilities. 
 We 
recognize 
external 
development 
costs 
based 
on 
an 
evaluation 
of 
the 
progress 
to 
completion 
of 
specific 
tasks 
using 
information 
 provided to us by 
service providers. This process 
involves reviewing open contracts and 
purchase orders, communicating with 
personnel 
 to identify services that 
have been performed on 
our behalf and 
estimating the level 
of service performed and 
the associated cost 
incurred 
 for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. Any nonrefundable advance payments that 
we 
 make for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research 
and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. 
 Such amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed, or until it is no longer expected that 
 the goods will be delivered, 
or the services rendered, at which point the net remainder is expensed. 
 We continue to work with related parties for 
the advancement of our research and development programs, including for manufacturing, 
 quality control, testing, validation, 
supply services, as well as the 
winding down of some previously 
initiated clinical initiatives. While 
 this related party work has significantly diminished over the last year, and we expect this trend to continue, we are still reliant on UBIA 
 to provide 
certain manufacturing-related 
data that 
will be 
needed for 
inclusion in 
our regulatory 
applications for 
UB-612. During 
the 
 years 
ended 
December 31, 
2022 
and 
2021, 
related 
party 
expenses 
were 
approximately 
6 
and 
29 
of 
our 
operating 
expenses, 
 respectively. 

 Where appropriate, 
we allocate 
our third-party 
research 
and development 
expenses on 
a program-by-program 
basis. These 
expenses 
 primarily 
relate 
to 
outside 
consultants, 
CROs, 
contract 
manufacturers 
and 
research 
laboratories 
in 
connection 
with 
pre-clinical 
 development, process 
development, manufacturing 
and clinical 
development activities. 
We 
do not 
allocate our 
internal costs, 
such as 
 employee costs, 
costs associated 
with our discovery 
efforts, laboratory 
supplies and 
facilities, including 
depreciation or 
other indirect 
 costs, to 
specific programs because 
these costs often 
relate to platform 
development, to multiple 
programs simultaneously or 
to discovery 
 of new 
programs, and 
any such 
allocation would 
necessarily involve 
significant estimates 
and judgments 
and, accordingly, 
would be 
 imprecise. When we 
refer to the 
research and development 
expenses associated with 
a specific program, 
these refer exclusively 
to the 
 allocated 
third-party 
expenses 
associated 
with 
that 
product 
candidate. 
All 
other 
research 
and 
development 
costs 
are 
referred 
to 
as 
 unallocated costs. 

95 
 Product candidates in later 
stages of clinical development 
generally have higher development costs 
than those in earlier 
stages of clinical 
 development, 
primarily 
due 
to 
the 
increased 
size 
and 
duration 
of 
later-stage 
clinical 
trials. 
Additionally, 
greater 
research 
and 
 development overhead is required to support 
broader and more rapid 
development of our Vaxxine Platform and new product candidates. 
 As a result, we expect that our research and development expenses could increase if we continue our existing and planned clinical trials 
 and conduct 
increased pre-clinical 
and clinical 
development activities, 
including submitting 
regulatory filings 
for product 
candidates, 
 and focus more generally on the development of our chronic disease product 
candidates. 
 At this 
time, we 
cannot reasonably 
estimate or know 
the nature, 
timing and 
costs of 
the efforts 
that will be 
necessary to 
complete the 
 pre-clinical and clinical development of any of our 
product candidates or when, if ever, 
material net cash inflows may commence from 
 any of our product candidates. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 

 General 
and 
administrative 
expenses 
consist 
primarily 
of 
salaries 
and 
benefits, 
travel 
and 
stock-based 
compensation 
expense 
for 
 personnel 
in 
executive, 
business 
development, 
finance, 
human 
resources, 
legal, 
information 
technology, 
public 
relations, 
 communications and 
administrative functions. 
General and administrative 
expenses also include 
insurance costs and 
professional fees 
 for 
legal, 
patent, 
consulting, 
investor 
and 
public 
relations, 
accounting 
and 
audit 
services 
and 
other 
general 
operating 
expenses 
not 
 otherwise classified as research and development expenses. We 
expense general and administrative costs as incurred. 
 In the event UB-612 obtains regulatory approval and we subsequently commence commercialization of this product, we expect general 
 and administrative 
expenses will 
increase. We 
will continue 
to incur 
public company-related 
expenses, including 
services associated 
 with maintaining compliance with Nasdaq listing and SEC requirements, director and officer liability insurance and investor and public 
 relations costs. 
 Other Expense (Income) 

 Interest Expense 

 Interest expense consists 
of (i) interest expense 
recognized on the note 
payable entered into during 
June 2020 for the 
acquisition of an 
 airplane (the 
 2025 Note ), 
(ii) interest 
expense accrued 
on the related 
party promissory 
note, (iii) 
interest expense 
recognized on 
the 
 Convertible 
Notes 
and 
(iv) 
interest expense 
recognized 
on other 
promissory 
notes, 
including 
 0.1 
million 
borrowed 
from 
our 
Chief 
 Executive Officer (the Executive 
Note and a related party Convertible 
Note payable for 2.0 million in aggregate 
proceeds that was 
 received in three tranches (the 
 2018 Related Notes ). The Executive 
Note was repaid in 
full in August 2021 
and the 2018 
Related Notes 
 were converted into Series A preferred stock concurrently with the Reorganization. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income consists of income earned on our cash and cash equivalents, 
money market holdings, and short-term investments. 

 Change in Fair Value 
of Convertible Notes, SAFEs and Series A-1 Warrant 
Liability 

 We 
issued a series 
of Convertible Notes 
during the years 
ended December 31, 
2018 through 2021, 
a series of SAFEs 
during the 
years 
 ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, 
and warrants to purchase shares of our Series A-1 preferred 
stock Series A-1 Warrants 
during 
 the year ended December 31, 2020, each of which were measured and accounted for at fair value. We remeasured 
the fair value of each 
 of 
the 
Convertible 
Notes, 
SAFEs 
and 
Series 
A-1 
Warrants 
at 
each 
reporting 
date 
and 
recognize 
changes 
in 
the 
fair 
value 
in 
our 
 consolidated statements of operations. 
Inputs to the calculation of fair 
value generally include market and acquisition 
comparable(s) as 
 well as other variables. In 
connection with the Reorganization, all outstanding 
Convertible Notes, SAFEs, and 
Series A-1 Warrants were 
 exchanged 
for 
shares 
of 
Series 
A 
preferred 
stock, 
which 
were 
subsequently 
exchanged 
into 
shares 
of 
Class 
A 
common 
stock 
upon 
 closing of the IPO in November 2021. 
 Loss on Foreign Currency 
Translation, Net 

 Our foreign 
subsidiaries, which are 
wholly-owned by Vaxxinity, 
use the U.S. 
dollar as their 
functional currency 
and maintain records 
 in 
the 
local 
currency. 
Nonmonetary 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
are 
remeasured 
at 
historical 
rates 
and 
monetary 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
are 
 remeasured at exchange rates in 
effect at the end 
of the reporting period. Income 
statement accounts are remeasured at 
average exchange 
 rates for the reporting 
period. The resulting gains or 
losses are included in 
foreign currency (losses) gains in 
the consolidated financial 
 statements. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 

 We have not recorded any significant amounts related to income tax but have reserved 0.7 million of unrecognized tax 
benefits against 
 NOLs. We have not 
recorded any income tax benefits for the majority of our net losses we incurred 
to date. 

96 
 We 
account for 
income taxes 
using the 
asset and 
liability method, 
which requires 
the recognition of 
deferred tax 
assets and 
liabilities 
 for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included 
in the consolidated financial statements or our tax returns. 

 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
determined based on the difference between the 
financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis 
 of existing assets and liabilities and for loss and credit carryforwards, which are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws in effect 
 in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation 
 of future taxable 
income, the amount 
and timing of which 
are uncertain. Valuation 
allowances are provided, 
if, based upon the 
weight 
 of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all 
of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of December 31, 2022, 
 we continue to 
maintain a full 
valuation allowance 
against all of 
our deferred tax 
assets based on 
evaluation of all 
available evidence. 
 We 
file income 
tax returns in 
the U.S. federal 
and state jurisdictions 
and may become 
subject to income 
tax audit and 
adjustments by 
 related tax authorities. 
Our tax return 
periods (for entities then 
in existence) for 
U.S. federal income 
taxes for the tax 
years since 2017 
 remain open to examination under the statute of limitations 
by the Internal Revenue Service and state jurisdictions. We 
record 
reserves 
 for potential 
tax payments 
to various 
tax authorities 
related to 
uncertain tax 
positions, if 
any. 
The nature 
of uncertain 
tax positions 
is 
 subject 
to 
significant 
judgment 
by 
management 
and 
subject 
to 
change, 
which 
may 
be 
substantial. 
These 
reserves 
are 
based 
on 
a 
 determination of 
whether and how 
much a tax 
benefit taken by 
us in our 
tax filings or 
positions is more 
likely than 
not to be 
realized 
 following the resolution of any potential contingencies related to the tax benefit. We 
develop our assessment of uncertain tax positions, 
 and the associated 
cumulative probabilities, using 
internal expertise and assistance 
from third-party experts. 
As additional information 
 becomes 
available, 
estimates 
are 
revised 
and 
refined. 
Differences 
between 
estimates 
and 
final 
settlement 
may 
occur 
resulting 
in 
 additional tax 
expense. Potential 
interest and 
penalties associated 
with such uncertain 
tax positions is 
recorded as 
a component 
of our 
 provision for income taxes. 

 Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Consolidated Results of 
Operations 

 On March 2, 2021, Vaxxinity entered into the Contribution 
and Exchange Agreement, pursuant to 
which the outstanding equity interests 
 of 
UNS 
and 
COVAXX 
were 
contributed 
to 
Vaxxinity 
in 
return 
for 
equity 
interests 
in 
Vaxxinity, 
resulting 
in 
UNS 
and 
COVAXX 
 becoming wholly owned subsidiaries of Vaxxinity. 
Accordingly, all share and per share amounts prior to the Reorganization 
have been 
 adjusted to reflect the Reorganization. In addition, we formed COVAXX, 
and commenced our COVAXX business, 
on March 23, 2020. 
 As a result, 
the historical financial 
information between 
March 23, 2020 
and March 2, 
2021 described 
in this Annual 
Report refers 
to 
 the combined historical financial information of UNS and COVAXX. Our operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 reflects the 
 operations of Vaxxinity 
and its subsidiaries. Our 
operations for the 
year ended December 
31, 2021 reflects 
the operations of 
UNS and 
 COVAXX 
businesses on a consolidated basis 
for the period from January 
1, 2021 to March 
1, 2021 and of Vaxxinity and its subsidiaries 
 for the remainder of that twelve-month period. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere 
in this Form 10-
 K filing.

 Comparison of the Years 
Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 
 Revenue 

 We did not record any revenues for the 
year ended December 31, 2022. Total revenue was 0.1 million 
for the year ended 
December 31, 
 2021. 
All revenues 
were due 
to sales 
of our 
ELISA tests. 
We 
are not 
actively pursuing 
commercialization 
of our 
ELISA tests 
at this 
 time. 
 Gross Margin 
 All gross 
margin and comparable 
decreases were due 
to sales 
of our ELISA 
tests. Gross 
margin was zero 
for the 
year ended 
December 31, 
 2022. 
The gross 
margin 
for the 
year ended 
December 31, 2021 
was negative, 
however the 
sales volume 
was de 
minimis. During 
the 
 year ended December 31, 2021, we wrote off, 
to cost of revenue, 1.9 million in expired ELISA tests that had no commercial value. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research 
and 
development 
expenses 
were 
 47.6 
million 
and 
 71.4 
million 
for 
the 
years 
ended 
December 31, 
2022 
and 
2021, 
 respectively. 

 The 23.8 million 
decrease was comprised 
of a 38.3 
million decrease in 
allocated costs (i.e., 
costs that can be 
directly attributed 
to a 
 specific clinical program), 
offset by a 14.6 
million increase in unallocated 
costs. The decrease in allocated 
costs was primarily due 
to 
 a decrease 
of 47.7 
million in 
costs related 
to our 
UB-612 Covid 
vaccine program, 
including a 
 1.8 million 
expense in 
2022 for 
raw 
 materials 
acquired 
by 
UBP, 
a 
related 
party 
contract 
manufacturer. 
See 
Note 
17, 
 Commitments 
and 
Contingencies , 
for 
more 
 information 
about 
this 
expense. 
The 
decrease 
in 
allocated 
costs 
was 
offset 
by 
increases 
in 
spend 
of 
 4.7 
million 
on 
our 
VXX-401 
 hypercholesterolemia program, 
 2.1 million on 
our UB-313 CGRP program, 
and 0.5 million on 
our UB-312 PD 
program. The 14.6 
 million increase in unallocated costs was driven by increased salaries and personnel-related costs of 9.6 million, including stock-based 
 compensation expense of 1.8 million, a 3.2 
million increase in rent, lab supplies, logistics 
and travel costs, and a 1.8 
million increase 
 in external professional services supporting research and development 
activities across the pipeline. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General 
and 
administrative 
expenses 
were 
 28.4 
million 
and 
 51.8 
million 
for 
the 
years 
ended 
December 31, 
2022 
and 
2021, 
 respectively. 
The 23.5 
million decrease 
was primarily 
due to 
a decrease 
of 23.6 
million in 
stock-based compensation 
expense; we 
 recorded a 23.1 million expense in 2021 related to performance-based grants that vested upon the successful completion of our IPO in 
 November 2021. 
There were also 
decreases of 
 0.7 million 
in legal 
spend, and 
 1.0 million 
in consulting 
spend versus 
the prior 
year 
 when we were 
preparing for our 
initial public offering 
, 
and 0.8 million 
in spending on 
external recruiters. These 
cost decreases were 
 partially offset by an increase in director and officer 
insurance expense of 3.0 million in 2022 versus 2021. 
 Interest and Other Expense
 Interest 
and 
other 
expense 
was 
 0.5 
million 
and 
 0.8 
million 
for 
the 
years 
ended 
December 31, 
2022 
and 
2021, 
respectively. 
The 
 decrease was due to the conversion of Convertible Notes for Series A preferred 
stock in connection with the Reorganization. 

 Interest and Other Income
 Interest 
and 
other 
income 
on 
cash 
and 
short-term 
investments 
was 
 1.3 
million 
and 
less 
than 
 0.1 
million 
for 
the 
years 
ended 
 December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Change in Fair Value 
of Convertible Notes, SAFEs and Series A-1 Warrant 
Liability 
 The 
 2.7 
million 
change 
in fair 
value 
of 
the Convertible 
Notes 
recognized 
during 
the year 
ended 
December 31, 
2021 
related 
to the 
 revaluation of the Convertible Notes 
upon conversion to equity. 
The 8.6 million change in 
fair value of SAFEs recognized 
during the 
 year 
ended December 
31, 2021 
related 
to insight 
into the 
pricing of 
Vaxxinity s 
next stock 
issuance at 
a higher 
valuation. 
The 0.2 
 million change in fair value of Series A-1 Warrants recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021 related to an increase in 
value 
 of the Series A-1 preferred stock. 

 In connection with the Reorganization, all outstanding Convertible Notes, 
SAFEs and Series A-1 Warrants 
were exchanged into shares 
 of Series A preferred 
stock, which were 
subsequently exchanged 
into shares of 
Class A common 
stock upon the 
closing of the 
IPO in 
 November 2021 as described in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements 
included elsewhere in this Report. 

98 
 (Gain) Loss on Foreign Currency Translation, Net 

 The 
net 
gain 
(loss) 
of 
foreign 
currency 
translation 
reflects 
de 
minimis 
fluctuations 
in 
the 
foreign 
exchange 
rate 
for 
the 
year 
ended 
 December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 

 We have generated limited 
revenue from sales of our ELISA tests and have not yet obtained regulatory approval for or commercialized 
 any 
of 
our 
product 
candidates, 
which 
are 
in 
various 
phases 
of 
pre-clinical 
and 
clinical 
development. 
We 
have 
financed 
operations 
 primarily through the issuance 
of common stock, convertible 
preferred stock, borrowings under 
promissory notes (including Convertible 
 Notes) and the execution of SAFEs. Through December 31, 2022, we received gross proceeds of 306.4 
million in connection with the 
 issuance of various financial instruments, including 
the sale of preferred and 
common stock, the issuance of 
promissory notes (including 
 Convertible Notes), and the execution of SAFEs. In addition, 
we also generated revenue from the sale of an 
option to negotiate a license 
 with UNS (which 
option has expired) 
and the sales of 
ELISA tests in 2020 
and 2021. At December 
31, 2022, we had 
 33.5 million in 
 cash 
and 
cash 
equivalents, 
 53.4 
million 
of 
short-term 
investments, 
and 
a 
 1.1 
million 
restricted 
cash 
balance, 
compared 
to 
 145.1 
 million as of 
December 31, 2021. The 
decrease in cash 
and cash equivalents 
balances for the periods 
reported are primarily 
due to the 
 factors described under Cash Flows below.

 Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 55.9 million, primarily due to a 75.2 million net loss, 
 offset by a favorable 9.8 million change in operating assets and liabilities and total non-cash items of 9.5 million. The favorable 
cash 
 flow impact from changes 
in net operating assets and 
liabilities was primarily due to 
 9.0 million related to 
accrued expense, accounts 
 payable and 
other liabilities 
and 3.3 
million in 
prepaid expenses 
for UB-612 
production, partially 
offset by 
 2.4 million 
in amounts 
 due to related parties. The primary non-cash adjustments to 
net loss included addbacks of 8.7 million of 
stock-based compensation and 
 1.7 million in depreciation, 
offset by a reduction of 1.0 million for amortization of discounts on 
short-term investments. 
 Net cash 
used in 
operating activities 
for the 
year ended 
December 31, 2021 
was 81.0 
million, primarily 
due to 
a 137.2 
million net 
 loss, offset 
by a favorable 
 12.9 million 
change in 
operating assets and 
liabilities and 
total non-cash 
items of 43.3 
million. The cash 
 flow impact from changes in net operating assets and liabilities were primarily due to 11.4 million in amounts due to related parties as 
 well as 
 3.9 million 
related to accrued 
expense, accounts 
payable and 
other liabilities. 
These increases 
were offset 
by 4.7 
million in 
 prepaid expenses 
for UB-612 
production. The 
primary non-cash 
adjustments to 
net loss 
included an 
 11.2 
million change 
in the 
fair 
 market value of financial instruments as well as 30.4 
million of stock-based compensation and 1.1 million in depreciation. 

99 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in 
investing activities totaled 54.4 
million for the year 
ended December 31, 2022. 
The cash used in 
investing activities 
 consisted primarily of the net impact of the acquisition and redemption of short-term investments, and the acquisition 
of laboratory and 
 computer equipment, and leasehold improvements. 

 Net cash 
used in 
investing activities 
totaled 1.3 
million for 
the year 
ended December 31, 
2021. The 
cash used 
in investing 
activities 
 consisted primarily of the acquisition of equipment. 

 Financing Activities 
 Net cash 
used by 
financing activities 
was 0.2 
million for 
the year ended 
December 31, 2022. 
We 
repaid 0.4 
million in relation 
to a 
 note payable and received 0.3 million from the exercise of stock options. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities totaled 196.2 million for the 
year ended December 31, 2021. We raised capital to support our 
 operations 
through 
the 
issuance of 
Class A 
common 
stock in 
the 
IPO, 
with net 
proceeds of 
 71.1 
million, 
the 
issuance prior 
to the 
 Reorganization of SAFEs and 
Convertible Notes, with net 
proceeds of 2.9 
million and 2.0 
million, respectively, 
as well as 
the issuance 
 of Series 
B convertible 
preferred stock, 
with net 
proceeds of 
 122.8 million. 
We 
also repaid 
 2.0 million 
in relation 
to a Convertible 
 Note, 0.1 million in relation to a note payable with 
related party, 0.3 million in repayment for Paycheck Protection Program, and 0.4 
 million in relation to a note payable entered into for the acquisition of an airplane. 
 Funding Requirements 
 We 
have generated 
approximately 3.7 
million in revenue 
since inception 
and have 
incurred net 
losses in each 
reporting period 
since 
 inception. We 
do not expect to 
generate any meaningful 
revenue unless and 
until we obtain regulatory 
approval of and 
commercialize 
 our product 
candidates, 
or enter 
into collaboration 
or licensing 
deals with 
one or more 
third-party strategic 
partners. We 
do not 
know 
 when, or if, this will occur. If we do not receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, or if we receive approval but our 
 commercialization results 
fall short of 
our expectations, we 
will continue 
to incur significant 
losses for the 
foreseeable future, 
and we 
 expect the losses to increase as we continue the development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates and begin to 
 commercialize any approved products.
 As of the date of this Annual Report, we expect our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses 
 over the next 12 months. As of December 31, 2022, other than our 2025 
Note and the 2022 Promissory Note, we have no material debt 
 obligations.
 We have 
based our projections of operating capital 
requirements on assumptions that may 
prove to be incorrect, and we may 
use all of 
 our available capital resources sooner than we expect. Our future capital 
requirements will depend on many factors, which include: 
 
 the scope, number, progress, initiation, 
duration, cost, results and timing of pre-clinical programs and nonclinical 
studies of 
 our current or future product candidates; 
 
 the outcomes and timing of regulatory reviews, approvals or othe 
r 
actions; 
 
 the timing and manner in which we manufacture our pre-clinical and clinical 
drug material, the terms on which we can have 
 such manufacturing completed, and the extent to which we undertake commercialization 
of any drug products, if approved; 
 
 the extent to which we establish sales, marketing, medical affairs 
and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any product 
 candidates; 
 
 the timing and extent to which we expand our operational, financial and management 
systems and infrastructure, and 
 facilities; 

the timing and extent to which we increase our personnel to support operations, 
including necessary increases in headcount to 
 conduct and expand our clinical trials, commercialize any approved products and support 
our operations as a public 
 company; 
 
 the number of patent applications we must file and claims we must defend in order 
to maintain, expand and protect our 
 intellectual property portfolio, and the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting 
patent applications, maintaining and 
 protecting 
our intellectual property rights; 
 
 our ability to obtain marketing approval for our product candidates; 

100 
 
 our ability to establish and maintain additional licensing, collaboration or 
similar arrangements on favorable terms and 
 whether and to what extent we retain development or commercialization responsibilities 
under any new licensing, 
 collaboration or similar arrangement; 
 
 the success of any other business, product or technology that we acquire or in 
which we invest; 

our ability to maintain, expand and defend the scope of our intellectual property 
portfolio; 
 
 the current and potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our 
business; 

the costs of acquiring, licensing or investing in businesses, product candidates 
and technologies; 

market acceptance of our product candidates, to the extent any are approved for 
commercial sale; and 

the effect of competing technological and market developments. 
 Until such time, if ever, as we 
can generate positive cash flows from operations, 
we expect to finance our cash needs through public 
or 
 private equity offerings, strategic collaborations and debt financing. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale 
of our 
 Class A common 
stock, convertible securities or 
other equity securities, 
shareholders ownership interest 
will be diluted and 
the terms 
 of these securities 
could include liquidation 
or other preferences 
and anti-dilution protections. 
In addition, debt 
financing, if available, 
 may 
result in 
fixed 
payment 
obligations 
and 
may 
involve agreements 
that include 
restrictive 
covenants 
that limit 
our 
ability to 
take 
 specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, creating liens, redeeming shares or declaring dividends. 
 If we raise additional 
funds through strategic collaborations 
or marketing, distribution 
or licensing arrangements 
with third parties, we 
 may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, 
future revenue streams or product candidates or grant licenses on 
terms that 
 may 
not 
be 
favorable 
to 
us. 
If 
we 
are 
unable 
to 
raise 
additional 
funds 
when 
needed, 
we 
may 
be 
required 
to 
delay, 
limit, 
reduce 
or 
 terminate our product 
candidate development or 
future commercialization efforts 
or grant rights to 
third parties to develop 
and market 
 product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market 
ourselves. 

 Contract Research and Manufacturing Organizations 
 We 
recorded accrued 
expenses of 
 4.3 million 
and 4.5 
million in our 
balance sheet 
for expenditures 
incurred by 
CROs and 
contract 
 manufacturers as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

 Tax 
-Related Obligations 
 We have reserved 0.7 million of unrecognized 
tax benefits against NOLs. 
Additionally, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, 
we accrued 
 0.2 million and 0.2 million, respectively, 
in interest and penalties related to prior year tax filings. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We did not have during the periods presented, and do not 
currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in 
the rules and 
 regulations of the SEC. 

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements 
in accordance with GAAP requires 
management to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect 
 the amounts 
reported in 
our consolidated 
financial statements 
and accompanying 
notes. Management 
bases its estimates 
on historical 
 experience, market and other conditions, and various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based 
 on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact us in the future, the estimation process is, by its nature, 
 uncertain given that 
estimates depend on 
events over which 
we may not 
have control. In 
addition, if our 
assumptions change, we 
may 
 need to revise 
our estimates, or 
take other corrective 
actions, either of 
which may also 
have a 
material effect on 
our consolidated financial 
 statements. Significant estimates contained 
within these consolidated financial 
statements include, but are 
not limited to, the estimated 
 fair 
value 
of 
our 
common 
stock, 
convertible 
notes 
payable 
and 
SAFEs, 
stock-based 
compensation, 
warrant 
liabilities, 
income 
tax 
 valuation 
allowance and 
the accruals 
of research 
and development 
expenses. We 
base our 
estimates on 
historical experience, 
known 
 trends and other market-specific or other 
relevant factors that we 
believe to be reasonable under the 
circumstances. On an ongoing basis, 
 management evaluates its estimates, 
as there are changes in facts 
and circumstances. If market 
and other conditions change from 
those 
 that we anticipate, our consolidated financial statements may be materially 
affected. 
 While our 
significant accounting 
policies are 
described in 
more detail 
in the 
notes to 
our consolidated 
financial statements 
appearing 
 elsewhere in this 
Annual Report, we believe 
that the following 
critical accounting policies and 
estimates have a 
higher degree of inherent 
 uncertainty and require our most significant judgments. 

101 
 Accrued Research and Development Expenses
 As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, 
we are required to estimate accrued research and development 
 expenses. 
As we 
advance 
our 
programs, 
we 
anticipate 
more 
complex 
clinical 
studies 
resulting 
in 
greater 
research 
and development 
 expenses, which will 
place even greater emphasis 
on the accrual. This 
process involves reviewing 
open contracts and purchase 
orders, 
 communicating with 
our applicable 
personnel to 
identify services 
that have 
been performed 
on our 
behalf and 
estimating the 
level of 
 service performed 
and the associated 
cost incurred for 
the service when 
we have not 
yet been invoiced 
or otherwise notified 
of actual 
 costs. In the past years, UBI and its affiliated companies performed and administered a significant amount of research and development 
 work on our 
behalf. 
Having UBI and 
its affiliated 
company act as 
intermediaries added 
to the complexity 
of determining appropriate 
 accruals, 
and 
we have 
largely moved 
away from 
this model. 
Certain accruals 
and 
amounts owed 
to the 
UBI entities 
are still 
under 
 review, and these amounts may 
change as a result of this review. 
 The 
majority 
of 
our 
service 
providers 
invoice 
in 
arrears 
for 
services 
performed, 
on 
a 
pre-determined 
schedule 
or 
when 
contractual 
 milestones are met; however, some require advance payments. We 
make estimates of accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in 
 the consolidated financial statements 
based on facts and circumstances 
known to us at that 
time. We 
periodically confirm the accuracy 
 of the estimates with 
the service providers and 
make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated 
accrued research and development 
 expenses include fees paid to: 
 
 vendors, including research laboratories, in connection with pre-clinical 
development activities; 
 
 CROs and investigative sites in connection with pre-clinical studies and 
clinical trials; and 
 
 contract manufacturers in connection with drug substance and drug 
product formulation of pre-clinical studies and clinical 
 trial materials. 
 We 
base our 
expenses related 
to pre-clinical 
studies and 
clinical trials 
on our 
estimates of 
the services 
received and 
efforts expended 
 pursuant to quotes and contracts with multiple 
research institutions and CROs that supply, conduct and manage 
pre-clinical studies and 
 clinical trials on our behalf. 
The financial terms of these 
agreements are subject to negotiation, 
vary from contract to 
contract and may 
 result 
in 
uneven 
payment 
flows. 
There 
may 
be 
instances 
in 
which 
payments 
made 
to 
our 
vendors 
will 
exceed 
the 
level 
of 
services 
 provided and result 
in a prepayment 
of the expense. 
Payments under some 
of these contracts 
depend on factors 
such as the 
successful 
 enrollment of patients 
and the completion of 
clinical trial milestones. In 
accruing service fees, we 
estimate the time period 
over which 
 services will be performed 
and the level of 
effort to be 
expended in each period. 
If the actual timing 
of the performance of 
services or 
 the level 
of effort 
varies from 
the estimate, 
it adjusts 
the accrual 
or the 
prepaid expense 
accordingly. 
Although we 
do not 
expect our 
 estimates to 
be materially 
different from 
amounts actually 
incurred, our 
understanding of 
the status 
and timing 
of services performed 
 relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts 
that are too high or too low 
 in any particular period. To 
date, our estimated accruals have not differed materially from actual costs incurred 
. 
 Stock-Based Compensation
 We measure all stock-based awards granted to employees, directors and non-employees based on their fair 
value on the date of the 
grant 
 and recognize the corresponding compensation expense of those awards over the requisite service period, which is 
generally the vesting 
 period of the respective award. 
Forfeitures are accounted for as 
they occur. 
We grant 
stock options and restricted stock 
awards that are 
 subject to service vesting conditions. 
 We 
classify stock-based 
compensation 
expense in 
our consolidated 
statements of 
operations in 
the same 
manner in 
which the 
award 
 recipient s payroll costs are classified 
or in which the award recipient s 
service payments are classified. 
 We estimate the fair value of each stock 
option grant using the Black-Scholes 
option-pricing model, which requires the use 
of subjective 
 assumptions 
that 
could 
materially 
impact 
the 
estimation 
of 
fair 
value 
and 
related 
compensation 
expense 
to 
be 
recognized. 
These 
 assumptions include (i) the expected volatility of our stock 
price, (ii) the periods of time over 
which recipients are expected to hold their 
 options prior to exercise (expected lives), (iii) expected dividend yield on our common stock, and (iv) risk-free interest rates, which 
are 
 based 
on 
quoted 
U.S. 
Treasury 
rates 
for 
securities 
with 
maturities 
approximating 
the 
options 
expected 
lives. 
Developing 
these 
 assumptions requires the use of judgment. Both prior to and after the IPO, we lacked company-specific historical and implied 
volatility 
 information. 
Therefore, 
we 
estimate 
our 
expected 
stock 
volatility 
based 
on 
the 
historical 
volatility 
of 
a 
publicly 
traded 
set 
of 
peer 
 companies. The expected term of the Company s options has been determined 
utilizing the simplified method for awards that qualify 
 as plain-vanilla options. The expected term of options granted to non-employees 
is equal to the contractual term of the option award. 
 The expected dividend yield is 
zero as we have 
never paid dividends and do 
not currently anticipate paying any 
in the foreseeable future. 
 Determination of the Fair Value 
of Common Stock
 Before there was a public market for our common stock, the estimated fair value of common stock was determined by its most recently 
 available third-party valuations of 
common stock. These third-party 
valuations were performed in 
accordance with the 
guidance outlined 

102 
 in 
the 
American 
Institute 
of Certified 
Public 
Accountants 
Accounting 
and 
Valuation 
Guide, 
Valuation 
of Privately 
-Held-Company 
 Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. Our common stock valuations 
were prepared using an option pricing method OPM ). The 
 OPM treats common stock and preferred stock as call options on 
the total equity value of a company, 
with exercise prices based on the 
 value thresholds at which the allocation among the various holders 
of a company s securities changes. Under 
this method, the common 
 stock 
has 
value 
only 
if 
the 
funds 
available 
for 
distribution 
to 
stockholders 
exceeded 
the 
value 
of 
the 
preferred 
stock 
liquidation 
 preferences at the 
time of the 
liquidity event, 
such as a 
strategic sale or 
a merger. 
A discount for 
lack of marketability 
of the common 
 stock is then applied to arrive at an indication of value for the common stock. 

 In addition to considering the 
results of these third-party 
valuations, our board of directors 
considered various objective and 
subjective 
 factors to determine the fair value of our common stock as of each grant date, including: 
 
 the prices at which we sold shares of preferred stock and the superior rights and preferences 
of the preferred stock relative to 
 our common stock at the time of each grant; 
 
 the progress of our research and development programs, including the status and 
results of pre-clinical studies and clinical 
 trials for our product candidates; 
 
 our stage of development and commercialization and our business strategy; 
 
 external market conditions affecting the biopharmaceutical 
industry and trends within the biopharmaceutical industry; 
 
 our financial position, including cash on hand, and our historical and forecasted 
performance and results of operations; 
 
 the lack of an active public market for our common stock and our preferred 
stock; 
 
 the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering 
or our sale in light of prevailing market 
 conditions; and 
 
 the analysis of initial public offerings and the market performance 
of similar companies in the biopharmaceutical industry. 
 The assumptions 
underlying these 
valuations represented 
management s 
best estimate, 
which involved 
inherent uncertainties 
and the 
 application of management s judgment. As a result, if we had used significantly different assumptions or estimates, the fair value of our 
 common stock and our stock-based compensation expense could 
have been materially different. 
 Once a public trading 
market for our common 
stock has been established 
for a sufficient 
period of time, it 
will no longer be 
necessary 
 to estimate the fair 
value of our 
common stock in 
connection with our 
accounting for granted 
stock options and 
other such awards 
we 
 may grant, as the fair value of our common stock will be determined based on 
the quoted market price of our common stock.

 Simple Agreement for Future 
Equity 
 During the year ended December 31, 2021, we entered into SAFEs. The SAFEs 
were not mandatorily redeemable, nor did they require 
 us 
to 
repurchase 
a 
fixed 
number 
of 
shares. 
We 
determined 
that 
the 
SAFEs 
contained 
a 
liquidity 
event 
provision 
that 
embodied 
an 
 obligation indexed to the fair value of the equity shares and 
could require us to settle the SAFE obligation by transferring assets 
or cash. 
 Our SAFEs represented 
a recurring measurement that 
is classified within Level 
3, discussed and defined 
in Note 2 to our 
consolidated 
 financial 
statements 
included 
elsewhere 
in 
this 
Report, 
of 
the 
fair 
value 
hierarchy 
wherein 
fair 
value 
is 
estimated 
using 
significant 
 unobservable inputs, including 
an estimate of the 
number of months to 
a liquidity event, volatility 
rates and the estimation 
of the most 
 likely conversion feature for converting the SAFE. 
 The fair value of the SAFEs 
on the date of issuance was 
determined to equal the proceeds we 
received. The value of the SAFEs 
on the 
 date of conversion 
into Series A 
preferred stock 
was determined to 
be equal to 
the fair value 
of the Series 
A preferred 
stock issued in 
 connection with the Reorganization. 
 Convertible Notes
 Beginning in 2018, we issued Convertible Notes that 
bore simple interest at annual rates 
ranging from 4.8 to 6 . All 
unpaid principal, 
 together with 
the accrued 
interest thereon, 
for the 
Convertible Notes 
were payable 
upon the 
event of 
default or 
upon maturity, 
which 
 ranged from one to three years. The Convertible Notes contained a number of 
provisions addressing automatic and optional conversion, 
 events 
of 
default 
and 
prepayment 
provisions. 
We 
determined 
that 
a 
portion 
of 
the 
Convertible 
Notes 
contained 
a 
liquidity 
event 
 provision, requiring them 
to be measured and 
accounted for at fair 
value at each 
reporting date. We 
determined the Convertible 
Notes 
 requiring a measurement to fair value represented 
a recurring measurement that was classified within Level 3, disclosed 
and defined in 
 Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, of the fair value hierarchy 
wherein fair value 
 is estimated using significant unobservable inputs. 

104 
 Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness CEPI Grant
 In April 2022, we entered into an agreement with the Coalition for Epidemic 
Preparedness Innovations CEPI whereby CEPI 
 agreed to provide funding of up to 9.3 million to co-fund a Phase 3 clinical trial of 
our UB-612 COVID-19 vaccine candidate as a 
 heterologous or mix-and-match booster dose. The Phase 3 trial, which began 
in early 2022, is evaluating the ability of UB-612 to 
 boost COVID-19 immunity against the original strain and multiple variants 
of concern including Omicron - in people aged 16 years or 
 older, who have been previously immunized 
with an authorized COVID-19 vaccine. 
 We will also be performing 
further manufacturing scale-up work to enable readiness for potential commercialization. 
Under the terms 
 of the agreement with CEPI, if successful, a portion of the released doses of the commercial 
product will be delivered to the COVID-
 19 Vaccines 
Global Access COVAX 
consortium for distribution to developing countries at low cost. 
 Cash payments received in advance under the CEPI Funding Agreement are restricted as to their use until expenditures contemplated in 
 the funding agreement are incurred. As funds are received they are included within restricted cash offset 
by a corresponding short-term 
 accrued liability. 
We 
recognize payments 
from CEPI 
as a 
reduction of 
research and 
development expenses, 
in the 
same period 
as the 
 expenses that the grant is intended to reimburse are incurred. 
 Taiwan 
Centers for Disease Control Grant 
 UBIA, which is responsible for applying for 
and managing grants on our behalf, was 
awarded a grant by the Taiwan Centers for Disease 
 Control TCDC for COVID-19 
vaccine development. The 
grant provides that costs 
incurred to complete the 
two phases of 
the clinical 
 trial will be reimbursed 
based on the achievement 
of certain milestones as 
defined in the agreement. 
We 
are entitled to reimbursement 
 under the TCDC 
grant. At each 
reporting date, 
we assess the 
status of all 
of the activities 
involved in 
completing the 
clinical study 
in 
 relation 
to 
the 
milestones. 
We 
account 
for 
the 
amounts 
that 
have 
been 
received 
from 
the TCDC 
to 
reimburse 
costs 
incurred 
on 
the 
 clinical study 
and not 
expected to 
be refunded 
back to 
the TCDC 
as contra 
research and 
development expenses 
in the 
accompanying 
 consolidated statements of operations. 
 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About 
Market Risk. 
 
 We 
are exposed 
to market 
risk in 
the ordinary 
course of 
our business. 
These risks 
primarily relate 
to foreign 
currency, 
inflation and 
 changes in interest rates. 

 Inflation Risk 
 Inflation generally 
may affect 
us by increasing 
our cost of 
labor, clinical 
trial costs, and 
other outsourced 
activities. To 
date, inflation 
 has not had a material impact on our business, but if 
the global inflationary trends continue, we expect appreciable 
increases in clinical 
 trial, 
selling, 
labor, 
and 
other 
operating 
costs. 
If 
our 
costs 
were 
to 
become 
subject 
to 
significant 
inflationary 
pressures, 
this 
would 
 adversely affect our business, financial condition 
and results of operations. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange 
Risk 

 We 
have 
limited 
exposure 
to 
foreign 
currency 
exchange 
risk 
as 
most 
of 
our 
operating 
activities 
are 
primarily 
denominated 
in 
U.S. 
 dollars. We believe actual foreign 
exchange gains and 
losses did not 
have a significant 
impact on our 
results of operations 
for any periods 
 presented herein. The results of the analysis based on our financial position as of December 31, 2022, indicated that a hypothetical 10 
 increase or decrease in applicable foreign currency exchange rates would not 
have a material effect on our financial results. 
 Interest Rate Risk 

 We 
are exposed to 
market risk related 
to changes in 
interest rates. As 
of December 31, 
2022 and 2021, 
our cash equivalents 
consisted 
 of 
interest-bearing 
checking 
accounts 
and 
money 
market 
accounts. 
We 
issued 
Convertible 
Notes, 
which 
Convertible 
Notes 
were 
 exchanged for Series A preferred stock in connection with the Reorganization. The Convertible Notes bore simple interest at the annual 
 rates ranging from 
4.8 to 6 , with 
redemption terms payable 
at the earlier 
of one year, 
or upon the 
event of default. In 
addition, the 
 Convertible Notes contained provisions addressing automatic and optional 
conversion. Given the redemption of the Convertible Notes, 
 and the short-term nature and fixed interest rate, we believe there 
is no material exposure to interest rate risk. The 
2025 Note we entered 
 into for the year ended December 
31, 2020 bears a fixed annual 
interest rate of 3.4 and matures 
in June 2025. Additionally, 
the 2022 
 Promissory Note we 
entered into for the 
year ended December 31, 
2022 bears a 
fixed annual interest 
rate of 7.0 
and matures in 
October 
 2026. Given that 
the 2025 Note 
and the 2022 
Promissory Note bear 
fixed rates of 
interest, we believe 
there is no 
material exposure to 
 interest rate risk. The results 
of the analysis based on our 
financial position as of December 31, 
2022, indicated that a hypothetical 
100 
 basis point increase or decrease in risk-free rates would not have a material 
effect on our financial results. 

105 
 Our measurement of 
interest rate risk involves 
assumptions that are 
inherently uncertain and, 
as a result, cannot 
precisely estimate the 
 impact of 
changes in interest 
rates on net 
interest revenues. 
Actual results may 
differ from 
simulated results due 
to balance 
growth or 
 decline and 
the timing, 
magnitude, and 
frequency of 
interest rate 
changes, as 
well as 
changes in 
market conditions 
and management 
 strategies, including changes in asset and liability mix.

our audits in accordance with the 
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require 
that we plan and perform the audits 
 to obtain 
reasonable assurance 
about whether 
the consolidated 
financial statements 
are free 
of material 
misstatement, whether 
due to 
 error or 
fraud. The 
Company is 
not required 
to have, 
nor were 
we engaged 
to perform, 
an audit 
of its 
internal control 
over financial 
 reporting. As part 
of our 
audits, we are 
required to 
obtain an 
understanding of 
internal control 
over financial 
reporting but 
not for 
the 
 purpose 
of 
expressing 
an 
opinion 
on 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
Company s 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting. 
Accordingly, 
we 
 express no such opinion. 
 Our audits 
of the consolidated 
financial statements 
included performing procedures 
to assess the 
risks of material 
misstatement of 
the 
 consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or 
fraud, and performing procedures that respond 
to those risks. Such procedures 
 included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding 
the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. 
Our audit 
 also included evaluating the accounting principles 
used and significant estimates made 
by management, as well as 
evaluating the overall 
 presentation 
of 
the 
consolidated 
financial 
statements. 
Our 
audit 
also 
included 
performing 
such 
other 
procedures 
as 
we 
considered 
 necessary in the circumstances. We 
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 We have served 
as the Company s auditor since 2018.

 Initial Public Offering
 On November 15, 2021, the Company closed its IPO of 

shares of Class A common stock at a public offering price of 
 
 per share. On 
November 18, 2021 
the Company held 
a subsequent closing for 
the issuance of an 
additional 

shares of Class A 
 common stock pursuant 
to a 
30-day option granted 
to the 
underwriters to purchase 
up to an 
additional 

shares of Class 
A common 
 stock at 
the IPO 
price, less 
underwriting 
discounts and 
commissions. The 
aggregate net 
proceeds to 
the Company 
from the 
offering, 
 after deducting underwriting discounts 
and commissions and 
other offering expenses payable 
by the Company, was approximately 

million. Upon the closing 
of the IPO, all previously 
outstanding shares of the Company s 
redeemable convertible preferred 
stock were 
 automatically converted at the same ratio used for the Stock Split (1-for- into shares of its Class A common stock. 
 Liquidity 
 As of 
December 31, 2022, 
the Company 
had 

million of 
highly liquid 
assets to fund 
operations, including 

million of 
cash 
 and 
cash 
equivalents, 

million 
of 
short-term 
investments, 
and 
a 

million 
restricted 
cash 
balance 
of 
which 

million 
is 
 restricted for the reimbursement of 
certain research and development expenses 
related to our UB-612 COVID-19 
vaccine program. To 
 date, the Company has primarily financed its operations through the 
sale of convertible preferred stock and common stock, borrowings 
 under promissory 
notes (including 
Convertible Notes), 
a portion of 
which has been 
raised from 
related party entities, 
and grants 
from 
 foundations 
such 
as 
the 
Coalition 
of 
Epidemic 
Preparedness 
Innovations 
(CEPI) 
and 
the 
Michael 
J. 
Fox 
Foundation 
(MJFF). 
The 
 Company has experienced 
significant negative cash flows 
from operations since inception, 
and incurred a net 
loss of 

million for 
 the year ended 
December 31, 2022. Net 
cash used in 
operating activities 
for the year 
ended December 31, 2022 
was 

million. In 
 addition, as of 
December 31, 2022, the 
Company has an 
accumulated deficit of 

million. The Company 
expects to incur 
substantial 
 operating 
losses 
and 
negative 
cash 
flows 
from 
operations 
for 
the 
foreseeable 
future. 
As 
of 
the 
date 
these 
financial 
statements 
were 
 available to 
be issued, 
the Company 
expects its existing 
cash and 
cash equivalents 
to be 
sufficient to 
fund its 
operating expenses 
and 
 capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. 
 Unless and 
until the 
Company is 
able to 
obtain regulatory 
approval for, 
and generate 
significant revenues 
from commercialization 
of 
 our product candidates, the 
Company will need to seek 
additional capital in order 
to continue to fund future 
research and development 
 activities. 
This 
may 
occur 
through 
strategic 
alliances, 
licensing 
arrangements, 
grants 
and/or 
future 
public 
or 
private 
debt 
or 
equity 
 financings. Additional funding may not be available on 
terms the Company finds acceptable or at 
all. If the Company is unable 
to obtain 
 sufficient 
capital to 
continue 
to advance 
its programs, 
the Company 
would be 
forced to 
delay, 
limit, reduce 
or terminate 
its product 
 development 
or 
future 
commercialization 
efforts 
or 
grant 
rights 
to 
third 
parties

 In November 2021, the 
Company replaced the Existing 2021 
Plan with the 2021 
Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (the 
 New 2021

the Existing 2021 
Plan and no 
further grants will 
be made under 
the Existing 
 2021 Plan. The following is a summary of certain terms and conditions of the 
New 2021 Plan. 
 At its 
inception in 
November 2021, 
the maximum 
number of 
shares of 
common stock 
that could 
be issued 
under the 
New 2021 
Plan 
 was 

shares of Class A equity. This number 
increases automatically on January 1 of each year, 
commencing January 1, 2023, 
 by the 
number of 
shares equal 
to the 
lesser of 
(i) 
 
 of 
the outstanding 
shares of 
the Company s 
common stock 
on the 
immediately 
 preceding December 31, (ii) the number of shares determined by the Compensation Committee, 
if any such determination is made, and 
 (iii) 
the 
number 
of

underlying 
any 
awards 
granted 
during 
the 
preceding 
calendar 
year, 
net 
of 
the 
shares 
underlying 
awards 
 canceled or forfeited under the New 2021 
Plan. On January 1, 2023, in accordance with 
the automatic evergreen provision of the New 
 2021 Plan, the maximum number of shares that can be issued under the 
plan was increased to 
 
 . 
 As of December 31, 
2022, 

shares were available 
for future grant. 
Shares issued under 
the New 2021 
Plan that are forfeited, 
 canceled, reacquired by the Company prior to vesting, satisfied without the issuance 
of stock, withheld to cover the exercise price or tax 
 withholdings, or 
otherwise terminated, 
other than by 
exercise, shall be 
added back 
to the shares 
available for 
issuance under 
the New 
 2021 Plan. 
 The exercise 
price for 
grants made 
pursuant to 
the terms 
of the 
New 2021 
Plan is 
determined in 
the applicable 
grant by 
the board 
of 
 directors. Any incentive options granted to persons 
possessing less than 10 of the total combined 
voting power of all classes of stock 
 may not have an exercise price of less than 100 of the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date. 
Any incentive options 
 granted to persons possessing more than 10 of the total combined 
voting power of all classes of stock may not have an exercise price 
 of less than 110 of the fair market value of 
the common stock on the grant date. 

 The option term for incentive awards 
may not be greater than ten years 
from the date of the grant. Incentive 
options granted to persons 
 possessing more than 
10 of the total 
combined voting power 
of all classes of 
stock may not 
have an option 
term of greater than 
five 
 years from the date of the grant. The vesting period for equity-based awards 
is determined at the discretion of the board of directors.

and similar state 
provisions. The 
 Company has not completed 
a study to 
assess whether an ownership 
change has occurred or 
whether there have been 
multiple ownership 
 changes since 
the Company s 
formation due 
to the 
complexity and 
cost associated 
with such 
a study, 
and the 
fact that 
there may 
be 
 additional ownership changes in the future. If 
the Company experienced an ownership change at 
any time since its formation, utilization 
 of the 
NOL or 
tax credit 
carryforwards to 
offset future 
taxable income 
and taxes, 
respectively, 
would be 
subject to 
annual limitation 
 under the Code. The annual 
limitation may result in 
the expiration of the NOL and 
credits before utilization. If impaired, 
the NOL and 
 credit carryforwards would be removed from the deferred tax asset schedule with a corresponding reduction in the valuation allowance. 
 On March 27, 2020, the President 
of the United States signed into law 
the CARES Act, which, along with 
earlier issued IRS guidance, 
 contains numerous 
provisions that 
may benefit 
the Company, 
including the 
deferral of 
certain taxes. 
The CARES 
Act did 
not have 
a 
 material impact on the Company s 
tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, which was enacted on December 
27, 2020, has expanded, extended, and clarified selected 
 CARES Act provisions, 
specifically on Paycheck Protection 
Program loan and Employee 
Retention Tax 
Credit, 100 deductibility 
of 
 business meals as well 
as other tax 
extenders. The Consolidated 
Appropriations Act did 
not have a material 
impact on the 
Company s 
 tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law on August 16, 2022. The IRA introduces a 15 corporate alternative minimum

 Michael J. Fox Foundation Grant

On November 3, 
2021, the Company 
was awarded a 
grant from the 
Michael J. Fox 
Foundation for Parkinson s 
Research MJFF in 
 the amount of 

million to be used 
in a project for 
the exploration of markers 
for target engagement 
in individuals immunized 
with 
 UB-312, an 
active 
 a
 -Synuclein immunotherapy. 
The Company 
will oversee

as 
well 
as

the 
binding 
properties 
of 
the

As 
funding 
is 
 expected to be 
utilized over a 
two-year period, as 
cash is 
received, the amount 
expected to the 
utilized within twelve 
months is 
recognized 
 to short-term 
restricted cash/deposits, 
with a 
corresponding short-term 
accrued liability, 
which is 
released as 
the related 
expenses are 
 offset. The Company recognizes 
payments from MJFF as a 
reduction of research and development 
expenses, in the same period 
as the 
 expenses that the 
grant is 
intended to 
reimburse are incurred. 
The remaining balance 
of cash 
received is recognized 
to long-term 
restricted 
 cash/deposits, with a 
corresponding long-term accrued liability. As 
of December 31, 2022, 
there was 

balance remaining in 
the accrued 
 liability related to this grant. For 
the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, 
the Company recognized 

million and less than 
 
 million, respectively, 
as a reduction of research and development expenses for amounts reimbursed through 
the grant. 
 Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations CEPI Grant 
 In April 
2022, the 
Company entered 
into an 
agreement with 
the Coalition 
for Epidemic 
Preparedness Innovations CEPI whereby 
 CEPI has 
agreed to 
provide 
funding of 
up to 

million to 
co-fund 
a Phase 
3 clinical 
trial of 
Vaxxinity s 
next generation 
UB-612 
 COVID-19 
vaccine 
candidate 
as 
a 
heterologous 
 
or 
 mix-and-match 
 
booster 
dose. 
The 
Phase 
3 
trial, 
which 
began 
in 
2022, 
is 
 evaluating the 
ability of 
UB-612 to 
boost COVID-19 
immunity against 
the original 
strain and 
multiple variants 
of concern 
including 
 Omicron - in people aged 16 years or older, who 
have been previously immunized with an authorized COVID-19 
vaccine. 
 The Company will also be performing further manufacturing scale-up 
work to enable readiness for potential commercialization. Under 
 the terms of the 
agreement with CEPI, if 
successful, a portion 
of the released doses 
of the commercial 
product will be delivered 
to the 
 COVID-19 Vaccines 
Global Access COVAX 
consortium for distribution to developing countries at low cost. 
 Cash payments received in advance under the CEPI Funding Agreement are restricted as to their use until expenditures contemplated in 
 the funding agreement are 
incurred. As funding is expected 
to be received in tranches 
over an eighteen month period, 
and the amounts 
 received in each tranche are expected to the utilized within twelve months, the funds received are reflected within restricted cash with a 
 corresponding short-term accrued liability. 
The Company recognizes payments from 
CEPI as a reduction of research 
and development 
 expenses, in the same period as the expenses that the grant is intended to reimburse are incurred. As of December 31, 2022, the balance 
 of the restricted cash and 
short-term accrued liability was 

million. For the year ended 
December 31, 2022, the Company recognized 
 a reduction of 

million of research and development expenses. 
 Lease Agreements

The Company has 

operating lease agreements for 
office and laboratory space. 
The Company is 
also required to 
pay certain operating 
 costs under its leases.

square feet of lab and office space with Space Florida in 
Exploration Park, 
 Florida commencing August 12, 
2022. The lease 
has an initial 
 one-year
 
term with an 
annual lease obligation of 

million, after Lessee 
 credits. Additionally, 
the lease requires the Company to provide a security deposit in the amount of less than 

million. 
 In April 2022, the 
Company entered into a 
facility lease agreement for 

square feet of office 
space in New York, 
New York. 
The 
 lease commenced in April 2022 
and will expire March 2029 with 
no option to renew. 
This lease and its terms were 
reviewed using the 
 guidance found in ASC 842. Since the lease has a non-cancellable period of 
 
 , and after the first year both the Company and the 
 landlord have the 
option to early 
terminate the lease 
for any or 
no reason, the 
Company has elected 
to apply the 
short-term expedient, 
 which does not subject the New York 
lease to capitalization. 

 Rent expense for each 
of the years 
ended December 31, 2022 and 
2021 amounted to 

million and less 
than 

million, respectively. 

 License Agreements
 In October 2014, the Company entered into a contribution agreement with 
UBI, whereby UBI contributed and assigned to the Company 
 assets and granted 
a non-exclusive license 
to certain technologies deemed 
necessary or reasonably 
useful in the 
utilization of the licensed 
 intellectual 
property. 
In consideration, 
the Company 
issued 

shares of 
common stock 
to UBI. 
The agreement 
allowed for 
 exploitation of all diagnostic, prophylactic, and therapeutic 
uses and indications in humans in 
the field of neurology. The agreement was 
 amended in 
August 2019 
to provide 
the Company 
with exclusivity 
(except as 
to UBI) 
in the 
field of 
neurology and 
the flexibility 
to 
 pursue indications outside the initial field limitations. 

 In connection with 
the amendment, the 
Company agreed to execute 
an exclusive, worldwide 
license agreement for 
any product that 
is 
 developed by the 
Company outside the original 
field. The terms and 
conditions are to be 
negotiated in good 
faith and mutually 
agreed 
 upon. The 
Company anticipates 
that if 
it is required 
to enter into 
an exclusive 
license agreement, 
it will be 
able to negotiate 
financial 
 terms for the license 
at prevailing market 
rates within the pharmaceutical 
industry. 
Accordingly, 
the Company may 
be required to pay 
 UBI upfront fees, revenue royalties, development milestones, commercial 
milestones, sublicense fees, and other related fees. 

 Vaxxinity s 
COVAXX 
subsidiary was 
formed in March 
2020 through 
a transfer of 
technology from 
UBI, UBI IP 
Holdings, and 
UBI 
 US Holdings, LLC, 
all related parties 
of the Company, 
whereby the Company, 
pursuant to an 
April 2020 license 
agreement, obtained 
 exclusive 
rights to 
intellectual 
property 
and 
technology 
related 
to the 
discovery 
of vaccines, 
diagnostic 
assays, 
and 
antigens 
for 
use 
 against all coronaviruses including, 
without limitation, SARS, 
MERS, and COVID-19 in 
all strains in 
humans. The license is 
worldwide, 
 perpetual, exclusive and fully paid-up. There are no future royalty or milestone 
payment obligations associated with the agreement. The 
 Company has the right to grant sublicenses. 

 The 
Company 
considered 
ASC 
805, 
 Business 
Combinations 
and 
ASC 
730, 
 Research 
and 
Development 
in 
determining 
how 
to 
 account for the 
issuance of common 
stock. The license 
agreement is considered 
to be a common 
control transfer; however, 
the related 
 party did not have any basis in the assets licensed, so there was no accounting impact for 
the Company. 

 In August 2021, 
Vaxxinity 
entered into a 
license agreement (the 
 Platform License 
Agreement with UBI 
and certain of 
its affiliates 
 that 
expanded 
intellectual 
property 
rights 
previously 
licensed 
under 
previously 
issued 
license 
agreements 
with 
UBI. 
As 
part 
of 
the 
 agreement, Vaxxinity 
obtained a worldwide, sublicensable 
(subject to certain conditions), perpetual, 
fully paid-up, royalty-free license 
 to 
research, 
develop, 
make, 
have 
made, 
utilize, 
import, 
export, 
market, 
distribute, 
offer 
for 
sale, 
sell, 
have 
sold, 
commercialize 
or 
 otherwise exploit peptide-based vaccines in the field of all human prophylactic and therapeutic uses, except for such vaccines related to 
 human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV), herpes 
simplex virus (HSE) 
and Immunoglobulin E 
(IgE). The patents 
and patent applications 
 licensed under the 
Platform License Agreement 
include claims directed 
to a CpG delivery 
system, artificial T 
helper cell epitopes 
and 
 certain designer 
peptides and 
proteins utilized 
in UB-612. 
As described 
above, in 
consideration for 
the Platform 
License Agreement, 
 the Company issued to UBI a warrant to purchase Class A common stock (the 
 UBI Warrant ). 

 The Company considered ASC 805, Business Combinations ASC 805 and ASC 730, 
 Research and Development ASC 730 
 in determining how to account 
for the issuance of the 
Class A common stock warrants. The 
Class A common stock warrants 
were issued 
 to a related party in exchange for a license agreement. 
The majority of the voting interests in the related party 
and that of the Company 
 were held 
by a 
group of 
immediate family 
members, at 
the time 
of the 
transaction, and 
as such the 
transaction constitutes 
a common 
 control transaction, 
which requires 
the license 
to be 
accounted for 
at the 
carrying value 
in the 
books of 
the transferor. 
As the 
related 
 party did not have any basis in the assets licensed, there was no accounting impact for 
the Company. 
 Indemnification Agreements 

 In the 
ordinary course 
of business, 
the Company 
may provide 
indemnification of 
varying scope 
and terms 
to employees, 
consultants, 
 vendors, lessors, 
business partners 
and other 
parties with 
respect to 
certain matters 
including, but

million in raw materials would 
 be needed to produce the initial 30kg of protein. An Authorization to Proceed (ATP) 
agreement authorized UBP to acquire the first 
 
 million of materials using an advance payment from Vaxxinity, 
pending execution of a final supply agreement between the parties. 
 Through August 2021, 

million of materials were ordered, 

million of materials were received by UBP and paid for with the 
 advance payment, and the Company expensed 

million as these raw materials were used to produce proteins. 
During 2022, 
 Vaxxinity 
recognized an additional 

million in expense related to the materials UBP had taken possession of but had not yet 
used 
 in production. 
 When Vaxxinity 
asked to pause further manufacture of protein upon rejection of the EUA by Taiwan 
in August 2021, UBP requested 
 that its suppliers cancel the remaining 

million in orders where it had not taken possession of the materials. In the fourth 
quarter of 
 2022, the Company learned that most of the suppliers refused to cancel 
the orders, although some agreed to seek other buyers for the 
 materials. For these orders, management has not yet concluded that 
a loss for Vaxxinity 
for this entire amount is probable, since they 
 were not originally authorized by the ATP, 
and UBP s suppliers may be able to dispose 
of some amount to other buyers. Hence, an 
 expense has not been recognized for them.

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, 
with the 
participation of 
our principal 
executive officer 
and principal 
financial officer, 
evaluated, as 
of and 
for the 
 year ended of the 
period covered by this 
Annual Report on Form 
10-K, the effectiveness 
of our disclosure 
controls and procedures (as 
 defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls 
and procedures, 
 management 
recognizes 
that 
any 
controls 
and 
procedures, 
no 
matter 
how 
well 
designed 
and 
operated, 
can 
provide 
only 
reasonable 
 assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, 
the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact 
 that there 
are resource 
constraints, and 
that management 
is required 
to apply 
judgment in 
evaluating the 
benefits of 
possible controls 
 and procedures relative to their costs. Based on management s 
evaluation our principal executive officer

 Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 The 
Company s 
management 
is responsible 
for 
establishing 
and 
maintaining 
adequate 
internal 
control over 
financial 
reporting. 
The 
 internal control process has been designed under management s supervision 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
 financial reporting and the 
preparation of the 
Company s consolidated financial statements for external 
reporting purposes in 
accordance 
 with U.S. GAAP. 
 Management conducted an 
assessment of 
the effectiveness of 
the Company s internal control 
over financial reporting 
as of 
December 31, 
 2022 utilizing 
the framework 
established in 
Internal Control 
 Integrated 
Framework (2013) 
issued by 
the Committee 
of Sponsoring 
 Organizations 
of 
the 
Treadway 
Commission 
(COSO). 
Based 
on 
this 
assessment, 
management 
has 
determined 
that 
the 
Company s 
 internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 
is effective. 
 The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that 
 accurately and 
fairly reflect, 
in reasonable 
detail, transactions 
and dispositions 
of assets; 
and provide 
reasonable assurances 
that: (1) 
 transactions are 
recorded as 
necessary to 
permit preparation 
of financial 
statements in 
accordance with 
U.S. GAAP; 
(2) receipts 
and 
 expenditures 
are 
being 
made 
only 
in 
accordance 
with 
authorizations 
of 
management 
and 
the 
directors 
of 
the 
Company; 
and 
(3) 
 unauthorized acquisition, use, 
or disposition of the 
Company s assets 
that could have a 
material effect on 
the Company s 
consolidated 
 financial statements are prevented or timely detected. 
 All internal 
control systems, 
no matter 
how well 
designed, have 
inherent limitations. 
Therefore, even 
those systems 
determined to 
be 
 effective can 
provide only 
reasonable assurance 
with respect 
to financial 
statement preparation 
and presentation. 
Also, projections 
of 
 any 
evaluation 
of effectiveness 
to future 
periods 
are subject 
to the 
risk that 
controls 
may 
become 
inadequate 
because of 
changes 
in 
 conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures 
may deteriorate. 
 This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm due to an 
 exemption established by the JOBS Act for emerging growth 
companies. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A material 
weakness is 
a deficiency, 
or combination 
of deficiencies, 
in internal 
control over 
financial reporting, 
such that 
there 
is a 
 reasonable 
possibility 
that 
a material 
misstatement 
of 
a 
company s 
annual and 
interim 
consolidated 
financial 
statements 
will not 
be 
 detected or prevented on a timely basis. 
 During 
2022, 
we 
invested 
resources 
to 
remediate 
the 
material 
weaknesses 
identified 
in 
the 
preparation 
of 
our 
audited 
consolidated 
 financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 and in the 
preparation of our unaudited consolidated financial statements for 
 the quarter ended March 31, 2022. These remediation activities involved 
the following: 
 
 hiring additional accounting 
personnel with the 
appropriate level of 
skill and experience 
for public company 
financial reporting; 
 
 designing and implementing a formal financial close process 
that includes multiple levels of reviews of accounting 
entries; and 
 
 supplementing our resources for evaluating and 
accounting for complex transactions and 
stock options through the use 
of third-
 party advisors. 
 Other 
than 
the 
measures 
described 
in 
 Remediation 
Measures 
above, 
there 
were 
no 
changes 
in 
our 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
 reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange 
Act) during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 
that have 
 materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially 
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
