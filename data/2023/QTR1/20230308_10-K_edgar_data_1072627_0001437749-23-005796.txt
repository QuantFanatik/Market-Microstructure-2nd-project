 Extended Warranty Products 
 
 Automotive 
 
 IWS, Geminus and PWI market and administer vehicle service agreements ("VSAs") and related products for new and used automobiles throughout the United States. IWS and PWI also market and administer VSAs for motorcycles and ATV s. A VSA is an agreement between the Company and the vehicle purchaser under which the Company agrees to replace or repair, for a specific term, designated vehicle parts in the event of a mechanical breakdown. VSAs supplement, or are in lieu of, manufacturers' warranties and provide a variety of extended coverage options. The cost of the VSA is a function of the contract term, coverage limits and type of vehicle. 

IWS serves as the administrator on all contracts it originates. VSA's range from one to seven years and/or 12,000 miles to 125,000 miles. The average term of a VSA is b etween four and five years. 

Geminus goes to market through its subsidiaries, Penn and Prime. Penn and Prime serve as the administrator on all contracts they originate and its VSAs range from three months to sixty months and/or 3,000 miles to 165,000 miles. Penn offers a limited product line of vehicle service agreements with unlimited miles offerings that have an average term of twelve to twenty-four months. 

PWI serves as the co ntract administrator and originator in all states, except for Alaska, Florida and Washington. In those states, PWI partners with American Auto Shield ("AAS") in a white label relationship where the VSAs are branded PWI, are originated and administered by AAS, with PWI generating fee income on every contract sold.

GAP generally covers a consumer's out-of-pocket amount, related to an automobile loan or lease, if the vehicle is stolen or damaged beyond repair. IWS, Geminus and PWI earn a commission when a consumer purchases a GAP certificate but do not take on any insurance risk. 
 
 Home 
 
 PWSC has two insured home warranty products: 

The primary product is designed for new home construction companies, and the warranty is issued to new home buyers. The warranty coverage is provided nationwide by a single, A+ rated insurance carrier. The warranty document is an agreement between the homebuilder and the purchaser of the home and includes specific tolerances related to covered defects and precise definitions of damages. Each damage category includes materials defect coverage for the first year, major systems coverage for the second year, and workmanship and structural coverage for years three through ten. The warranty enables certain damages to be resolved by the homebuilder without admitting fault or negligence, and the warranty offers an efficient method to resolve buyer complaints and avoid costly litigation through mediation and mandatory binding arbitration. 

The second insured warranty product is designed for existing homes and covers major systems and appliances. PWSC designs the product specifications, but the administration is conducted by an independent third party. PWSC is not a risk-taker on this product; instead, it leverages an independent, reputable insurance carrier. PWSC sells this product directly to consumers and through various other channels, such as credit unions, brokers, and property managers. 

PWSC also has an uninsured warranty administration services program. The warranty document issued through this program is an agreement between the homebuilder and the purchaser of the home, and it includes performance standards established by the homebuilder and warrants conditions in the home that could constitute a construction defect throughout the warranty period. This program enables construction defects to be efficiently and amicably resolved by the homebuilder through mediation and mandatory binding arbitration to avoid costly litigation. Claims are covered for a period of time as may be required by law, for an elected time-frame by the builder in a specific state, or per agreement with a general liability insurance carrier. The warranty document is designed to ensure all parties interests are aligned in order to handle their claims relative to construction defects promptly and without attorney intervention.

HVAC 
 
 Trinity sells HVAC, standby generator, commercial LED lighting and commercial refrigeration warranty products. As a seller of warranty products, Trinity markets and administers product warranty contracts for certain new and used products in the HVAC, standby generator, commercial LED lighting and commercial refrigeration industries throughout the United States. Trinity acts as an agent on behalf of the third-party insurance companies that underwrite and guaranty these warranty contracts.

 Trinity also provides equipment breakdown and maintenance support services to companies across the United States. As a provider of such services, Trinity acts as a single point of contact to its clients for both certain equipment breakdowns and scheduled maintenance of equipment. Trinity will provide such repair and breakdown services by contracting with certain HVAC providers. 
 
 Marketing, Distribution and Competition 
 
 No Extended Warranty customer or group of affiliated customers accounts for 10 or more of the Company's consolidated revenues, and no loss of a customer or group of affiliated customers would have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
 
 Automotive 
 
 IWS markets its products primarily through credit unions. IWS enters into an exclusive agreement with each credit union whereby the credit union receives a stipulated access fee for each vehicle service agreement issued to its members. The credit unions are served by IWS employee representatives located throughout the United States in close geographical proximity to the credit unions they serve. IWS distributes and markets its product s in 25 states and the District of Columbia. 
 
 IWS focuses exclusively on the automotive finance market with its core VSA and related product offerings, while much of its competition in the credit union channel has a less targeted product approach. IWS' typical competitor takes a generalist approach to market by providing credit unions with a variety of different product offerings. They might be unable to deliver specialty expertise on par with IWS and may not give VSA products the attention they require for healthy profitability and strong risk management. 
 
 Geminus goes to market through its subsidiaries, Penn and Prime, which market their products primarily through independent automotive dealerships and franchise automotive dealerships. Penn and Prime enter into dealer wholesale agreements that allow the dealer to resell Penn and Prime vehicle service agreements at a retail rate that varies by state as they earn potential commission on the remarketing. The dealer base is serviced by the Company's employees located throughout the United States in close geographical proximity to the dealers they serve. Penn and Prime distribute and market their products in 39 and 40 states, respectively. 
 
 Penn and Prime focus exclusively on the automotive finance market with its core VSA and related product offerings, while much of its competition is non-employee based or agent centric. Penn and Prime's typical competitor s approach to market is by working through non-employees or agents with a variety of different product offerings. Penn and Prime solely focuses on the suite of VSAs it offers, which allows the proper attention required for healthy profitability and risk management. 
 
 PWI markets, sells and administers VSAs to used car buyers in all fifty states, primarily through a network of approved automobile dealer partners. PWI enters into an agreement with dealer partners that permits dealers to legally sell PWI products to its customers. The distribution of PWI VSAs is supported by an internal sales team geographically located around the country and in close proximity to its dealer partners. 
 
 PWI operates exclusively in the automotive finance market with its sole focus on VSAs. PWI does operate within a highly competitive environment where product pricing and product options are important. Most of its competitors have a comprehensive menu of products and services to offer the independent and franchise dealers. PWI s future strategy will drive additional competitiveness by adding new products to its existing menu of VSAs and GAP. PWI s competitors are a blend of national and regional competitors implementing employee and agent-based sales models. 
 
 Home 
 
 PWSC markets its insured warranty products through a sales force directly to the homebuilder and its uninsured builder backed warranty products through a network of construction general liability insurance carriers and domestic insurance brokers. Homebuilder prospects are developed through membership in local homebuilder associations, attendance at homebuilder conventions, distribution of promotional products and direct mail efforts. For its uninsured homebuilder backed product, PWSC dedicates senior personnel to working with the construction general liability insurers and domestic insurance brokers to identify and assist in developing new opportunities and devotes marketing resources to sell its product. 
 
 For its insured warranty product, PWSC operates in an environment with several competitors. PWSC differentiates itself through its relationship with and backing by an A+ rated global insurance carrier; having over 20 years of experience in the field of new home warranty administration; its dispute resolution services; and its best in class customer service. For its uninsured builder backed product, PWSC operates in an environment with very few competitors. The most significant features differentiating the builder backed product from its competition are an express warranty for all construction defects, the only warranty that is fully integrated with the general liability policy in its definition and coverage of construction defects, and mutual agreement between the homebuilder and the home buyer that all claims be resolved through mediation or, if necessary, binding arbitration.

HVAC 
 
 Trinity directly markets and distributes its warranty products to manufacturers, distributors and installers of HVAC, standby generator, commercial LED lighting and commercial refrigeration equipment. As a provider of equipment breakdown and maintenance support, Trinity directly markets and distributes its product through its clients, which are primarily companies that directly own and operate numerous locations across the United States. 
 
 Trinity operates in an environment with few market competitors. Trinity competes on two important facets: its belief that it provides superior customer service relative to its competitors and its ability, through the support of its insurance company partners, to provide warranty solutions to a wider range of HVAC, standby generator, commercial LED lighting and commercial refrigeration equipment customers than that of its competitors. 
 
 Claims Management 
 
 Claims management is the process by which Extended Warranty determines the validity and amount of a claim. The Company believes that claims management is fundamental to its operating results. The Company's goal is to settle claims fairly for the benefit of policyholders in a manner that is consistent with the policy language and the Company's regulatory and legal obligations. 
 
 IWS, Geminus and PWI effectively and efficiently manage claims by utilizing in-house expertise and information systems. They employ an experienced claims staff, in some cases comprised of Automotive Service Excellence certified mechanics, knowledgeable in all aspects of vehicle repairs and potential claims. Additionally, each owns a proprietary database of historical claims information that has been compiled over several years. Management utilizes these databases to drive real-time pricing adjustments and strategic decision-making. 
 
 Under PWSC s warranty products, disputes typically arise when there is a difference between what the homeowner expects of the builder and what the builder believes are its legitimate warranty service responsibilities. PWSC employs an experienced claims staff who respond to all inquiries from homeowners and from requests by builders. Any inquiries or complaints received are submitted or communicated to the builder. PWSC will not make any determination as to the validity or resolution of any complaint; however, PWSC will discuss alternatives or resolutions to disputes with all parties and can mediate or negotiate a fair solution to a dispute. This process ensures that homebuilders can effectively manage new home construction risk and reduce the potential for substantial legal costs associated with litigation. PWSC may, at times, act as a third-party administrator for claims under the insured warranty product; however, at no time does PWSC bear the loss of claims on warranty products. 
 
 Trinity claims on warranty products are managed by the insurance companies with which Trinity partners. Trinity may, at times, act as a third-party administrator of such claims; however, at no time does Trinity bear the loss of claims on warranty products.

Marketing, Distribution and Competition 
 
 CSuite actively markets its services via sponsorship of industry events and conferences typically targeted at private equity and related service providers. 
 
 Ravix does not actively market its services through traditional channels. Instead, Ravix focuses primarily on venture-capital-funded startups and receives most of its new business as a result of business networking activities, referrals from service providers and former clients. 
 
 SNS does not actively market its services through traditional channels. Instead, SNS relies on word-of-mouth to recruit nurses to help meet the demands of the hospitals. 
 
 No Kingsway Search Xcelerator customer or group of affiliated customers accounts for 10 or more of the Company's consolidated revenues, and no loss of a customer or group of affiliated customers would have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
 
 CEO Accelerator 
 
 The Company has developed a unique program, whereby it employs dedicated Operator-in-residence (or "Searcher") personnel whose sole function is to search for an appropriate business for Kingsway to acquire and then to ultimately run that business. As an example, our first Searcher, who was hired in May 2020, identified Ravix as a potential acquisition, which the Company closed on in October 2021. 
 
 The CEO Accelerator focuses on identifying and acquiring privately-held businesses with enterprise values between 10 and 30 million where the owner/operator is looking to transition from day-to-day operating responsibilities. The CEO Accelerator utilizes the proven framework and characteristics of the Search Fund acquisition model and targets industries and companies with pre-defined characteristics. 
 
 The Company believes that having a dedicated Searcher(s) whose background includes a mix of real-world work experience and a graduate degree (usually a master s of business administration) who is ready to transition into the role of CEO gives it a competitive advantage over traditional private equity firms and other potential acquirers of businesses in the lower middle market. 
 
 When a search ends with a successful acquisition, the Searcher transitions into an operational role as CEO of the acquired company and receives a financial incentive, in the form of various stock-based grants, in the acquired company. The awards have both time and performance vesting requirements, which aligns the incentives with those of the overall Company. 
 
 The Company currently has three full-t ime Searchers as of December 31, 2022. The Company intends to maintain this level and potentially expand it as business opportunities permit. 
 
 PRICING AND PRODUCT MANAGEMENT 
 
 Responsibility for pricing and product management rests with the Company's individual operating subsidiaries in Extended Warranty and Kingsway Search Xcelerator . In Extended Warranty, teams typically comprised of pricing actuaries, product managers and business development managers work together by territory to develop policy forms and language, rating structures, regulatory filings and new product ideas. Data solutions and claims groups within the individual operating subsidiaries track loss performance monthly to alert the operating subsidiaries' management teams to the potential need to adjust forms or rates. For Kingsway Search Xcelerator, an annual review of billing rates is performed and rates are adjusted to reflect prevailing marketing expectations. 
 
 INVESTMENTS 
 
 The Company manages its investments to support its liabilities, preserve capital, maintain adequate liquidity and maximize after-tax investment returns within acceptable risks: 

The fixed maturities portfolios are managed by a third-party firm and are comprised predominantly of high-quality fixed maturities with relatively short durations. 

Equity, limited liability and other investments are generally overseen by corporate. 

Limited liability investments, at fair value, investments in private companies and real estate investments are generally overseen by corporate, who engages third-party managers for certain holdings. 

The I nvestment Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for monitoring the performance of the Company's investments and compliance with the Company's investment policies and guidelines, which it reviews annually.

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT 
 
 Insurance 
 
 The Company has one U.S. insurance subsidia ry, Kingsway Amigo Insurance Company ("Amigo"), w hich is organized and domiciled under the insurance statutes of Florida and is in voluntary run-off. During 2022, all remaining outstanding claims were settled and paid. As such, in late 2022 the Company began procedures with the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation in order to surrender Amigo s Certificate of Authority COA to operate as a property and casualty insurer in the state of Florida, which was completed as of March 7, 2023. As such, Amigo is no longer a regulated insurance company. To the best of the Company's knowledge, it was in compliance with all applicable regulations. 
 
 Extended Warranty 
 
 Vehicle service agreements are regulated in all states in the United States, and IWS, Geminus and PWI are subject to these regulations. Most states utilize the approach of the Uniform Service Contract Act that was adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in the early 1990's. Under that approach, states regulate vehicle service contract companies by requiring them annually to file documentation, together with a copy of the contract of insurance covering their liability under the service contracts, which complies with the particular state's regulatory requirements. IWS, Geminus and PWI are in compliance with the regulations of each state where it sells vehicle service agreements. 
 
 Certain, but not all, states regulate the sale of HVAC and equipment warranty contracts. Trinity is licensed as a service contract provider in those states where it is required. 
 
 HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 
 
 At December 31, 2022, the Company employe d 471 per sonnel supporting its operations, all of which were full-time employees. None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 
 
 We believe the skills and experience of our employees are an essential driver of our business and important to our future prospects. To attract qualified applicants and retain our employees, we offer our employees what we believe to be competitive salaries, comprehensive benefit packages, equity compensation awards, and discretionary bonuses based on a combination of seniority, individual performance and corporate performance. The principal purposes of these employee benefits are to attract, retain, reward and motivate our personnel and to provide long-term incentives that align the interests of employees with the interests of our stockholders. 
 
 ACCESS TO REPORTS 
 
 The Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are made available free of charge through its website at www.kingsway-financial.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 Most issuers, including Kingsway, are exposed to numerous risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from recent results or anticipated future results. The risks and uncertainties described below are those specific to the Company that we currently believe have the potential to be material, but they may not be the only ones we face. If any of the following risks, or any other risks and uncertainties that we have not yet identified or that we currently consider not to be material, actually occur or become material risks, our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Investors are advised to consider these factors along with the other information included in this 2022 Annual Report and to consult any further disclosures Kingsway makes in its filings with the SEC. 
 
 FINANCIAL RISK 
 
 We have substantial outstanding recourse debt, which could adversely affect our ability to obtain financing in the future, react to changes in our business and satisfy our obligations. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 90.5 million principal value of outstanding recourse subordinated debt in the form of trust preferred securities, with redemption dates beginning in December 2032, and which has deferred interest accrued of 25.5 million as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 Pursuant to the indentures governing our outstanding trust preferred securities, we are permitted to defer interest payments for up to 20 quarters. During the third quarter of 2018, the Company gave notice to the trustees of its outstanding trust preferred securities of the Company s intention to exercise its voluntary right to defer interest. On March 2, 2023, we gave notice to the holders of five series of our trust preferred securities of our intention to exercise repurchase options no later than March 15, 2023. We will also pay interest accrued during the deferral period on the remaining series of trust preferred securities not subject to repurchase. After the repurchase is completed we will have 15 million of principal outstanding related to the remaining series of trust preferred securities. The Company is currently prohibited from redeeming any shares of its capital stock while payment of interest on the trust preferred securities is being deferred. We also gave notice of our intention to redeem all the outstanding shares of Class A Preferred Stock on March 15, 2023, following the repurchase and payment of accrued interest on our trust preferred securities.

Additionally, we incurred indebtedness in connection with our acquisitions of PWI Holdings, Inc. and its various subsidiaries (collectively, "PWI") on December 1, 2020, Ravix Financial, Inc. ("Ravix") on October 1, 2021, CSuite Financial Partners, LLC ("CSuite") on November 1, 2022 and Secure Nursing Service Inc. ("SNS") on November 18, 2022. As of as of December 31, 2022, we ha ve 34.8 million principal value of such acquisition financing outstanding. 
 
 Because of our substantial outstanding recourse debt: 

our ability to engage in acquisitions without raising additional equity or obtaining additional debt financing could be limited; 

our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or general corporate purposes and our ability to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt may be impaired in the future; 

a large portion of our cash flow must be dedicated to the payment of interest on our debt, thereby reducing the funds available to us for other purposes; 

we are exposed to the risk of increased interest rates because our outstanding subordinated debt and our outstanding acquisition financing bear interest directly related to the London interbank offered interest rate ("LIBOR"), the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR and the Prime Rate; 

it may be more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to our creditors, resulting in possible defaults on, and acceleration of, such debt; 

we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and may have reduced flexibility to deploy capital or otherwise respond to changes; 

we may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with proportionately less debt or with comparable debt on more favorable terms and, as a result, they may be better positioned to withstand economic downturns; 

our ability to refinance debt may be limited or the associated costs to do so may increase; 

our ability to transfer funds among our various subsidiaries and/or distribute such funds to the holding company are limited; 

our flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions and ability to withstand competitive pressures could be limited; 

we were unable to redeem outstanding shares of our redeemable preferred stock on the required date, which could lead to increased financing costs and/or costs associated with any disputes that might arise involving the holders of such preferred stock; and 

we may be prevented from carrying out capital spending that is, among other things, necessary or important to our growth strategy and efforts to improve the operating results of our businesses. 

Increases in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our outstanding recourse debt and could adversely affect our results of operation. 
 
 Our outstanding recourse subordinate debt as of December 31, 2022 of 90.5 million principal value bears interest directly related to LIBOR (and will in the future bear interest related to SOFR) and our outstanding acquisition financing of 34.8 million related to the acquisitions of PWI, Ravix, CSuite and SNS bears interest directly related to either SOFR or the Prime Rate. As a result, increases in LIBOR, SOFR and the Prime Rate would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could adversely affect our results of operations. Each one hundred basis point increase in LIBOR, SOFR or the Prime Rate would result in an approxi mately 1.4 million in crease in our annual interest expense. 
 
 The expected discontinuation of LIBOR could adversely affect the cost of servicing our outstanding debt. 
 
 Our outstanding recourse subordinate debt, which has redemption dates ranging from December 4, 2032 through January 8, 2034, bear interest directly related to LIBOR and extend beyond June 2023, by which time the United Kingdom s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, has announced it intends to phase out U.S dollar LIBOR. 
 
 The transition from LIBOR to other benchmarks has been the subject of private sector and governmental activity. It is unclear if alternative rates or benchmarks, such as SOFR, will be widely adopted, and this uncertainty may impact the liquidity of the SOFR loan markets. In addition, the transition from LIBOR could have a significant impact on the overall interest rate environment and on our borrowing costs. The indentures governing the Company s outstanding recourse debt and the loan and security agreement governing our outstanding acquisition financing provide alternative means of determining the Company s interest expense on its outstanding debt, but at this time, the Company cannot yet reasonably estimate the expected impact of the discontinuation of LIBOR. 
 
 Our operations are restricted by the terms of our debt indentures, which could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet our capital needs. 
 
 Our debt indentures contain numerous covenants that limit our ability, among other things, to make particular types of restricted payments and pay dividends or redeem capital stock. The covenants under our debt agreements could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or to meet our capital needs. No assurances can be given that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants. 
 
 If we are not able to comply with the covenants and other requirements contained in the debt indentures, an event of default under the relevant debt instrument could occur, which could result in the acceleration of all obligations under such debt instruments. 
 
 The Board of Directors closely monitors the debt and capital position and, from time to time, recommends capital initiatives based upon the circumstances of the Company. 
 
 We may not be able to realize our investment objectives, which could significantly reduce our earnings and liquidity. 
 
 We depend on our investments for a substantial portion of our liquidity. As of December 31, 2022, our investments includ ed 37.6 million o f fixed maturities, at fair value. General economic conditions can adversely affect the markets for interest rate-sensitive instruments, including the extent and timing of investor participation in such markets, the level and volatility of interest rates and, consequently, the fair value of fixed maturities. In addition, changing economic conditions can result in increased defaults by the issuers of investments that we own. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. Given the low interest rate environment that exists for fixed maturities, a significant increase in investment yields or an impairment of investments that we own could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition by reducing the fair value of the investments we own, particularly if we were forced to liquidate investments at a loss.

As of December 31, 2022, our investments also included 0.2 million of equity investments, 1.0 million of limited liability investments, 17.1 million of limited liability investments, at fair value, 0.8 million of investments in private companies, at adjusted cost and other investments, at cost of 0.4 million. The se investments are less liquid than fixed maturities. General economic conditions, stock market conditions and many other factors can adversely affect the fair value of the investments we own. If circumstances necessitated us disposing of our limited liability investments prematurely in order to generate liquidity for operating purposes, we would be exposed to realizing less than their carrying value. 
 
 Our ability to achieve our investment objectives is affected by general economic conditions that are beyond our control and our own liquidity needs for operating purposes. We may not be able to realize our investment objectives, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and available cash resources. 
 
 Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by changes in international and national economic and industry conditions . 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant disruption and uncertainty in the global economy and has negatively impacted our business and results of operations and financial condition. We continue to take steps to assess the effects, and mitigate the adverse consequences to our businesses, of the COVID-19 pandemic; however, though the magnitude of the impact continues to develop and change as new variants of COVID-19 emerge, our businesses have been and will continue to be adversely impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19. 
 
 In addition to adverse United States domestic and global macroeconomic effects, including the adverse impacts on various industries' supply chains and automobile sales, which has decreased, and may continue to decrease, consumer demand for our products and services, reduce our ability to access capital, and otherwise adversely impact the operation of our businesses, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and will continue to cause, substantial disruption to our employees, distribution channels, investors, tenants, and customers through self-isolation, travel limitations, business restrictions, and other means, all of which has resulted in declines in sales. These effects, individually or in the aggregate, will continue to adversely impact our businesses, financial condition, operating results and cash flows and such adverse impacts may be material. 
 
 Additionally, actual or potential changes in international, national, regional and local economic, business and financial conditions, including recession, high inflation and trade protection measures and creditworthiness of our customers, may negatively affect consumer preferences, perceptions, spending patterns or demographic trends, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or liquidity. 
 
 We are subject to macro-economic fluctuations in the U.S. and worldwide economy. Concerns about consumer and investor confidence, volatile corporate profits and reduced capital spending, international conflicts, terrorist and military activity, civil unrest and pandemic illness could reduce customer orders or cause customer order cancellations. In addition, political and social turmoil may put further pressure on economic conditions in the United States and abroad. The global economy has been periodically impacted by the effects of global economic downturns (such as recently related to COVID-19). There can be no assurance that there will not be further such events or deterioration in the global economy. These economic conditions make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. 
 
 Russia s invasion and military attacks on Ukraine have triggered significant sanctions from U.S. and European leaders. These events may escalate and have created increasingly volatile global economic conditions. Resulting changes in U.S. trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by Russia, its allies and other affected countries, including China, resulting in a trade war. Furthermore, if the conflict between Russia and Ukraine continues for a long period of time, or if other countries, including the U.S., become further involved in the conflict, we could face material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or liquidity. 
 
 A difficult economy generally could materially adversely affect the credit, investment and financial markets which, in turn, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
 
 An adverse change in market conditions, including changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to instability in the global credit markets presents additional risks and uncertainties for our business. Depending on market conditions going forward, we could incur substantial realized and unrealized losses in future periods, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Certain trust accounts for the benefit of related companies and third-parties have been established with collateral on deposit under the terms and conditions of the relevant trust agreements. The value of collateral could fall below the levels required under these agreements putting the subsidiary or subsidiaries in breach of the agreements which could expose us to damages or otherwise adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows. 
 
 Market volatility may also make it more difficult to value certain of our investments if trading becomes less frequent and the liquidity of such investment declines. Disruptions, uncertainty and volatility in the global credit markets may also adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for future acquisitions. If financing is available, it may only be available at an unattractive cost of capital, which would decrease our profitability or result in our inability to consummate such acquisitions. There can be no assurance that market conditions will not deteriorate in the future. 
 
 Financial disruption or a prolonged economic downturn could materially and adversely affect our business. 
 
 Worldwide financial markets have recently experienced periods of extraordinary disruption and volatility, which has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in heightened credit risk, reduced valuation of investments and decreased economic activity. Moreover, many companies have experienced reduced liquidity and uncertainty as to their ability to raise capital during such periods of market disruption and volatility. In the event that these conditions recur or result in a prolonged economic downturn, our results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. These market conditions may affect the Company's ability to access debt and equity capital markets.

We are party to a Settlement Agreement that may require us to make cash payments from time to time, which payments could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
 
 In May 2016, Aegis Security Insurance Company ("Aegis") filed a complaint for breach of contract and declaratory relief against the Company in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania alleging, among other things, that we breached a contractual obligation to indemnify Aegis for certain customs bond losses incurred by Aegis under the indemnity and hold harmless agreements provided by us to Aegis for certain customs bonds reinsured by Lincoln General Insurance Company ("Lincoln General") during the period of time that Lincoln General was a subsidiary of the Company. Lincoln General was placed into liquidation in November 2015 and Aegis subsequently invoked its rights to indemnity under the indemnity and hold harmless agreements. 
 
 Effective January 20, 2020, we entered into a Settlement Agreement with Aegis with respect to such litigation pursuant to which we agreed to pay Aegis a one-time settlement amount of 0.9 million and to reimburse Aegis for 60 of future losses that Aegis may sustain in connection with such customs bonds, up to a maximum reimbursement amount of 4.8 million. From 2020 to 2022, the Company made reimbursement payments to Aegis totaling 1.0 million in connection with the Settlement Agreement. The timing and severity of our future payments pursuant to this Settlement Agreement are not reasonably determinable. No assurances can be given, however, that we will not be required to perform under this Settlement Agreement in a manner that has a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
 
 We have generated net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. income tax purposes, but our ability to use these net operating losses could be limited by our inability to generate future taxable income. 
 
 Our U.S. businesses have generated consolidated net operating loss carryforwards ("U.S. NOLs") for U.S. federal income tax purposes of approximately 644.2 million as o f December 31, 2022. These U.S. NOLs can be available to reduce income taxes that might otherwise be incurred on future U.S. taxable income and would have a positive effect on our cash flow. There can be no assurance that we will generate the taxable income in the future necessary to utilize these U.S. NOLs and realize the positive cash flow benefit. Also, almost all of our U.S. NOLs have expiration dates. There can be no assurance that, if and when we generate taxable income in the future from operations or the sale of assets or businesses, we will generate such taxable income before our U.S. NOLs expire. 
 
 We have generated U.S. NOLs, but our ability to preserve and use these U.S. NOLs could be limited or impaired by future ownership changes. 
 
 Our ability to utilize the U.S. NOLs after an "ownership change" is subject to the rules of Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Section 382"). An ownership change occurs if, among other things, the shareholders (or specified groups of shareholders) who own or have owned, directly or indirectly, five percent (5 or more of the value of our shares or are otherwise treated as five percent (5 shareholders under Section 382 and the regulations promulgated thereunder increase their aggregate percentage ownership of the value of our shares by more than fifty (50) percentage points over the lowest percentage of the value of the shares owned by these shareholders over a three-year rolling period. An ownership change could also be triggered by other activities, including the sale of our shares that are owned by our five percent (5 shareholders. 
 
 In the event of an ownership change, Section 382 would impose an annual limitation on the amount of taxable income we may offset with U.S. NOLs. This annual limitation is generally equal to the product of the value of our shares on the date of the ownership change multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate in effect on the date of the ownership change. The long-term tax-exempt rate is published monthly by the Internal Revenue Service. Any unused Section 382 annual limitation may be carried over to later years until the applicable expiration date for the respective U.S. NOLs. In the event an ownership change as defined under Section 382 were to occur, our ability to utilize our U.S. NOLs would become substantially limited. The consequence of this limitation would be the potential loss of a significant future cash flow benefit because we would no longer be able to substantially offset future taxable income with U.S. NOLs. There can be no assurance that such ownership change will not occur in the future. 
 
 Expiration of our tax benefit preservation plan could increase the probability that we will experience an ownership change as defined under Section 382. 
 
 In order to reduce the likelihood that we would experience an ownership change without the approval of our Board of Directors, our shareholders ratified and approved the tax benefit preservation plan agreement (the "Plan"), dated as of September 28, 2010, between the Company and Computershare Investor Services Inc., as rights agent, for the sole purpose of protecting the U.S. NOLs. The Plan expired on September 28, 2013. There can be no assurance that our Board of Directors will recommend to our shareholders that a similar tax benefit preservation plan be approved to replace the expired Plan; furthermore, there can be no assurance that our shareholders would approve any new tax benefit preservation plan were our Board of Directors to present one for shareholder approval. The expiration of the Plan, without a new tax benefit preservation plan, exposes us to certain changes in share ownership that we would not be able to prevent as we would have been able to prevent under the Plan. Such changes in share ownership could trigger an ownership change as defined under Section 382 resulting in restrictions on the use of NOLs in future periods, as discussed above. 
 
 We will only be able to utilize our U.S. NOLs against the future taxable income generated by companies we acquire if we are able to include the acquired companies in our U.S. consolidated tax return group. 
 
 We have in the past acquired companies and expect to do so in the future. Our ability to include acquired companies in our U.S. consolidated tax return group is subject to the rules of Section 1504 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. If it were ever determined that an acquired company did not qualify to be included in our U.S. consolidated tax return group, such acquired company would be required to file a U.S. tax return separate and apart from our U.S. consolidated tax return group. In that instance, the acquired company would be required to pay U.S. income tax on its taxable income despite the existence of our U.S. NOLs, which would be a use of cash at the acquired company; furthermore, were the income tax obligation of the acquired company in such instance to be greater than its available cash, we could be obligated to contribute cash to our subsidiary to meet its income tax obligation. There can be no assurance that an acquired company will generate taxable income and, if an acquired company does generate taxable income, there can be no assurance that the acquired company will be allowed to be included in our U.S. consolidated tax return group.

COMPLIANCE RISK 
 
 If we fail to comply with applicable insurance and securities laws or regulatory requirements, our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flow could be adversely affected. 
 
 As a publicly traded holding company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, we are subject to numerous laws and regulations. These laws and regulations delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers to federal, provincial or state regulators. 
 
 Any failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or the mandates of applicable regulators could result in the imposition of fines or significant restrictions on our ability to do business, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. In addition, any changes in laws or regulations (or the interpretation or application thereof, including changes to applicable case law and legal precedent) could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. It is not possible to predict the future effect of changing federal, state and provincial law or regulation (or the interpretation or application thereof) on our operations, and there can be no assurance that laws and regulations enacted in the future will not be more restrictive than existing laws and regulations. 
 
 Our business is subject to risks related to litigation. 
 
 In connection with our operations in the ordinary course of business, at times we are named as defendants in various actions for damages and costs allegedly sustained by the plaintiffs. While it is not possible to estimate the loss, or range of loss, if any, that would be incurred in connection with any of the various proceedings at this time, it is possible an individual action would result in a loss having a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
 
 Material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 We are required to evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As described in Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, of this 2022 Annual Report, in previous years we identified the existence of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. We have one material weakness that has not yet been fully remediated. We are actively engaged in developing and implementing remediation plans as described in Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, of this 2022 Annual Report, but we can provide no assurance that additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future and that such material weaknesses, if identified, will not result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Failure to comply with the NYSE s continued listing requirements and rules could result in the NYSE delisting our common stock, which could negatively affect our company, the price of our common stock and your ability to sell our common stock. 
 
 On April 17, 2020, the Company received a notice from NYSE that the Company was not in compliance with NYSE listing standard 802.01B because our average global market capitalization over a consecutive 30 trading-day period was less than 50.0 million and stockholders equity was less than 50.0 million. In accordance with the NYSE listing requirements, we submitted a plan that demonstrated how we expected to return to compliance with NYSE listing standard 802.01B. On July 9, 2020, the NYSE notified us that our plan was accepted. On January 18, 2021, NYSE notified us that we were again in compliance with NYSE listing standard 802.01B but that we were subject to continued monitoring and review for a period of 12 months. While we remained in compliance during this 12-month period, we may in the future again fail to be in compliance with the NYSE listing standards and we may be subject to corrective action by NYSE, which may include suspension and delisting procedures. 
 
 If we are unable to satisfy the NYSE criteria for continued listing, our common stock would be subject to delisting. A delisting of our common stock could negatively impact us by, among other things, reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock; reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity financing; decreasing the amount of news and analyst coverage of us; and limiting our ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. In addition, delisting from the NYSE may negatively impact our reputation and, consequently, our business. 
 
 STRATEGIC RISK 
 
 The achievement of our strategic objectives is highly dependent on effective change management. 
 
 Over the past several years we have restructured our operating insurance subsidiaries, including exiting states and lines of business, placing subsidiaries into voluntary run-off, terminating managing general agent relationships, hiring a new management team, selling Mendota and CMC and acquiring PWI, Ravix, CSuite and SNS with the objective of focusing on our Extended Warranty and Kingsway Search Xcelerator segments, creating a more effective and efficient operating structure and focusing on profitability. These actions resulted in changes to our structure and business processes. While these changes are expected to bring us benefits in the form of a more agile and focused business, success is dependent on management effectively realizing the intended benefits. Change management may result in disruptions to the operations of the business or may cause employees to act in a manner that is inconsistent with our objectives. Any of these events could negatively affect our performance. We may not always achieve the expected cost savings and other benefits of our initiatives.

We may experience difficulty continuing to retain our holding company staff. 
 
 There can be no assurance that our businesses will produce enough cash flow to adequately compensate and retain staff and to service our other holding company obligations, particularly the interest expense burden of our remaining outstanding debt. 
 
 The highly competitive environment in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
 
 The vehicle service agreement market in which we compete is comprised of a number of companies, including a few large companies, which market service agreements on a national basis and have significantly more financial, marketing and management resources than we do, as well as several other companies that are somewhat similar in size to our Extended Warranty companies. There may also be other companies of which we are not aware that may be planning to enter the vehicle service agreement industry. 
 
 Competitors in our market generally compete on coverages offered, claims handling, customer service, financial stability and, to a lesser extent, price. Larger competitors of ours benefit from added advantages such as industry endorsements and preferred vendor status. We do not believe that it is in our best interest to compete solely on price. Instead, we focus our marketing on the total value experience, with an emphasis on customer service. While we historically have been able to adjust our product offering to remain competitive when competitors have focused on price, our business could be adversely affected by the loss of business to competitors offering vehicle service agreements at lower prices. 
 
 Engaging in acquisitions involves risks, and, if we are unable to effectively manage these risks, our business could be materially harmed. 
 
 From time to time we engage in discussions concerning acquisition opportunities and, as a result of such discussions, may enter into acquisition transactions. 
 
 Acquisitions entail numerous potential risks, including the following: 

difficulties in the integration of the acquired business, including implementation of proper internal controls over financial reporting; 

assumption of unknown material liabilities; 

diversion of management's attention from other business concerns; 

failure to achieve financial or operating objectives or other anticipated benefits or synergies and/or anticipated cost savings; and 

potential loss of customers or key employees. 

We may not be able to integrate or operate successfully any business, operations, personnel, services or products that we may acquire in the future. 
 
 OPERATIONAL RISK 
 
 Our Extended Warranty subsidiaries' deferred service fees may be inadequate, which would result in a reduction in our net income and could adversely affect our financial condition. 
 
 Our Extended Warranty subsidiaries' deferred service fees do not represent an exact calculation but are estimates involving actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time of what we expect to be the remaining future revenue to be recognized in relation to our remaining future obligations to provide policy administration and claim-handling services. The process for establishing deferred service fees reflects the uncertainties and significant judgmental factors inherent in estimating the length of time and the amount of work related to our future service obligations. If we amortize the deferred service fees too quickly, we could overstate current revenues, which may result in a future significant reversal of revenue and adversely affect future reported operating results. 
 
 As time passes and more information about the remaining service obligations becomes known, the estimates are appropriately adjusted upward or downward to reflect this additional information. We cannot assure that we will not have unfavorable re-estimations in the future of our deferred service fees and that such unfavorable re-estimations will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, we have in the past, and may in the future, acquire companies that record deferred service fees. We cannot assure that the deferred service fees of the companies that we acquire are or will be adequate. 
 
 Extended Warranty's reliance on credit unions and dealers, as well as our overall reliance on automobile sales could adversely affect our ability to maintain business. 
 
 The Extended Warranty business markets and distributes vehicle service agreements through a network of credit unions and dealers in the United States. We have competitors that offer similar products exclusively through credit unions and competitors that distribute similar products through dealers. Loss of all or a substantial portion of our existing relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Moreover, our vehicle service agreement businesses rely heavily on the sale of new and used vehicles to drive product sales. Accordingly, a significant decline in new and used automobile sales could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Our reliance on a limited number of warranty and maintenance support clients and customers could adversely affect our ability to maintain business. 
 
 We market and distribute our warranty products and equipment breakdown and maintenance support services through a limited number of customers and clients across the United States. Loss of all or a substantial portion of our existing customers and clients could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
 
 We have reclassified certain assets and discontinued a portion of our operations which could adversely affect our business and operations. 
 
 As discussed in Note 5, "Disposal and Discontinued Operations" to our Consolidated Financial Statements, all operations related to CMC and VA Lafayette, which serves as a medical and dental clinic for the Department of Veteran Affairs, are included as discontinued operations. In the future, it may be necessary to write-off charges and other costs or incur additional expenses in connection with our discontinued operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
 
 Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, we classified VA Lafayette as an asset held for sale . We can provide no assurances that we will successfully sell VA Lafayette, that we will do so in accordance with our expected timeline or that we will recover the carrying value of the assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Additionally, any decisions made regarding our deployment or use of any sales proceeds we receive in any sale involves risks and uncertainties. As a result, our decisions with respect to such proceeds may not lead to increased long-term stockholder value. 
 
 CSuite s focus on serving private equity backed businesses creates exposure to general mergers and acquisitions ("M A") activity. 
 
 CSuite s business opportunities outside of search are correlated with M A activities. Clients will often engage CSuite s financial executive services to prepare a business for a transaction or to assist with post-acquisition implementation. Accordingly, a major contraction of M A activity could have a material effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
 
 Ravix's concentration in venture-capital-funded startups creates exposure to the venture capital funding cycles . 
 
 Ravix focuses on venture-capital-funded companies, often in Silicon Valley, as its clients and receives a significant portion of its referrals from service providers focused on servicing the same market. Accordingly, a major contraction of available venture capital funding into companies or industries that Ravix services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
 
 SNS may experience increased costs that reduce its revenue and profitability if applicable government regulations change. 
 
 The introduction of new regulatory provisions could materially raise the costs associated with hiring temporary employees such as per diem and travel nurses. For example, a state could impose sales taxes or increase sales tax rates on temporary healthcare staffing services. Furthermore, if government regulations were implemented that limit the amount SNS is permitted to charge for its services, SNS' profitability could be adversely affected. 
 
 Healthcare is a regulated industry and modifications, inaccurate interpretations or violations of any applicable statutory or regulatory requirements may result in material costs or penalties as well as litigation and could reduce SNS revenue and profitability. 
 
 Healthcare is subject to many complex federal, state, local and international laws and regulations related to professional licensing, the payment of employees (e.g., wage and hour laws, employment taxes, arbitration agreements, and income tax withholdings, etc.) and general business operations (e.g., federal, state and local tax laws). Failure to comply with all applicable laws and regulations could result in civil and/or criminal penalties as well as litigation, injunction or other equitable remedies. SNS maintains insurance coverage for employment claims, however, SNS' insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover all claims against SNS or may not continue to be available to SNS at a reasonable cost or without coverage exclusions. If SNS' insurance does not cover the claim or SNS is otherwise not able to maintain adequate insurance coverage, SNS may be exposed to substantial liabilities that would materially impact its business and financial performance. 
 
 SNS profitability could be adversely impacted if SNS is unable to adjust its nurse pay rates as the bill rates decline. 
 
 SNS does not have control over the bill rate from hospitals and negotiates the pay rates with the nurses who work with the company. If the bill rates decline, SNS will need to renegotiate the pay rates with its nurses and successfully recruit new nurses at lower pay rates. SNS' ability to recruit and retain nurses is contingent on SNS' ability to offer attractive assignments with competitive wages and benefits or payments. 
 
 SNS may be unable to recruit and retain enough quality nurses to meet the demand. 
 
 SNS relies on its ability to attract, develop, and retain nurses who possess the skills, experience and required licenses necessary to meet the specified requirements of the healthcare facilities. SNS competes for nurses with other temporary healthcare staffing companies. SNS relies on word-of-mouth referrals, as well as social and digital media to attract qualified nurses. If SNS' social and digital media strategy is not successful, SNS' ability to attract qualified nurses could be negatively impacted. Moreover, the competition for nurses remains high as many areas of the United States continue to experience a shortage of qualified nurses.

Disruptions or security failures in our information technology systems could create liability for us and/or limit our ability to effectively monitor, operate and control our operations and adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. 
 
 Our information technology systems facilitate our ability to monitor, operate and control our operations. Changes or modifications to our information technology systems could cause disruption to our operations or cause challenges with respect to our compliance with laws, regulations or other applicable standards. For example, delays, higher than expected costs or unsuccessful implementation of new information technology systems could adversely affect our operations. In addition, any disruption in or failure of our information technology systems to operate as expected could, depending on the magnitude of the problem, adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows, including by limiting our capacity to monitor, operate and control our operations effectively. Failures of our information technology systems could also lead to violations of privacy laws, regulations, trade guidelines or practices related to our customers and employees. If our disaster recovery plans do not work as anticipated, or if the third-party vendors to which we have outsourced certain information technology or other services fail to fulfill their obligations to us, our operations may be adversely affected. Any of these circumstances could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. 
 
 Our success depends on our ability to price accurately the risks we underwrite. 
 
 Our results of operation or financial condition depend on our ability to price accurately for a wide variety of risks. Adequate rates are necessary to generate revenues sufficient to pay expenses and to earn a profit. To price our products accurately, we must collect and properly analyze a substantial amount of data; develop, test and apply appropriate pricing techniques; closely monitor and timely recognize changes in trends; and project both severity and frequency of losses with reasonable accuracy. Our ability to undertake these efforts successfully, and as a result price our products accurately, is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are outside our control, including: 

the availability of reliable data and our ability to properly analyze available data; 

the uncertainties that inherently characterize estimates and assumptions; 

our selection and application of appropriate pricing techniques; and 

changes in applicable legal liability standards and in the civil litigation system generally. 

Consequently, we could underprice risks, which would adversely affect our results, or we could overprice risks, which would reduce our sales volume and competitiveness. In either case, our results of operation could be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 HUMAN RESOURCES RISK 
 
 Our business depends upon key employees, and if we are unable to retain the services of these key employees or to attract and retain additional qualified personnel, our business could be adversely affected. 
 
 Our success at improving our performance will be dependent in part on our ability to retain the services of our existing key employees and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel in the future. The loss of the services of any of our key employees, or the inability to identify, hire and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could adversely affect our results of operations.

Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following management's discussion and analysis ("MD A") of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this 2022 Annual Report. 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 
 Kingsway is a holding company with operating subsidiaries located in the United States. The Company owns or controls subsidiaries primarily in the extended warranty and business services industries. Kingsway conducts its business through the following two reportable segments: Extended Warranty and Kingsway Search Xcelerator . 
 
 Prior to the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company conducted its business through a third reportable segment, Leased Real Estate. Leased Real Estate included the following subsidiaries of the Company: CMC Industries, Inc. ("CMC") and VA Lafayette, LLC ("VA Lafayette"). 

CMC owned, through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary (the "Property Owner"), a parcel of real property consisting of approximately 192 acres located in the State of Texas (the "Real Property"), which is subject to a long-term triple net lease agreement. The Real Property is also subject to two mortgages. On December 22, 2022, the Company announced a definitive agreement for the sale of the Real Property, for gross cash proceeds of 44.5 million and the assumption of the mortgages. On December 29, 2022, the sale was completed. 

VA Lafayette owns real property consisting of approximately 6.5 acres and a 29,224 square foot single-tenant medical office building locat ed in the State of Louisiana (the "LA Real Property"). The LA Real Property serves as a medical and dental clinic for the Department of Veteran Affairs and is subject to a long-term lease. T he LA Real Property is also subject to a mortgage (th e "LA Mortgage"). During the fourth quarter, the Company began executing a plan to sell VA Lafayette, and as a result, VA Lafayette is reported as held for sale at December 31, 2022. 

Both CMC and VA Lafayette have been classified as discontinued operations and the results of their operations are reported separately for all periods presented. See Note 5, "Disposal and Discontinued Operations," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. All segmented information has been restated to exclude the Leased Real Estate segment for all periods presented. 

Extended Warranty includes the following subsidiaries of the Company: IWS Acquisition Corporation ("IWS"), Geminus Holding Company, Inc. ("Geminus"), PWI Holdings, Inc. ("PWI"), Professional Warranty Service Corporation ("PWSC") and Trinity Warranty Solutions LLC ("Trinity"). As discussed in Note 5 , "Disposal and Discontinued Operations," to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company disposed of PWSC on July 29, 2022. The earnings of PWSC are included in the consolidated statements of operations and the segment disclosures through the disposal date. Throughout this 2022 Annual Report, the term "Extended Warranty" is used to refer to this segment. 
 
 IWS is a licensed motor vehicle service agreement company and is a provider of after-market vehicle protection services distributed by credit unions in 25 sta tes and the District of Columbia to their members, with customers in all 50 states. 
 
 Geminus primarily sells vehicle service agreements to used car buyers across the United States, through its subsidiaries, The Penn Warranty Corporation ("Penn") and Prime Auto Care, Inc. ("Prime"). Penn and Prime distribute these products in 39 and 40 states, respectively, via independent used car dealerships and franchised car dealerships. 
 
 PWI markets, sells and administers vehicle service agreements to used car buyers in all fifty states via independent used car and franchise network of approved automobile and motorcycle dealer partners. PWI s business model is supported by an internal sales and operations team and partners wit h American Auto Shield in three states with a white label agreement. PWI also has a "white label" agreement with Classic to sell a guaranteed asset protection product ("GAP") in states that Classic is approved in. 
 
 PWSC sells home warranty products and provides administration services to homebuilders and homeowners across the United States. PWSC distributes its products and services through an in-house sales team and through insurance brokers and insurance carriers throughout all states except Alaska and Louisiana. 
 
 Trinity sells heating, ventilation, air conditioning ("HVAC"), standby generator, commercial LED lighting and commercial refrigeration warranty products and provides equipment breakdown and maintenance support services to companies across the United States. As a seller of warranty products, Trinity markets and administers product warranty contracts for certain new and used products in the HVAC, standby generator, commercial LED lighting and commercial refrigeration industries throughout the United States. Trinity acts as an agent on behalf of the third-party insurance companies that underwrite and guaranty these warranty contracts. Trinity does not guaranty the performance underlying the warranty contracts it sells. As a provider of equipment breakdown and maintenance support services, Trinity acts as a single point of contact to its clients for both certain equipment breakdowns and scheduled maintenance of equipment. Trinity will provide such repair and breakdown services by contracting with certain HVAC providers. 

Kingsway Search Xcelerator includes the Company's subsidiaries, CSuite Financial Partners, LLC ("CSuite"), Ravix Financial, Inc. ("Ravix") and Secure Nursing Service LLC ("SNS"). Throughout this 
 2022 Annual Report, the term "Kingsway Search Xcelerator" is used to refer to this segment.

NON U.S.-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE 
 
 Throughout this 2022 Annual Report, we present our operations in the way we believe will be most meaningful, useful and transparent to anyone using this financial information to evaluate our performance. In addition to the U.S. GAAP presentation of net income, we present segment operating income a s a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, which we believe is valuable in managing our business and drawing comparisons to our peers. Below is a definition of our non-U.S. GAAP measure and its relationship to U.S. GAAP. 
 
 Segment Operating Income 
 
 Segment operati ng income represents on e measure of the pretax profitability of our segments and is derived by subtracting direct segment expenses from direct segment revenues. Revenues and expenses presented in the consolidated statements of operations are not subtotaled by segment; however, this information is available in total and bysegment in Note 22, "Segmented Information," to the Consolidated Financial Statements, regarding reportable segment information. The nearest comparable U.S. GAAP measure to total segment operatin g income is income (loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (benefit) that, in addition to total segment operating income, includes net investment income, net realized gains, loss on change in fair value of equity investments, (loss) gain on change in fair value of limited liability investments, at fair value, gain on change in fair value of real estate investments, gain on change in fair value of derivative asset option contracts, interest expense, other revenue and expenses not allocated to segments, net, amortization of intangible assets, loss on change in fair value of debt, gain on disposal of subsidiary and gain on extinguishment of debt not allocated to segments. A reconciliation of total segment operating income to income (loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (benefit) fo r the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 is presented in Table 1 of the "Results of Continuing Operations" section of MD A. 
 
 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND CRITICAL ESTIMATES 
 
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and classification of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Estimates and their underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes in estimates are recorded in the accounting period in which they are determined. 
 
 The Company s most critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations, and that require the Company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company has identified the following as its most critical accounting policies and judgments. Although management believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable, they are based upon information available when they are made, and therefore, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 
 Service fee and commission revenue represents vehicle service agreement fees, guaranteed asset protection products ("GAP") commissions, maintenance support service fees, warranty product commissions, homebuilder warranty service fees, homebuilder warranty commissions and business services consulting revenue based on terms of various agreements with credit unions, consumers, businesses and homebuilders. Customers either pay in full at the inception of a warranty contract, commission product sale, or when consulting services are billed, or on terms subject to the Company s customary credit reviews. 
 
 The Company s revenue recognition policy follows guidance from ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which utilizes a five-step revenue recognition framework. The Company identifies the contract with its customers and then identifies the performance obligations in the contracts. The transaction price is determined based on the amount we expect to be entitled to in exchange for providing the promised services to the customer. The transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. Revenue is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied. 
 
 Certain of the Company s contracts with customers include obligations to provide multiple services to a customer. Determining whether services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately from one another requires judgment. Revenue from GAP commissions and homebuilder warranty service fees contain multiple distinct performance obligations that are accounted for separately. 
 
 Judgment is required to determine the standalone selling price ("SASP") for each distinct performance obligation. Revenue is allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative SASP. SASP are not directly observable in the GAP and homebuilder warranty contracts for the separate performance obligations. As a result, the Company has applied the expected cost plus a margin approach to develop models to estimate the standalone selling price for each of its performance obligations in order to allocate the transaction price to the two separate performance obligations identified. In these models, the Company makes judgments about which of its actual costs are associated with each of the performance obligations. The relative percentage of expected costs plus a margin associated with these performance obligations is applied to the transaction price to determine the estimated SASP of the performance obligations, which the Company recognizes as earned as services are performed over the term of the contract period.

Management's Discussion and Analysis

In certain jurisdictions the Company is required to refund to a customer a pro-rata share of the vehicle service agreement fees if a customer cancels the agreement prior to the end of the term. Depending on the jurisdiction, the Company may be entitled to deduct from the refund a cancellation fee and/or amounts for claims incurred prior to cancellation. While refunds vary depending on the term and type of product offered, historically refunds have averaged 9 to 13 of the original amount of the vehicle service agreement fee. Revenues recorded by the Company are net of variable consideration related to refunds and the associated refund liability is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The Company estimates refunds based on the actual historical refund rates by warranty type taking into consideration current observable refund trends in estimating the expected amount of future customer refunds to be paid at each reporting period.

 Valuation of Fixed Maturities and Equity Investments 
 
 Our equity investments, including warrants, are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in n et income. Fair value for our equity investments are determined using quoted market values based on latest bid prices, where active markets exist, or models based on significant market observable inputs, where no active markets exist. 
 
 For fixed maturities, we use observable inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are inactive; or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. We do not have any fixed maturities in our portfolio that require us to use unobservable inputs. The Company engages a third-party vendor who utilizes third-party pricing sources and primarily employs a market approach to determine the fair values of our fixed maturities. The market approach includes primarily obtaining prices from independent third-party pricing services as well as, to a lesser extent, quotes from broker-dealers. Our third-party vendor also monitors market indicators, as well as industry and economic events, to ensure pricing is appropriate. All classes of our fixed maturities are valued using this technique. We have obtained an understanding of our third-party vendor s valuation methodologies and inputs. Fair values obtained from our third-party vendor are not adjusted by the Company. 
 
 Gains and losses realized on the disposition of investments are determined on the first-in first-out basis and credited or charged to the consolidated statements of operations. Premium and discount on investments are amortized using the interest method and charged or credited to net investment income. 
 
 Fixed maturities and equity investments are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate risk, credit risk and overall market volatility risk. Accordingly, it is reasonably possible that changes in the fair values of the Company s investments reported at fair value will occur in the near term and such changes could materially affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Impairment Assessment of Investments 
 
 The establishment of an other-than-temporary impairment on an investment requires a number of judgments and estimates. 
 
 We perform a quarterly analysis of our investments classified as available-for-sale and our limited liability investments to determine if any declines in market value are other-than-temporary. The analysis for available-for-sale investments includes some or all of the following procedures, as applicable: 

identifying all unrealized loss positions that have existed for at least six months; 

identifying other circumstances management believes may affect the recoverability of the unrealized loss positions; 

obtaining a valuation analysis from third-party investment managers regarding the intrinsic value of these investments based on their knowledge and experience together with market-based valuation techniques; 

reviewing the trading range of certain investments over the preceding calendar period; 

assessing if declines in market value are other-than-temporary for debt instruments based on the investment grade credit ratings from third-party rating agencies; 

assessing if declines in market value are other-than-temporary for any debt instrument with a non-investment grade credit rating based on the continuity of its debt service record; 

determining the necessary provision for declines in market value that are considered other-than-temporary based on the analyses performed; and 

assessing the Company's ability and intent to hold these investments at least until any investment impairment is recovered. 

The risks and uncertainties inherent in the assessment methodology used to determine declines in market value that are other-than-temporary include, but may not be limited to, the following: 

the opinions of professional investment managers could be incorrect; 

the historical trading patterns of individual investments may not reflect future valuation trends; 

the credit ratings assigned by independent credit rating agencies may be incorrect due to unforeseen or unknown facts related to a company's financial situation; and 

the debt service pattern of non-investment grade instruments may not reflect future debt service capabilities and may not reflect a company's unknown underlying financial problems. 

We perform a quarterly analysis of our investments in private companies. The analysis includes some or all of the following procedures, as applicable: 

the opinions of external investment and portfolio managers; 

the financial condition and prospects of the investee; 

recent operating trends and forecasted performance of the investee; 

current market conditions in the geographic area or industry in which the investee operates; 

changes in credit ratings; and 

changes in the regulatory environment.

Management's Discussion and Analysis

As a result of the analysis performed to determine declines in market value that are other-than-temporary, the Company recorded write downs for other-than-temporary impairment related to limited liability investments, at fair value. See "Investments" s ection below an d Note 7, "Investments," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
 
 Valuation of Limited Liability Investments, at Fair Value 
 
 Limited liability investments, at fair value represent the underlying investments of the Company s consolidated entities Net Lease Investment Grade Portfolio LLC ("Net Lease") and Argo Holdings Fund I, LLC ("Argo Holdings"). The Company accounts for these investments at fair value with changes in fair value reported in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 Net Lease owns investments in limited liability companies that hold investment properties. The fair value of Net Lease's investments is based upon the net asset values of the underlying investments companies as a practical expedient to estimate fair value. 
 
 Argo Holdings makes investments in limited liability companies and limited partnerships that hold investments in search funds and private operating companies. The fair value of Argo Holdings' limited liability investments that hold investments in search funds is based on the initial investment in the search funds. The fair value of Argo Holdings' limited liability investments that hold investments in private operating companies is valued using a market approach. 
 
 Refer to Note 23 , "Fair Value of Financial Instruments," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
 
 Valuation of Deferred Income Taxes 
 
 The provision for income taxes is calculated based on the expected tax treatment of transactions recorded in our consolidated financial statements. In determining our provision for income taxes, we interpret tax legislation in a variety of jurisdictions and make assumptions about the expected timing of the reversal of deferred income tax assets and liabilities and the valuation of deferred income taxes. 
 
 The ultimate realization of the deferred income tax asset balance is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the Company's temporary differences reverse and become deductible. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred income tax asset balance will not be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is needed, management considers all available positive and negative evidence affecting specific deferred income tax asset balances, including the Company's historical and anticipated future performance, the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, and the availability of tax planning strategies. 
 
 Objective positive evidence is necessary to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for all or a portion of a company's deferred income tax asset balances when significant negative evidence exists. Cumulative losses are the most compelling form of negative evidence considered by management in this determination. To the extent a valuation allowance is established in a period, an expense must be recorded within the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2022, the Company maintains a valuation allowan ce of 130.6 million, a ll of which relates to its U.S. deferred income taxes. The largest component of the U.S. deferred income tax asset balance relates to tax loss carryforwards that have arisen as a result of losses generated from the Company's U.S. operations. Uncertainty over the Company's ability to utilize these losses over the short-term has led the Company to record a valuation allowance. 
 
 Future events may result in the valuation allowance being adjusted, which could materially affect our financial position and results of operations. If sufficient positive evidence were to arise in the future indicating that all or a portion of the deferred income tax assets would meet the more likely than not standard, all or a portion of the valuation allowance would be reversed in the period that such a conclusion was reached, which would beneficially impact our results of operations. 
 
 Accounting for Business Combinations and Asset Acquisitions 
 
 The Company evaluates acquisitions in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 805, Business Combinations ("ASC 805"), to determine if a transaction represents an acquisition of a business or an acquisition of assets. 
 
 An acquisition of a business represents a business combination. The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for a business combination by assigning the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill. We determine the fair value of such assets and liabilities, often in consultation with third-party valuation advisors. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires significant judgment and estimates, including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenue, costs and cash flows, discount rates, royalty rates, and selection of comparable companies. The resulting fair values and useful lives assigned to acquisition-related intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization expense. Acquired intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year but is considered complete once all necessary information is available to management to estimate fair value. Acquisition costs related to a business combination are expensed as incurred. 
 
 When an acquisition does not meet the definition of a business combination either because: (i) substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset, or group of similar identified assets, or (ii) the acquired entity does not have an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs, the Company accounts for the acquisition as an asset acquisition. In an asset acquisition, goodwill is not recognized. Any excess of the total purchase price plus transaction costs over the fair value of the net assets acquired is allocated on a relative fair value basis to the identifiable net assets at the acquisition date. The net assets acquired in an asset acquisition of property generally include, but are not limited to: land, building, building and tenant improvements, and intangible assets or liabilities associated with above-market and below-market leases and in-place leases.

Management's Discussion and Analysis

The Company's methodology for determining fair value of the acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities includes estimating an "as-if vacant" fair value of the physical property, which includes land, building, and improvements. In addition, the Company determines the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets and liabilities, considering the following categories: (i) value of in-place leases, and (ii) above and below-market value of in-place leases. The value of in-place leases is estimated based on the value associated with the costs avoided in originating leases compared to the acquired in-place leases as well as the value associated with lost rental and recovery revenue during the assumed lease-up period. The value of in-place leases is amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term and is included in amortization of intangible assets in the consolidated statements of operations . The fair value of the above-market or below-market component of an acquired lease is based upon the present value (calculated using a market discount rate) of the difference between the contractual rents to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term and management s estimate of the rents that would be paid using fair market rental rates and rent escalations at the date of acquisition over the remaining term of the lease. An identifiable intangible asset or liability is recorded if there is an above-market or below-market lease at an acquired property . The amounts recorded for above-market leases are included in intangible assets on the consolidated balance sheets, and the amounts for below-market leases are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. These amounts are amortized on a straight-line basis as an adjustment to rental revenue over the remaining term of the applicable leases. Changes to these assumptions could result in a different pattern of recognition. If tenants do not remain in their lease through the expected term or exercise an assumed renewal option, there could be a material impact to earnings. 
 
 Valuation and Impairment Assessment of Intangible Assets 
 
 Intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Intangible assets with definite useful lives consist of database and customer relationships. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If circumstances require that a definite-lived intangible asset be tested for possible impairment, we first compare the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that definite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the definite-lived intangible asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. 
 
 Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names, which are assessed for impairment annually as of November 30, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company may perform its impairment test for any indefinite-lived intangible asset through a qualitative assessment or elect to proceed directly to a quantitative impairment test, however, the Company may resume a qualitative assessment in any subsequent period if facts and circumstances permit. 
 
 Under the qualitative approach, the impairment test consists of an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If the Company elects to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset, or if a qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the estimated carrying amount of such asset exceeds its fair value, the Company performs a quantitative test. Factors that could trigger a quantitative impairment review include, but are not limited to, significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results and significant negative industry or economic trends. 
 
 As of November 30, 2022, the Company conducted its annual qualitative assessment. As a result, the Company determined that certain trade names should be further examined under a quantitative approach. Based on the results of the quantitative approach, the estimated fair values of the trade names exceeded their respective carrying values; therefore, the Company did not record any impairment. 
 
 No impairment charges were recorded against intangible assets in 2022 or 2021. Additional information regarding our intangible assets is included i n Note 9, "Intangible Assets," to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Goodwill Recoverability 
 
 Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually as of November 30, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In evaluating the recoverability of goodwill, the Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units and compares it to the carrying value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to such excess. 
 
 For Extended Warranty, the Company estimates the fair value using a valuation technique based on observed market capitalization multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") for a group of publicly traded insurance services and insurance brokerage companies, an approach that the Company views as a technique consistent with the objective of measuring fair value consistent with prior years assessments performed. 
 
 For Kingsway Search Xcelerator, the Company estimates the fair value using a valuation technique based on observed market capitalization multiples of EBITDA from its recent acquisitions of similar businesses. 
 
 Estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results, internal forecasts, market observable pricing multiples of similar businesses and comparable transactions and determining the appropriate discount rate and long-term growth rate assumptions. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. It is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described above could change in future periods. 
 
 Although the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units, the amount of the goodwill impairment charge, or both. 
 
 No impairment charges were recorded against goodwill in 2022 or 2021, as the estimated fair values of the reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values. Additional information regarding our goodwill is included in Note 8, "Goodwill," to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Deferred Contract Costs 
 
 Deferred contract costs represent the deferral of incremental costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer. Incremental costs to obtain a contract with a customer primarily include sales commissions. The Company capitalizes costs incurred to fulfill a contract if the costs are identifiable, generate or enhance resources used to satisfy future performance obligations and are expected to be recovered. Costs to fulfill a contract include labor costs for set-up activities directly related to the acquisition of vehicle service agreements. Contract costs are deferred and amortized over the expected customer relationship period consistent with the pattern in which the related revenues are earned. Amortization of incremental costs to obtain a contract and costs to fulfill a contract with a customer are recorded in commissions and general and administrative expenses, respectively, in the consolidated statements of operations. No impairment charges related to deferred contract costs were recorded in 2022 o r 2021. 
 
 Fair Value Assumptions for Subordinated Debt Obligations 
 
 Our subordinated debt is measured and reported at fair value. The fair value of the subordinated debt is calculated using a model based on significant market observable inputs and inputs developed by a third-party. These inputs include credit spread assumptions developed by a third-party and market observable swap rates. The following summarizes the impacts: 

Impact of Rate Change on Fair Value 
 
 2022 Result 
 
 2021 Result 

Libor: 

increase causes fair value to increase; decrease causes fair value to decrease 
 
 Increase to fair value 
 
 Increase to fair value 

Risk free rate: 

increase causes fair value to decrease; decrease causes fair value to increase 
 
 Decrease to fair value 
 
 Decrease to fair value 

The other primary variable affecting the fair value of debt calculation is the passage of time, which will always have the effect of increasing the fair value of debt. 
 
 Therefore, changes in the underlying interest rates used would cause the fair value to be impacted, but only impacts the income statement (or comprehensive income/loss for the portion related to credit risk) and does not impact cash flows. 
 
 Fair Value Assumptions for Subsidiary Stock-Based Compensation Awards 
 
 Three of the Company's subsidiaries, PWSC, Ravix and SNS, have made grants of restricted stock awards or restricted unit awards (together "Subsidiary Restricted Awards"). The Subsidiary Restricted Awards are measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period during which awards are expected to vest, with a corresponding increase to either additional paid-in capital for equity-classified awards or to a liability for liability-classified awards. Certain of the Subsidiary Restricted Awards are classified as a liability, either because they contain a noncontingent put option that is exercisable less than six months after the vesting of certain shares or because the awards are expected to settle in cash. Liability-classified awards, included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, are measured and reported at fair value on the date of grant and are remeasured each reporting period. Th e Subsidiary Restricted Awards contain performance vesting and/or market vesting conditions. Performance vesting conditions are reviewed quarterly to assess the probability of achievement of the performance condition. Compensation expense is adjusted when a change in the assessment of achievement of the specific performance condition is determined to be probable. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis for awards subject to market conditions regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied, provided that the requisite service has been provided. Forfeitures are recognized in the period that Subsidiary Restricted Awards are forfeited. 
 
 The determination of fair value of the Subsidiary Restricted Awards is subjective and involves significant estimates and assumptions of whether the awards will achieve performance thresholds. The fair value of the Subsidiary Restricted Awards is estimated using either an internal valuation model without relevant observable market inputs, the Black-Scholes option pricing model and/or the Monte Carlo simulation model to derive certain inputs. The significant inputs used in the internal valuation model includes a valuation multiple applied to trailing twelve month earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. The determination of the grant date fair value using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model is affected by subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the awards, expected volatility over the expected term of the awards, expected dividend yield, and risk-free interest rates. The determination of the grant date fair value using the Monte Carlo simulation model is affected by subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the awards, expected volatility over the expected term of the awards and risk-free interest rates. The assumptions used in the Company s Black-Scholes option-pricing and Monte Carlo simulation models requires significant judgment and represents management s best estimates. 
 
 Derivative Financial Instruments 
 
 Derivative financial instruments include interest rate swap contract and the trust preferred debt repurchase options. The Company measures derivative financial instruments at fair value. The fair value of derivative financial instruments is required to be revalued each reporting period, with corresponding changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. Realized gains or losses are recognized upon settlement of the contracts. See Note 11, "Derivatives" and Note 23, "Fair Value of Financial Instruments" t o the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further discussion.

Management's Discussion and Analysis

Contingent Consideration 
 
 The consideration for certain of the Company's acquisitions include future payments to the former owners that are contingent upon the achievement of certain targets over future reporting periods. Liabilities for contingent consideration are measured and reported at fair value at the date of acquisition with subsequent changes in fair value reported in the consolidated statements of operations as non-operating other (expense) revenue. 
 
 Determining the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities requires management to make assumptions and judgments. The fair value of Company s contingent consideration liabilities is estimated by applying the Monte Carlo simulation method to forecast achievement of gross profit or gross revenue. These fair value measurements are based on significant inputs not observable in the market. Key inputs in the valuations include forecasted gross profit or revenue, gross profit or revenue volatility, discount rate and discount term. Management must use judgment in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Changes in assumptions could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration benefit or expense reported in the consolidated statements of operations and have an impact on the payout of contingent consideration liabilities. Contingent consideration liabilities are revalued each reporting period. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or multiple inputs, including adjustments to the key inputs or changes in the assumed achievement or timing of any targets. Any changes in fair value are reported in the consolidated statements of operations as non-operating other (expense) revenue. Additional information regarding our contingent consideration liabilities is included i n Note 23, "Fair Value of Financial Instruments, " to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Increased operating income from Kingsway Search Xcelerator, primarily due to including Ravix for twelve months in 2022 (acquired October 2021), as well as the November 2022 acquisitions of CSuite and SNS, which was partially offset by 

2021 operating income in Extended Warranty segment includes a gain on extinguishment of debt of 2.2 million, related to Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP") loan forgiveness, while there was zero in 2022; 

2022 operating income includes a reduction to IWS operating income of 0.9 million, due to a change in estimate of IWS' deferred revenue and deferred contract costs associated with vehicle service contract fees; and 

The disposal of PWSC as of July 29, 2022, which had segment operating income of 0.1 million and 2.6 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Management's Discussion and Analysis

For the year ended December 31, 2022, we reported income from continuing operations of 30.1 million c ompared to a loss from continuing operations o f 2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The income from continuing operations for 2022 is primarily due to: 

A gain on disposal of subsidiary of 37.9 million, r elated to the sale of PWSC; 

A gain on change in fair value of derivative asset option contracts of 16.7 million , related to the trust preferred debt repurchase options; 

A gain on change in fair value of real estate investments of 1.5 million; all of which were partially offset by 

An increase in interest expense related to rising interest rates; 

Other revenue and expenses not allocated to segments, net, which includes a 4.8 million increase in the fair value of previously-granted awards to PWSC employees that are accounted for on a fair value basis and 1.2 million increase in expense due to the increase in fair value of the Ravix contingent consideration; 

Loss on change in fair value of debt, which increased by 1.7 million; 

Loss on change in fair value of limited liability investments, at fair value which increased by 4.1 million (see below); and 

Income tax expense which increased by 8.7 million. The income tax expense in 2022 is primarily due to the state tax expense associated with the sale of PWSC on July 29, 2022 and the related increase in valuation allowance from the accelerated utilization of indefinite life interest expense carryforwards as a result of such sale. The income tax benefit in 2021 is primarily due to the release of valuation allowance as a result of deferred tax liabilities available in 2021 arising from the acquisitions of Ravix Financial and PWI available to offset existing deferred tax assets. 

The loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 is primarily due to operating income in Extended Warranty (which includes gain on extinguishment of debt of 2.2 million, related to PPP loan forgiveness) that was negatively impacted by recording a 1.9 million non-cash, cumulative reduction to service fee and commission revenue relating to the decrease in PWI acquired deferred service fees as a result of finalizing the purchase accounting, net investment income, ne t realized gains, gain on change in fair value of limited liability investments, at fair value and income tax benefit, partially offset by interest expense, other revenue and expenses not allocated to segments, net, increased amortization of intangible assets as a result of a 1.9 million non-cash, cumulative adjustment related to finalizing the PWI purchase accounting and loss on change in fair value of debt. 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, we reported net income of 15.1 million compared to 1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition to the items described above impacti ng income (loss) fro m continuing operations, the net income includes: 

A loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes of 12.8 million and income from discontinued operations, net of taxes of 4.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 , respectively ; 

A loss on disposal of discontinued operations, net of taxes of 2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

The loss from discontinued operations is related to the operations of CMC and VA Lafayette and is primarily due to a final management fee of 16.4 million resulting from the sale of the CMC railyard. 
 
 T he loss o n disposal of discontinued operations includes the gain on disposal of CMC o f 0.2 million and a loss of 2.5 million related to a liability recorded at September 30, 2022 regarding the Company's obligation to indemnify a former subsidiary for open claims (the maximum liability under the indemnity is 2.5 million). See Note 5 "Disposal and Discontinued Operations ," to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further discussion. 
 
 Extended Warranty 
 
 The Extended Warranty service fee and commission revenue decreased 0.1 (or 0.9 million) to 74.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared with 74.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Service fee and commission revenue was impacted by the following in 2022: 

A 3.1 million decrease at PWSC, due to the sale of PWSC on July 29, 2022 (the financial results for PWSC are only included through the disposal date); 

A 0.7 million decrease at Geminus, due to the continued supply-chain issues in the automotive industry, resulting in significant increases in the prices of used automobiles, making it difficult for smaller automobile dealers to obtain inventory and, therefore, putting downward pressure on revenue; both of which were partially offset by 

A 1.3 million increase at PWI. During the third quarter of 2021, PWI recorded a 1.9 million non-cash, cumulative reduction to service fee and commission revenue relating to the decrease in PWI acquired deferred service fees as a result of finalizing the purchase accounting. This was partially offset by similar macro-economic conditions as explained above for Geminus, as well as a restructuring of leadership at PWI that has resulted in a higher focus salesforce production; 

A 1.2 million increase at Trinity, primarily driven by a 0.9 million increase in its equipment breakdown and maintenance support services, as Trinity continues to recover from the original impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic; and 

A 0.4 million increase at IWS. During the first quarter of 2022, there was a change in estimate of IWS' deferred revenue associated with vehicle service contract fees, which resulted in a reduction to IWS revenue of 1.2 million. This reduction was more than offset by an increase in revenue due primarily to an increase in the number of VSAs written in 2022, as sales volume continues to trend up towards pre-COVID levels. IWS sells a substantial amount of VSAs for new automobiles but, more importantly, its products are distributed through credit unions at the point of vehicle financing, which has been less impacted by the recent macro-economic conditions. 

The Extended Warranty operating income was 9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared with 12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The 2021 operating income results include a 1.9 million non-cash, cumulative reduction to service fee and commission revenue relating to the decrease in PWI acquired deferred service fees as a result of finalizing the purchase accounting.

Management's Discussion and Analysis

Operating income was primarily impacted by the following: 

Inclusion of PPP loan forgiveness related to Extended Warranty companies of 2.2 million for 2021, of which there was zero in 2022; 

A 1.1 million decrease at PWSC to an operating income of 0.9 million, primarily due to the sale of PWSC on July 29, 2022; 

A 0.5 million decrease at Geminus to 1.3 million, due to a decrease in revenue that was partially offset by a slight decrease in general and administrative expenses; all of which were partially offset by 

A 0.5 million increase at IWS to 4.0 million, primarily due to increased revenue. This was partially offset by a change in estimate of IWS' deferred revenue and deferred contract costs associated with vehicle service contract fees, which resulted in a reduction to IWS operating income of 0.9 million in 2022. Also, during 2022, IWS had a slight increase in commission and claims expense, as a decrease in the number of claims was slightly more than offset by an increase in the average cost of a claim; 

A 0.3 million increase at PWI to 2.1 million. The 2021 results include a 1.9 million non-cash, cumulative reduction to service fee and commission revenue relating to the decrease in PWI acquired deferred service fees as a result of finalizing the purchase accounting. The operating income for 2022 was impacted by an increase in claims expense (decreased volume of claims that was more than offset by a higher average cost per claim) compared to 2021; and 

A 0.2 million increase at Trinity to 1.7 million, primarily due to an increase in revenue that was partially offset by an increase in cost of services sold and higher general and administrative expenses compared to 2021. 

Kingsway Search Xcelerator 
 
 The Kingsway Search Xcelerator revenue increased to 19.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared wit h 3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Kingsway Search Xcelerator operating income was 3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared with 0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in revenue and operating income is primarily due to the inclusion of Ravix for a full year in 2022 following its acquisition effective October 1, 2021, as well as revenue and operating income derived from CSuite and SNS, which were acquired on November 1, 2022 and November 18, 2022, respectively. 
 
 Net Investment Income 
 
 Net investment income was 2.3 million in 2022 compared to 1.6 million in 2021. The increase in 2022 relates primarily to higher investment income from the Company's limited liability investments, fixed maturities and cash equivalents. The Company also benefited from increasing interest rates and an increase in the Company s unrestricted cash balance (from 10.1 million as of December 31, 2021 to 64.2 million as of December 31, 2022). 
 
 The increases above were partially offset by a decrease in investment income from the Company's limited liability investments, at fair value, which is recognized based on the Company's share of the earnings of the limited liability entities. 
 
 Net Realized Gains 
 
 The Company recorded net realized gains of 1.2 million in 2022 compared to 1.8 million in 2021. The net realized gains for 2022 and 2021 primarily relate to: 

Net realized gains on sales of limited liability investments ; 

Realized gains recognized by Argo Holdings Fund I, LLC ("Argo Holdings") ; and 

Distributions received from one of the Company s investments in private companies in which its carrying value previously had been written down to zero as a result of prior distributions. 

(Loss) Gain on Change in Fair Value of Limited Liability Investments, at Fair Value 
 
 Loss on change in fair value of limited liability investments, at fair value was 1.8 million in 2022 compared to a gain of 2.4 million in 2021. The loss for the year ended December 31, 2022 represents decreases in fair value of 0.9 million related to Net Lease Investment Grade Portfolio LLC ("Net Lease") and 0.8 million related to Argo Holdings. The remaining property in Net Lease was sold in February 2023. 
 
 The gain for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes increases in fair value of 1.6 million related to Net Lease, due to the sale of one of the Net Lease investment properties, and 0.8 million related to Argo Holdings. 
 
 Gain on Change in Fair Value of Real Estate Investments 
 
 Gain on change in fair value of real estate investments was 1.5 million in 2022 compared to zero in 2021. Real estate investments solely relates to investment real estate properties held by the Company s consolidated subsidiary, Flower Portfolio 001, LLC ("Flower"). The Company consolidates the financial statements of Flower on a three-month lag. The increase in fair value is attributable to the sale of the Flower real estate investment properties for 12.2 million, which closed on September 29, 2022. As a result of the three-month lag, the Company recorded the sale transaction in its fourth quarter 2022 financial statements.

Gain on Change in Fair Value of Derivative Asset Option Contracts 
 
 Gain on change in fair value of derivative asset option contracts was 16.7 million in 2022 compared to zero in 2021, due to the fact that the Company entered into three option agreements during the third quarter of 2022 to repurchase a significant portion of its subordinated debt. The amount relates to the difference between the value of the option at date of inception and the cash consideration paid of (total of 11.4 million), and the subsequent change in fair value of 5.3 million through December 31, 2022. 
 
 Refer to Note 11, "Derivatives," to t he Consolidated Financial Statements, for further information on the option agreements. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 
 Interest expense for 2022 was 8.1 million compared to 6.2 million in 2021. The increase in 2022 is primarily attributable to: 

2.1 million higher interest expense on the Company s subordinated debt, which resulted from generally higher London interbank offered interest rates ("LIBOR") for three-month U.S. dollar deposits during 2022 compared to 2021 . The Company's subordinated debt bears interest at the rate of LIBOR, plus spreads ranging from 3.85 to 4.20 ; 

An increase of 0.3 million related to the 2021 Ravix Loan, which was effective October 1, 2021, and has an annual interest rate equal to the greater of the Prime Rate plus 0.5 , or 3.75 (current rate of 8.00 ; 

A n increase of 0.1 million related to the new 6.0 million 2022 Ravix Loan, which was effective November 16, 2022 and has an annual interest rate equal to the Prime Rate plus 0.75 (current rate of 8.25 ; 

A n increase of 0.1 million related to the new 6.5 million SNS Loan, which was effective November 18, 2022 and has an annual interest rate equal to the greater of the Prime Rate plus 0.5 , or 5.00 (current rate of 8.00 ; all of which were partially offset by 

A decrease of 0.4 million, related to the 2020 KWH Loan, as a result of lower principal balance, as well as an increase in fair value of the interest rate swap related to the 2020 KWH bank loan; and 

A decrease of 0.1 million related to notes payable at Net Lease. The Net Lease debt was repaid in the fourth quarter of 2020, however due to the three-month reporting lag for Net Lease, the Company continued to report interest expense through the first quarter of 2021 related to the Net Lease debt. 

See "Debt" section below for further details. 
 
 Other Revenue and Expenses not Allocated to Segments, Net 
 
 Other revenue and expenses not allocated to segments was a net expense of 17.2 million in 2022 compared to 11.4 million in 2021. Included are revenue and expenses associated with our various other investments that are accounted for on a consolidated basis, our insurance company that has been in run-off since 2012, and expenses associated with our corporate holding company. 
 
 The increase in net expense for 2022 is primarily attributable to a 4.8 million increase in the fair value of previously-granted awards to PWSC employees that are accounted for on a fair value basis and an increase in the fair value of the Ravix contingent consideration liability of 1.2 million, p artially offset by lower general and administrative expense incurred by the holding company during 2022 compared to 2021. 
 
 Amortization of Intangible As sets 
 
 Amortization of intangible assets wa s 6.1 million i n 2022 compared to 4.8 million in 2021. 
 
 The higher amortization expense for 2022 is related to amortization of intangible assets recorded in conjunction with the Company's acquisitions of Ravix effective October 1, 2021, CSuite effective November 1, 2022 and SNS effective November 18, 2022. During 2022, the Company recorded 1.1 million, 0.3 million and 0.3 million, respec tively, of amortization expense related to the intangible assets identified as part of the acquisitions of Ravix, CSuite and SNS. 
 
 S ee Note 4 , " Acquisitions , " to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the Company s acquisitions of Ravix, CSuite and SNS. 
 
 Loss on Change in Fair Value of Debt 
 
 The loss on change in fair value of debt amounted to 4.9 million in 2022 compared to 3.2 million in 2021. The loss for 2022 reflects an increase in the fair value of the subordinated debt resulting primarily from changes in interest rates used (not related to instrument-specific credit risk). The following summarizes the impacts:

Gain on Disposal of Subsidiary 
 
 On July 29, 2022, the Company sold its 80 majority-owned subsidiary, PWSC. As a result of the sale, the Company recognized a net gain on disposal of 37.9 million during the third quarter of 2022. The sale of PWSC did not represent a strategic shift that would have a major effect on the Company's operations or financial results; therefore, PWSC is not presented within discontinued operations. 
 
 Se e Note 5, "Disposal and Discontinued Operations," to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further discussion of the PWSC disposal. 
 
 Gain on Extinguishment of Debt not Allocated to Segments 
 
 During 2021, gain on extinguishment of debt not allocated to segments consists of a 0.3 million g ain (recorded in the first quarter of 2021) on forgiveness of the balance of the holding company's loan obtained through the PPP of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ("CARES") Act.

 Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 
 
 Income tax expense for 2022 was 4.8 million compared to income tax benefit of 3.9 million in 2021. The 2022 and 2021 income tax expense (benefit) is primarily related to: 

An income tax expense o f 1.0 million and an income tax benefit 0.4 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, for the partial release of the Company s deferred income tax valuation allowance associated with business interest expense with an indefinite life; 

An income tax benefit of 0.2 million in 2022 for the partial release of the Company s deferred tax valuation allowance related to the change in future income assumptions and 4.1 million in 2021 for the partial release of the Company s deferred income tax valuation allowance related to its acquisitions of PWI and Ravix; 

An income tax expense of 0.1 million an d 0.2 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, relating to a change in indefinite life deferred income tax liabilities; and 

An income tax expens e of 3.9 million a nd 0.4 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, for state income taxes. 

See Note 15 , "Income Taxes," t o the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional detail of the income tax benefit recorded for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 
 
 INVESTMENTS 
 
 Portfolio Composition 
 
 The following is an overview of how we account for our various investments: 

Investments in fixed maturities are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value. 

Equity investments are reported at fair value. 

Limited liability investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The most recently available financial statements of the limited liability investments are used in applying the equity method. The difference between the end of the reporting period of the limited liability investments and that of the Company is no more than three months. 

Limited liability investments, at fair value represent the underlying investments of the Company s consolidated entities Net Lease and Argo Holdings. The difference between the end of the reporting period of the limited liability investments, at fair value and that of the Company is no more than three months. 

Investments in private companies consist of: convertible preferred stocks and notes in privately owned companies; and investments in limited liability companies in which the Company s interests are deemed minor. These investments do not have readily determinable fair values and, therefore, are reported at cost, adjusted for observable price changes and impairments. 

Real estate investments are reported at fair value, which consisted of Flowers. 

Other investments include collateral loans and are reported at their unpaid principal balance. 

Short-term investments, which consist of investments with original maturities between three months and one year, are reported at cost, which approximates fair value. 

At December 31, 2022, we held cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments with a carrying value of 134.2 million. Our U.S. operations typically invest in U.S. dollar-denominated instruments to mitigate their exposure to currency rate fluctuations.

Other-Than-Temporary Impairment 
 
 The Company performs a quarterly analysis of its investments to determine if declines in market value are other-than-temporary. Further information regarding our detailed analysis and factors considered in establishing an other-than-temporary impairment on an investment is discussed within the "Significant Accounting Policies and Critical Estimates" section of MD A. 
 
 As a result of the analysis performed, the Company recorded write downs for other-than-temporary impairment related to limited liability investments, at fair value of less than 0.1 million and 0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, which are included in (loss) gain on change in fair value of limited liability investments, at fair value in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 There were no write-downs recorded for other-than-temporary impairments related to available-for sale investments, limited liability investments, investments in private companies and other investments for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 
 
 The length of time a fixed maturity investment may be held in an unrealized loss position may vary based on the opinion of the investment manager and their respective analyses related to valuation and to the various credit risks that may prevent us from recapturing the principal investment. In the case of a fixed maturity investment where the investment manager determines that there is little or no risk of default prior to the maturity of a holding, we would elect to hold the investment in an unrealized loss position until the price recovers or the investment matures. In situations where facts emerge that might increase the risk associated with recapture of principal, the Company may elect to sell a fixed maturity investment at a loss. 
 
 At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the gross unrealized losses for fixed maturities amounted to 2.5 million and 0.3 million, and there were no unrealized losses attributable to non-investment grade fixed maturities. At each of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, all unrealized losses on individual investments were considered temporary.

DEBT 
 
 See Note 12 , " Debt ," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details to those provided below. 
 
 Bank Loans 
 
 In 2019, the Company formed Kingsway Warranty Holdings LLC ("KWH"), whose subsidiaries at the time included IWS, Geminus and Trinity. As part of the acquisition of PWI on December 1, 2020, PWI became a wholly owned subsidiary of KWH, which borrowed a principal amount of 25.7 million from a bank to finance its acquisition of PWI and to fully repay the prior outstanding loan at KWH (the "2020 KWH Loan"). The 2020 KWH Loan had an annual interest rate equal to LIBOR, having a floor of 0.75 , plus 3.00 . During the second quarter of 2022, the 2020 KWH Loan was amended to change the annual interest rate to be equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), having a floor of 0.75 , plus spreads ranging from 2.62 to 3.12 . At December 31, 2022, the interest rate was 6.96 . The 2020 KWH Loan is carried in the consolidated balance sheets at its amortized cost, which reflects the pay-down of principal, as well as the amortization of the debt discount and issuance costs using the effective interest rate method. The 2020 KWH Loan matures on December 1, 2025. 
 
 The 2020 KWH Loan contains a number of covenants, including, but not limited to, a leverage ratio, a fixed charge ratio and limits on annual capital expenditures, all of which are as defined in and calculated pursuant to the 2020 KWH Loan that, among other things, restrict KWH s ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, make dividends and distributions, engage in mergers, acquisitions and consolidations, make certain payments and investments and dispose of certain assets. 
 
 On February 28, 2023, KWH entered into a second amendment to the 2020 KWH Loan (the KWH DDTL that provides for an additional delayed draw term loan in the principal amount of up to 10 million, with a maturity date of December 1, 2025. All or any portion of the KWH DDTL, subject to a 2 million minimum draw amount, may be requested at any time through February 27, 2024. The proceeds are evidenced by an intercompany loan and guarantee between KAI and KWH. Proceeds from certain assets dispositions, as defined, may be required to be used to repay outstanding draws under the DDTL. The principal amount shall be repaid in quarterly installments in an amount equal to 3.75 of the original amount of the drawn DDTL. The KWH DDTL also increases the senior cash flow leverage ratio maximum permissible for certain periods. 
 
 As part of the acquisition of Ravix on October 1, 2021, Ravix became a wholly owned subsidiary of Ravix Acquisition LLC ("Ravix LLC"), and together they borrowed from a bank a principal amount of 6.0 million in the form of a term loan, and established a 1.0 million revolver to finance the acquisition of Ravix (together, the "2021 Ravix Loan"). The 2021 Ravix Loan has an annual interest rate equal to the greater of the Prime Rate plus 0.5 , or 3.75 (current rate of 8.00 and is carried in the consolidated balance sheets at its amortized cost, which reflects the monthly pay-down of principal as well as the amortization of the debt discount and issuance costs using the effective interest rate method. The term loan matures on October 1, 2027. 
 
 Subsequent to the acquisition of CSuite on November 1, 2022, CSuite became a wholly owned subsidiary of Ravix LLC. As a result of the acquisition of CSuite, on November 16, 2022, the Ravix Loan was amended to (1) include CSuite as a borrower; (2) borrow an additional principal amount of 6.0 million in the form of a supplemental term loan (the "2022 Ravix Loan"); and (3) amend the maturity date and interest rate of the 1.0 million revolver (the "2022 Revolver"). The 2022 Ravix Loan matures on November 16, 2028 and has an annual interest rate equal to the Prime Rate plus 0.75 (current rate of 8.25 and is carried in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2022 at its amortized cost, which reflects the monthly pay-down of principal. The 2022 Revolver matures on November 16, 2024 and has an annual interest rate equal to the Prime Rate plus 0.50 . 
 
 The 2021 Ravix Loan and 2022 Ravix Loan contain a number of covenants, including, but not limited to, a leverage ratio and a fixed charge ratio, all of which are as defined in and calculated pursuant to the 2021 Ravix Loan and 2022 Ravix Loan that, among other things, restrict Ra vix and CSuite s a bility to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, make dividends and distributions, engage in mergers, acquisitions and consolidations, make certain payments and investments and dispose of certain assets. 
 
 As part of the asset acquisition of SNS on November 18, 2022, the Company formed Secure Nursing Service LLC, who became a wholly owned subsidiary of Pegasus Acquirer Holdings LLC ("Pegasus LLC"), and together they borrowed from a bank a principal amount of 6.5 million in the form of a term loan , and established a 1.0 million revolver to finance the acquisition of SNS (together, the "SNS Loan"). The SNS Loan has an annual interest rate equal to the greater of the Prim e Rate plus 0.5 , or 5.00 (current rate of 8.00 and is carried in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2022 at its amortized cost, which reflects the monthly amortization of the debt discount and issuance costs using the effective interest rate method. The term loan matures on November 18, 2028 and revolver matures on November 18, 2023. 
 
 The SNS Loan contains a number of covenants, including, but not limited to, a leverage ratio and a fixed charge ratio and limits on annual capital expenditures, all of which are as defined in and calculated pursuant to the SNS Loan that, among other things, restrict SNS s ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, make dividends and distributions, engage in mergers, acquisitions and consolidations, make certain payments and investments and dispose of certain assets. 
 
 Notes Payable 
 
 On January 5, 2015, Flower Portfolio 001, LLC assumed a 9.2 million mortgage in conjunction with the purchase of investment real estate properties ("the Flower Note"). The Flower Note was scheduled to mature on December 10, 2031 and had a fixed interest rate of 4.81 . On September 29, 2022, Flower sold its investment real estate properties and used a portion of the sales proceeds to repay the unpaid principal balance of the Flower Note. At December 31, 2021, the Flower Note is carried in the consolidated balance sheet at its unpaid principal balance. 
 
 In April 2020, certain subsidiaries of the Company received loan proceeds under the PPP, totaling 2.9 million with a stated annual interest rate of 1.00 . The PPP, established as part of the CARES Act and administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the "SBA"), provides for loans to qualifying businesses for amounts up to 2.5 times of the average monthly payroll costs (as defined for purposes of the PPP) of the qualifying business. The loans and accrued interest are forgivable as long as the borrower uses the loan proceeds for eligible purposes, including payroll, costs, rent and utilities, during the twenty-four week period following the borrower s receipt of the loan and maintains its payroll levels and employee headcount. The amount of loan forgiveness will be reduced if the borrower reduces its employee headcount below its average employee headcount during a benchmark period or significantly reduces salaries for certain employees during the covered period.

Management's Discussion and Analysis

The Company used the entire loan amount for qualifying expenses. The U.S. Department of the Treasury has announced that it will conduct audits for PPP loans that exceed 2.0 million. If we were to be audited and receive an adverse outcome in such an audit, we could be required to return the full amount of the PPP Loan and may potentially be subject to civil and criminal fines and penalties. 
 
 On December 21, 2020 the SBA approved the forgiveness of the full amount of one of the five PPP loans, which included principal and interest of 0.4 million. In January 2021 and March 2021, the SBA provided the Company with notices of forgiveness of the full amount of the remaining four loans. The forgiveness in the first quarter of 2021 included total principal and interest of 2.5 million.

 Between December 4, 2002 and December 16, 2003, six subsidiary trusts of the Company issued 90.5 million of 30-year capital securities to third parties in separate private transactions. In each instance, a corresponding floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debenture was then issued by Kingsway America Inc. to the trust in exchange for the proceeds from the private sale. The floating rate debentures bear interest at the rate of LIBOR, plus spreads ranging from 3.85 to 4.20 . The Company has the right to call each of these securities at par value any time after five years from their issuance until their maturity. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2018, the Company gave notice to its Trust Preferred trustees of its intention to exercise its voluntary right to defer interest payments for up to 20 quarters, pursuant to the contractual terms of its outstanding Trust Preferred indentures, which permit interest deferral. This action does not constitute a default under the Company's Trust Preferred indentures or any of its other debt indentures. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, deferred interest payable of 25.5 million and 18.7 milli on, respectively, is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 On August 2, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with a holder of four of the trust preferred debt instruments ("TruPs") that gives the Company the option to repurchase up to 100 of the holder s principal and deferred interest for a purchase price equal to 63 of the outstanding principal and deferred interest. Originally, the agreement called for a repurchase at 63 , which escalated to 63.75 once the September 26, 2022 agreement (described below) was signed. The Company has agreed that any repurchase made will be for no less than 50 of the TruPs held by the holder. 
 
 Until the earlier of (i) the date that all four of the preferred debt instruments have been repurchased and (ii) the nine month anniversary of the agreement ("May Termination Date"), all interest on the four preferred debt instruments will continue to accrue. However, with respect to TruPs that are repurchased prior to the May Termination Date, the amount of interest accrued during the term of the agreement will be treated as an offset and reduce the repurchase price for such TruPs. The Company will have no obligation to pay any such accrued interest with respect to any of the TruPs that are repurchased prior to the May Termination Date. 
 
 The Company paid approximately 2.0 million to the holder for this option and the Company has until the May Termination Date to execute the repurchases. If the Company repurchases less than 30.0 million of principal and deferred interest, or fails to purchase any principal or deferred interest within one year, then the 2.0 million paid is forfeited. If the Company repurchases an amount equal to or great than 30.0 million, then the 2.0 million paid would be applied to such repurchases. 
 
 On September 20, 2022, the Company entered into an additional agreement with the same party to the August 2, 2022 agreement that gives the Company the option to repurchase up to 100 of the holder s principal and deferred interest for 63.75 of the outstanding principal and deferred interest relating to a portion of a fifth TruPs held. The September 20, 2022 agreement is subject to the same terms and conditions as the August 2, 2022 and no additional consideration was paid. 
 
 On September 26, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with a holder of a portion of one of the TruPs that gives the Company the option to repurchase up to 100 of the holder s principal and deferred interest for a purchase price equal to 63 of the outstanding principal and deferred interest. 
 
 Until the earlier of (i) the date that all of the preferred debt instrument has been repurchased and (ii) the May Termination Date, all interest on the preferred debt instrument will continue to accrue. However, with respect to TruPs that are repurchased prior to the May Termination Date, the amount of interest accrued during the term of the agreement will be treated as an offset and reduce the repurchase price for such TruPs. The Company will have no obligation to pay any such accrued interest with respect to the TruPs that are repurchased prior to the May Termination Date. 
 
 The Company paid approximately 0.3 million to the holder for this option and the Company has until the May Termination Date to execute the repurchase. If the Company fails to purchase any principal or deferred interest before the May Termination Date, then the 0.3 million paid is forfeited. If the Company repurchases any of the TruPs, then the 0.3 million paid would be applied to any repurchases. 
 
 The Company continues to accrue interest on all six of the TruPs. 
 
 In February 2023, the Company entered into amendments to the repurchase agreements described above that would give the Company an additional discount on the total repurchase price if the Company effected a 100 repurchase on or before March 15, 2023. On March 2, 2023, the Company gave notice to the holders that it intends to exercise its options to repurchase 100 of the principal no later than March 15, 2023. The total amount to be paid will be 56.5 million, which includes a credit for the 2.3 million that the Company previously paid at the time of entering into the repurchase agreements. As a result, the Company will have repurchased 75.5 million of principal and 21.2 million of deferred interest (valued as of December 31, 2022). The Company intends to use currently available funds from working capital to fund the repurchases. 
 
 In order to execute the repurchase, the Company will have to pay an estimated 4.7 million of deferred interest to the remaining trust preferred debt instrument for which the Company did not have the right to repurchase. After the repurchase is completed, the Company will continue to have 15 million of principal outstanding related to remaining trust preferred debt instrument. 
 
 The agreements governing our subordinated debt contain a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict the Company s ability to incur additional indebtedness, make dividends and distributions, and make certain payments in respect of the Company s outstanding securities. 
 
 The Company's subordinated debt is measured and reported at fair value. At December 31, 2022, the carrying value of the subordinated deb t is 67.8 million. T he fair value of the subordinated debt is calculated using a model based on significant market observable inputs and inputs developed by a third-party. For a description of the market observable inputs and inputs developed by a third-party used in determining fair value of debt, se e Note 23, "Fair Value of Financial Instruments," to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Management's Discussion and Analysis

During the year ended December 31, 2022, the market observable swap rates changed, and the Company experienced a decrease in the credit spread assumption developed by the third-party. Changes in the market observable swap rates affect the fair value model in different ways. An increase in the LIBOR swap rates has the effect of increasing the fair value of the Company's subordinated debt while an increase in the risk-free swap rates has the effect of decreasing the fair value. The increase in the credit spread assumption has the effect of decreasing the fair value of the Company's subordinated debt while a decrease in the credit spread assumption has the effect of increasing the fair value. The other primary variable affecting the fair value of debt calculation is the passage of time, which will always have the effect of increasing the fair value of debt. The changes to the credit spread and swap rate variables during 2022, along with the passage of time, contributed to the 6.8 million increase in fair value of the Company s subordinated debt between December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022. 
 
 Of the 6.8 million increase in fair value of the Company s subordinated debt between December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022, 1.9 million is reported as an increase in fair value of debt attributable to instrument-specific credit risk in the Company's consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) and 4.9 million is reported as loss on change in fair value of debt in the Company s consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 Though changes in the market observable swap rates will continue to introduce some volatility each quarter to the Company s reported gain or loss on change in fair value of debt, changes in the credit spread assumption developed by the third party does not introduce volatility to the Company s consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of the Company s subordinated debt will eventually equal the principal value, totaling 90.5 million, of the subordinated debt by the time of the stated redemption date of each trust, beginning with the trust maturing on December 4, 2032 and continuing through January 8, 2034, the redemption date of the last of the Company s outstanding trusts. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 The purpose of liquidity management is to ensure there is sufficient cash to meet all financial commitments and obligations as they fall due. The liquidity requirements of the Company and its subsidiaries have historically been met primarily by funds generated from operations, capital raising, disposal of subsidiaries, investment maturities and investment income, and other returns received on investments and from the sale of investments. 
 
 A significant portion of the cash provided by our Extended Warranty companies is required to be placed into restricted trust accounts, as determined by the insurers who back-up our service contracts, in order to fund future expected claims. On a periodic basis (quarterly or annually), we may be required to contribute more into the restricted accounts or we may be permitted to draw additional funds from the restricted accounts, dependent upon actuarial analyses performed by the insurers regarding sufficiency of funds to cover future expected claims. A substantial portion of the restricted trust accounts are invested in fixed maturities and other instruments that have durations similar to the expected future claim projections. 
 
 Cash provided from these sources is used primarily for warranty expenses, business service expenses, debt servicing, acquisitions and operating expenses of the holding company. 
 
 The Company's Extended Warranty and Kingsway Search Xcelerator subsidiaries fund their obligations primarily through service fee and commission revenue. 
 
 Cash Flows from Continuing Operations 
 
 During 2022 , the Company reported 2.6 million of net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations, primarily due to: 

The sale of PWSC, which generated cash flows of 1.8 million through the date of the sale in 2022, compared to 2.8 million for 2021; 

A 0.4 million reduction in cash flows from the remaining Extended Warranty companies; 

Outflows at the holding company related to the TruPs repurchase option 2.3 million); all of which were partially offset by; 

Continued cost containment initiatives at the holding company regarding ongoing expenses; and 

Increases in cash flows from the KSX companies, due to the inclusion of Ravix for the full twelve months in 2022 and the acquisitions of CSuite and SNS. 

During 2021 , the Company reported 6.5 million of net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations, primarily due to cash inflows generated by the Extended Warranty segment (which includes PWI for 12 months in 2021) and cost containment initiatives at the holding company. 
 
 During 2022 , the net cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations was 58.1 million. This source of cash was primarily attributed to: 

Net cash proceeds received, net of cash disposed of from the sale of PWSC, of 35.2 million; 

Net cash proceeds received from the sale of the CMC Real Property of 26.4 million; 

Cash proceeds received from the sale of real estate investments of 12.2 million; 

The acquisitions of CSuite and SNS in 2022, which totaled 13.7 million, net of cash acquired; and 

Purchases of fixed maturities in excess of proceeds from limited liability investments and from sales and maturities of fixed maturities. 

During 2021, the net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was 9.0 million. This use of cash was primarily attributed to: 

Purchases of fixed maturities in excess of proceeds from sales and maturities of fixed maturities of 15.6 million; 

The acquisitions of Ravix and RoeCo in 2021, which totaled 12.6 million, net of cash acquired; 

Distributions received (reducing the use of cash) by Net Lease from two of its limited liability investment companies of 16.3 million; and 

Proceeds received (reducing the use of cash) from the Company's limited liability investments.

Management's Discussion and Analysis

During 2022, the net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was 5.6 million, p rimarily attributed to: 

Principal repayments: on bank loans of 5.2 million, notes payable of 6.4 million, which relates to the repayment of the Flower Note; 

Distributions to noncontrolling interest holders of 6.0 million; and 

Net proceeds (reducing the use of cash) from bank loans of 12.7 million related to the 2022 Ravix Loan and the SNS Loan, and proceeds from the exercise of warrants of 0.5 million. 

During 2021, the net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was 9.3 million, primarily attributed to: 

Principal repayments: on bank loans of 4.9 million, notes payable of 9.5 million, of which 9.0 million relates to the repayment of Net Lease's 9.0 million mezzanine loan and 0.5 million relating to principal paydowns on the Flower Note; 

Distributions to noncontrolling interest holders of 2.4 million; and 

Net proceeds (reducing the use of cash) from bank loans of 6.2 million related to the Ravix Loan and proceeds from the exercise of warrants of 1.8 million. 

Holding Company Liquidity 
 
 The liquidity of the holding company is managed separately from its subsidiaries. The obligations of the holding company primarily consist of holding company operating expenses; transaction-related expenses; investments; and any other extraordinary demands on the holding company. 
 
 Pursuant to satisfying the covenants under the 2020 KWH Loan, distributions to the holding company in an aggregate amount not to exceed 1.5 million in any 12-month period are permitted. Also, beginning in 2022, the holding company is permitted to receive a portion of the excess cash flow (as defined in the 2020 KWH Loan document) generated by the KWH Subs in the previous year. In 2022, the Company was entitled to 50 of the excess cash flow with the other 50 used to pay down the 2020 KWH Loan. During 2022, the Company received 1.7 million and in March 2022 paid down the KWH 2020 Loan by 1.7 million. 
 
 The amount of excess cash flow the Company is entitled to retain is dependent upon the leverage ratio (as defined in the 2020 KWH Loan document): 

Percent of excess cash flow 

If leverage ratio is 
 
 retained by the Company 

Greater than 1.75:1.00 
 
 50 

Less than 1.75:1.00 but greater than 0.75:1.00 
 
 75 

Less than 0.75:1.0 
 
 100 

The Company anticipates that in 2023 it will be entitled to receive 75 of the 2022 excess cash flow. 
 
 On October 1, 2021, the Company closed on the acquisition of Ravix. Related to the Ravix acquisition, the Company secured the 2021 Ravix Loan with Ravix and Ravix LLC as borrowers under the 2021 Ravix Loan. On November 1, 2022, the Company closed on the acquisition of CSuite. Related to the CSuite acquisition, the Company secured the 2022 Ravix Loan with CSuite, Ravix and Ravix LLC as borrowers under the 2022 Ravix Loan. Pursuant to the covenants under the 2021 Ravix Loan and the 2022 Ravix Loan, Ravix and CSuite are permitted to make distributions to the holding company so long as doing such would not cause non-compliance with the various covenants outlined within the 2021 Ravix Loan and 2022 Ravix Loan. 
 
 On November 18, 2022, the Co mpany closed on the acquisition of SNS. Related to the SNS acquisition, the Company secured the SNS Loan with SNS and Pegasus LLC as borrowers under the SNS Loan. Pursuant to the covenants under the SNS Loan, SNS is not permitted to make distributions to the holding company without the consent of the lender. 
 
 On October 18, 2018, the Company completed the previously announced sale of its non-standard automobile insurance companies Mendota Insurance Company, Mendakota Insurance Company and Mendakota Casualty Company (collectively "Mendota"). As part of the transaction, the Company will indemnify the buyer for any loss and loss adjustment expenses with respect to open claims in excess of Mendota's carried unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses at June 30, 2018 related to the open claims. The maximum obligation to the Company with respect to the open claims is 2.5 million. Per the purchase agreement, a security interest on the Company s equity interest in its consolidated subsidiary, Net Lease, as well as any distributions to the Company from Net Lease, was to be collateral for the Company s payment of obligations with respect to the open claims. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2021, the purchasers of Mendota and the Company agreed to release the Company's equity interest in Net Lease as collateral and allow Net Lease to make distributions to the Company. In exchange, the Company agreed to deposit 2.0 million into an escrow account and advance 0.5 million to the purchaser of Mendota to satisfy the Company's payment obligation with respect to the open claims .

Management's Discussion and Analysis

During the third quarter of 2022, the buyer provided to the Company an analysis of the claims development that indicated that the Company's potential exposure with respect to the open claims was at the maximum obligation amount. Previous communications from the buyer noted no such development. As a result of the newly provided information, the Company recorded a liability of 2.5 million during the third quarter of 2022, which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2022 and loss on disposal of discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022. There were no payments made by the Company related to the open claims during the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. During the first quarter of 2023, the 2.0 million that had been previously deposited into an escrow account was released and remitted to the buyer to satisfy the Company's payment with respect to the open claims. 
 
 The holding company s liquidity, defined as the amount of cash in the bank accounts of Kingsway Financial Services Inc. and Kingsway America Inc., was 48.9 million and 2.2 million at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, which excludes future actions available to the holding company that could be taken to generate liquidity. The holding company cash amounts are reflected in the cash and cash equivalents o f 64.2 million and 10.1 million rep orted at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. The significant increase is primarily due to the sale of PWSC and the sale of the CMC railyard in 2022. 
 
 In addition to its collections from subsidiaries and holding company expenditures, the Company anticipates the following cash inflows and outflows over the next twelve months: 

Inflows: 

Distributions from Net Lease of 8.3 million, from the sale of the last commercial real estate property in February 2023 

3.7 million from the exercise of 0.7 million warrants from January 1 through February 28, 2023

1.5 million distribution from Amigo, given that as of early March 2023 it was no longer a regulated insurance company

Outflows: 

56.5 million to repurchase the trust preferred debt instruments (aka subordinate debt) for which it has the option to repurchase, which outflow is expected no later than March 15, 2023 (see Note 11 , " Derivatives ," and Note 26 , Subsequent Events , to the Consolidated Financial Statements) 

4.7 million of deferred interest to the remaining trust preferred debt instrument for which the Company did not have the right to repurchase (see 
 Note 26
 , 
 Subsequent Events
 , to the Consolidated Financial Statements); the Company would have the ability to defer interest payments for up to 20 quarters on the remaining trust preferred debt instrument, if it so elected

6.1 million required to redeem the Class A Preferred Shares; however, based on discussions with the holders of the Class A Preferred Shares, the Company anticipates that 100 of the
 Class A Preferred Shares would be converted and, in that case, there would be no cash outlay by the Company (see 
 Note 19
 , 
 Redeemable Class A Preferred Stock
 , and 
 Note 26
 , 
 Subsequent Events
 , to the Consolidated Financial Statements)

The Company notes there are outstanding warrants that expire in September 2023 (see 
 Note 20
 , 
 Shareholders' Equity
 , to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and, if all outstanding warrants were exercised, the Company would receive an additional 18.7 million. The Company also notes that it has an additional 10 million available from the second amendment to the 2020 KWH Loan (see 
 Note 12
 , " 
 Debt
 ," and 
 Note 26
 , 
 Subsequent Events
 , to the Consolidated Financial Statements), that i s available to be drawn.

Based on the Company s current business plan and revenue prospects, existing cash, cash equivalents, investment balances and anticipated cash flows from operations are expected to be sufficient to meet the Company s working capital and operating expenditure requirements, including the cash that may be required to redeem the Preferred Shares, repurchase its trust preferred securities and pay deferred interest on its trust preferred securities, for the next twelve months. However, the Company s assessment could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the developing macro-economic environment. 
 
 Regulatory Capital 
 
 Kingsway Reinsurance Corporation ("Kingsway Re"), our reinsurance subsidiary domiciled in Barbados, is required by the regulator in Barbados to maintain minimum statutory capital of 125,000. Kingsway Re is currently operating with statutory capital near the regulatory minimum, requiring us to periodically contribute capital to fund operating expenses. Kingsway Re incurs operating expenses of approximately 0.1 million per year. As of December 31, 2022, the capital maintained by Kingsway Re was in excess of the regulatory capital requirements in Barbados.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Kingsway Financial Services, Inc. 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Kingsway Financial Services, Inc. (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the related statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and schedule (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits.

Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 The Company's revenue from contracts with customers (ASC 606) relates to extended warranty service fee and commission income, which is comprised of multiple revenue streams including: vehicle service agreement fees, guaranteed asset protection commissions, maintenance support service fees, warranty product commissions, homebuilder warranty service fees, and homebuilder warranty commissions. Many of the Company's contracts include revenue which is generated from contracts with multiple performance obligations. Accordingly, the application of revenue recognition policies requires the Company to exercise significant judgement in the following areas: 
 
 Determination of whether individual services are promises which are considered distinct performance obligations. 
 
 Assessing whether the Company is a principal or an agent in providing services to the ultimate customer in the contract. 
 
 Assessing variable consideration attributable to each contract and the related estimates of variable consideration, which are significant in vehicle service contracts, based on refund rights provided to the customer under vehicle service contracts and related business practices. 
 
 Assessing the transaction price including the impact of various dealer and partner incentive and rebate programs which are considered contract acquisition costs. 
 
 Determining stand-alone selling prices for each distinct service and allocation to each individual performance obligation on a relative selling price basis. 
 
 Determining the timing of when revenue is recognized for separate performance obligations and whether the performance is deemed to occur over time or at a point in time. 
 
 For performance obligations satisfied over time, the selection of an appropriate methodology which best depicts the transfer of services to the customer under the contract.

For these reasons, we identified revenue recognition as a critical audit matter. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit 
 
 The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following, among other procedures: 
 
 We obtained an understanding of the processes and internal controls related to each significant revenue generating activity within scope of ASC 606. 
 
 We evaluated the Company's application of the portfolio approach to individual groups of contracts to ensure the application was in compliance with ASC 606. 
 
 We tested the determination of individual performance obligations identified by management to ensure distinct performance obligations identified were consistent with the underlying contracts. We also tested whether all distinct performance obligations within each contract were complete and reflected all material promises which are capable of being distinct. 
 
 We evaluated and tested the key judgements applied by management, including: 
 
 o Assessing whether the Company is deemed to be the principal or an agent in delivering services to the customer. We evaluated the key factors to determine whether the Company is responsible for fulfillment of each significant service provided to the customer. 
 
 o Estimating variable consideration, primarily related to refund liabilities on vehicle service contracts, based on historical patterns and future expectations of customer refund requests. We tested the estimated amount of expected refunds including management s assessment of refund rates on each significant type of warranty contract to assess the overall reasonableness of the refund liabilities. 
 
 o Determining whether certain incentive payments to dealers and partners were considered customer acquisition costs and should be included in the determination of the overall transaction price by examining the underlying program agreements and related business practices followed by the Company. 
 
 o Estimating stand-alone selling prices when multiple performance obligations exist within a contract, based on management s internal estimates of cost plus an appropriate margin to support expected selling prices. We tested the related costs expected to be incurred in satisfying the delivery of services at contract commencement and those expected to be incurred over the life of the contract which are primarily associated with contract administration services. We also tested the relative selling price allocation of the contract price to each separate performance obligation. 
 
 o Application of over time recognition patterns, including management s estimates related to claims emergence patterns for each separate group of contracts which possess similar characteristics that faithfully represent the transfer of services to the customer. We tested contracts at the warranty company subsidiaries to determine the accuracy and consistency of claim emergence patterns. 

Trust Preferred Debt Repurchase Options Refer to Note 2 and Note 11 to the financial statements 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 The Company entered into agreements with multiple holders of trust preferred debt instruments that gives the Company the option to repurchase 100 of the holder s principal and deferred interest at agreed upon prices. These agreements constitute derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value and are required to be revalued each reporting period, with corresponding changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 The fair value of the Trust Preferred Repurchase Options contracts are estimated using the binomial lattice model. Key inputs in the valuation include credit spread assumptions, interest rate volatility, debt coupon interest rate and time to maturity which in their entirety fall under level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Significant judgment is required, as the transaction(s) are based upon a hypothetical market and the initial deposit consideration paid by the Company does not reflect fair value as the deposit consideration was not based on the most advantageous market from a market participant assumption basis. 
 
 For these reasons, we identified the derivative option contracts as a critical audit matter. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 
 The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following, among other procedures: 
 
 We evaluated the Company's application of the accounting for derivatives to ensure the application was in compliance with ASC 815. 
 
 We confirmed the terms of the trust preferred debt repurchase options directly with debt holders. 
 
 We evaluated the business purpose of the transactions for reasonableness. 
 
 We reviewed and tested the methodologies and key assumptions in the valuation analysis provided by management using our internal valuation specialists. In performing these procedures, we considered the following: 
 
 o Completeness and accuracy of underlying data provided by management 
 
 o The nature and basis for valuation adjustments and calculations used by management s valuation specialists 
 
 o Reasonableness of the valuation methods and assumptions used by management s valuation specialists in the analysis 
 
 o The sensitivity of significant inputs to the valuation model and their impact on management s conclusions. 
 
 o The probabilities of certain outcomes as selected by management 
 
 We tested key inputs to the valuation model, including checking calculations of significant inputs to the valuation model. 
 
 We considered the sensitivity of key assumptions and performed sensitivity analysis around the key assumptions in evaluating their reasonableness.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

The consolidated financial statements are prepared as of December 31, 2022 based on individual company financial statements at the same date, or in the case of certain limited liability companies that are consolidated, on a three -month lag basis. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been aligned where necessary to ensure consistency with those of Kingsway. The Company's subsidiaries Argo Holdings Fund I, LLC ("Argo Holdings"), Flower Portfolio 001, LLC ("Flower") and Net Lease Investment Grade Portfolio LLC ("Net Lease") meet the definition of an investment company and follow the accounting and reporting guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946, Financial Services-Investment Companies . Noncontrolling interests The Company has noncontrolling interests attributable to certain of its subsidiaries. A noncontrolling interest arises where the Company owns less than 100 of the voting rights and economic interests in a subsidiary. A noncontrolling interest is initially recognized at the proportionate share of the identifiable net assets of the subsidiary at the acquisition date and is subsequently adjusted for the noncontrolling interest's share of the acquiree's net income (loss) and changes in capital. The effects of transactions with noncontrolling interests are recorded in shareholders' equity where there is no change of control. 

Limited liability investments, at fair value are accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value included in gain on change in fair value of limited liability investments, at fair value. The difference between the end of the reporting period of the limited liability investments, at fair value and that of the Company is no more than three months. Investments in private companies consist of convertible preferred stocks and notes in privately owned companies and investments in limited liability companies in which the Company s interests are deemed minor. These investments do not have readily determinable fair values and, therefore, are reported at cost, adjusted for observable price changes and impairments. Changes in carrying value are included in net change in unrealized loss on private company investments. Real estate investments are reported at fair value, which is as of December 31, 2022 due to the sale of Flower s investment real estate properties for million on September 29, 2022. Note 7 , "Investments," for further details. Other investments include collateral loans and are reported at their unpaid principal balance, which approximates fair value. Short-term investments, which consist of investments with original maturities between three months and one year, are reported at cost, which approximates fair value. Realized gains and losses on sales, determined on a first -in first -out basis, are included in net realized gains. Dividends and interest income are included in net investment income. Investment income is recorded as it accrues. The Company accounts for all financial instruments using trade date accounting. The Company conducts a quarterly review to identify and evaluate investments that show objective indications of possible impairment. Impairment is charged to the consolidated statements of operations if the fair value of an instrument falls below its cost/amortized cost and the decline is considered other-than-temporary. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and the Company's ability and intent to hold investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery. 

to years for furniture and equipment; and three to five years for computer hardware. 

(m) Contingent consideration: 
 The consideration for certain of the Company's acquisitions include future payments to former owners that are contingent upon the achievement of certain targets over future reporting periods. Liabilities for contingent consideration are measured and reported at fair value at the date of acquisition and are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or multiple inputs, including adjustments to the discount rates or changes in the assumed achievement or timing of any targets. These fair value measurements are based on significant inputs not observable in the market. Changes in assumptions could have an impact on the payout of contingent consideration liabilities. Changes in fair value are reported in the consolidated statements of operations as non-operating other (expense) revenue. 

In certain jurisdictions the Company is required to refund to a customer a pro-rata share of the vehicle service agreement fees if a customer cancels the agreement prior to the end of the term. Depending on the jurisdiction, the Company may be entitled to deduct from the refund a cancellation fee and/or amounts for claims incurred prior to cancellation. While refunds vary depending on the term and type of product offered, historically refunds have averaged 9 to 13 of the original amount of the vehicle service agreement fee. Revenues recorded by the Company are net of variable consideration related to refunds and the associated refund liability is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The Company estimates refunds based on the actual historical refund rates by warranty type taking into consideration current observable refund trends in estimating the expected amount of future customer refunds to be paid at each reporting period. Maintenance support service fees include the service fees collected to administer equipment breakdown and maintenance support services and are earned as services are rendered. Warranty product commissions include the commissions from the sale of warranty contracts for certain new and used heating, ventilation, air conditioning ("HVAC"), standby generator, commercial LED lighting and commercial refrigeration equipment. The Company acts as an agent on behalf of the third -party insurance companies that underwrite and guaranty these warranty contracts. The Company does not guaranty the performance underlying the warranty contracts it sells. Warranty product commissions are earned at the time of the warranty product sales. Homebuilder warranty service fees include fees collected from the sale of warranties issued by new homebuilders. The Company receives a single warranty service fee as its transaction price at the time it enters into a written contract with each of its builder customers. Each contract contains two separate performance obligations - warranty administrative services and other warranty services. Warranty administrative services include enrolling each home sold by the builder into the program and the warranty administrative system and delivering the warranty product. Other warranty services include answering builder or homeowner questions regarding the home warranty and dispute resolution services. Standalone selling prices are not directly observable in the contract for each of the separate home warranty performance obligations. As a result, the Company has applied the expected cost plus a margin approach to develop models to estimate the standalone selling price for each of its performance obligations in order to allocate the transaction price to the two separate performance obligations identified. For the model related to the warranty administrative services performance obligation, the Company makes judgments about which of its actual costs are associated with enrolling each home sold by the builder into the program and the warranty administrative system and delivering the warranty product. For the model related to the other warranty services performance obligation, the Company makes judgments about which of its actual costs are associated with activities, such as answering builder or homeowner questions regarding the home warranty and dispute resolution services, which are performed over the life of the warranty coverage period. The relative percentage of expected costs plus a margin associated with the warranty administrative services performance obligation is applied to the transaction price to determine the estimated standalone selling price of the warranty administrative services performance obligation, which the Company recognizes as earned at the time the home is enrolled and the warranty product is delivered. The relative percentage of expected costs plus a margin associated with the other warranty services performance obligation is applied to the transaction price to determine the estimated standalone selling price of the other warranty services performance obligation, which the Company recognizes as earned as services are performed over the warranty coverage period. For the other warranty services performance obligation, the Company applies an input method of measurement, based on the expected costs plus a margin of providing services, to determine the transfer of its services over the warranty coverage period. The Company uses historical data regarding the number of calls it receives and activities performed, in addition to the number of homes enrolled, to estimate the number of complaints and dispute resolution requests to be received by year until coverage expires, which allows the Company to develop a revenue recognition pattern that it believes provides a faithful depiction of the transfer of services over time for the other warranty services performance obligation. Homebuilder warranty commissions include commissions from the sale of warranty contracts for those builders who have requested and receive insurance backing of their warranty obligations. The Company acts as an agent on behalf of the third -party insurance company that underwrites and guaranties these warranty contracts. Homebuilder warranty commissions are earned on the certification date, which is typically the date of the closing of the sale of the home to the buyer. The Company also earns fees to manage remediation or repair services related to claims on insurance-backed warranty obligations, which are earned when the claims are closed. Kingsway Search Xcelerator consulting revenue includes the revenue from providing outsourced finance and human resources consulting services, as well as healthcare professional staffing services. The Company invoices for services revenue based on contracted rates. Revenue is earned as services are provided. Contingent consideration receivable The terms of the sale of one of the Company's subsidiaries includes potential receipt by the Company of future earnout payments. The gain related to the earnout payments is recorded when the consideration is determined to be realizable and is reported in the consolidated statements of operations as gain on disposal of subsidiary. The assumptions and methodologies used are continually reviewed and any adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the adjustments are made. See Note 5 , "Disposal and Discontinued Operations," for further discussion. 

(q) Stock-based compensation: 
 The Company uses the fair-value method of accounting for stock-based compensation awards granted to employees. Expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period during which awards are expected to vest, with a corresponding increase to either additional paid-in capital for equity-classified awards or to a liability for liability-classified awards. Liability-classified awards, included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, are measured and reported at fair value on the date of grant and are remeasured each reporting period. Compensation expense related to the c hange in fair value for liability-classified awards is reported in the consolidated statements of operations as general and administrative expenses. For awards with a graded vesting schedule, expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the awa rd. For awards subject to a performance condition, expense is recognized when the performance condition has been satisfied or is probable of being satisfied. For awards subject to a market condition, com pensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied, provided that the requisite service has been provided. Forfeitures are recognized in the period that the award is forfeited. 

million and million at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 , respectively. The holding company cash amounts are reflected in the cash and cash equivalents o f million and million reported at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 , respectively, on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. In addition to its collections from subsidiaries and holding company expenditures, the Company anticipates the following cash inflows and outflows over the next months: 
 Inflows: 
 
 Distributions from Net Lease of million, from the sale of the last commercial real estate property in February 2023 
 million from the exercise of million warrants from January 1 through February 28, 2023 
 
 million distribution from Amigo, given that as of early March 2023 it was no longer a regulated insurance company 
 
 Outflows: 
 
 million to repurchase the trust preferred debt instruments (aka subordinate debt) for which it has the option to repurchase, which outflow is expected no later than March 15, 2023 see Note 11 , " Derivatives ," and Note 26 , Subsequent Events 
 million of deferred interest to the remaining trust preferred debt instrument for which the Company did not have the right to repurchase (see Note 26 , Subsequent Events ); the Company would have the ability to defer interest payments for up to 20 quarters on the remaining trust preferred debt instrument, if it so elected 
 
 million required to redeem the Class A Preferred Shares; however, based on discussions with the holders of the Class A Preferred Shares, the Company anticipates that 100 of the Class A Preferred Shares would be converted and, in that case, there would be cash outlay by the Company (see Note 19 , " Redeemable Class A Preferred Stock ," and Note 26 , Subsequent Events 
 The Company notes there are outstanding warrants that expire in September 2023 see Note 20 , Shareholders' Equity and, if all outstanding warrants were exercised, the Company would receive an additional 18.7 million. The Company also notes that it has an additional 10 million available from the second amendment to the 2020 KWH Loan (see Note 12 , " Debt ," and Note 26 , Subsequent Events ), that i s available to be drawn. Based on the Company s current business plan and revenue prospects, existing cash, cash equivalents, investment balances and anticipated cash flows from operations are expected to be sufficient to meet the Company s working capital and operating expenditure requirements, including the cash that may be required to redeem the Preferred Shares, repurchase its trust preferred securities and to pay the deferred interest on its trust preferred securities, for the next twelve months. However, the Company s assessment could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the developing macro-economic environment.

 CSuite Financial Partners, LLC 

On
 November 
 1, 
 2022, the Company acquired
 of the outstanding equity interests of CSuite Financial Partners, LLC ("CSuite"). CSuite, based in Manhattan Beach, California, is a national financial executive services firm providing financial management leadership to companies in every industry, regardless of size, throughout the United States. As further discussed in
 Note 22 
 , "Segmented Information," CSuite is included in the Kingsway Search Xcelerator segment. This acquisition was the Company s
 second acquisition under its novel CEO Accelerator program and further expands the Company s portfolio of businesses with recurring revenue and low capital intensity.

The Company acquired CSuite for aggregate cash consideration of approximately million, less certain escrowed amounts for purposes of indemnification claims and working capital adjustments. The Company will also pay additional contingent consideration, only to the extent earned, in an aggregate amount of up to million, which is subject to certain conditions, including the successful achievement o f certain financial metrics for CSuite during the three -year period commencing on the first full calendar month following the acquisition date. 

This acquisition was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. The purchase price was provisionally allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition and are subject to adjustment during a measurement period subsequent to the acquisition date, not to exceed one -year as permitted under U.S. GAAP. The Company expects to complete its purchase price allocation in early 2023. These estimates, allocations and calculations are subject to change as we obtain further information; therefore, the final fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed could change from the estimates included in these consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Refer to Note 9 , "Intangible Assets ," for further disclosure of the intangible assets related to this acquisition. The goodwill of million represents the premium paid over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired, which the Company paid to grow its portfolio of companies and acquire an assembled workforce. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration obligation at the acquisition date of zero was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation based on forecasted future results. 
 
 The following table summarizes t he preliminary e stimated allocation of the CSuite assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition: 

Service fee receivable 
 Other receivables 
 Goodwill 
 Intangible asset not subject to amortization - trade name 
 Intangible asset subject to amortization - customer relationships

The Company's businesses have generated substantial operating losses in prior years. These losses can be available to reduce income taxes that might otherwise be incurred on future taxable income; however, it is uncertain whether the Company will generate the taxable income necessary to utilize these losses or other reversing temporary differences. This uncertainty has caused management to place a full valuation allowance on its December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 net deferred income tax assets, excluding the deferred income tax asset and liability amounts set forth in the paragraph below. 
 
 In 2022 , the Company (i) increased by million its valuation allowance associated with business interest expense carryforwards with an indefinite life; and (ii) increased by million its valuation allowance relating to a change in indefinite life deferred income tax liabilities. 
 
 In 2021 , the Company (i) released into income million of its valuation allowance associated with business interest expense carryforwards with an indefinite life and (ii) released into income million and million of its valuation allowance, as a result of its acquisitions of PWI and Ravix, respectively, due to net deferred income tax liabilities that are expected to reverse during the period in which the Company will have deferred income tax assets available. 

The Company carries net deferred income tax liabilities of million and million at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 , respectively, that consists of:

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act") modified the U.S. net operating loss deduction, effective with respect to losses arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. The Tax Act, however, did not limit the utilization, in 2018 and later tax years, of U.S. net operating losses generated in 2017 and prior tax years. 
 
 Amounts, originating dates and expiration dates of the KFSI Tax Group's consolidated U.S. net operating loss carryforwards, totaling million , are as follows:

 2013 2033 
 2014 2034 
 2016 2036 
 2017 2037 

In addition, not reflected in the table above, are net operating loss carryforwards of (i) million relating to losses generated in separate U.S. tax return years, which losses will expire over various years through 2037 and (ii) million relating to non-U.S. operations, which losses will expire over various years through 2042. 
 
 A reconciliation of the beginning and ending unrecognized tax benefits related to discontinued operations, exclusive of interest and penalties, is as follows:

(a) Potentially dilutive securities consist of unvested restricted stock awards, warrants and convertible preferred stock. Because the Company is reporting a loss from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2021, all potentially dilutive securities outstanding were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss from continuing operations per share since their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. 

Basic earnings (loss) per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income (loss) attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated using weighted-average diluted shares. Weighted-average diluted shares is calculated by adding the effect of potentially dilutive securities to weighted-average common shares outstanding. Potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the diluted earnings (loss) per share computation in loss periods and when the applicable exercise price is greater than the market price on the period end date as their effect would be anti-dilutive. 
 
 The following weighted-average potentially dilutive securities are not included in the diluted earnings (loss) per share calculations above because they would have had an antidilutive effect on the earnings (loss) per share:

 On November 1, 2022, the Company modified the inputs related to the IRR portion of the 2021 Ravix RUA to be based on the combined internal rate of return of Ravix and CSuite. The modified portion of the awards was probable of vesting both immediately before and after the modification. As a result, the fair value of the award that is subject to the IRR was measured at the modification date and compared to the fair value of the modified portion of the award immediately prior to the modification, with the difference resulting in incremental compensation expense of less than million. The incremental fair value was estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation model, using the following assumptions at the modification date: expected term of years, expected volatility of and risk-free interest rate of 4.44 ; and the following assumptions prior to the modification: expected term of years, expected volatility of and risk-free interest rate of 4.44 .

The Company classifies its investments in fixed maturities as available-for-sale and reports these investments at fair value. The Company's equity investments, limited liability investments, at fair value, real estate investments, subordinated debt, stock-based compensation liabilities, derivative contracts (interest rate swap and trust preferred debt repurchase options) and contingent consideration ar e measured and reported at fair value. 
 
 Fixed maturities - Fair values of fixed maturities for which no active market exists are derived from quoted market prices of similar instruments or other third -party evidence. All classes of the Company s fixed maturities, primarily consisting of investments in US. Treasury bills and government bonds; obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions; mortgage-backed securities; and corporate securities, are classified as Level 2. Level 2 is applied to valuations based upon quoted prices for similar assets in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are inactive; or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 
 
 The Company engages a third -party vendor who utilizes third -party pricing sources and primarily employs a market approach to determine the fair values of our fixed maturities. The market approach includes primarily obtaining prices from independent third -party pricing services as well as, to a lesser extent, quotes from broker-dealers. Our third -party vendor also monitors market indicators, as well as industry and economic events, to ensure pricing is appropriate. All classes of our fixed maturities are valued using this technique. The Company has obtained an understanding of our third -party vendor s valuation methodologies and inputs. Fair values obtained from our third -party vendor are not adjusted by the Company. 
 
 The following is a description of the significant inputs, by asset class, used by the third -party pricing services to determine the fair values of our fixed maturities included in Level 2: 
 
 U.S. government, government agencies and authorities are generally priced using the market approach. Inputs generally consist of trades of identical or similar securities, quoted prices in inactive markets and maturity. 
 
 States, municipalities and political subdivisions are generally priced using the market approach. Inputs generally consist of trades of identical or similar securities, quoted prices in inactive markets, new issuances and credit spreads. 
 
 Mortgage-backed securities are generally priced using the market approach. Inputs generally consist of trades of identical or similar securities, quoted prices in inactive markets, expected prepayments, expected credit default rates, delinquencies and issue specific information including, but not limited to, collateral type, seniority and vintage. 
 
 Corporate securities are generally priced using the market approach using pricing vendors. Inputs generally consist of trades of identical or similar securities, quoted prices in inactive markets, issuer rating, benchmark yields, maturity and credit spreads. 

Equity investments - Fair values of equity investments, including warrants, reflect quoted market values based on latest bid prices, where active markets exist, or models based on significant market observable inputs, where no active markets exist. 
 
 Limited liability investments, at fair value - Limited liability investments, at fair value include the underlying investments of Net Lease and Argo Holdings. Net Lease owns investments in limited liability companies that hold investment properties. Argo Holdings makes investments in limited liability companies and limited partnerships that hold investments in search funds and private operating companies. 
 
 The fair value of Net Lease's investments in limited liability companies is based upon the net asset values of the underlying investments in companies as a practical expedient to estimate fair value. The Company applies the net asset value practical expedient to Net Lease's limited liability investments on an investment-by-investment basis unless it is probable that the Company will sell a portion of an investment at an amount different from the net asset value of the investment. Investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value practical expedient are not required to be classified using the fair value hierarchy. 
 
 The fair value of Argo Holdings' limited liability investments that hold investments in search funds is based on the initial investment in the search funds. The fair value of Argo Holdings' limited liability investments that hold investments in private operating companies is valued using a market approach including valuation multiples applied to corresponding performance metrics, such as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization; revenue; or net earnings. The selected valuation multiples were estimated using multiples provided by the investees and review of those multiples in light of investor updates, performance reports, financial statements and other relevant information. These investments are categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Real estate investments - The fair value of real estate investments involves a combination of the market and income valuation techniques. Under this approach, a market-based capitalization rate is derived from comparable transactions, adjusted for any unique characteristics of each asset, and applied to the asset under consideration. The cap rates used during underwriting and subsequent valuation incorporate the consideration of risks of vacancy and collection loss, administrative costs of owning net leased assets and possible capital expenditures that could be determined a landlord expense. These investments are categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 
 Subordinated debt - The fair value of the subordinated debt is calculated using a model based on significant market observable inputs and inputs developed by a third -party. These inputs include credit spread assumptions developed by a third -party and market observable swap rates. The subordinated debt is categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 
 Stock-based compensation liabilities - C ert ain of the restricted stock awards granted by PWSC were classified as a liability prior to the sale of PWSC on July 29, 2022. Liability-classified awards are measured and reported at fair value and are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the liability-classified awards granted by PWSC were estimated using an internal valuation model without relevant observable market inputs. The significant inputs used in the model include a valuation multiple applied to trailing twelve month earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. Liability-classified PWSC restricted stock awards were categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Derivative contract interest rate swap - As described in Note 11 , "Derivatives," t he Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement effective April 1, 2021 to convert the variable interest rate on a portion of the 2020 KWH Loan to a fixed interest rate. The interest rate swap contract is measured and reported at fair value and is included in other receivables and accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 , respectively. The fair value of the interest rate swap contract is estimated using inputs which the Company obtains from the counterparty and is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of the derivative. The discounted cash flow valuation technique reflects the contractual term of the derivative contract, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market based inputs, including quoted mid-market prices or third -party consensus pricing, interest rate curves and implied volatilities. The interest rate swap contract is categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 
 Derivative contracts - trust preferred debt repurchase options - As described i n Note 11 , "Derivatives," the Company entered into TruPs Options contracts during the third quarter of 2022. The TruPs Options contracts are measured and reported at fair value and are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2022 . The fair value of the TruPs Options contracts are estimated using the binomial lattice model. Key inputs in the valuation include credit spread assumptions, interest rate volatility, debt coupon interest rate and time to maturity. The TruPs Options contracts are categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 
 Contingent consideration - The consideration for the Company's acquisitions of Ravix and CSuite includes future payments to the former owners that are contingent upon the achievement of certain targets over future reporting periods. Liabilities for contingent consideration are measured and reported at fair value and are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Contingent consideration liabilities are revalued each reporting period. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or multiple inpu ts, including adjustments to the discount rates or changes in the assumed achievement or timing of any targets. Any changes in fair value are reported in the consolidated statements of operations as non-operating other (expense) reven ue. T he contingent consideration liabilities are categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 
 The fair value of Ravix's contingent consideration liability is estimated by applying the Monte Carlo simulation method to forecast achievement of gross profit which may result in up to million in total payments to the former owners of Ravix through October 2024 . Key inputs in the valuation include forecasted gross profit, gross profit volatility, discount rate and discount term. 
 The fair value of CSuite's contingent consideration liability is estimated by applying the Monte Carlo simulation method to forecast achievement of gross revenue which may result in up to million in total payments to the former owners of CSuite through November 2025 . Key inputs in the valuation include forecasted gross revenue, gross revenue volatility, discount rate and discount term.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
 
 Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including assets that are adjusted for observable price changes or written down to fair value as a result of an impairment. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 , the Company did not record any adjustments to the fair value of its investments in private companies for observable price changes. The Company did not record any impairments related to investments in private companies for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 . To determine the fair value of investments in these private companies, the Company considered rounds of financing and third -party transactions, discounted cash flow analyses and market-based information, including comparable transactions, trading multiples and changes in market outlook, among other factors. The Company has classified the fair value measurements of these investments in private companies as Level 3 because they involve significant unobservable inputs.

 Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company s management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports the Company files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, the Company s management recognizes that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Our disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to meet reasonable assurance standards. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints that require the Company s management to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 
 
 Based on this evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company's disclosure controls and proce dures are not effective as a result of one unremediated material weakness in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that was discovered during the course of the 2018 external audit of the accounts, relating to the accounting for and disclosure of certain complex and nonrecurring transactions as it specifically pertains to the adoption and application of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("ASU 2014-09"). Not all material weaknesses necessarily present the same risks from period to period as a result of differing events and transactions which have occurred or may occur in current and future periods . 
 
 Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company's management evaluated the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on that evaluation, the Company s management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal controls over financial rep orting are not effective because of the existence of one unremediated material weakness in internal control over financial reporting, that was discovered during the course of the 2018 external audit of the accounts, relating to the accounting for and disclosure of certain complex and nonrecurring transactions as it specifically pertains to the adoption and application of ASU 2014-09 . 
 
 Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A material weakness is defined as a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 
 With respect to the inadequate design accounting for and operation of internal disclosure of certain complex and nonrecurring transactions, the execution of the controls over the application of accounting literature did not operate effectively with respect to the adoption and application of ASU 2014-09. This matter was discovered during the course of the 2018 external audit of the accounts and was reviewed with the Company's Audit Committee. 
 
 As a result of this material weakness, the Company s management directed a comprehensive review of its consolidated financial statements to assess the possibility of further material misstatements that may remain unidentified. As a result of such review, and notwithstanding the material weakness described above, the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that the audited consolidated financial statements contained in this 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the fiscal years presented in conformity with U.S. GAAP. 
 
 Remediation Process 
 
 In 2022, the Company directed its internal audit department to conduct a thorough review of the material revenue processes. The review is in its final stages, which has preliminarily indicated no material issues. The Company expects to use the final results of this review in early 2023 to implement a remediation plan for this final material weakness. 
 
 The actions that the Company is taking are subject to ongoing senior management review as well as Audit Committee oversight. The Company is committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment and believes that these remediation efforts will represent significant improvements in its controls.
