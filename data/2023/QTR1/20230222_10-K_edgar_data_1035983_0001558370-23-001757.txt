 PART I The terms Comfort Systems, we, us, or the Company refer to Comfort Systems USA, Inc. or Comfort Systems USA, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, as appropriate in the context. ITEM 1. Business Comfort Systems USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was established in 1997. We provide mechanical and electrical contracting services. Our mechanical segment principally includes heating, ventilation and air conditioning HVAC ), plumbing, piping and controls, as well as off-site construction, monitoring and fire protection. Our electrical segment includes installation and servicing of electrical systems. We build, install, maintain, repair and replace mechanical, electrical and plumbing MEP systems throughout our 42 operating units with 169 locations in 128 cities throughout the United States. We operate primarily in the commercial, industrial and institutional MEP markets and perform most of our services in industrial, healthcare, education, office, technology, retail and government facilities. Substantially all of our consolidated 2022 revenue was derived from commercial, industrial and institutional customers and multi-family residential projects. Approximately 48.6 of our revenue was attributable to installation services in newly constructed facilities and 51.4 was attributable to renovation, expansion, maintenance, repair and replacement services in existing buildings. Our consolidated 2022 revenue was derived from the following service industries: 

Percentage of Service Activity Revenue Mechanical Services 76.8 Electrical Services 23.2 Total 100.0 Industry Overview We believe that commercial, industrial, and institutional mechanical and electrical contracting generate annual revenue in the United States of approximately 350 billion. Mechanical and electrical systems are necessary to virtually all commercial, industrial and institutional buildings. Because most buildings are sealed, HVAC systems provide the primary method of circulating fresh air in such buildings. Replacing an aging building s existing systems with modern, energy-efficient systems significantly reduces a building s energy consumption, carbon footprint, and operating costs while improving air quality and overall system effectiveness. Older commercial, industrial and institutional facilities frequently have poor air quality and provide less comfortable environments, and older HVAC systems result in significantly higher energy consumption than do modern systems. As electrical systems age, they require service and replacement, and changing building configurations and technological power load requirements lead to the need to reconfigure and improve electrical systems in buildings on a regular basis. Many factors affect mechanical and electrical services industry growth, including but not limited to, (i) population growth, which increases the need for commercial, industrial and institutional space, (ii) an aging installed base of buildings and equipment, (iii) increasing sophistication, complexity and efficiency of mechanical and electrical systems, and (iv) growing emphasis on internal air quality, environmental sustainability and energy efficiency. Our industry can be broadly divided into two categories: construction of and installation in new buildings, which provided approximately 48.6 of our revenue in 2022, and renovation, expansion, maintenance, repair and replacement in existing buildings, which provided the remaining 51.4 of our 2022 revenue. 
 Construction, Installation, Expansion and Renovation Services Construction, installation, expansion and renovation services consist of design and build and plan and spec projects. In design and build projects, the commercial MEP company is responsible for designing, engineering and installing a cost-effective, energy-efficient system customized to the specific needs of the building owner. Costs and other project terms are normally negotiated

 between the building owner or its representative and the contracting company. Companies that specialize in design and build projects use a consultative approach with customers and tend to develop long-term relationships with building owners and developers, general contractors, architects, consulting engineers and property managers. Plan and spec installation refers to projects in which a third-party architect or consulting engineer designs the MEP systems and the installation project is put out for bid. We believe that plan and spec projects usually take longer to complete and frequently result in less efficient outcomes than design and build projects because the system design and installation process are not integrated, thus resulting in more frequent adjustments to project specifications, work requirements and schedules. Our investments in design and building information modeling enable us to collaborate with our customers to achieve reliable and energy efficient construction outcomes and to eliminate unnecessary waste. Maintenance, Repair and Replacement Services The Company s services further include maintaining, repairing, replacing, reconfiguring and monitoring previously installed systems and building automation controls. The growth and aging of the installed base of MEP and related systems, changing requirements due to increasing technology deployment and the demand for more efficient systems and more capable building automation controls have fueled growth in these services. The increasing complexity of these systems leads many commercial, industrial and institutional building owners and property managers to outsource maintenance and repair, often through service agreements with service providers. State-of-the-art control and monitoring systems feature electronic sensors and microprocessors that are crucial to energy efficient operations. These systems require specialized training to install, maintain and repair. We believe that the work we perform to optimize and upgrade systems and to enable wise controls helps Comfort Systems USA to optimize energy use and fundamentally reduce our nation s carbon footprint. Strategy We focus on strengthening core operating competencies, on leading in sustainability, efficiency and technological improvement, and on increasing profit margins. The key objectives of our strategy are to improve profitability and generate growth in our operations, to enable sustainable and efficient building environments, to improve the productivity of our workforce, and to acquire complementary businesses. Specifically, we are currently focused on the following elements: Achieve Excellence in Core Competencies We have identified seven core competencies that we believe are critical to attracting and retaining customers, increasing operating income and cash flow, and maximizing the productivity of our skilled labor force. The seven core competencies are: (i) safety, (ii) customer service, (iii) design and build expertise, (iv) effective pre-construction processes, (v) job and cost tracking, (vi) leadership in energy efficient and sustainable design, and (vii) best-in-class servicing of existing building systems. Achieve Operating Efficiencies We think we can achieve operating efficiencies and cost savings through purchasing economies, adopting best practices, and focusing on efficient job management. We are continually improving the job loop at our locations qualifying, estimating, pricing, and executing projects effectively and efficiently. We also use our combined spend to gain purchasing advantages on products and services such as MEP components, raw materials, services, vehicles, bonding, insurance, and employee benefits. Attract, Retain and Invest in our Employees We seek to attract and retain quality employees by providing them an enhanced career path that offers a stable income, attractive benefits packages, and excellent growth opportunities. We continually invest in training, including programs for project managers, field superintendents, service managers, service technicians, sales managers, estimators, and leadership and development of key managers and leaders. We believe that skilled labor forces in the building and services trades have become increasingly scarce and valuable, and we are increasingly focused on growing and improving our skilled labor force, including through recruitment, development, and skills training for our hourly workers. Focus on Industrial, Commercial and Institutional Markets We focus on the industrial, commercial, and institutional building markets, including construction, maintenance, repair, and replacement services. We believe that these complex markets are attractive because of their growth opportunities, large and diverse customer base, attractive margins, and potential for long-term relationships with building owners. Leverage Resources and Capabilities We believe significant operating efficiencies can be achieved by leveraging resources among our operating locations. We have shifted certain fabrication activities to centralized locations to increase asset utilization. We opportunistically allocate our engineering, field, and supervisory labor from

 one operation to another to use our employee base more fully, meet our customers needs and share expertise. Our ability to share resources frequently allows us to pursue work that would otherwise not be available to us and allows us to provide a more diversified and steady deployment of our labor. We believe that we have realized scale benefits from coordinated purchasing, technical innovation, insurance, benefits, bonding, and financing activities across our operations. Maintain a Diverse Customer, Geographic, and Project Base We have a distribution of revenue across end-use sectors that we believe reduces our exposure to negative developments in any given sector. We also have significant geographical diversification across all regions of the United States, again reducing our exposure to negative developments in any given region. Our distribution of revenue in 2022 by end-use sector was as follows: 

Industrial 47.7 Healthcare 14.1 Education 10.8 Office Buildings 8.4 Retail, Restaurants and Entertainment 7.5 Government 6.2 Multi-Family and Residential 3.0 Other 2.3 Total 100.0 Approximately 87.0 of our revenue is earned on a project basis for installation of systems in newly constructed or existing facilities. As of December 31, 2022, we had 10,636 projects in process with an aggregate contract value of approximately 9.3 billion. Our average project takes six to nine months to complete, with an average contract price of approximately 875,000. This average project size, when taken together with the approximately 13.0 of our revenue derived from maintenance and service, provides us with a broad base of work in the construction services sector. A stratification of projects in progress as of December 31, 2022, by contract price, is as follows: Aggregate Contract No. of Price Value Contract Price of Project Projects (millions) Under 2 million 9,812 1,628.5 2 million - 10 million 610 2,698.6 10 million - 20 million 112 1,645.6 20 million - 40 million 82 2,345.3 Greater than 40 million 20 985.2 Total 10,636 9,303.2 Develop and Adopt Leading Technologies We are improving productivity by increasing use of innovative techniques in prefabrication, project design and planning, as well as in coordination and production methods. We have invested in the refinement and adoption of prefabrication practices. We work to identify, develop, and implement new materials, products and methods that can achieve greater productivity and more efficient and sustainable outcomes. Above all, we have concluded that as technology develops in our industry the fundamental prerequisite for leadership is adopting such opportunities in the quality, accuracy, and buildability of our designs. Accordingly, we have invested in the experts, training, and internal and external knowledge transfer to ensure that we are properly scaling, achieving true buildability, and fundamentally and continuously improving our design capabilities to meet our customers evolving requirements. Our goal is to use our scale and strategic investments to maintain a leading position in design and modeling excellence, optimize productivity and quality, and ultimately position ourselves to capitalize from ongoing or future technological developments. Excel at Modular and Off-Site Construction We believe that modular and off-site construction the ability to build superior quality plants and systems away from the construction site will become increasingly important in complex construction projects. Accordingly, through our acquisitions, we have invested in that capability, and after acquisition we have further invested in improving and growing that service offering. This has led to meaningful growth in our ability to provide this expertise. Through recent and ongoing development and acquisitions, we plan to continue to improve on our unmatched capability in mechanical off-site or modular construction.

 Service Growth Initiative Over the last several years we have made substantial investments to expand our service and maintenance revenue by increasing the value we can offer to service and maintenance customers. We are actively concentrating managerial and sales resources on training and hiring experienced employees to sell and profitably perform service work. In many locations we have added or upgraded our capability, and we believe our investments and efforts have provided customer value and stimulated growth in all aspects of our businesses. Seek Growth through Acquisitions We believe that we can further increase our cash flow and operating income by continuing to opportunistically enter new markets or service lines through acquisition. We have dedicated a significant portion of our cash flow on an ongoing basis to seeking opportunities to acquire businesses that have strong assembled workforces, excellent historical safety performance, leading design and energy efficiency capabilities, attractive market positions, a record of consistent positive cash flow, and desirable market locations. Operations and Services Provided We provide a wide range of construction, renovation, expansion, maintenance, repair and replacement services for MEP and related systems in commercial, industrial and institutional properties. Our local management teams maintain responsibility for day-to-day operating decisions. Local management is augmented by regional leadership that focuses on core business competencies, regional financial performance, cooperation and coordination between locations, implementing best practices and corporate initiatives. In addition to senior management, local personnel generally include design engineers, energy efficiency and sustainability experts, sales personnel, customer service personnel, installation and service technicians, sheet metal and prefabrication technicians, estimators and administrative personnel. We have centralized certain administrative functions such as insurance, employee benefits, training, safety programs, marketing and cash management to enable our local operating management to focus on pursuing new business opportunities and improving operating efficiencies. Construction and Installation Services for New Buildings Our installation business related to newly constructed facilities, which comprised approximately 48.6 of our consolidated 2022 revenue, involves the design, engineering, integration, installation and start-up of MEP and related systems. We provide design and build and plan and spec installation services for office buildings, retail centers, manufacturing plants, healthcare, education and government facilities and other commercial, industrial and institutional facilities. In a design and build installation, we work with the customer to determine the needed capacity and to optimize energy efficiency of the MEP systems that best suit the proposed facility. The final design, terms, price and timing of the project are then negotiated with the customer or its representatives, after which any necessary modifications are made to the system plan. In plan and spec installation, we participate in a bid process to provide labor, equipment, materials and installation based on the end user s plans and engineering specifications. Once an agreement has been reached, we order the necessary materials and equipment for delivery to meet the project schedule. In many instances we fabricate ductwork, conduit and piping and assemble certain components for the system based on the mechanical drawing specifications. Finally, we install the systems at the project site, working closely with the owner or general contractor. Our average project takes six to nine months to complete, with an average contract price of approximately 875,000. We also perform larger project work, with 824 contracts in progress at December 31, 2022 with contract prices in excess of 2 million. Our largest project in progress at December 31, 2022 had a contract price of 74.5 million. Project contracts typically provide for periodic billings to the customer as we meet progress milestones or incur cost on the project. Project contracts in our industry also frequently allow for a small portion of progress billings or contract price to be withheld by the customer until after we have completed the work. Amounts withheld under this practice are known as retention or retainage. Renovation, Expansion, Maintenance, Monitoring, Repair and Replacement Services for Existing Buildings Our renovation, expansion, maintenance, monitoring, repair and replacement services in existing buildings comprised approximately 51.4 of our consolidated 2022 revenue. Maintenance and repair services are provided either in response to service calls or under a service agreement. Service calls are coordinated by customer service representatives or dispatchers that use computer and communication technology to process orders, arrange service calls, dispatch technicians and communicate with and invoice customers. Service technicians work from service vehicles equipped with commonly used parts, supplies and tools to complete a variety of jobs. Optimal maintenance is crucial to energy efficient operations. Commercial, industrial and institutional service agreements usually have terms of one or more years, with automatic annual renewals, and frequently include thirty- to sixty-day cancellation notice periods. We also provide remote monitoring of power usage, temperature, pressure, humidity and air flow for MEP and other building systems.

 Sources of Supply The raw materials and components we use include MEP system components, ductwork, pipe, conduit, wire, electrical fixtures, steel, sheet metal and copper tubing and piping. These raw materials and components are generally available from a variety of domestic or foreign suppliers at competitive prices. In ordinary times, delivery times are typically short for most raw materials and standard components, but during periods of peak demand, including as we continue to experience the effects of the pandemic, may extend to several months. We estimate that direct purchase of commodities and finished products comprises between 40 and 45 of our average project cost. We have procedures to reduce commodity cost exposure such as purchasing commodities early for projects, as well as selectively including time or market-based escalation and escape provisions in bids and contracts. Chillers, electrical switch gear and generators for large applications typically have the longest delivery time and frequently have lead times of six months or even longer. The major components of commercial MEP systems are compressors and chillers that are manufactured primarily by Carrier, Lennox, Daikin, Trane, and York. The major suppliers of building automation control systems are Automated Logic, Cisco, Delta, Distech Controls, Honeywell, Johnson Controls, Rockwell Automation, Schneider Electric, Siemens, Trane, and York. The major suppliers of electrical switchgear and generators are Caterpillar, Cummins, Eaton and Schneider Electric. We do not have any significant contracts guaranteeing us a supply of raw materials or components. Cyclicality and Seasonality The construction industry is subject to business cycle fluctuation. As a result, our volume of business, particularly in new construction projects and renovation, may be adversely affected by declines in new installation and replacement projects in various geographic regions of the United States during periods of economic weakness. The mechanical and electrical contracting industries are also subject to seasonal variations. The demand for new installation and replacement is generally lower during the winter months (the first quarter of the year) due to reduced construction activity during inclement weather and less use of air conditioning during the colder months. Demand for our services is generally higher in the second and third calendar quarters due to increased construction activity and increased use of air conditioning during the warmer months. Accordingly, we expect our revenue and operating results generally will be lower in the first calendar quarter. Sales and Marketing We have a diverse customer base, with our top customer representing 8 of consolidated 2022 revenue, and our largest customer often changes from year to year. Management and a dedicated sales force are responsible for developing and maintaining successful long-term relationships with key customers. Customers generally include building owners and developers and property managers, as well as general contractors, architects and consulting engineers. We intend to continue our emphasis on developing and maintaining long-term relationships with our customers by providing superior, high-quality service in a professional manner. We believe we can continue to leverage the diverse technical and marketing strengths at individual locations to expand the services offered in other local markets. With respect to multi-location service opportunities, we maintain a national sales force in our national accounts group. Human Capital Resources Employees As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 14,100 employees as compared to approximately 13,200 employees as of December 31, 2021. We have collective bargaining agreements covering 12 employees. We have not experienced and do not expect any significant strikes or work stoppages and believe our relations with employees covered by collective bargaining agreements are good. Culture and Core Values Our values define, inform, and guide the way we operate both within our Company and in the communities where we do business. Our core values are to be safe; be honest; be respectful; be innovative; and be collaborative. These values set the foundation for our Code of Conduct, which applies to all employees, officers, and directors of the Comfort Systems USA family of companies. The Code of Conduct is regularly reinforced to the Company s employees and management through periodic ethics, equal opportunity employment, and anti-corruption trainings. In addition, certain business partners, such as consultants, agents, suppliers, contractors, and other third 
 7 

Table of Contents 
 parties, serve as an extension of the Company. They are expected to follow the spirit of our Code of Conduct, all applicable laws, and any applicable contractual provisions when working on our behalf. We believe that the way we conduct business is just as important as the business we do. Operating with integrity helps us deliver on the promises we have made to each other, our customers, and the communities where we live and work. It is also the basis for ensuring continued growth and success. Everyone at our Company shares a responsibility for doing business ethically and in a sustainable manner, preserving our good name. We ensure that this responsibility applies at every level in our organization, and everyone from corporate officers to members of our Board of Directors, to our field personnel is responsible for overseeing these efforts. Recruiting and Training Our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified engineers, service technicians, field supervisors and project managers. We believe our success in retaining qualified employees will be based on the quality of our recruiting, training, compensation, employee benefits programs and opportunities for advancement. We provide numerous training programs for management, sales, and leadership, as well as on-the-job training, technical training, apprenticeship programs, attractive benefit packages and career advancement opportunities within our Company. Safety We have established comprehensive safety programs throughout our operations to ensure that all employees comply with safety standards we have established and that are established under federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Safety leadership establishes safety programs and benchmarking to improve safety across the Company. Additionally, our employment screening process seeks to determine that prospective employees have requisite skills, sufficient background references and acceptable driving records, if applicable. Our rate of incidents recordable under the standards of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA per one hundred employees per year, also known as the OSHA recordable rate, was 1.01 during 2022. This level was 33 better than the most recently published OSHA rate for our industry. Diversity and Inclusion We are an equal opportunity employer, and we welcome and celebrate our teams differences, experiences, and beliefs. We expect all employees to be treated with dignity and respect in an environment free from discrimination and harassment regardless of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, genetic information, or any other protected class. We know that diversity is truly a competitive advantage that helps drive growth and innovation, and we have increasingly focused on diversity and inclusion programs within our Company. Diversity and inclusion are among our leadership team s top priorities, with clearly outlined near-term actions to accelerate progress in outreach, representation, development, and advancement of underrepresented groups within our Company. Our Board of Directors and Board committees provide oversight on certain human capital matters, including our diversity and inclusion strategy. Insurance and Litigation The primary insured risks in our operations are bodily injury, property damage and workers compensation injuries. We retain the risk for workers compensation, employer s liability, auto liability, general liability and employee group health claims resulting from uninsured deductibles per-incident or occurrence. Because we have very large per incident deductibles, the vast majority of our claims are paid by us, so as a practical matter we self-insure the great majority of these risks. Losses up to such per-incident deductible amounts are estimated and accrued based upon known facts, historical trends and industry averages using the assistance of an actuary to project the extent of these obligations. We are subject to certain claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business. We maintain various insurance coverages to minimize financial risk associated with these claims. We have estimated and provided accruals for probable losses and related legal fees associated with certain litigation in our consolidated financial statements. While we cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings, in our opinion and based on reports of counsel, any liability arising from these matters individually and in the aggregate will not have a material effect on our operating results, cash flows or financial condition, after giving effect to provisions already recorded. We typically warrant labor for the first year after installation on new MEP systems that we build and install, and we pass through to the customer manufacturers warranties on equipment. We generally warrant labor for thirty days after servicing existing MEP systems. We do not expect warranty claims to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.

 Competition The mechanical and electrical contracting industries are highly competitive and consist of thousands of local and regional companies. We believe that purchasing decisions in the commercial, industrial, and institutional markets are based on (i) competitive price, (ii) relationships, (iii) quality, timeliness, and reliability, (iv) tenure, financial strength, and access to bonding, (v) range of capabilities, and (vi) scale of operation. To improve our competitive position, we focus on both the consultative design and build installation market and the maintenance, repair, and replacement market to develop and strengthen customer relationships. In addition, we believe our ability to provide multi-location coverage and a broad range of services gives us a strategic advantage over smaller competitors who may have more limited resources and capabilities. We believe that we are larger than most of our competitors, which are generally small, owner-operated companies in a specific area. However, there are divisions of larger contracting companies, utilities and MEP equipment manufacturers that provide MEP services in some of the same service lines and geographic areas we serve. Some of these competitors and potential competitors have greater financial resources than we do to finance development opportunities and support their operations. We believe our smaller competitors generally compete with us based on price and their long-term relationships with local customers. Our larger competitors compete with us on those factors but may also provide attractive financing and comprehensive service and product packages. Vehicles We operate a fleet of various owned or leased service trucks, vans and support vehicles. We believe these vehicles generally are well maintained and sufficient for our current operations. Climate Change and Sustainability We recognize our environmental and societal responsibilities and are committed to sustainability and to improving our environmental footprint as well as operating our business in a manner that seeks to protect the health and safety of our employees, customers, and the public. Our focus on environmental stewardship and improving productivity drives not only our efforts to become more energy efficient but also improvements in our customers impact on climate change. Replacing an aging building s existing systems with modern, energy-efficient systems significantly reduces a building s energy consumption and carbon footprint while improving cost, air quality, and overall system effectiveness. We are subject to the requirements of numerous federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and rules that promote the protection of the environment. While capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not currently anticipate that they will have a material effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position in the short term. Additionally, we have increased our voluntary reporting through a submission to CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), wherein, among other things, we disclosed the results of our first annual greenhouse gas emissions inventory. Such additional reporting is a continuation of our efforts to adhere to voluntary reporting standards. For example, in 2022, we received a silver medal as a result of our EcoVadis submission, and we published our second sustainability report (i) following the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures TCFD and the Sustainability Accounting Standard Board s SASB standards for the Engineering and Construction Services industry, and (ii) in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative GRI Standards: Core option. Finally, we have published a number of new policies and guidelines related to environmental, social and governance matters, including: a Supplier Diversity Policy, a Supplier Code of Conduct, an Environmental Policy and a Labor Human Rights Policy. Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, including: (i) licensing requirements applicable to engineering, construction and service technicians, (ii) building and MEP codes and zoning ordinances, (iii) regulations relating to consumer protection, including those governing residential service agreements, (iv) special bidding and procurement requirements on government projects, (v) wage and hour regulations, and (vi) regulations relating to worker safety and protection of the environment. For example, our operations are subject to the requirements of OSHA and comparable state laws directed towards protection of employees. We believe we have all required licenses to conduct our operations and are in substantial compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. If 
 9 

Table of Contents 
 we fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could be subject to substantial fines or revocation of our operating licenses. Many state and local regulations governing the MEP services trades require individuals to hold permits and licenses. In some cases, a required permit or license held by a single individual may be sufficient to authorize specified activities for all of our service technicians who work in the state or county that issued the permit or license. We seek to ensure that, where possible, we have two employees who hold any such permits or licenses that may be material to our operations in a particular geographic region. Our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act, as amended, which governs air emissions and imposes specific requirements on the use and handling of ozone-depleting refrigerants generally classified as chlorofluorocarbons CFCs or hydrochlorofluorocarbons HCFCs ). Clean Air Act regulations promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency USEPA require the certification of service technicians involved in the service or repair of equipment containing these refrigerants and also regulate the containment and recycling of these refrigerants. These requirements have increased our training expenses and expenditures for containment and recycling equipment. The Clean Air Act is intended ultimately to eliminate the use of ozone-depleting substances such as CFCs and HCFCs in the United States and to require alternative refrigerants to be used in replacement HVAC systems. Some replacement refrigerants, already in use, and classified as hydrofluorocarbons HFCs are not ozone-depleting substances. HFCs are considered by USEPA to have high global warming potential. USEPA may at some point require the phase-out of HFCs and expand existing technician certification requirements to cover the handling of HFCs. We do not believe the existing regulations governing technician certification requirements for the handling of ozone-depleting substances or possible future regulations applicable to HFCs will materially affect our business on the whole because, although they require us to incur modest ongoing training costs, our competitors also incur such costs, and such regulations may encourage or require our customers to update their MEP systems.

 Risks Related to Our Business Economic downturns in the markets in which we operate may materially and adversely affect our business because our business is dependent on levels of construction activity. The demand for our services is dependent upon the existence of construction projects and service requirements within the markets in which we operate. Any period of economic recession affecting a market or industry in which we transact business is likely to adversely impact our business. Many of the projects we work on have long lifecycles from conception to completion, and the bulk of our performance generally occurs late in a construction project s lifecycle. We experience the results of economic trends well after an economic cycle begins, and therefore have generally continued to experience the results of an economic recession well after conditions in the general economy have improved. The industries and markets in which we operate have always been and will continue to be vulnerable to macroeconomic downturns because they are cyclical in nature. When there is a reduction in demand, it often leads to greater price competition as well as decreased revenue and profit. The lasting effects of a recession can also increase economic instability with our vendors, subcontractors, developers, and general contractors, which can increase our liability exposure and result in us not being paid in full or at all on some projects, thus decreasing our revenue and profit. Further, to the extent some of our vendors, subcontractors, developers, or general contractors seek bankruptcy protection, such bankruptcy will likely force us to incur additional costs in attorneys fees, as well as other professional consultants, and will result in decreased revenue and profit. Additionally, because 6.2 of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 was attributable to projects in the government sector, a reduction in federal, state, or local government spending in our industries and markets could result in decreased revenue and profit for us. Because we bear the risk of cost overruns in most of our contracts, we may experience reduced profits or, in some cases, losses under these contracts if costs increase above our estimates. Our contract prices are established largely based on estimates and assumptions of our projected costs, including assumptions about: future economic conditions; prices, including commodity prices and inflation; availability of labor, including the costs of providing labor, equipment, and materials; and other factors outside our control. If our estimates or assumptions prove to be inaccurate, circumstances change in a way that renders our assumptions and estimates inaccurate or we fail to successfully execute the work, cost overruns may occur, and we could experience reduced profits or a loss for affected projects. For instance, unanticipated technical problems may arise, we could have difficulty obtaining permits or approvals, local laws, labor costs or labor conditions could change, bad weather could delay construction, raw materials prices could increase, our suppliers or subcontractors may fail to perform as expected or site conditions may be different than we expected. Further rising inflation may result in higher costs for labor and materials needed to complete our contracts, and we may be unable to pass these heightened costs to our customers. We are also exposed to increases in energy prices, particularly as they relate to gasoline prices. Additionally, in certain circumstances, we guarantee project completion or the achievement of certain acceptance and performance testing levels by a scheduled date. Failure to meet schedule or performance requirements typically results in additional costs to us, and in some cases, we may also create liability for consequential and liquidated damages. Performance problems for existing and future projects could cause our actual results of operations to differ materially from those we anticipate and could damage our reputation within our industry and our customer base. Our backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations, which means that amounts included in our backlog may not result in actual revenue or translate into profits. Backlog reflects revenue still to be recognized under contracted or committed installation and replacement project work. Our backlog as of December 31, 2022 was 4.06 billion. The predictive value of backlog information is limited to indications of general revenue direction over the near term, and we cannot guarantee that the revenue projected from our backlog will be realized or, if realized, will be profitable. Projects may remain in our backlog for an extended period of time, or project cancellations or scope adjustments may occur with respect to contracts reflected in our backlog. Such changes may adversely affect the revenues and profit we ultimately realize on these projects.

 The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic repercussions have materially affected how we and our customers, vendors, subcontractors, developers, and general contractors are operating our businesses, and the duration and extent to which this will negatively impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, affected consumer spending and global supply chains, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. We have experienced resulting disruptions to our business operations. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to present potential risks to our business, particularly in light of new variants of the virus which have emerged, such as the Omicron variant and the more recent BA.4 and BA.5 sub-variants of the virus. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial performance, including our ability to execute our near-term and long-term business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, depends on numerous evolving factors outside our control including: emergence of new variants of the virus and increased transmission rates; government, social, business and other actions that have been and will be taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; additional waves of COVID-19 infections; the efficacy of vaccines on new variants of the virus and overall vaccination rates; the effect of government or customer vaccine or testing requirements on employee retention and recruitment; and the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on short- and long-term general economic conditions. Even after the initial COVID-19 outbreak has subsided, we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of its global economic impact. We continue to experience permitting, regulatory, and supply chain delays attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to these current dynamics, the COVID-19 pandemic may create or exacerbate risks related to our operations and regulatory and compliance matters. Even though the initial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may have waned, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows may continue to be adversely affected. We could be adversely impacted by the effects of inflation, supply chain disruptions, capital market volatility and an economic recession or downturn. The global economy is experiencing historically high rates of inflation and market and economic volatility, resulting from a number of factors, including the war between Russia and Ukraine and supply chain constraints. These conditions have increased our cost for labor, materials, utilities, and other goods and services. In addition, the current market conditions have caused volatility in the capital markets, which may increase our cost of capital or prevent us from raising capital if we desire or need to do so and may have adverse impacts on the mechanical and electrical services industry. Further, there are market concerns that the United States economy may be in or soon enter a recession. As a result, these conditions have, and they or any similar future conditions may continue to have, significant adverse impacts on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Rising inflation and/or interest rates may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In efforts to combat inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates multiple times in 2022 and may continue to increase interest rates into 2023. Economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in interest rates, may have a negative impact on our business. For instance, we have exposure to changes in interest rates under our revolving credit facility and as interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, may correspondingly decrease. Furthermore, the cost of our materials, labor, and services may rise as a result of continued inflation and further interest rate hikes, and we may not be able to offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our financial position and results of operations. Intense competition in our industry could reduce our market share and our profit. The markets we serve are highly fragmented and competitive. Our industry is characterized by many small companies whose activities are geographically concentrated. We compete on the basis of our technical expertise and experience, financial and operational resources, nationwide presence, industry reputation and dependability. While we believe our customers consider a number of these factors in awarding available contracts, a large portion of our work is awarded through a bid process. Consequently, price is often the principal factor in determining which contractor is selected, especially on smaller, less complex projects. Smaller competitors are sometimes able to win bids for these 
 12 

Table of Contents 
 projects based on price alone due to their lower cost and financial return requirements. We expect competition to continue in our industry, presenting us with significant challenges in our ability to maintain strong growth rates and acceptable profit margins. We also expect increased competition from in-house service providers because some of our customers have employees who perform service work similar to the services we provide. Vertical consolidation could also contribute to competition in our industry. If we are unable to meet these competitive challenges, we will lose market share to our competitors and experience an overall reduction in our profits. In addition, our profitability would be impaired if we have to reduce our prices to remain competitive. Our recent and future acquisitions may not be successful. We expect to continue pursuing selective acquisitions of businesses. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify acquisitions or that we will be able to consummate transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us, or that acquired businesses will be profitable. Acquisitions may expose us to additional business risks different than those we have traditionally experienced. We also may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses and successfully managing the growth we expect to experience from these acquisitions. We may choose to finance future acquisitions with debt, equity, cash or a combination of the three. Future acquisitions could dilute earnings or disrupt the payment of a stockholder dividend. To the extent we make acquisitions, a number of risks will result, including: the assumption of material liabilities (including for environmental-related costs); failure of due diligence to uncover situations that could result in legal exposure or to quantify the true liability exposure from known risks; the diversion of management s attention from the management of daily operations to the integration of operations; difficulties in the assimilation and retention of employees, in the assimilation of different cultures and practices, in the assimilation of broad and geographically dispersed personnel and operations, and the retention of employees generally; the risk of additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management, financial reporting and internal controls; and we may not be able to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated prior to the acquisition. The failure to successfully integrate acquisitions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Third parties contribute significantly to our completion of many projects and labor shortages or increased labor costs from third parties could adversely impact our results of operations. We hire third-party subcontractors to perform work and depend on third-party suppliers to provide equipment and materials necessary to complete our projects. If we are unable to retain qualified subcontractors or suppliers, or if our subcontractors or suppliers do not perform as anticipated for any reason, our execution, reputation and profitability could be harmed. Recent labor shortages may also lead to higher wages for employees and higher costs to purchase the services of third parties. Increases in labor costs, such as increases in minimum wage requirements, wage inflation and/or increased overtime, reduce our profitability and that of our customers. Increases in such labor costs for a prolonged period of time could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations. Earnings for future periods may be impacted by impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets. We carry a significant amount of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets on our consolidated Balance Sheets. Goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses. We assess goodwill for impairment each year, and more frequently if circumstances suggest an impairment may have occurred. We have determined in the past and may again determine in the future that a significant impairment has occurred in the value of our unamortized intangible assets or fixed assets, which could require us to write off a portion of our assets and could adversely affect our financial condition or our reported results of operations.

 Our use of the cost-to-cost input method of accounting could result in a reduction or reversal of previously recorded revenue or profits. A material portion of our revenue is recognized using the cost-to-cost input method of accounting, which results in our recognizing contract revenue and earnings ratably over the contract term in the proportion that our actual costs bear to our estimated contract costs. The earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract revenue, costs and profitability. We review our estimates of contract revenue, costs and profitability on an ongoing basis. Prior to contract completion, we may adjust our estimates on one or more occasions as a result of change orders to the original contract, collection disputes with the customer on amounts invoiced or claims against the customer for increased costs incurred by us due to customer-induced delays and other factors. Contract losses are recognized in the fiscal period when the loss is determined. Contract profit estimates are also adjusted in the fiscal period in which it is determined that an adjustment is required. As a result of the requirements of the cost-to-cost input method of accounting, the possibility exists, for example, that we could have estimated and reported a profit on a contract over several periods and later determined, usually near contract completion, that all or a portion of such previously estimated and reported profits were overstated. If this occurs, the full aggregate amount of the overstatement will be reported for the period in which such determination is made, thereby eliminating all or a portion of any profits from other contracts that would have otherwise been reported in such period or even resulting in a loss being reported for such period. On a historical basis, we believe that we have made reasonably reliable estimates of the progress towards completion on our long-term contracts. However, given the uncertainties associated with these types of contracts, it is possible for actual costs to vary from estimates previously made, which may result in reductions or reversals of previously recorded revenue and profits. A significant portion of our business depends on our ability to provide surety bonds. Any difficulties in the financial and surety markets may adversely affect our bonding capacity and availability. In the past we have expanded, and it is possible we will continue to expand, the number and percentage of total contract dollars that require an underlying bond. Historically, surety market conditions have experienced times of difficulty as a result of significant losses incurred by many surety companies and the results of macroeconomic trends outside of our control, such as the current volatility in the capital markets and the possibility of an extended economic downturn or recession. Consequently, during times when less overall bonding capacity is available in the market, surety terms have become more expensive and more restrictive. As such, we cannot guarantee our ability to maintain a sufficient level of bonding capacity in the future, which could preclude our ability to bid for certain contracts or successfully contract with some customers. Additionally, even if we continue to be able to access bonding capacity to sufficiently bond future work, we may be required to post collateral to secure bonds, which would decrease the liquidity we would have available for other purposes. Our surety providers are under no commitment to guarantee our access to new bonds in the future; thus, our ability to access or increase bonding capacity is at the sole discretion of our surety providers. If our surety companies were to limit or eliminate our access to bonds, our alternatives would include seeking bonding capacity from other surety companies, increasing business with clients that do not require bonds and posting other forms of collateral for project performance, such as letters of credit or cash. We may be unable to secure these alternatives in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all. As such, if we were to experience an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity, it is likely we would be unable to compete for or work on certain projects. If we experience delays and/or defaults in customer payments, we could be unable to recover all expenditures. Because of the nature of our contracts, at times we commit resources to projects prior to receiving payments from the customer in amounts sufficient to cover expenditures on projects as they are incurred. Delays in customer payments may require us to make a working capital investment. If a customer defaults in making their payments on a project to which we have devoted resources, it could have a material negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our business may be affected by the work environment. We may need to perform our work under a variety of conditions, including but not limited to, difficult terrain, difficult site conditions and busy urban centers where delivery of materials and availability of labor may be impacted, clean-room environments where strict procedures must be followed and sites that may have been exposed to harsh and hazardous conditions and outbreaks of infectious disease, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Extreme weather conditions (such as storms, droughts, extreme heat or cold, wildfires and floods) may limit the availability of resources, 
 14 

Table of Contents 
 increase our costs, or may cause projects to be cancelled. To the extent climate change results in an increase in extreme weather events and adverse weather conditions, the likelihood of a negative impact on our results of operations may increase. If we are unable to manage the conditions required for certain of our jobs, including the availability of sufficient labor, adherence to environmental, health and safety or other standards, and adequately addressing harsh or hazardous conditions, our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. We are susceptible to adverse weather conditions, which may harm our business and financial results. Our business can be highly cyclical and subject to seasonal and other variations that can result in significant differences in operating results from quarter to quarter. Moreover, our business may be adversely affected by severe weather in areas where we have significant operations. Repercussions of severe weather conditions may include: curtailment of services; suspension of operations; inability to meet performance schedules in accordance with contracts and potential liability for liquidated damages; injuries or fatalities; weather-related damage to our facilities; disruption of information systems; inability to receive machinery, equipment and materials at jobsites; and loss of productivity. Future climate change could adversely affect us. Climate change may create physical and financial risk to our business. Physical risks from climate change could, among other things, include an increase in extreme weather events (such as floods or hurricanes), rising sea levels and limitations on water availability and quality. Such extreme weather conditions may limit the availability of resources, increasing the costs of our projects, or may cause projects to be delayed or cancelled. Legislation, nationwide protocols, regulation or other restrictions related to climate change could negatively impact our operations or our customers operations. Increasing concerns about climate change and other environmental issues may result in additional environmental regulations and restrictions. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, as well as more vigorous enforcement policies of the regulatory agencies could increase the costs of projects for our customers or, in some cases, prevent a project from going forward, which could in turn have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Continuing worldwide political and economic uncertainties may adversely affect our revenue and profitability. The last several years have been periodically marked by political and economic concerns, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, decreased consumer confidence, the effects of international conflicts such as the war between Russia and Ukraine, tariffs, energy costs and inflation. This instability can make it extremely difficult for our customers, our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities, and could cause constrained spending on our services, delays and a lengthening of our business development efforts, the demand for more favorable pricing or other terms, and/or difficulty in collection of our accounts receivable. Our government clients may face budget deficits that prohibit them from funding proposed and existing projects. Further, ongoing economic instability in the global markets, including from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, rising inflation and interest rates and the war between Russia and Ukraine, could limit our ability to access the capital markets at a time when we would like, or need, to raise capital, which could have an impact on our ability to react to changing business conditions or new opportunities. If economic conditions remain uncertain or weaken, or government spending is reduced, our revenue and profitability could be adversely affected.

 Risks Related to Our Operations If we are unable to attract and retain qualified managers and employees, we will be unable to operate efficiently, which could reduce our profitability. Our business is labor intensive, and many of our operations experience a high rate of employee turnover. At times of low unemployment rates in the United States, it is typically more difficult for us to find qualified personnel at low cost in some geographic areas where we operate. Additionally, our business is managed by a small number of key executive and operational officers. We may be unable to hire and retain the sufficient skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy. Our labor expenses may increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel. Labor shortages, including the current U.S. labor shortage, increased labor costs or the loss of key personnel may reduce our profitability and negatively impact our business. Further, our relationships with some customers could suffer if we are unable to retain the employees with whom those customers primarily work and have established relationships. Future growth could also impose significant additional responsibilities on members of our senior management, including the need to recruit and integrate new senior level managers and executives. To the extent that we are unable to manage our growth effectively, or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified management, we may not be able to expand our operations or successfully execute our business plan. We are a decentralized company and place significant decision-making powers with our subsidiaries management, which presents certain risks. We believe that our practice of placing significant decision-making powers with local management is important to our successful growth and allows us to be responsive to opportunities and to our customers needs. However, this practice presents certain risks, including the risk that we may be slower or less effective in our attempts to identify or react to problems affecting an important business than we would under a more centralized structure or that we would be slower to identify a misalignment between a subsidiary s and the Company s overall business strategy. Further, if a subsidiary location fails to follow the Company s compliance policies, we could be made party to a contract, arrangement or situation that requires the assumption of large liabilities or has less advantageous terms than is typically found in the market. If we do not effectively manage our backlog and the size and cost of our operations, our existing infrastructure may become either strained or over-burdensome, and we may be unable to increase or sustain revenue growth. The growth that we have experienced in the past, that we are currently experiencing, and that we may experience in the future, may provide challenges to our organization, requiring us to expand our personnel and our operations. Growth may strain our infrastructure, operations and other managerial and operating resources. We have also experienced in the past severe constriction in the markets in which we operate and, as a result, in our operating requirements. Failing to maintain the appropriate cost structure during a particular economic cycle may result in our incurring costs that affect our profitability or failing to be prepared for unprecedented growth. If our business resources become strained or over-burdensome, our earnings may be adversely affected, and we may be unable to increase revenue growth. Further, we may undertake contractual commitments that exceed our labor, managerial or other resources, which could also adversely affect our earnings and our ability to increase revenue growth and cause material reputational or other harm. Information technology system failures, network disruptions or cybersecurity breaches could adversely affect our business. We use and rely significantly on sophisticated information technology systems, networks, and infrastructure in conducting our day-to-day operations, providing services to certain customers and protecting sensitive Company information. In addition, we also rely on third-party software and information technology for certain of our critical accounting, project management and financial information systems. We also collect and retain information about our customers, stockholders, vendors and employees, with the expectation by such third parties being that we will adequately protect such information.

 Information technology system failures, including suppliers or vendors system failures, could disrupt our operations by causing transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, other business disruptions or the loss of employee or other third-party personal information. We have in the past experienced system interruptions and delays and expect that such interruptions and delays may occur in the future, given the increasing diversity and sophistication of cybersecurity threats. In addition, our systems, networks and infrastructure could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failures, intentional or inadvertent user misuse or error, failures of information technology solutions, computer viruses, malicious code, ransomware attacks and acts of terrorism. We may also be subject to physical or electronic security breaches, including breaches by computer hackers or cyber-terrorists or unauthorized access to or disclosure of our or our customers data. These events could impact our customers, employees and reputation and lead to financial losses from remediation actions, loss of business or access to our business data, potential liability or an increase in expenses, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business. Similar risks could affect our customers and vendors, indirectly affecting us. While we have security, internal control and technology measures in place to protect our systems and networks, these measures could fail as a result of a cyber-attack, other third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or other security failure. In the ordinary course of business, we have been targeted by malicious cyber-attacks. In April 2019, for example, our information technology infrastructure was impacted by a ransomware attack virus, which caused a substantial majority of our operating locations to experience loss of access to certain data and outages affecting systems including accounting, payroll, billing, job report and management and other software environments. These disruptions created challenges in key back-office functions that required workarounds and alternative procedures. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. As a result, we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of system disruptions and security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these disruptions and breaches. Any of these events could damage our reputation and, while the April 2019 incident did not have such effects, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, flexible working arrangements at our corporate offices increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and these arrangements have resulted in a higher extent of remote working. This and other possible changing work practices may adversely impact our ability to maintain the security, proper function and availability of our information technology and systems since remote working by our employees could strain our technology resources and introduce operational risk, including heightened cybersecurity risk. Remote working environments may be less secure and more susceptible to hacking attacks, including phishing and social engineering attempts that have sought, and may seek, to exploit remote working environments. Any failure by us or our third party vendors to maintain the security, proper function and availability of information technology and systems could result in financial losses, interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, cause us to be in default of material contracts and subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and the value of our securities. In addition, current and future laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information may pose complex compliance challenges and result in additional costs. A failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in penalties or fines, legal liabilities or reputational harm. The continuing and evolving threat of cyber-attacks has also resulted in increased regulatory focus on risk management and prevention. New cyber-related regulations or other requirements could require significant additional resources and cause us to incur significant costs, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. We regularly evaluate the need to upgrade or replace our systems and network infrastructure to protect our information technology environment, to stay current on vendor supported products and to improve the efficiency and scope of our systems and information technology capabilities. The implementation of new systems and information technology could adversely impact our operations by requiring substantial capital expenditures, diverting management s attention, or causing delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems. In addition, our systems implementations may not result in productivity improvements at the levels anticipated. Systems implementation disruption and any other information technology disruption, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have an adverse effect on our business.

 Our insurance policies against many potential liabilities require high deductibles, and our risk management policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risks. Additionally, difficulties in the insurance markets may adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary insurance. We insure various general liability, workers compensation, property and auto risks as well as other risks through a variety of direct insurance policies and a captive insurance company that are reinsured for risks above certain deductibles and retentions. All of our insurance policies and programs are subject to high deductibles and retentions; as such, we are, in effect, self-insured for substantially all of our typical claims. We hire an actuary to determine any liabilities for unpaid claims and associated expenses for the three major lines of coverage (workers compensation, general liability and auto liability). The determination of these claims and expenses and the appropriateness of the estimated liability are reviewed and updated quarterly. However, insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to the many relevant factors, the effects of which are often unknown, including the severity of an injury, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties, the number of incidents that have occurred but are not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program. Our accruals are based on known facts, historical trends (both internal trends and industry averages) and our reasonable estimate of our future expenses. We believe our accruals are adequate. However, our risk management strategies and techniques may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk. If any of the variety of instruments, processes or strategies we use to manage our exposure to various types of risk are not effective, we may incur losses that are not covered by our insurance policies or that exceed our accruals or coverage limits. Additionally, we typically are contractually required to provide proof of insurance for projects on which we work. Historically, insurance market conditions become more difficult for insurance consumers during periods when insurance companies suffer significant investment losses as well as casualty losses. Consequently, it is possible that insurance markets will become more expensive and restrictive. Also, our prior casualty loss history might adversely affect our ability to procure insurance within commercially reasonable ranges. As such, we may not be able to maintain commercially reasonable levels of insurance coverage in the future, which could preclude our ability to work on many projects and increase our overall risk exposure. Our insurance providers are under no commitment to renew our existing insurance policies in the future; therefore, our ability to obtain necessary levels or kinds of insurance coverage is subject to market forces outside our control. If we were unable to obtain necessary levels of insurance, it is likely we would be unable to compete for or work on most projects. Failure to remain in compliance with covenants under our credit agreement, service our indebtedness, or fund our other liquidity needs could adversely impact our business. Our credit agreement and related restrictive and financial covenants are more fully described in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our failure to comply with any of these covenants under the credit agreement, or to pay principal, interest or other amounts when due thereunder, would constitute an event of default under the credit agreement. Default under our credit agreement could result in (1) us no longer being entitled to borrow under the agreement; (2) termination of the agreement; (3) acceleration of the maturity of outstanding indebtedness under the agreement; and/or (4) foreclosure on any collateral securing the obligations under the agreement. If we are unable to service our debt obligations or fund our other liquidity needs, we could be forced to curtail our operations, reorganize our capital structure (including through bankruptcy proceedings) or liquidate some or all of our assets in a manner that could cause holders of our securities to experience a partial or total loss of their investment in us. Our inability to properly utilize our workforce could have a negative impact on our profitability. The extent to which we utilize our workforce affects our profitability. Underutilizing our workforce could result in lower gross margins and, consequently, a decrease in short-term profitability. On the other hand, overutilization of our workforce could negatively impact safety, employee satisfaction and project execution, leading to a potential decline in future project awards. The utilization of our workforce is impacted by numerous factors, including: our estimate of headcount requirements and our ability to manage attrition; efficiency in scheduling projects and our ability to minimize downtime between project assignments; and productivity.

 Increases and uncertainty in our health insurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. The costs of employee health insurance have been increasing in recent years due to rising health care costs, legislative changes, and general economic conditions. Additionally, we may incur additional costs as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the Affordable Care Act that was signed into law in March 2010. Future legislation could also have an impact on our business. The status of the Affordable Care Act, any amendment, repeal or replacement thereof, is currently uncertain. For example, in December 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit struck down a central provision of the Affordable Care Act, ruling that the requirement that people have health insurance was unconstitutional, sending the case back to a federal district judge in Texas to determine which of the law s many parts could survive without the mandate. On March 2, 2020, the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari to review this case, and on June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the individual mandate was repealed by Congress. The Affordable Care Act will remain in effect in its current form; however, we continue to evaluate the effect that the Affordable Care Act has on our business. Regulatory and Legal Risks Actual and potential claims, lawsuits and proceedings could ultimately reduce our profitability and liquidity and weaken our financial condition. We are likely to continue to be named as a defendant in legal proceedings claiming damages from us in connection with the operation of our business. These actions and proceedings may involve claims for, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, workers compensation, employment discrimination, breach of contract or property damage. In addition, we may be subject to class action lawsuits involving allegations of violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and state wage and hour laws. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such actions or proceedings. We also are, and are likely to continue to be, from time to time a plaintiff in legal proceedings against customers, in which we seek to recover payment of contractual amounts we are owed as well as claims for increased costs we incur. When appropriate, we establish provisions against possible exposures, and we adjust these provisions from time to time according to ongoing exposure. If our assumptions and estimates related to these exposures prove to be inadequate or inaccurate, we could experience a reduction in our profitability and liquidity and a weakening of our financial condition. In addition, claims, lawsuits and proceedings may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business. We typically warrant the services we provide, guaranteeing the work performed against defects in workmanship and the material we supply. Historically, warranty claims have not been material as our customers evaluate much of the work we perform for defects shortly after work is completed. However, if warranty claims occur, we could be required to repair or replace warrantied items at our cost. In addition, in some circumstances, our customers may elect to repair or replace the warrantied item by using the services of another provider and require us to pay for the cost of the repair or replacement. Costs incurred as a result of warranty claims could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Misconduct by our employees, subcontractors or partners or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could harm our reputation, damage our relationships with customers, reduce our revenue and profits, and subject us to criminal and civil enforcement actions. Misconduct, fraud, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or other improper activities by one or more of our employees, directors, executive officers, subcontractors or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. Examples of such misconduct include employee or subcontractor theft, personal misconduct and failure to comply with safety standards, including regulatory, company or site-specific COVID-19 safety protocols, laws and regulations, customer requirements, environmental laws and any other applicable laws or regulations. While we take precautions to prevent and detect these activities, such precautions may not be effective and are subject to inherent limitations, including human error and fraud. Our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of misconduct could subject us to fines and penalties, harm our reputation, lead to loss of the services of employees or members of management, damage our relationships with customers, reduce our revenue and profits and subject us to criminal and civil enforcement actions.

 We have subsidiary operations throughout the United States and are exposed to multiple state and local regulations, as well as federal laws and requirements applicable to government contractors. Changes in law, regulations or requirements, or a material failure of any of our subsidiaries or us to comply with any of them, could increase our costs and have other negative impacts on our business. Our 169 locations are located in 27 states, which exposes us to a variety of different state and local laws and regulations, particularly those pertaining to contractor licensing requirements. These laws and regulations govern many aspects of our business, and there are often different standards and requirements in different locations. In addition, our subsidiaries that perform work for federal government entities are subject to additional federal laws and regulatory and contractual requirements. Changes in any of these laws, or any of our subsidiaries material failure to comply with them, can adversely impact our operations by, among other things, increasing costs, distracting management s time and attention from other items, and harming our reputation. As government contractors, our subsidiaries are subject to a number of rules and regulations, and their contracts with government entities are subject to audit. Violations of the applicable rules and regulations could result in a subsidiary being barred from future government contracts. Government contractors must comply with many regulations and other requirements that relate to the award, administration and performance of government contracts. A violation of these laws and regulations could result in imposition of fines and penalties, the termination of a government contract or debarment from bidding on government contracts in the future. Further, despite our decentralized nature, a violation at one of our locations could impact other locations ability to bid on and perform government contracts. Additionally, because of our decentralized nature, we face risks in maintaining compliance with all local, state and federal government contracting requirements. Because 6.2 of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 was attributable to projects in the government sector, prohibitions against bidding on future government contracts could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Past and future environmental, social, governance, safety and health regulations could impose significant additional costs on us that could reduce our profits. HVAC systems are subject to various environmental statutes and regulations, including the Clean Air Act and those regulating the production, servicing and disposal of certain ozone-depleting refrigerants used in HVAC systems. There can be no assurance that the regulatory environment in which we operate will not change significantly in the future. Various local, state and federal laws and regulations impose licensing standards on technicians who install and service HVAC systems. Additional laws, regulations and standards apply to contractors who perform work that is being funded by public money, particularly federal public funding. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to substantial fines, the loss of our licenses or potentially debarment from future publicly funded work. It is impossible to predict the full nature and effect of judicial, legislative or regulatory developments relating to health and safety regulations and environmental protection regulations applicable to our operations. Additionally, industries in which our customers or potential customers operate may be affected by new or changing environmental, safety, health or other regulatory requirements, leading to decreased demand for our services and potentially impacting our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to grow. Additionally, actual or perceived environmental, social and corporate governance ESG and other sustainability matters and our response to these matters could harm our business. Increasing governmental and societal attention to ESG matters, including expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence and disclosure on topics such as climate change, human capital, labor and risk oversight, could expand the nature, scope, and complexity of matters that we are required to control, assess, and report. If we are unable to adequately address such ESG matters or fail to comply with all laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations, it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results. Unsatisfactory safety performance may subject us to penalties, affect customer relationships, result in higher operating costs, negatively impact employee morale and result in higher employee turnover. Our projects are conducted at a variety of sites including construction sites and industrial facilities. Each location is subject to numerous safety risks, including fall risks, electrocutions, fires, explosions, mechanical failures, weather-related incidents, transportation accidents, damage to equipment and, with respect to indoor sites, an increased risk of COVID-19 outbreaks. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of 
 20 

Table of Contents 
 property and equipment and other consequential damages and could lead to suspension of operations, large damage claims and, in extreme cases, criminal liability. While we have taken what we believe are appropriate precautions to minimize safety risks, we have experienced serious accidents, including fatalities, in the past and may experience additional accidents in the future. Serious accidents may subject us to penalties, civil litigation or criminal prosecution. Claims for damages to property or persons, including claims for bodily injury or loss of life, could result in significant costs and liabilities, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Poor safety performance could also jeopardize our relationships with our customers, negatively impact employee morale and harm our reputation. Changes in United States trade policy, including the imposition of tariffs and the resulting consequences, may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. As a result of policy changes or shifting proposals by the U.S. government, there may be greater restrictions and economic disincentives on international trade. For example, the U.S. government has recently pursued a new approach to trade policy, including renegotiating or terminating certain existing bilateral or multi-lateral trade agreements. It has also imposed tariffs on certain foreign goods and raised the possibility of imposing significant, additional tariff increases or expanding the tariffs to capture other types of goods. These tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy have in the past and could continue to trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, and certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing retaliatory measures on certain U.S. goods. In response to Russia s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the United States and other countries imposed trade sanctions against Russia, which impacted global operations and financial performance. We, our suppliers and our customers import certain raw materials, components and other products from foreign suppliers. As such, the adoption and expansion of trade restrictions such as those adopted in response to Russia s invasion of Ukraine, the occurrence of a trade war, or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies has in the past and may continue to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, our customers, our suppliers, and the United States economy, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Tax matters, including changes in corporate tax laws and disagreements with taxing authorities, could impact our results of operations and financial condition. We conduct business across the United States and file income taxes in the federal and various state jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in our accounting for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are transactions and calculations in which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Changes in tax laws and regulations, in addition to changes and conflicts in related interpretations and other tax guidance, could materially impact our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for uncertain tax positions. I ssues relating to tax audits or examinations and any related interest or penalties and uncertainty in obtaining deductions or credits claimed in various jurisdictions could also impact the accounting for income taxes. Our results of operations are reported based on our determination of the amount of taxes we owe in various tax jurisdictions, and our provision for income taxes and tax liabilities are subject to review or examination by taxing authorities in applicable tax jurisdictions. An adverse outcome of such a review or examination could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Further, the results of tax examinations and audits could have a negative impact on our financial results and cash flows where the results differ from the liabilities recorded in our financial statements. Risks Related to Our Common Stock Our common stock, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations are likely to continue in the future, and our stockholders may suffer losses. The market price of our common stock may change significantly in response to various factors and events beyond our control. A variety of events may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly, including the following: (i) the risk factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K; (ii) a shortfall in operating revenue or net income from that expected by securities analysts and investors; (iii) quarterly fluctuations in our operating results; (iv) changes in securities analysts estimates of our financial performance or that of our competitors or companies in our industry generally; (v) general conditions in our customers industries, including as a result of the

Table of Contents 
 ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; (vi) general conditions in the securities markets; (vii) our announcements of significant contracts, milestones and acquisitions; (viii) our relationship with other companies; (ix) our investors view of the sectors and markets in which we operate; and (x) additions or departures of key personnel. Some companies that have volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to security class action suits filed against them. If a suit were to be filed against us, regardless of the outcome, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Future sales of our common stock may depress our stock price. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or otherwise, either by us, a member of management or a major stockholder, or the perception that these sales could occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. Our charter contains certain anti-takeover provisions that may inhibit or delay a change in control. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue, without stockholder approval, one or more series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights (including preferences over the common stock respecting dividends and distributions and voting rights) as the Board of Directors may determine. The issuance of this blank-check preferred stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control by means of a tender offer, merger, proxy contest or otherwise. Additionally, certain provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law or even certain provisions of our credit agreement may also discourage takeover attempts that have not been approved by the Board of Directors. General Risk Factors Failure or circumvention of our disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting could seriously harm our financial condition, results of operations, and our business. We plan to continue to maintain and strengthen internal controls and procedures to enhance the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure of our disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting could harm our financial condition and results of operations. Force majeure events, including natural disasters, outbreaks of infectious disease, such as COVID-19, and terrorists actions, could negatively impact our business, which may affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Force majeure or extraordinary events beyond the control of the contracting parties, such as natural and man-made disasters, as well as outbreaks of infectious disease e.g. , COVID-19) and terrorist actions, could negatively impact us. We typically negotiate contract language through which we are granted certain relief from force majeure events in private client contracts and review and attempt to mitigate force majeure events in both public and private client contracts. We remain obligated to perform our services after most extraordinary events subject to relief that may be available to us pursuant to a force majeure clause. If we are not able to react quickly to force majeure events, our operations may be affected significantly, which would have a negative impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity and could also negatively affect our reputation in the marketplace. Deliberate, malicious acts, including terrorism and sabotage, could damage our facilities, disrupt our operations or injure employees, contractors, customers or the public and result in liability to us. Intentional acts of destruction could damage or destroy our facilities, reducing our operational production capacity and potentially requiring us to repair or replace our facilities at substantial cost. Additionally, employees, contractors and the public could suffer substantial physical injury from acts of terrorism for which we could be liable. Governmental authorities may also impose security or other requirements that could make our operations more difficult or costly. The consequences of any such actions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

 We are required to assess and report on our internal controls each year. Findings of inadequate internal controls could reduce investor confidence in the reliability of our financial information. As directed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the SEC adopted rules generally requiring public companies, including us, to include in their annual reports on Form 10-K a report of management that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, the independent registered public accounting firm auditing our financial statements must report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and records of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. We may discover in the future that we have deficiencies in the design and operation of our internal controls. In addition, we may acquire companies whose internal controls have design or operational deficiencies, which could impair our ability to integrate those companies into our internal control environment. If any of the deficiencies in our internal control, either by itself or in combination with other deficiencies, becomes a material weakness such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, we may be unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting. In such event, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which may significantly harm our business and cause our stock price to decline. In addition, the failure to maintain effective internal controls could also result in unauthorized transactions. Changes in accounting rules and regulations could adversely affect our financial results. Accounting rules and regulations are subject to review and interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB ), the SEC and various other governing bodies. A change in U.S. GAAP could have a significant effect on our reported financial results. Additionally, the adoption of new or revised accounting principles could require that we make significant changes to our systems, processes and controls. We cannot predict the effect of future changes to accounting principles, which could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and/or our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. ITEM 2. Properties As of December 31, 2022, we owned 15 properties. Other than these owned properties, we lease the real property and buildings from which we operate. Our facilities are located in 27 states and consist of offices, shops and fabrication, maintenance and warehouse facilities. Generally, leases range from three to ten years and are on terms we believe to be commercially reasonable. A majority of these premises are leased from individuals or entities with whom we have no other business relationship. In certain instances, these leases are with current or former employees. To the extent we renew, enter into leases or otherwise change leases with current or former employees, we enter into such agreements on terms that reflect a fair market valuation for the properties. Leased premises range in size from approximately 1,000 square feet to 175,000 square feet. To maximize available capital, we generally intend to continue to lease our properties, but may consider further purchases of property where we believe ownership would be more economical. We believe that our facilities are sufficient for our current needs. We lease our executive and administrative offices in Houston, Texas.

 ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings We are subject to certain legal and regulatory claims, including lawsuits arising in the normal course of business. We maintain various insurance coverages to minimize financial risk associated with these claims. We have estimated and provided accruals for probable losses and related legal fees associated with certain litigation in our consolidated financial statements. While we cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings, in management s opinion and based on reports of counsel, any liability arising from these matters individually and in the aggregate will not have a material effect on our operating results, cash flows or financial condition, after giving effect to provisions already recorded. In 2022, we recorded a net gain of 5.1 million related to legal matters that merited changes to our assessments of the related accruals in the ordinary course of our business based on information received in 2022. The largest change resulted from favorable developments related to a dispute with a customer regarding the outcome of a completed project as well as the obligation to perform subcontract work under two executed letters of intent for subsequent projects that we believed were not enforceable. The net gain of 5.1 million was recorded primarily as an increase in gross profit in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2022, we recorded an accrual for unresolved matters, which is not material to our financial statements, based on our analysis of likely outcomes related to the respective matters; however, it is possible that the ultimate outcome and associated costs will deviate from our estimates and that, in the event of an unexpectedly adverse outcome, we may experience additional costs and expenses in future periods.

 The following Corporate Performance Graph and related information shall not be deemed soliciting material or to be filed with the SEC, nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any future filing under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, except to the extent that we specifically incorporate it by reference into such filing. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities None. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities On March 29, 2007, our Board of Directors (the Board approved a stock repurchase program to acquire up to 1.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock. Subsequently, the Board has from time to time increased the number of shares that may be acquired under the program and approved extensions of the program. On May 17, 2022, the Board approved an extension to the program by increasing the shares authorized for repurchase by 0.7 million shares. Since the inception of the repurchase program, the Board has approved 10.9 million shares to be repurchased. As of December 31, 2022, we have repurchased a cumulative total of 10.1 million shares at an average price of 24.52 per share under the repurchase program. The share repurchases will be made from time to time at our discretion in the open market or privately negotiated transactions, as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements, and subject to market conditions and other factors. The Board may modify, suspend, extend or terminate the program at any time.

 (1) Purchased as part of a program announced on March 29, 2007 under which, since the inception of this program, 10.9 million shares have been approved for repurchase. Under our stock incentive plans, employees may elect to have us withhold common shares to satisfy statutory federal, state and local tax withholding obligations arising on the vesting of restricted stock awards and exercise of options. When we withhold these shares, we are required to remit to the appropriate taxing authorities the market price of the shares withheld, which could be deemed a purchase of the common shares by us on the date of withholding. ITEM 6. [Reserved] ITEM 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Also see Forward-Looking Statements discussion. Introduction and Overview We are a national provider of comprehensive mechanical and electrical installation, renovation, maintenance, repair and replacement services within the mechanical and electrical services industries. We operate primarily in the commercial, industrial and institutional markets and perform most of our work in industrial, healthcare, education, office, technology, retail and government facilities. We operate our business in two business segments: mechanical and electrical. Nature and Economics of Our Business In our mechanical business segment, customers hire us to ensure HVAC systems deliver specified or generally expected heating, cooling, conditioning and circulation of air in a facility. This entails installing core system equipment such as packaged heating and air conditioning units, or in the case of larger facilities, separate core components such as chillers, boilers, air handlers, and cooling towers. We also typically install connecting and distribution elements such as piping and ducting. In our electrical business segment, our principal business activity is electrical construction and engineering in the commercial and industrial field. We also perform electrical logistics services, electrical service work, and electrical construction and engineering services.

Table of Contents 
 In both our mechanical and electrical business segments, our responsibilities usually require conforming the systems to pre-established engineering drawings and equipment and performance specifications, which we frequently participate in establishing. Our project management responsibilities include staging equipment and materials to project sites, deploying labor to perform the work, and coordinating with other service providers on the project, including any subcontractors we might use to deliver our portion of the work. Approximately 87.0 of our revenue is earned on a project basis for installation services in newly constructed facilities or for replacement of systems in existing facilities. When competing for project business, we usually estimate the costs we will incur on a project, and then propose a bid to the customer that includes a contract price and other performance and payment terms. Our bid price and terms are intended to cover our estimated costs on the project and provide a profit margin to us commensurate with the value of the installed system to the customer, the risk that project costs or duration will vary from estimate, the schedule on which we will be paid, the opportunities for other work that we might forego by committing capacity to this project, and other costs that we incur to support our operations but which are not specific to the project. Typically, customers will seek pricing from competitors for a given project. While the criteria on which customers select a provider vary widely and include factors such as quality, technical expertise, on-time performance, post-project support and service, and company history and financial strength, we believe that price for value is the most influential factor for most customers in choosing a mechanical or electrical installation and service provider. After a customer accepts our bid, we generally enter into a contract with the customer that specifies what we will deliver on the project, what our related responsibilities are and how much and when we will be paid. Our overall price for the project is typically set at a fixed amount in the contract, although changes in project specifications or work conditions that result in unexpected additional work are usually subject to additional payment from the customer via what are commonly known as change orders. Project contracts typically provide for periodic billings to the customer as we meet progress milestones or incur cost on the project. Project contracts in our industry also frequently allow for a small portion of progress billings or contract price to be withheld by the customer until after we have completed the work. Amounts withheld under this practice are known as retention or retainage. Labor, materials and overhead costs account for the majority of our cost of service. Accordingly, labor management and utilization have the most impact on our project performance. Given the fixed price nature of much of our project work, if our initial estimate of project costs is wrong or we incur cost overruns that cannot be recovered in change orders, we can experience reduced profits or even significant losses on fixed price project work. We also perform some project work on a cost-plus or a time and materials basis, under which we are paid our costs incurred plus an agreed-upon profit margin, and such projects are sometimes subject to a guaranteed maximum cost. These margins are frequently less than fixed-price contract margins because there is less risk of unrecoverable cost overruns in cost-plus or time and materials work. As of December 31, 2022, we had 10,636 projects in process. Our average project takes six to nine months to complete, with an average contract price of approximately 875,000. Our projects generally require working capital funding of equipment and labor costs. Customer payments on periodic billings generally do not recover these costs until late in the job. Our average project duration, together with typical retention terms as discussed above, generally allow us to complete the realization of revenue and earnings in cash within one year. We have what we consider to be a well-diversified distribution of revenue across end-use sectors that we believe reduces our exposure to negative developments in any given sector. Because of the integral nature of our services to most buildings, we have the legal right in almost all cases to attach liens to buildings or related funding sources when we have not been fully paid for installing systems, except with respect to some government buildings. The service work that we do, which is discussed further below, usually does not give rise to lien rights. We also perform larger projects. Taken together, projects with contract prices of 2 million or more totaled 7.7 billion of aggregate contract value as of December 31, 2022, or approximately 82 , out of a total contract value for all projects in progress of 9.3 billion. Generally, projects closer in size to 2 million will be completed in one year or less. It is unusual for us to work on a project that exceeds two years in length.

 A stratification of projects in progress as of December 31, 2022, by contract price, is as follows: Aggregate Contract No. of Price Value Contract Price of Project Projects (millions) Under 2 million 9,812 1,628.5 2 million - 10 million 610 2,698.6 10 million - 20 million 112 1,645.6 20 million - 40 million 82 2,345.3 Greater than 40 million 20 985.2 Total 10,636 9,303.2 In addition to project work, approximately 13.0 of our revenue represents maintenance and repair service on already installed HVAC, electrical, and controls systems. This kind of work usually takes from a few hours to a few days to perform. Prices to the customer are based on the equipment and materials used in the service as well as technician labor time. We usually bill the customer for service work when it is complete, typically with payment terms of up to thirty days. We also provide maintenance and repair service under ongoing contracts. Under these contracts, we are paid regular monthly or quarterly amounts and provide specified service based on customer requirements. These agreements typically are for one or more years and frequently contain thirty- to sixty-day cancellation notice periods. A relatively small portion of our revenue comes from national and regional account customers. These customers typically have multiple sites and contract with us to perform maintenance and repair service. These contracts may also provide for us to perform new or replacement systems installation. We operate a national call center to dispatch technicians to sites requiring service. We perform the majority of this work with our own employees, with the balance being subcontracted to third parties that meet our performance qualifications. Profile and Management of Our Operations We manage our 42 operating units based on a variety of factors. Financial measures we emphasize include profitability and use of capital as indicated by cash flow and by other measures of working capital principally involving project cost, billings and receivables. We also monitor selling, general, administrative and indirect project support expense, backlog, workforce size and mix, growth in revenue and profits, variation of actual project cost from original estimate, and overall financial performance in comparison to budget and updated forecasts. Operational factors we emphasize include project selection, estimating, pricing, safety, management and execution practices, labor utilization, training, and the make-up of both existing backlog as well as new business being pursued, in terms of project size, technical application, facility type, end-use customers and industries and location of the work. Most of our operations compete on a local or regional basis. Attracting and retaining effective operating unit managers is an important factor in our business, particularly in view of the relative uniqueness of each market and operation, the importance of relationships with customers and other market participants, such as architects and consulting engineers, and the high degree of competition and low barriers to entry in most of our markets. Accordingly, we devote considerable attention to operating unit management quality, stability, and contingency planning, including related considerations of compensation and non-competition protection where applicable. Economic and Industry Factors As a mechanical and electrical services provider, we operate in the broader nonresidential construction services industry and are affected by trends in this sector. While we do not have operations in all major cities of the United States, we believe our national presence is sufficiently large that we experience trends in demand for and pricing of our services that are consistent with trends in the national nonresidential construction sector. As a result, we monitor the views of major construction sector forecasters along with macroeconomic factors they believe drive the sector, including trends in gross domestic product, interest rates, business investment, employment, demographics and the fiscal condition of federal, state and local governments. Spending decisions for building construction, renovation and system replacement are generally made on a project basis, usually with some degree of discretion as to when and if projects proceed. With larger amounts of capital,

Table of Contents 
 time, and discretion involved, spending decisions are affected to a significant degree by uncertainty, particularly concerns about economic and financial conditions and trends. We have experienced periods of time when economic weakness caused a significant slowdown in decisions to proceed with installation and replacement project work. Operating Environment and Management Emphasis During the five-year period from 2015 to 2019, there was an increase in nonresidential building construction and renovation activity levels. In 2020, the advent of a global pandemic led to some delays in service and construction, including delayed project starts and air pockets or pauses during 2020 and 2021. We believe that delays and air pockets have now substantially abated; however, we expect to continue to experience supply chain constraints and reduced labor availability during 2023. We have a credit facility in place with terms we believe are favorable that does not expire until July 2027. As of December 31, 2022, we had 580.8 million of credit available to borrow under our credit facility. We have strong surety relationships to support our bonding needs, and we believe our relationships with the surety markets are strong and benefit from our operating history and financial position. We have generated positive free cash flow in each of the last twenty-four calendar years and will continue our emphasis in this area. We believe that the relative size and strength of our Balance Sheet and surety relationships, as compared to most companies in our industry, represent competitive advantages for us. As discussed at greater length in Results of Operations below, we expect price competition to continue as local and regional industry participants compete for customers. We will continue to invest in our service business, to pursue the more active sectors in our markets, and to emphasize our regional and national account business. Critical Accounting Estimates Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that can have a meaningful effect on the amounts reported within our consolidated financial statements. Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The Company has identified the following as its critical accounting estimates: Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation using the cost-to-cost input method of accounting, as it best depicts the transfer of assets to the customer that occurs as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. The cost-to-cost input method of accounting is also affected by changes in job performance, job conditions, and final contract settlements. These factors may result in revisions to estimated costs and, therefore, revenue. Such revisions are frequently based on further estimates and subjective assessments. Variations from estimated project costs could have a significant impact on our operating results, depending on project size, and the recoverability of the variation from change orders collected from customers. Accounting for Self-Insurance Liabilitie s We are substantially self-insured for workers compensation, employer s liability, auto liability, general liability and employee group health claims, in view of the relatively high per-incident deductibles we absorb under our insurance arrangements for these risks. Losses are estimated and accrued based upon known facts, historical trends and industry averages. Insurance liabilities are difficult to estimate due to various required judgements, including the severity of an injury, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties, timely reporting of occurrences, ongoing treatment or loss mitigation, general trends in litigation recovery outcomes and the effectiveness of safety and risk management programs. Accounting for Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for uncertain tax positions reflect management s best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid. Significant judgments and estimates are required in the determination of our income taxes, including the ability to recover our deferred tax assets based on assumptions about future taxable income. We record liabilities for uncertain tax positions when we determine whether it is more likely than not that the positions will be sustained based on their technical merits 
 30 

Table of Contents 
 and we recognize tax benefits that are more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant taxing authority. Acquisitions We recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations based on fair value estimates as of the date of acquisition. In certain acquisitions, we agree to pay additional amounts to sellers contingent upon achievement by the acquired businesses of certain predetermined profitability targets. We recognize liabilities for these contingent obligations based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. Key assumptions used to determine the fair value of contingent obligations include, but are not limited to, future cash flows and operating income, probabilities of achieving such future cash flows and operating income and a weighted average cost of capital. Recoverability of Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets Determining whether impairment indicators exist and estimating the fair value of the Company s goodwill reporting units and intangible assets for impairment testing requires significant judgment. In the evaluation of goodwill for impairment, we have to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of one of our reporting units is greater than its carrying value. If we perform a quantitative assessment, then we calculate the fair value of the reporting unit and compare the fair value with the carrying value of the reporting unit. We estimate the fair value of the reporting unit based on a market approach and an income approach, which utilizes discounted future cash flows. Assumptions critical to the fair value estimates under the discounted cash flow model include discount rates, cash flow projections, projected long-term growth rates and the determination of terminal values. Key assumptions in the market approach include multiples used to value each reporting unit. We amortize identifiable intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated useful lives. Changes in strategy and/or market condition may result in adjustments to recorded intangible asset balances or their useful lives. Results of Operations (in thousands, except percentages):

 Revenue Revenue increased 1.07 billion, or 34.7 , to 4.14 billion in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase included a 12.9 increase primarily related to the Amteck, Ivey, MEP Holdings and Atlantic acquisitions, as well as a 21.8 increase in revenue related to same-store activity. The following table presents our operating segment revenue (in thousands, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Revenue: Mechanical Services 3,178,475 76.8 2,542,623 82.7 Electrical Services 961,889 23.2 531,013 17.3 Total 4,140,364 100.0 3,073,636 100.0 Revenue for our mechanical services segment increased 635.9 million, or 25.0 , to 3.18 billion in 2022 compared to 2021. Of this increase, 164.9 million resulted from an additional eleven months of revenue related to the Ivey acquisition, and 471.0 million was attributable to same-store activity. The same-store revenue increase was broad-based and included an increase in activity in the industrial sector at our North Carolina operation 79.5 million) and one of our Texas operations 32.7 million), in the retail, restaurants and entertainment sector at one of our Florida operations 35.0 million) and our Arizona operation 26.0 million), and in the healthcare sector at another one of our Texas operations 26.4 million). Revenue for our electrical services segment increased 430.9 million, or 81.1 , to 961.9 million in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase primarily resulted from an additional seven months of revenue related to the Amteck acquisition 110.2 million), as well as the acquisitions of MEP Holdings 90.6 million) and Atlantic 31.6 million). The same-store revenue increase of 198.5 million was primarily attributable to an increase in activity in the industrial sector at our Texas electrical operation 172.5 million). Backlog reflects revenue still to be recognized under contracted or committed installation and replacement project work. Project work generally lasts less than one year. Service agreement revenue, service work and short duration projects, which are generally billed as performed, do not flow through backlog. Accordingly, backlog represents only a portion of our revenue for any given future period, and it represents revenue that is likely to be reflected in our operating results over the next six to twelve months. As a result, we believe the predictive value of backlog information is limited to indications of general revenue direction over the near term, and should not be interpreted as indicative of ongoing revenue performance over several quarters. The following table presents our operating segment backlog (in thousands, except percentages): 

December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 Backlog: Mechanical Services 3,299,630 81.2 1,753,340 75.8 Electrical Services 764,113 18.8 558,544 24.2 Total 4,063,743 100.0 2,311,884 100.0 Backlog as of December 31, 2022 was 4.06 billion, a 25.0 increase from September 30, 2022 backlog of 3.25 billion and a 75.8 increase from December 31, 2021 backlog of 2.31 billion. The sequential backlog increase was primarily a result of increased project bookings at one of our Texas operations 540.7 million), our North Carolina operation 310.6 million) and our Indiana operation 50.5 million). The sequential backlog increase was partially offset by completion of project work at one of our Virginia operations 70.0 million). The year-over-year backlog increase included the acquisition of Atlantic 30.2 million) as well as a same-store increase of 1.72 billion, or 74.5 . Same-store year-over-year backlog was broad-based, and increased primarily due to increased project bookings at one of our Texas operations 649.0 million), our North Carolina operation 432.7 million), our Indiana operation 109.7 million), our Texas electrical operation 104.1 million) and our Utah operation 64.2 million). Gross Profit Gross profit increased 178.4 million, or 31.7 , to 741.6 million in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase included a 68.4 million, or 12.1 , increase related to the Amteck, Ivey, MEP Holdings and Atlantic acquisitions, as well as a 110.0 million, or 19.6 , increase on a same-store basis. The same-store increase in gross 
 32 

Table of Contents 
 profit was broad-based and was primarily driven by higher revenues in the current year including increased volumes at our Texas electrical operation 20.5 million) and our North Carolina operation 15.2 million). Additionally, we achieved improvements in project execution at one of our Texas operations 12.0 million) and our Arizona operation 10.7 million). Furthermore, we recorded an increase of 4.9 million in gross profit related to positive developments on legal matters in 2022. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit decreased from 18.3 in 2021 to 17.9 in 2022 primarily due to a higher percentage of electrical segment revenue and new construction revenue in the current year, as well as materials and equipment being a higher percentage of our costs in the current year. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses SG A SG A increased 113.0 million, or 30.0 , to 489.3 million for 2022 as compared to 2021. On a same-store basis, excluding amortization expense, SG A increased 55.6 million, or 16.1 . The same-store increase is primarily due to higher same-store revenue, an increase in consulting fees and other expenses of 4.7 million related to the credit for increasing research activities (the R D tax credit for prior tax years and increased compensation costs attributable to increased headcount 33.1 million), as well as an increase in travel-related expenses 4.4 million), which were lower in the prior year due to the impacts of COVID-19 on travel. Additionally, bad debt expense increased 4.1 million on a same-store basis, primarily due to benefits recorded in the prior period when we lowered reserves to reflect the business impacts relating to COVID-19 stabilizing. Amortization expense increased 6.2 million during the period primarily as a result of the Amteck, Ivey, MEP Holdings and Atlantic acquisitions. As a percentage of revenue, SG A decreased from 12.2 in 2021 to 11.8 in 2022 due to the factors discussed above. We have included same-store SG A, excluding amortization, because we believe it is an effective measure of comparative results of operations. However, same-store SG A, excluding amortization, is not considered under generally accepted accounting principles to be a primary measure of an entity s financial results, and accordingly, should not be considered an alternative to SG A as shown in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 (in thousands) SG A 489,344 376,309 Less: SG A from companies acquired (51,181) Less: Amortization expense (36,426) (30,214) Same-store SG A, excluding amortization expense 401,737 346,095 Interest Expense Interest expense increased 7.2 million, or 115.5 , in 2022. The increase in interest expense is due to an increase in our average interest rate on our outstanding borrowings in 2022 compared to the prior year as well as a higher average outstanding debt balance as compared to the prior year. Additionally, we expensed 0.2 million in the second quarter of 2022 related to the unamortized debt issuance costs for the term loan, which was refinanced in the amendment of our senior credit facility. Changes in the Fair Value of Contingent Earn-out Obligations The contingent earn-out obligations are measured at fair value each reporting period and changes in estimates of fair value are recognized in earnings. Expense from changes in the fair value of contingent earn-out obligations increased 12.6 million in 2022 compared to 2021. This increase was primarily caused by higher expenses at our Texas electrical operation and Ivey, driven by stronger actual current earnings and forecasted results. Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes We conduct business throughout the United States in virtually all fifty states. Our effective tax rate changes based upon our relative profitability, or lack thereof, in the federal and various state jurisdictions with differing tax rates and rules. In addition, discrete items, such as tax law changes, judgments and legal structures can impact our effective tax rate. These items can also include the tax treatment for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, changes in fair value of acquisition-related assets and liabilities, uncertain tax positions, and accounting for losses associated with underperforming operations. Our benefit for income taxes for 2022 was 10.1 million with a negative effective tax rate of 4.3 , as compared to the provision for income taxes of 46.9 million with an effective tax rate of 24.7 for 2021. The effective rate for 2022 was significantly lower than the 21 federal statutory rate due to a reduction in net unrecognized tax benefits primarily from settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS for the 2016, 2017 and 2018 tax years (7.6 ), the filing of returns to claim the R D tax credit for the 2019, 2020 and 2021 tax years (15.1 and inclusion of the

Table of Contents 
 R D tax credit for the current year 2022 (6.7 ). These benefits were partially offset by net state income taxes (4.0 and nondeductible expenses, including nondeductible expenses related to TAS Energy Inc. TAS (1.7 ). The effective rate for 2021 was higher than the 21 federal statutory rate primarily due to net state income taxes (3.9 and nondeductible expenses, including nondeductible expenses related to TAS (1.3 ), partially offset by reductions for stock-based compensation (1.2 and the energy efficient commercial buildings deduction (the 179D deduction allocated to us (0.4 ). Refer to Note 11 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rates to the effective tax rates reflected in our financial statements. The decrease in our effective tax rate from 2021 to 2022 was primarily due to recognition of prior years tax benefits from the R D tax credit for the 2016 through 2021 tax years following an IRS survey of our previously filed refund claims for 2016, 2017 and 2018. The Joint Committee on Taxation approved such refunds in late January 2022. 2021 Compared to 2020 For a discussion of the period-to-period comparison of 2021 to 2020, please refer to Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations 2021 Compared to 2020 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Outlook We experienced strong demand in 2022, and we believe that we have largely recovered from negative impacts to industry demand in our business due to the business disruption caused by COVID-19. We are seeing fewer instances of delayed starts of new construction work; however, we continue to experience increased labor costs. We also are experiencing supply constraints and cost increases, reduced availability, and delays in delivery of various materials and equipment. We are recognizing these challenges in our job planning and pricing, and we are working to order materials earlier than usual and seeking to collaborate with customers to share supply risks and to mitigate the effects of these challenges. We have a good pipeline of opportunities and potential backlog, and we have been generally successful in maintaining activity levels and productivity and in procuring needed materials despite ongoing challenges. Considering all these factors, we currently anticipate solid earnings and cash flow in 2023. We continue to prepare for a wide range of challenges and economic circumstances, including a potential recession; however, despite challenges, we currently expect supportive conditions for our industry are likely to continue in 2023.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (in thousands) Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 301,531 180,151 286,510 Investing activities (97,178) (246,722) (207,802) Financing activities (205,915) 70,451 (74,600) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (1,562) 3,880 4,108 Free cash flow: Cash provided by operating activities 301,531 180,151 286,510 Purchases of property and equipment (48,359) (22,330) (24,131) Proceeds from sales of property and equipment 2,858 3,101 2,270 Free cash flow 256,030 160,922 264,649 Cash Flow Our business does not require significant amounts of investment in long-term fixed assets. The substantial majority of the capital used in our business is working capital that funds our costs of labor and installed equipment deployed in project work until our customer pays us. Customary terms in our industry allow customers to withhold a small portion of the contract price until after we have completed the work, typically for six months. Amounts withheld under this practice are known as retention or retainage. Our average project duration, together with typical retention terms, generally allow us to complete the realization of revenue and earnings in cash within one year. 2022 Compared to 2021 Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash flow from operations is primarily influenced by demand for our services and operating margins but can also be influenced by working capital needs associated with the various types of services that we provide. In particular, working capital needs may increase when we commence large volumes of work under circumstances where project costs, primarily associated with labor, equipment and subcontractors, are required to be paid before the receivables resulting from the work performed are billed and collected. Working capital needs are generally higher during the late winter and spring months as we prepare and plan for the increased project demand when favorable weather conditions exist in the summer and fall months. Conversely, working capital assets are typically converted to cash during the late summer and fall months as project completion is underway. These seasonal trends are sometimes offset by changes in the timing of major projects, which can be impacted by the weather, project delays or accelerations and other economic factors that may affect customer spending. We generated 301.5 million of cash flow from operating activities during 2022 compared with 180.2 million during 2021. The 121.4 million increase in cash provided was primarily driven by higher earnings in the current year, a 108.6 million benefit from billings in excess of costs, attributable to the timing of billings and various project work and a 72.8 million increase in deferred revenue liabilities driven by large advance payments received in 2022. The benefit from the advance payments received in 2022 will reverse in 2023, except to the extent that additional advanced payments are received in 2023. We made income tax payments of 52.6 million during 2022 related to the capitalization of research and experimental expenditures pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017). These payments were partially offset by 33.3 million of income tax refunds received in early 2022. These benefits were also partially offset by a 165.1 million change in receivables, net driven by the increase in revenue compared to the prior year. Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was 97.2 million for 2022 compared to 246.7 million during 2021. The 149.5 million decrease in cash used primarily relates to a decrease in cash paid (net of cash acquired) for acquisitions, partially offset by higher purchases of property and equipment in the current year compared to 2021. Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities was 205.9 million for 2022 compared to cash provided by financing activities of 70.5 million during 2021. The 276.4 million increase in 
 35 

Table of Contents 
 cash used is primarily due to higher net repayments on debt in the current year driven by strong operating cash flows, as well as due to an increase in share repurchases in 2022. 2021 Compared to 2020 For a discussion of the period-to-period comparison of 2021 to 2020, please refer to Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources 2021 Compared to 2020 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Free Cash Flow We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities, less customary capital expenditures, plus the proceeds from asset sales. We believe free cash flow, by encompassing both profit margins and the use of working capital over our approximately one year working capital cycle, is an effective measure of operating effectiveness and efficiency. We have included free cash flow information here for this reason, and because we are often asked about it by third parties evaluating us. However, free cash flow is not considered under generally accepted accounting principles to be a primary measure of an entity s financial results, and accordingly free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to operating income, net income, or amounts shown in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as determined under generally accepted accounting principles. Free cash flow may be defined differently by other companies. Share Repurchase Program On March 29, 2007, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program to acquire up to 1.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock. Subsequently, the Board has from time to time increased the number of shares that may be acquired under the program and approved extensions of the program. On May 17, 2022, the Board approved an extension to the program by increasing the shares authorized for repurchase by 0.7 million shares. Since the inception of the repurchase program, the Board has approved 10.9 million shares to be repurchased. As of December 31, 2022, we have repurchased a cumulative total of 10.1 million shares at an average price of 24.52 per share under the repurchase program. The share repurchases will be made from time to time at our discretion in the open market or privately negotiated transactions as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements, and subject to market conditions and other factors. The Board may modify, suspend, extend or terminate the program at any time. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased 0.4 million shares for approximately 38.2 million at an average price of 86.45 per share. Debt Revolving Credit Facility On May 25, 2022, we amended our senior credit facility (as amended, the Facility arranged by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and provided by a syndicate of banks, increasing our borrowing capacity from 562.5 million (of which 450 million was a revolving credit facility) to 850 million. As amended, the Facility is composed of a revolving credit line guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries, in the amount of 850.0 million. The amended Facility also provides for an accordion or increase option not to exceed the greater of (a) 250 million and (b) 1.0x Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below), as well as a sublimit of up to 175.0 million issuable in the form of letters of credit. The Facility expires in July 2027 and is secured by a first lien on substantially all of our personal property except for assets related to projects subject to surety bonds and the equity of, and assets held by, certain unrestricted subsidiaries and our wholly owned captive insurance company, and a second lien on our assets related to projects subject to surety bonds. In 2022, we incurred approximately 2.3 million in financing and professional costs in connection with the amendment to the Facility, which, combined with previously unamortized costs of 1.2 million, are being amortized on a straight-line basis as a non-cash charge to interest expense over the remaining term of the Facility. As of December 31, 2022, we had 215.0 million of outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility, 54.2 million in letters of credit and 580.8 million of credit available.

Table of Contents 
 There are two interest rate options for borrowings under the Facility, the Base Rate Loan (as defined in the Facility) option and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR Loan option. These rates are floating rates determined by the broad financial markets, meaning they can and do move up and down from time to time. Additional margins are then added to these two rates. Certain of our vendors require letters of credit to ensure reimbursement for amounts they are disbursing on our behalf, such as to beneficiaries under our self-funded insurance programs. We have also occasionally used letters of credit to guarantee performance under our contracts and to ensure payment to our subcontractors and vendors under those contracts. Such letters of credit are issued under the Facility for a fee. The letter of credit fees range from 1.00 to 2.00 per annum, based on the Net Leverage Ratio. Commitment fees are payable on the portion of the revolving loan capacity not in use for borrowings or letters of credit at any given time. These fees range from 0.15 to 0.25 per annum, based on the Net Leverage Ratio. Interest expense included the following primary elements (in thousands): 

Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Interest expense on notes to former owners 1,139 1,052 1,354 Interest expense on borrowings and unused commitment fees 10,955 3,371 5,319 Interest expense (income) on interest rate swaps (332) 499 338 Interest expense on finance leases 4 57 Letter of credit fees 800 679 830 Amortization of debt financing costs 786 538 544 Total 13,352 6,196 8,385 The Facility contains financial covenants defining various financial measures and the levels of these measures with which we must comply. Covenant compliance is assessed as of each quarter end. Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA is defined under the Facility for financial covenant purposes as consolidated net income for the four fiscal quarters ending as of any given quarterly covenant compliance measurement date, plus the corresponding amounts for (a) interest expense; (b) provision for income taxes; (c) depreciation and amortization; (d) stock or equity compensation; (e) other non-cash charges; and (f) pre-acquisition results of acquired companies. The following is a reconciliation of Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA to net income for 2022 (in thousands): 

Net income 245,947 Provision (benefit) for income taxes (10,089) Interest expense, net 13,306 Depreciation and amortization expense 81,347 Stock-based compensation 10,532 Pre-acquisition results of acquired companies, as defined under the Facility 356 Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA 341,399 The Facility s principal financial covenants include: Net Leverage Ratio The Facility requires that the ratio of (a) our Consolidated Total Indebtedness (as defined in the Facility) minus unrestricted cash and cash equivalents up to 100,000,000, to (b) our Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA not exceed 3.50 to 1.00 as of the end of each fiscal quarter. Interest Coverage Ratio The Facility requires that the ratio of (a) Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA to (b) consolidated interest expense, defined as all interest paid or accrued on indebtedness during the period excluding amortization of debt incurrence expenses, original issue discount, and mark-to-market interest expense, be at least 3.00 to 1.00. Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA and consolidated interest expense are calculated for purposes of this covenant for the four fiscal quarters ending as of any given quarterly covenant compliance measurement date. Other Restrictions The Facility (a) permits unlimited acquisitions when the Company s Net Leverage Ratio is less than or equal to 3.25 to 1.00, (b) expands certain baskets for permitted indebtedness and 
 37 

Table of Contents 
 liens, and (c) permits unlimited distributions, stock repurchases, and investments when the Net Leverage Ratio is less than or equal to 2.75 to 1.00. While the Facility s financial covenants do not specifically govern capacity under the Facility, if our debt level under the Facility at a quarter-end covenant compliance measurement date were to cause us to violate the Facility s Net Leverage Ratio covenant, our borrowing capacity under the Facility and the favorable terms that we currently have could be negatively impacted. We were in compliance with all of our financial covenants as of December 31, 2022. Notes to Former Owners As part of the consideration used to acquire ten companies, we have outstanding notes to the former owners. Together, these notes had an outstanding balance of 41.0 million as of December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, future principal payments of notes to former owners by maturity year are as follows (dollars in thousands): 

Balance at Range of Stated December 31, 2022 Interest Rates 2023 9,000 2.5 2024 7,200 2.5 - 3.0 2025 22,215 2.3 - 3.0 2026 2,625 2.5 Total 41,040 Outlook We have generated positive net free cash flow for the last twenty-four calendar years, much of which occurred during challenging economic and industry conditions. We also continue to have significant borrowing capacity under our credit facility, and we maintain what we feel are reasonable cash balances. We believe these factors will provide us with sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for the foreseeable future. Other Commitments As is common in our industry, we have entered into certain off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business that result in risks not directly reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as obligations involving letters of credit and surety guarantees. Certain of our vendors require letters of credit to ensure reimbursement for amounts they are disbursing on our behalf, such as to beneficiaries under our self-funded insurance programs. We have also occasionally used letters of credit to guarantee performance under our contracts and to ensure payment to our subcontractors and vendors under those contracts. The letters of credit we provide are actually issued by our lenders through the Facility as described above. A letter of credit commits the lenders to pay specified amounts to the holder of the letter of credit if the holder demonstrates that we have failed to perform specified actions. If this were to occur, we would be required to reimburse the lenders. Depending on the circumstances of such a reimbursement, we may also have to record a charge to earnings for the reimbursement. Absent a claim, there is no payment or reserving of funds by us in connection with a letter of credit. However, because a claim on a letter of credit would require immediate reimbursement by us to our lenders, letters of credit are treated as a use of the Facility s capacity just the same as actual borrowings. Claims against letters of credit are rare in our industry. To date, we have not had a claim made against a letter of credit that resulted in payments by a lender or by us. We believe that it is unlikely that we will have to fund claims under a letter of credit in the foreseeable future. Many customers, particularly in connection with new construction, require us to post performance and payment bonds issued by a financial institution known as a surety. If we fail to perform under the terms of a contract or to pay subcontractors and vendors who provided goods or services under a contract, the customer may demand that the surety make payments or provide services under the bond. We must reimburse the sureties for any expenses or outlays they incur. To date, we are not aware of any losses to our sureties in connection with bonds the sureties have posted on our behalf, and we do not expect such losses to be incurred in the foreseeable future.

 Under standard terms in the surety market, sureties issue bonds on a project-by-project basis, and can decline to issue bonds at any time. Historically, approximately 10 to 20 of our business has required bonds. While we currently have strong surety relationships to support our bonding needs, future market conditions or changes in our sureties assessment of our operating and financial risk could cause our sureties to decline to issue bonds for our work. If that were to occur, our alternatives include doing more business that does not require bonds, posting other forms of collateral for project performance, such as letters of credit or cash, and seeking bonding capacity from other sureties. We would likely also encounter concerns from customers, suppliers and other market participants as to our creditworthiness. While we believe our general operating and financial characteristics would enable us to ultimately respond effectively to an interruption in the availability of bonding capacity, such an interruption would likely cause our revenue and profits to decline in the near term. Material Cash Requirements Our material cash expenditures consist of normal operating expenditures, such as personnel costs, as well as the items noted in the following table. The table below summarizes current and long-term material cash requirements as of December 31, 2022, which we expect to fund primarily with operating cash flows (in thousands): Twelve Months Ending December 31, 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Total Revolving credit facility 215,000 215,000 Notes to former owners 9,000 7,200 22,215 2,625 41,040 Other debt 132 54 19 205 Interest payable 13,189 12,859 12,414 12,213 6,302 56,977 Operating lease obligations 26,275 23,743 22,471 19,172 14,914 51,638 158,213 Total 48,464 43,934 57,154 34,029 236,216 51,638 471,435 As of December 31, 2022, we have 54.2 million in letter of credit commitments, of which 28.9 million will expire in 2023 and 25.3 million will expire in 2024. The substantial majority of these letters of credit are posted with insurers who disburse funds on our behalf in connection with our workers compensation, auto liability and general liability insurance program. These letters of credit provide additional security to the insurers that sufficient financial resources will be available to fund claims on our behalf, many of which develop over long periods of time, should we ever encounter financial duress. Posting of letters of credit for this purpose is a common practice for entities that manage their self-insurance programs through third-party insurers as we do. While some of these letter of credit commitments expire in 2023, we expect nearly all of them, particularly those supporting our insurance programs, will be renewed annually. As discussed in Note 11 Income Taxes, included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2022 is 11.5 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions, or unrecognized tax benefits. We believe it is reasonably possible that a reduction of up to 5.3 million in unrecognized tax benefits could occur within the next twelve months. However, due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits may be concluded, we generally cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of cash flows related to these liabilities. Other than the lease obligations discussed in Note 10 Leases, we have no significant purchase or operating commitments outside of commitments to deliver equipment and provide labor in the ordinary course of performing project work. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are exposed to market risk primarily related to potential adverse changes in interest rates, as discussed below. We are actively involved in monitoring exposure to market risk and continue to develop and utilize appropriate risk management techniques. We are not exposed to any other significant financial market risks, including commodity price risk, or foreign currency exchange risk from the use of derivative financial instruments. At times, we use derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk. We have exposure to changes in interest rates under our revolving credit facility. Our debt with fixed interest rates consists of notes to former owners of acquired companies and acquired notes payable.

 The following table presents principal amounts (stated in thousands) and related average interest rates by year of maturity for our debt obligations at December 31, 2022: Twelve Months Ending December 31, 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Total Fixed Rate Debt 9,000 7,332 22,269 2,644 41,245 Average Interest Rate 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 Variable Rate Debt 215,000 215,000 The weighted average interest rate applicable to the borrowings under the revolving credit facility was approximately 5.7 as of December 31, 2022 and 1.4 as of December 31, 2021. We measure certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets are recognized at fair value when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. We did not recognize any impairments in the current year on those assets required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The valuation of the Company s contingent earn-out payments is determined using a probability weighted discounted cash flow method. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the purchase agreements (e.g., minimum and maximum payment, length of earn-out periods, manner of calculating any amounts due, etc.) and utilizes assumptions with regard to future cash flows, probabilities of achieving such future cash flows and a discount rate.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Comfort Systems USA, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Comfort Systems USA, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows, for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 22, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Revenue from Contracts with Customers Refer to Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company recognizes revenue based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The Company generally uses a cost-to-cost input method to measure progress for its contracts, as it depicts the transfer of assets to the customer that occurs as the Company incurs costs, which include labor, materials, subcontractors costs, other direct costs, and an allocation of indirect costs. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Revenue, including estimated fees or profits, is recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. 
 42 

Table of Contents 
 The cost-to-cost input method of accounting is also affected by changes in job performance, job conditions, and final contract settlements. These factors may result in revisions to estimated costs and, therefore, revenue. Such revisions are frequently based on further estimates and subjective assessments. Variations from estimated project costs could have a significant impact on operating results, depending on project size, and the recoverability of the variation from change orders collected from customers. Given the judgments necessary to account for the Company s contracts with customers, specifically the estimates of total costs that will be incurred at contract completion, which are complex and subject to many variables, auditing the corresponding balances and related accounting estimates required extensive audit effort due to the complexity of these estimates, and a high degree of auditor judgment when performing audit procedures and evaluating the results of those procedures. How the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to management s estimates and judgments included within the Company s estimated total costs at completion, included the following, among others: 
 We tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the recognition of revenue, including those over the determination of estimated costs at completion of the contracts (including the estimated progress toward completion). We evaluated quarter-over-quarter changes in contract profit estimates for a selection of contracts by obtaining explanations from Company s management regarding the timing and amount of the changes in estimates and corroborating these inquiries by inspecting documents, including management workplans, customer communications, change orders, vendor invoices, and supplier or subcontractor communications. We developed an independent expectation of recorded revenue at certain operating units using analytical procedures and considering relevant current and historical information and compared our expectations to the recorded revenue for the operating unit. For a sample of contracts with customers, we performed the following: o Evaluated the reasonableness of management s estimates of total costs and profit at completion by: Evaluating management s estimate of total costs at completion for each selected contract by performing corroborating inquiries with the Company s project managers and personnel involved with the selected contracts, and comparing the estimates to management s workplans, suppliers contracts, subcontract agreements, third-party invoices from suppliers, historical actual results, and/or engineering specifications. Evaluating management s ability to accurately estimate total costs and profits at completion by analyzing the comparison of actual costs and profits or current year estimates to prior year management s estimates. Evaluating changes in estimates and obtaining evidence regarding timing and amounts supporting these changes in estimates such as approved change order documents, communications with the customer, subcontract agreements and related amendments, recent actual costs, and other sources.

Such provisions are standard in our industry and usually allow for a small portion of progress billings or the contract price to be withheld by the customer until after we have completed work on the project, typically for a period of . Based on our experience with similar contracts in recent years, the majority of our billings for such retention balances at each Balance Sheet date are finalized and collected within the subsequent year. Retention balances at December 31, 2022 and 2021 were million and million, respectively, and are included in accounts receivable. Accounts payable at December 31, 2022 and 2021 included million and million of retainage under terms of contracts with subcontractors, respectively. The majority of the retention balances at each Balance Sheet date are finalized and paid within the subsequent year. The cost-to-cost input method of accounting is also affected by changes in job performance, job conditions, and final contract settlements. These factors may result in revisions to estimated costs and, therefore, revenue. Such revisions are frequently based on further estimates and subjective assessments. The effects of these revisions are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined. When such revisions lead to a conclusion that a loss will be recognized on a contract, the full amount of the estimated ultimate loss is recognized in the period such conclusion is reached, regardless of the completion percentage of the contract. Revisions to project costs and conditions can give rise to change orders under which there is an agreement between the customer and us that the customer pays an additional or reduced contract price. Revisions can also result in claims we might make against the customer to recover project variances that have not been satisfactorily addressed through change orders with the customer. The amount of revenue associated with unapproved change orders and claims was immaterial for the year ended December 31, 2022. Variations from estimated project costs could have a significant impact on our operating results, depending on project size, and the recoverability of the variation from change orders collected from customers. days . It is common in the construction industry for a contract to specify more lenient payment terms allowing the customer 45 to to make their payment. It is also common for the contract in the construction industry to specify that a general contractor is not required to submit payments to a subcontractor until it has received those funds from the owner or funding source. In most instances, we receive payment of our invoices between 30 to of the date of the invoice. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. A contract s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. To determine the proper revenue recognition method for contracts, we evaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as one performance obligation and whether the combined or single contract

 Existing Building Construction Service Projects Service Calls, Maintenance and Monitoring Total Contract Assets and Liabilities Contract assets include unbilled amounts typically resulting from sales under long term contracts when the cost-to-cost method of revenue recognition is used, revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer and right to payment is conditional or subject to completing a milestone, such as a phase of the project. Contract assets are not considered a significant financing component, as they are intended to protect the customer in the event that we do not perform our obligations under the contract. Contract assets are generally classified as current, as it is very unusual for us to have contract assets with a term of greater than one year. Contract liabilities consist of advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized. It is very unusual for us to have advanced payments with a term of greater than one year; therefore, our contract liabilities are usually all current. Advanced payments from customers related to work not yet started are classified as Deferred Revenue. If we have advanced payments with a term greater than one year, the noncurrent portion of advanced payments would be included in Other Long-term Liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Contract liabilities are not considered to have a significant financing component, as they are used to meet working capital requirements that are generally higher in the early stages of a contract and are intended to protect us from the other party failing to meet its obligations under the contract. Our contract assets and liabilities are reported in a net position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. The following table presents the changes in contract assets and contract liabilities (in thousands): Change due to acquisitions / disposals Change related to credit allowance ) Other changes in the period ) Balance at end of period During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized revenue of million and million related to our contract liabilities at January 1, 2021 and January 1, 2020, respectively. We did not have any impairment losses recognized on our receivables or contract assets in 2022 and 2021. Remaining Performance Obligations Remaining construction performance obligations represent the remaining transaction price of firm orders for which work has not been performed and exclude unexercised contract options. As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was billion. The Company expects to recognize revenue on approximately - of the remaining performance obligations over the next , with the remaining recognized thereafter. Our service maintenance agreements are generally renewable agreements. We have adopted the practical expedient that allows us to not include service maintenance contracts with a total term of one year or less; therefore, we do not report unfulfilled performance obligations for service maintenance agreements.

 million, a net loss of million and a net loss of million, respectively, related to our interest rate swaps. We currently do not have any derivatives that are accounted for as hedges under ASC 815. Fair Value Measurement We classify and disclose assets and liabilities carried at fair value in one of the following three categories: Level 1 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; Level 2 observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data; and Level 3 significant unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. 
 Life insurance cash surrender value Contingent earn-out obligations Fair Value Measurements at December 31, 2021 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Cash and cash equivalents Life insurance cash surrender value Contingent earn-out obligations Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of highly rated money market funds at a variety of well-known institutions with original maturities of three months or less. The original cost of these assets approximates fair value due to their short-term maturity. We believe the carrying value of our debt associated with our revolving credit facility approximates its fair value due to the variable rate on such debt. We believe the carrying values of our notes to former owners approximate their fair values due to the relatively short remaining terms on these notes. We have life insurance policies covering employees with a combined face value of million. The policies are invested in several investment vehicles, and the fair value measurement of the cash surrender balance associated with these policies is determined using Level 2 inputs within the fair value hierarchy and will vary with investment performance. The cash surrender value of these policies is included in Other Noncurrent Assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We value contingent earn-out obligations using a probability weighted discounted cash flow method. This fair value measurement is based on significant unobservable inputs in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the purchase agreements (e.g., minimum and maximum payments, length of earn-out periods, manner of calculating any amounts due, etc.) and utilizes

Atlantic performs electrical contracting for customers in various South Carolina markets, as well as installation of airport runway lighting in the Southeast. As a result of the acquisition, Atlantic is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company reported in our electrical services segment. On December 31, 2021, we acquired MEP Holding Co., Inc., and its related subsidiaries (collectively, MEP Holdings for a total purchase price of million, which included million funded on the closing date, million in notes payable to former owners, an earn-out that will be paid if certain financial targets are met after the acquisition date and a working capital adjustment. As a result of the acquisition, MEP Holdings is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and reports as a separate operating location in our electrical services segment. Additionally, on December 31, 2021, we completed an acquisition of a service and controls business in Kentucky with a total purchase price of million and a temporary staffing company based in Indiana with a total purchase price of million, which are both reported in our mechanical services segment. On December 1, 2021, we acquired Ivey Mechanical Company, LLC Ivey headquartered in Kosciusko, Mississippi for a total purchase price of million, which included million of cash paid on the closing date, a million short term payable which was settled in the third quarter of 2022, million in notes payable to former owners, plus an earn-out that will be paid if certain financial targets are met after the acquisition date and a working capital adjustment. As a result of the acquisition, Ivey is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and reports as a separate operating location in our mechanical services segment. On August 1, 2021, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Amteck Holdco LLC and each of its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively Amteck ). The total purchase price was million of which million was allocated to goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. The total purchase price included million in cash, million in working capital adjustment, million in notes payable to former owners and a million contingent earn-out obligation. Amteck provides electrical contracting solutions and services, including design and build, pre-fabrication and installation for core electric and low-voltage systems, as well as services for planned maintenance, retrofit and emergency work.

 million, which is reported in our mechanical services segment. The results of operations of acquisitions are included in our consolidated financial statements from their respective acquisition dates. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet includes preliminary allocations of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the applicable acquisitions pending the completion of the final valuation of intangible assets and accrued liabilities. The acquisitions completed in the current and prior year were not material, individually or in the aggregate. Additional contingent purchase price earn-out has been or will be paid if certain acquisitions achieve predetermined profitability targets. Such earn-outs, when they are not subject to the continued employment of the sellers, are estimated as of the purchase date and included as part of the consideration paid for the acquisition. If we have an earn-out under which continued employment is a condition to receipt of payment, then the earn-out is recorded as compensation expense over the period earned. Acquisitions and purchase price adjustments (See Note 5) Impact of segment reorganization ) Balance at December 31, 2021 Acquisitions and purchase price adjustments (See Note 5) Balance at December 31, 2022 The aggregate goodwill balance as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 includes million of accumulated impairment charges, all of which relate to the mechanical services segment. During our annual impairment testing on October 1, 2022, we performed a quantitative assessment where the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated using a discounted cash flow model combined with a market valuation approach. We assigned a weighting of to the discounted cash flow analysis and to the public company approach for the year ended December 31, 2022. Based on this assessment, we concluded that the fair value of each of the reporting units was greater than its carrying value. A decline in the estimated fair value of each reporting unit due to a change in assumptions would not have resulted in us recording an impairment in 2022. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, impairment of our goodwill was recorded. There are significant inherent uncertainties and management judgment involved in estimating the fair value of each reporting unit. While we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to estimate the fair value of our reporting units, it is possible that a material change could occur. If actual results are not consistent with our current estimates and assumptions, or the current economic outlook worsens, goodwill impairment charges may be recorded in future periods.

 Revolving Credit Facility On May 25, 2022, we amended our senior credit facility (as amended, the Facility arranged by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and provided by a syndicate of banks, increasing our borrowing capacity from million (of which million was a revolving credit facility) to million. As amended, the Facility is composed of a revolving credit line guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries, in the amount of million. The amended Facility also provides for an accordion or increase option not to exceed the greater of (a) million and (b) 1.0x Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below), as well as a sublimit of up to million issuable in the form of letters of credit. The Facility expires in July 2027 and is secured by a first lien on substantially all of our personal property except for assets related to projects subject to surety bonds and the equity of, and assets held by, certain unrestricted subsidiaries and our wholly owned captive insurance company, and a second lien on our assets related to projects subject to surety bonds. In 2022, we incurred approximately million in financing and professional costs in connection with the amendment to the Facility, which, combined with previously unamortized costs of million, are being amortized on a straight-line basis as a non-cash charge to interest expense over the remaining term of the Facility. As of December 31, 2022, we had million of outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility, million in letters of credit outstanding and million of credit available. Collateral A common practice in our industry is the posting of payment and performance bonds with customers. These bonds are offered by financial institutions known as sureties and provide assurance to the customer that in the event we encounter significant financial or operational difficulties, the surety will arrange for the completion of our contractual obligations and for the payment of our vendors on the projects subject to the bonds. In cooperation with our lenders, we granted our sureties a first lien on assets such as receivables, costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings, and equipment specifically identifiable to projects for which bonds are outstanding, as collateral for potential obligations under bonds. As of December 31, 2022, the book value of these assets was approximately million. Covenants and Restrictions The Facility contains financial covenants defining various financial measures and the levels of these measures with which we must comply. Covenant compliance is assessed as of each quarter end. Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA is defined under the Facility for financial covenant purposes as consolidated net income for the fiscal quarters ending as of any given quarterly covenant compliance measurement date, plus the corresponding amounts for (a) interest expense; (b) provision for income taxes; (c) depreciation and amortization; (d) stock or equity compensation; (e) other non-cash charges; and (f) pre-acquisition results of acquired companies. The Facility s principal financial covenants include: Net Leverage Ratio The Facility requires that the ratio of (a) our Consolidated Total Indebtedness (as defined in the Facility) minus unrestricted cash and cash equivalents up to , to (b) our Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA not exceed to 1.00 as of the end of each fiscal quarter. Interest Coverage Ratio The Facility requires that the ratio of (a) Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA to (b) consolidated interest expense, defined as all interest paid or accrued on indebtedness during the period excluding amortization of debt incurrence expenses, original issue discount, and mark-to-market interest expense, be at least to 1.00. Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA and consolidated interest expense are calculated for purposes of this covenant for the fiscal quarters ending as of any given quarterly covenant compliance measurement date. Other Restrictions The Facility (a) permits unlimited acquisitions when the Company s Net Leverage Ratio is less than or equal to to 1.00, (b) expands certain baskets for permitted indebtedness and liens, and (c) permits unlimited distributions, stock repurchases, and investments when the Net Leverage Ratio is less than or equal to to 1.00. While the Facility s financial covenants do not specifically govern capacity under the Facility, if our debt level under the Facility at a quarter-end covenant compliance measurement date were to cause us to violate the Facility s Net Leverage Ratio covenant, our borrowing capacity under the Facility and the favorable terms that we currently have could be negatively impacted. We were in compliance with all of our financial covenants as of December 31, 2022.

 interest rate options for borrowings under the Facility, the Base Rate Loan (as defined in the Facility) option and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR Loan option. Under the Base Rate Loan option, the interest rate is determined based on the highest of (a) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the Facility) plus , (b) the prime lending rate established by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., and (c) the one-month Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined in the Facility) plus . Under the SOFR Loan option, the interest rate is determined based on Adjusted Term SOFR for a one, three, or six-month tenor at our election. Additional margins are then added to these rates. The additional margins are determined based on our Net Leverage Ratio. The interest rates under the Facility are floating rates determined by the broad financial markets, meaning they can and do move up and down from time to time. For illustrative purposes, the following are the respective market rates as of December 31, 2022 relating to interest options under the Facility: Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Prime Rate One-month SOFR plus SOFR Loan Option: Certain of our vendors require letters of credit to ensure reimbursement for amounts they are disbursing on our behalf, such as to beneficiaries under our self-funded insurance programs. We have also occasionally used letters of credit to guarantee performance under our contracts and to ensure payment to our subcontractors and vendors under those contracts. Our lenders issue such letters of credit through the Facility. A letter of credit commits the lenders to pay specified amounts to the holder of the letter of credit if the holder demonstrates that we have failed to perform specified actions. If this were to occur, we would be required to reimburse the lenders for amounts they fund to honor the letter of credit holder s claim. Absent a claim, there is no payment or reserving of funds by us in connection with a letter of credit. However, because a claim on a letter of credit would require immediate reimbursement by us to our lenders, letters of credit are treated as a use of facility capacity just the same as actual borrowings. We have never had a claim made against a letter of credit that resulted in payments by a lender or by us and believe such a claim is unlikely in the foreseeable future. Commitment fees are payable on the portion of the revolving loan capacity not in use for borrowings or letters of credit at any given time. Letter of credit fees and commitment fees are based on the Net Leverage Ratio. SOFR Loan Option Letter of credit fees Commitment fees on any portion of the Revolving Loan capacity not in use for borrowings or letters of credit at any given time The weighted average interest rate applicable to the borrowings under the revolving credit facility was approximately as of December 31, 2022 and as of December 31, 2021.

 companies, we have outstanding notes to the former owners. Together, these notes had an outstanding balance of million as of December 31, 2022. 2024 - 2025 - 2026 Total million in 2022, million in 2021 and million in 2020. Lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The weighted average discount rate for our operating leases as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was and , respectively. We recognize operating lease expense, including escalating lease payments and lease incentives, on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Operating lease expense for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was million, million and million, respectively. The lease terms generally range from three to . Some leases include or options to renew, which may be exercised to extend the lease term. We include the exercise of lease renewal options in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option and such exercise is at our sole discretion. The weighted average remaining lease term for our operating leases was years at December 31, 2022 and years at December 31, 2021. A majority of the Company s real property leases are with individuals or entities with whom we have no other business relationship. However, in certain instances the Company enters into real property leases with current or former employees. Rent paid to related parties for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was approximately million, million and million, respectively. If we decide to cancel or terminate a lease before the end of its term, we would typically owe the lessor the remaining lease payments under the term of the lease. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. On rare occasions, we rent or sublease certain real estate assets that we no longer use to third parties.

The reasons for the differences between these effective tax rates and the federal statutory rates are as follows (in thousands, except percentages): December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Federal statutory rate of Income taxes at the federal statutory rate Increases (decreases) resulting from Net state income taxes Valuation allowances ) ) ) Net unrecognized tax benefits ) Nondeductible expenses R D tax credit ) ) 179D deduction ) ) ) Stock-based compensation deductions ) ) ) Other ) ) Provision (benefit) for income taxes ) During the third quarter of 2020, the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS completed their examination of our amended federal returns for 2014 and 2015 and issued a Revenue Agent Report RAR allowing the million of refund claims in full. Subsequently, the Joint Committee on Taxation (the JCT reviewed and approved the refund claims. As a result, our provision for income taxes was decreased by million due to a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits. In early October 2020, we filed amended federal returns for 2016, 2017 and 2018 primarily to claim the credit for increasing research activities (the R D tax credit requesting refunds of million, million and million, respectively. The million of refunds requested was offset by an increase in unrecognized tax benefits of million due to the uncertainty of the outcome of an IRS examination. Because of the increase in unrecognized tax benefits, the refunds requested for 2016, 2017 and 2018 had no material impact on our effective tax rates in the 2020 and 2021 calendar years. Following an IRS survey of the previously filed refund claims for the 2016, 2017 and 2018 tax years, the JCT approved such refunds in late January 2022. As a result, our benefit for income taxes in the first quarter of 2022 included a million reduction in unrecognized tax benefits plus approximately million of net interest income on the refunds. Our benefit for income taxes in the first quarter of 2022 was further increased by million for the expected refunds due to our intention to claim the R D tax credit for the 2019, 2020 and 2021 tax years. In the third quarter of 2022, we claimed the R D tax credit on our originally filed 2021 federal return and recognized an additional million benefit for the 2019, 2020 and 2021 tax years. Additionally, in February 2023, we filed amended federal returns for 2019 and 2020 requesting refunds primarily from claiming the R D tax credit. The Inflation Reduction Act was enacted on August 16, 2022. This law, among other provisions, provides a corporate alternative minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income over 1 billion, which is effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022, and a 1 excise tax on net corporate stock repurchases after December 31, 2022. We currently believe these provisions will be immaterial to our overall financial results, financial position and cash flows.

Beginning in 2022, R E expenditures must be capitalized and amortized pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017). Of the million deferred tax asset for NOL carryforwards, million is related to million of federal NOL carryforwards from the TAS Energy Inc. TAS acquisition. If not used, such carryforwards will begin to expire in 2032. Pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, utilization of our federal NOL carryforwards is subject to annual limitations due to the ownership change in TAS. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than 50 percentage points over a three-year period. Our management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit the use of the existing deferred tax assets. The most significant piece of objective evidence evaluated was three years of cumulative pretax income in the federal jurisdiction. Management determined there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude it is more likely than not our deferred tax assets are virtually all realizable.

We also accrued million for potential interest and penalties related to the unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2022. We recognize potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our provision for income taxes. We are subject to taxation in the federal and various state jurisdictions. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2020, our unrecognized tax benefits were reduced by million and million, respectively, due to favorable settlements with the IRS for the 2014 through 2018 tax years. As of December 31, 2022, we remain open to IRS examination for the 2019 tax year forward. State income tax returns are generally subject to examination for a period of three to four years after filing the returns. However, the state impact of any federal audit adjustments and/or amendments remains subject to examination by various states for up to one year after formal notification to the states. As of December 31, 2022, we generally remain open to examination by various state taxing authorities for the 2018 tax year forward. We believe it is reasonably possible that a reduction of up to million in unrecognized tax benefits could occur within the next twelve months. Any reductions in our unrecognized tax benefits, due to the future recognition of those tax benefits, would affect our effective tax rates. of covered employees salaries or wages. These contributions totaled million in 2022, million in 2021 and million in 2020. Of these amounts, approximately million and million were payable to the plans at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Certain of our subsidiaries also participate or have participated in various multi-employer pension plans for the benefit of employees who are union members. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had and employees, respectively, who were union members. There were contributions made to multi-employer pension plans in 2022, 2021 or 2020. The data available from administrators of other multi-employer pension plans is not sufficient to determine the accumulated benefit obligations, nor the net assets attributable to the multi-employer plans in which our employees participate or previously participated. Certain individuals at one of our operating units are entitled to receive fixed annual payments that reach a maximum amount, as specified in the related agreements, for a period following retirement or, in some cases, the attainment of of age. We recognize the unfunded status of the plan as a non-current liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Benefits vest after of service, after of service and are fully vested after of service. We had an unfunded benefit liability of million and million recorded as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

 million related to legal matters that merited changes to our assessments of the related accruals in the ordinary course of our business based on information received in 2022. The largest change resulted from favorable developments related to a dispute with a customer regarding the outcome of a completed project as well as the obligation to perform subcontract work under two executed letters of intent for subsequent projects that we believed were not enforceable. The net gain of million was recorded primarily as an increase in gross profit in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2022, we recorded an accrual for unresolved matters, which is not material to our financial statements, based on our analysis of likely outcomes related to the respective matters; however, it is possible that the ultimate outcome and associated costs will deviate from our estimates and that, in the event of an unexpectedly adverse outcome, we may experience additional costs and expenses in future periods. Surety Many customers, particularly in connection with new construction, require us to post performance and payment bonds issued by a financial institution known as a surety. If we fail to perform under the terms of a contract or to pay subcontractors and vendors who provided goods or services under a contract, the customer may demand that the surety make payments or provide services under the bond. We must reimburse the surety for any expenses or outlays it incurs. Current market conditions for surety markets and bonding capacity are adequate, with acceptable terms and conditions. Historically, approximately to of our business has required bonds. While we currently have strong surety relationships to support our bonding needs, future market conditions or changes in the sureties assessment of our operating and financial risk could cause the sureties to decline to issue bonds for our work. If that were to occur, the alternatives include doing more business that does not require bonds, posting other forms of collateral for project performance, such as letters of credit or cash, and seeking bonding capacity from other sureties. We would likely also encounter concerns from customers, suppliers and other market participants as to our creditworthiness. While we believe our general operating and financial characteristics would enable us to ultimately respond effectively to an interruption in the availability of bonding capacity, such an interruption would likely cause our revenue and profits to decline in the near term. Self-Insurance We are substantially self-insured for workers compensation, employer s liability, auto liability, general liability and employee group health claims, in view of the relatively high per-incident deductibles we absorb under our insurance arrangements for these risks. Losses are estimated and accrued based upon known facts, historical trends and industry averages. Estimated losses in excess of our deductible, which have not already been paid, are included in our accrual with a corresponding receivable from our insurance carrier. Loss estimates associated with the larger and longer-developing risks, such as workers compensation, auto liability and general liability, are reviewed by a third-party actuary quarterly.

As of December 31, 2022, there were million shares available for issuance under this plan. The 2017 Plan will expire in May 2027. We have outstanding and exercisable stock options under our 2012 Equity Incentive Plan, which was superseded by the 2017 Plan. Share Repurchase Program On March 29, 2007, our Board of Directors (the Board approved a stock repurchase program to acquire up to million shares of our outstanding common stock. Subsequently, the Board has from time to time increased the number of shares that may be acquired under the program and approved extensions of the program. On May 17, 2022, the Board approved an extension to the program by increasing the shares authorized for repurchase by million shares. Since the inception of the repurchase program, the Board has approved million shares to be repurchased. As of December 31, 2022, we have repurchased a cumulative total of million shares at an average price of per share under the repurchase program. The share repurchases will be made from time to time at our discretion in the open market or privately negotiated transactions as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements, and subject to market conditions and other factors. The Board may modify, suspend, extend or terminate the program at any time. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased million shares for approximately million at an average price of per share.

 Granted Vested ) Forfeited ) Unvested at end of year Approximately million of compensation expense related to restricted stock and restricted stock units will be recognized over a weighted-average period of years. The total fair value of shares vested during the year ended December 31, 2022 was million. The weighted-average fair value per share of restricted stock shares and units awarded during 2022, 2021 and 2020 was , and , respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of restricted stock vested during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was million, million and million, respectively. Performance Stock Units Under the 2017 Plan, we granted dollar-denominated performance vesting restricted stock units PSUs ), which cliff vest at the end of a performance period. The PSUs are subject to performance measures; of the PSUs are based on the annual performance of our stock price relative to a group of our peers (total shareholder return) and of the PSUs are measured based on meeting or exceeding a pre-determined annual earnings per share target as set by our Board of Directors (EPS). Depending on the Company s performance in relation to the established performance measures, the awards may vest at to a maximum of times the dollar-denominated award granted at target. Upon achievement of the necessary performance metrics, the award will be determined in dollars and may be settled in cash or stock based on the market price of the Company s common stock at the end of the performance period, at our discretion. Compensation expense for dollar-denominated performance units will ultimately be equal to the final dollar value awarded to the grantee upon vesting, settled either in cash or stock. However, throughout the performance period we must record and accrue expense based on an estimate of that future payout. For units determined by EPS performance, the awards are evaluated quarterly against established targets in order to estimate the liability throughout the vesting period. For units determined by total shareholder return performance, a Monte Carlo simulation model was used to estimate accruals throughout the vesting period. The model simulates our total shareholder return and compares it against our peer group over the performance period to produce a predicted distribution of relative share performance. This is applied to the reward criteria to give an expected value of the total shareholder return element. The calculated fair market value as of December 31, 2022 was million. Of this amount, million relates to the PSUs granted in 2020 whose performance period ended December 31, 2022. These awards will be settled within the upcoming year either in cash or stock. The expense related to performance stock units for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was million, million and million, respectively. At the December 31, 2022 calculated fair market value, approximately million of compensation expense related to performance stock units will be recognized over a weighted-average period of years. reportable segments: (a) our mechanical segment, which includes HVAC, plumbing, piping, and controls, as well as off-site construction, monitoring and fire protection; and (b) our electrical segment, which includes installation and servicing of electrical systems. We consider these lines of business to be separate segments because they require different skill sets, and the business models for providing services have some differences, as a mechanical system requires ongoing maintenance and monitoring and an electrical system generally does not. However, the business model for installation of new systems or retrofitting existing systems is very similar between the segments. Segment

 ITEM 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. ITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our executive management is responsible for ensuring the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. We conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during the three months ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting. Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO 2013 framework). Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Deloitte Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included elsewhere herein, has issued an attestation report auditing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.
