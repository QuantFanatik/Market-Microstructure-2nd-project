Business 

Introduction
 The Company was formed in May 1988 to produce and sell premium, super premium and ultra-premium varietals. The Company was
originally established as a sole proprietorship by Oregon winegrower Jim Bernau in 1983. The Company is headquartered in Turner, Oregon,
which is just south of the state capitol of Salem, Oregon. The Company s wines are made from grapes grown in vineyards owned, leased
or contracted by the Company, and from grapes purchased from other vineyards. The grapes are harvested, fermented and made into wine
primarily at the Company s winery in Turner, Oregon (the Estate Winery or Winery and the wines are sold
principally under the Company s Willamette Valley Vineyards label, but also under the Domaine Willamette, Griffin Creek, Tualatin
Estate, Pambrun, Maison Bleue, Natoma, Metis, Pere Ami and Elton labels. The Company also owns the Tualatin Estate Vineyards and Winery,
located near Forest Grove, Oregon (the Tualatin Winery ). 

Segments

Market
overview The United States wine industry has seen a rapid increase in wineries established nationwide. The United States
wine industry added 400 new wineries in 2022, a 3 increase from 2021, according to Wine Analytics Report . From 2009 to 2021,
U.S. wineries grew from 6,357 to 11,053, according to Statista, and consequently can be considered one of the fastest-growing segments
in agriculture. The total retail value of wine sales has increased from 26.3 billion in 2000 to 78.4 billion in 2021, according to
Statista. According to the report, the U.S. value of direct-to-consumer wine shipments grew by 13.4 percent during 2021. Total wine consumption
in the United States has also grown 46 percent since 2005. Additionally, 1.1 Billion gallons of wine were consumed in 2021, an increase
of 413 million from 2005 (Statista). Wine consumption has been increasing in the United States, as since 2005, the average annual consumption
per U.S. resident has increased by 33 percent to a high of 3.18 gallons in 2021. 

According
to Statista revenue in the U.S. wine market is worth 56.65 billion as of 2023, up 7.5 from the prior year, and is expected to grow
annually by 5.85 through 2027. Wine Grand View Research in their report believes millennials and younger generations drive this increase
as wine consumption has become a sign of social status. In addition, Wine Grand View Research believe innovations in flavors, color,
and packaging have also contributed to the growth. 

According
to Wine Intelligence Ltd., the total wine-drinking population in the U.S. increased to a record high of 118 million in 2019, an increase
of 8 million people drinking wine at least once a year compared with 2015. However, according to this same report the number of consumers
drinking wine at least once a month declined by 11 million over that same time. Wine Intelligence reports in that this trend is driven
by 21-34 year old s who are moderating consumption and switching to other beverages. Yet, Wine Intelligence found that Millennials
who remain regular wine drinkers, say they are more highly involved, adventurous and higher spending wine drinkers than more mature
consumers. According to the Wine Market Council of U.S. wine consumers in 2022, 54 were female and 42 male, with 34 drinking
wine more than once a week. Further, domestic wine accounted for 66.9 of U.S. sales in 2019, according to a Wines Vines Analytics.
Within the total wine market, the five most popular wines in 2022 were cabernet sauvignon, chardonnay, red blends, pinot gris, and pinot
noir, according to Nielsen. 

5 

In
2021, off-premise sales accounted for roughly 80 of the U.S. market, with an average bottle price of 12.05, according to Grand View
Research and Statista. In addition, a Sovos ShipCompliant and Wines Vines Analytics report from 2022 shows direct-to-consumer wine shipments
remained consistent with 2021 at 12 of the total off-premise wine market in the U.S. However, according to this report the average price
per bottle within these shipments increased by 9.7 in 2022 versus the prior year, up to 45.16. Pinot Noir was the second most-shipped
varietal during the year. 

In
summary, we believe the wine industry is on a solid trajectory and continues to grow. Overall, we believe the industry is expected to
stabilize in 2023 at the current levels. However, of concern, consumption growth is mainly amongst those over 60 years old, with
the most significant growth area among 70-80-year-olds. Consequently, we believe future positive sales and growth will depend on the
industry targeting younger consumers. According to the State of the Wine Industry 2023 by Rob McMillan, younger wine consumers are not
limited by cost; instead, they seek something enticing to draw them in to learn more about wine, including but not limited to health,
sustainability, social values, and transparent labeling, 

The
Company s Board of Directors and Management believe the winery s focus on integrity in winemaking, small scale, storied estate
vineyards, environmental stewardship, support for community needs and participatory wine experiences are reflective of the values of
a number of prospective, developing wine enthusiasts. 

The
Oregon wine industry Oregon is a relatively new wine-producing region in comparison to California and France. In 1966, there
were only two commercial wineries licensed in Oregon. According to the Oregon Vineyard and Winery Report produced by University of Oregon s
Institute for Policy Research and Engagement (UOIPRE) in 2021, the most recent year such data is available, the
overall number of wineries increased from 995 to 1,058 with the biggest increases coming from the Willamette Valley, which added 45.
 Planted acres of wine grape vineyards increased by 2,368 acres from 39,531 to 41,899, an increase of 6 , 39,083 acres of which
were harvested. Oregon wine grapes produced a 2021 crop with a total value of 271 million, an increase of 72 from 2020 primarily due
to a more normal fruit set compared to the preceding 2020 harvest according to UOIPRE. Pinot Noir leads all varieties accounting for
60 of planted acreage and 61 of production. According to UOIPRE, Oregon case sales in 2021 were 5.3 million, which was a 13 increase
from 2020. UOIPRE reported case sales in dollars for 2021 were approximately 844 million, a 21 increase from 2020. 

Because
of climate, soil and other growing conditions, we believe the Willamette Valley in western Oregon is ideally suited to growing superior
quality Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, Pinot Gris and Riesling wine grapes. Some of Oregon s Pinot Noir, Pinot Gris and Chardonnay wines
have developed outstanding reputations, winning numerous national and international awards. 

Oregon
does have certain disadvantages as a wine-producing region. Oregon s wines are lesser known to consumers worldwide and the total
wine production of Oregon wineries is small relative to California and French competitors. Greater worldwide label recognition and larger
production levels give Oregon s competitors certain financial, marketing, distribution, and unit cost advantages. 

Furthermore,
Oregon s Willamette Valley has an unpredictable rainfall pattern in early autumn. If significantly above-average rains occur just
prior to the autumn grape harvest, the quality of harvested grapes is often materially diminished, thereby affecting that year s
wine quality. 

Finally,
phylloxera, an aphid-like insect that feeds on the roots of grapevines, has been found in several commercial vineyards in Oregon. Contrary
to the California experience, most Oregon phylloxera infestations have expanded very slowly and done only minimal damage. Nevertheless,
phylloxera does constitute a significant risk to Oregon vineyards. Prior to the discovery of phylloxera in Oregon, all vine plantings
in the Company s Estate Vineyard, in Turner, Oregon, were with non-resistant rootstock. In 1997, the Company purchased Tualatin
Vineyards at the Tualatin Winery, which has phylloxera at its site. All current plantings are with, and all future planting will be with,
phylloxera-resistant rootstock at that location. The Company takes commercially reasonable precautions in an effort to prevent the spread
of phylloxera to other vineyards. 

6 

As
a result of these factors, subject to the risks and uncertainties identified in this Annual Report, the Company believes that long-term
prospects for growth in the Oregon wine industry are excellent. The Company believes that over the next several years the Oregon wine
industry will grow at a faster rate than the overall domestic wine industry, and that much of this growth will favor producers of premium,
super premium and ultra-premium wines such as the Company s Estate, Elton, Domaine Willamette, Pambrun, Maison Bleue and Griffin
Creek brands. 

Company
Strategy 

The
Company, one of the largest wine producers in Oregon by volume, believes its success is dependent upon its ability to: (1) grow and purchase
high quality vinifera wine grapes; (2) vinify the grapes into premium, super premium and ultra-premium wine; (3) achieve significant
brand recognition for its wines, first in Oregon and then nationally and internationally; (4) effectively distribute and sell its products
nationally; and (5) continue to build on its base of direct to consumer sales. The Company s goal is to continue to build on a reputation
for producing some of Oregon s finest, most sought-after wines. 

Based
upon several highly regarded surveys of the U.S. wine industry, the Company believes that successful wineries exhibit the following four
key attributes: (i) focus on production of high-quality premium, super premium and ultra-premium varietal wines; (ii) achieve brand positioning
that supports high bottle prices for its high quality wines; (iii) build brand recognition; and (iv) develop strong marketing advantages
(such as a highly visible winery locations, successful support of distribution, and life-long customer service programs). 

To
successfully execute this strategy, the Company has assembled a team of accomplished winemaking professionals and has constructed and
equipped the Estate Winery into a 12,784 square foot winery that includes a 12,500 square foot outdoor production area for the harvesting,
pressing and fermentation of wine grapes. 

The
Company s marketing and selling strategy is to sell its premium, super premium and ultra-premium cork-finished-wine through a combination
of direct sales at the Company s wineries, tasting room and restaurant locations in Oregon, Washington and California and sales
through independent distributors and wine brokers who market the Company s wine in specific targeted areas. 

To
remain competitive in the premium, super premium and ultra-premium market, the Company has embarked on a brand expansion project including
developing a brand and winery in the Walla Walla AVA under the names Pambrun, Maison Bleue and Metis. This future winery is expected
to produce small vintages of Cabernet Sauvignon and other Bordeaux-varietals, under the Pambrun brand, and Syrah and other Rhone-varietals,
under the Maison Bleue brand, to compete in the ultra-premium wine market. The Company has released wines under the Pambrun label beginning
with the 2015 vintage year and Maison Bleue label beginning with the 2016 vintage. Additionally, the Company has developed a single vineyard
brand near Hopewell, Oregon adjacent to the current site of Elton Vineyards to produce wine under the Elton label. This brand produces
primarily Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, also for sale in the ultra-premium space. The Company has released wines under the Elton label beginning
with the 2015 vintage year. In 2020, the Company opened a microwinery featuring wine tasting and a custom blending experience under the
name Willamette Wineworks, in historic Folsom, California, and began selling wine under the brand name Natoma. In 2022, the Company has
opened a sparkling wine facility and tasting room called Domaine Willamette, at Bernau Estate that features the Company s sparkling
wines, as well as its other reserve wines, and its biodynamic farming practices. 

7 

Vineyards 

The
Company owns and leases approximately 1,018 acres of land, of which 801 acres are currently planted as vineyards or is suitable for future
vineyard planting. The vineyards the Company owns and leases are all certified sustainable by LIVE (Low Input Viticulture and Enology)
and Salmon Safe. At full production, the Company anticipates these vineyards would enable the Company to grow approximately 72 of the
grapes needed to meet the winery s current production capacity, of 654,000 gallons (275,000 cases), at its Estate Winery.

WVV
Estate Established in 1983, the Company s Estate Vineyard (the Estate Vineyard is located at the
Winery location south of Salem, near Turner, Oregon. The Estate Vineyard uses an elaborate trellis design known as the Geneva Double
Curtain. The Company has incurred the additional expense of constructing this trellis because it doubles the number of canes upon
which grape clusters grow and spreads these canes for additional solar exposure and air circulation. Research and practical
applications of this trellis design indicate that it should improve grape quality through smaller clusters and berries over
traditional designs. 

Tualatin
Estate Vineyard Established in 1973 at the Tualatin Winery location near Forest Grove, Oregon, the Company s Tualatin
Estate Vineyards is one of the oldest vineyards in Oregon. It was purchased by the Company in 1997. A series of sale-leaseback transactions
split the property into two additional vineyards, and the Company continues to lease and manage the Peter Michael Vineyard and Meadowview
Vineyard, located adjacent to the Tualatin Vineyard. 

Ingram
Estate and Elton Vineyard In 2008, the Company purchased 86 acres near Hopewell, Oregon, for vineyard plantings. Adjacent
to the purchased land is an additional 110 leased acres, also for vineyard development. The Company believes the site is ideally situated
to grow premium Pinot Noir. The Ingram site is also adjacent to Elton Vineyards, where the Company leases 54 acres of established vineyards. 

Pambrun
Vineyards In 2015, the Company purchased 42 acres in the Walla Walla AVA near the town of Milton-Freewater, Oregon. Additionally,
the Company purchased an additional 45 adjoining acres in 2017. The Company believes this site is ideal to grow Cabernet Sauvignon and
other Bordeaux-varietals. Wines produced from this vineyard are sold under the Pambrun label. 

8 

Loeza
Vineyard The Company purchased 62 acres near Gaston, Oregon in 2014, for vineyard plantings, and believes the site is ideally
situated to grow premium Pinot Gris and Pinot Noir. The site is close to Tualatin Vineyards which allows the Company to leverage existing
crews for vineyard development and operations. 

Louisa
Vineyard The Company purchased 53 acres in the Ribbon Ridge sub-AVA in 2016 for vineyard plantings and believes the site
is suitable for growing ultra-premium Pinot Noir. 

Maison
Bleue Vineyard The Company purchased approximately 37 acres in the new Rocks District of Milton-Freewater appellation near
Milton-Freewater, Oregon in 2016. Grapes from this vineyard go to the Maison Bleue label. 

Bernau
Estate The Company purchased approximately 17 acres in Dundee, Oregon in January 2017 comprised of 13 acres of producing
Pinot Noir. Additionally, the Company added 3 acres through a lot line adjustment to add to the parcel. The Company leases 17 adjoining
acres. 

Dayton
Vineyard The Company purchased 40 acres in Dayton, Oregon in December 2016. The Company intends to plant vineyards and construct
a new winery at this location. 

Lafayette
Vineyard The Company purchased 36 acres in January 2018. 

Jory
Claim Vineyard The Company purchased 69 acres south of Salem, Oregon in 2019. 

Grape
Vines Beginning in 1997, the Company embarked on a major effort to improve the quality of its flagship varietal by planting new
Pinot Noir clones that originated directly from the cool climate growing region of Burgundy rather than the previous source, Napa, California,
where winemakers believe the variety adapted to the warmer climate over the many years it was grown there. 

These
new French clones are called Dijon clones after the University of Dijon in Burgundy, which assisted in their selection and
shipment to a U.S. government authorized quarantine site, and then two years later to Oregon winegrowers. The most desirable of these
new Pinot Noir clones are numbered 113, 114, 115, 667, 777 and 943. In addition to certain flavor advantages, these clones ripen up to
two weeks earlier, allowing growers to pick before heavy autumn rains. Heavy rains can dilute concentrated fruit flavors and promote
bunch rot and spoilage. These Pinot Noir clones were planted at the Tualatin Vineyards with phylloxera-resistant rootstock and the 667
and 777 clones have been grafted onto seven acres of self-rooted, non-phylloxera-resistant vines at the Company s Estate Vineyard. 

In
2022, crop yields were above the 7-year average and the Company s producing acres in the Estate Vineyard and Tualatin Estate yielded
approximately 206 tons and 279 tons of grapes, respectively. 

The
Company fulfills its remaining grape needs by purchasing grapes from other nearby vineyards at competitive prices. In 2022, the Company
purchased an additional 1,307 tons of grapes from other growers. The Company cannot grow enough grapes to meet anticipated production
needs, and therefore contracts grape purchases to make up the difference. Contracted grape purchases are considered an important component
of the Company s long-term growth and risk-management plan. The Company believes high quality grapes will be available for purchase
in sufficient quantity to meet the Company s requirements. Additionally, the Company will continue to evaluate opportunities to
plant more acres and purchase properties for future vineyards. 

Management
believes that the grapes grown on the Company s vineyards establish a foundation of quality through the Company s farming practices,
upon which the quality of the Company s wines is built. Wine produced from grapes grown in the Company s own vineyards may
be labeled as Estate Bottled wines. These wines traditionally sell at a premium over non-estate bottled wines. 

9 

Viticultural
conditions Oregon s Willamette Valley is recognized as a premier location for growing certain varieties of high-quality
wine grapes, particularly Pinot Noir, Pinot Gris, Chardonnay and Riesling. The Company believes that the Estate Vineyard s growing
conditions, including its soil, elevation, slope, rainfall, evening marine breezes and solar orientation are among the most ideal conditions
in the United States for growing certain varieties of high-quality wine grapes. The Estate Vineyard s grape growing conditions compare
favorably to those found in some of the famous Viticultural regions of France. Western Oregon s latitude (42 o 46 o
 North) and relationship to the eastern edge of a major ocean is very similar to certain centuries-old wine grape growing regions
of France. 

In
the Willamette Valley, permanent vineyard irrigation generally is not required. The average annual rainfall provides sufficient moisture
to avoid the need to irrigate. However, if the need should arise, the Company s Estate property contains one water well which can
sustain sufficient volume to meet the needs of the Winery and to provide auxiliary water to the WVV Estate Vineyard for new plantings
and unusual drought conditions. At the Tualatin Vineyard, the Company has water rights to a year-round spring that feeds an irrigation
pond. The Company also has water rights at the Pambrun Vineyard and Maison Bleue Vineyards. 

Susceptibility
of vineyards to disease The Tualatin Estate Vineyard and the adjacent leased vineyards are known to be infested with phylloxera,
an aphid-like insect, which can destroy vines. 

It
is not possible to estimate any range of loss that may be incurred due to the phylloxera infestation of the Company s vineyards.
The phylloxera at Tualatin Vineyard is believed to have been introduced on the roots of the vines first planted on the property in the
southern most section Gewurztraminer in 1971 that the Company partially removed in 2004. The remaining vines, and all others infested,
remain productive at low crop levels. The Company is in the process of gradually replacing infested areas with new, phylloxera-resistant
vines. 

Winery 

Wine
production facility The Company s Estate Winery and production facilities are capable of efficiently producing up to
275,000 cases (654,000 gallons) of wine per year, depending on the type of wine produced. In 2022, the Winery produced approximately
186,792 cases (444,107 gallons) primarily from its 2020 and 2021 harvest. 

The
Winery is 12,784 square feet in size and contains areas for processing, fermenting, aging and bottling wine, as well as an underground
wine cellar, and administrative offices. There is a 12,500 square foot outside production area for harvesting, pressing and fermenting
wine grapes The Company also has a 23,000 square foot storage building to store its inventory of bottled product with a capacity of approximately
135,000 cases of wine. The production area is equipped with a settling tank and sprinkler system for disposing of wastewater from the
production process in compliance with environmental regulations. 

In
addition to the production capacity discussed above, the Tualatin Winery has 20,000 square feet of production capacity. This adds approximately
28,000 cases (66,000 gallons) of wine production capacity to the Company. The capacity at the Tualatin Winery is available to the Company
to meet any anticipated future production needs. The Company also stores and ages product at the Domaine Willamette Winery location in
Dundee, Oregon. 

Mortgages
on properties The Company s winery facilities at the Estate Winery are subject to two mortgages with an aggregate principal
balance of 5,062,654 at December 31, 2022. The two outstanding loans require monthly principal and interest payments of 62,067 for
the life of the loans, at annual fixed interest rates of 4.75 and 5.21 , and with maturity dates of 2028 and 2032. 

Wine
production The Company operates on the principle that winemaking is a natural but highly technical process requiring the
attention and dedication of the winemaking staff. The Company s Winery is equipped with current technical innovations and uses modern
laboratory equipment and computers to monitor the progress of each wine through all stages of the winemaking process.

Cases
produced per ton harvested often vary between years mainly due to the timing of when the cases are produced. 

Sales
and Distribution 

Marketing
strategy The Company markets and sells its wines through a combination of direct sales at the retail locations, directly
through mailing lists, and through distributors and wine brokers. As the Company has increased production volumes and achieved greater
brand recognition, sales to out of state markets have increased, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of total Company
sales. 

The
Company uses a variety of marketing channels to generate interest in its wines. The Company has a highly functional website and maintains
social media sites. The Company controls a database of customers for email and direct promotions. The Company continues to submit its
wines to competitions and state, regional and national media for editorials and ratings. 

Direct
sales The Estate Winery is located on a visible hill adjacent to Oregon s major north-south freeway (Interstate 5),
approximately 2 miles south of the state s second-largest metropolitan area (Salem), and 50 miles in either direction from the state s
first and third-largest metropolitan areas (Portland and Eugene). We believe the unique location along Interstate 5 has resulted in a greater amount of wines sold at the Estate Winery as compared to the Oregon industry standard. Direct sales from the Winery
are a vital sales channel and an effective means of product promotion. The Estate Winery s Tasting Room is open daily and offers
wine tasting and education by trained personnel. The Company offers by-appointment private tours offering a behind-the-scenes look at
the production process of the wines. The Company has one of the largest wine club memberships in Oregon. 

In
September 2022, the Company opened a new sparkling winery, Domaine Willamette, located adjacent to Highway 99 in Dundee, Oregon (the
 Domaine Willamette Winery, approximately 30 miles southwest of the state s largest metropolitan area (Portland) and 25 miles
northwest of the state s second-largest metropolitan area (Salem). We believe the location of the Domaine Willamette Winery along
Highway 99 in Dundee provides an ideal location for direct wine sales and wine tourism. Domaine Willamette Winery s Tasting Room
is open daily for wine tasting, restaurant service and education by trained personnel. It features m thode traditionelle sparkling
wines and a wine club. The Company offers by-appointment private tours giving a behind-the-scenes look at sparkling wine production.
Domaine Willamette Winery s biodynamic garden is another attraction for visitors. 

11 

In
2014, the Company launched daily food pairings to accompany its wines. Led by the Winery Chef, the menu highlights Pacific Northwest
inspired dishes paired with the Company s wines. The culinary offering has now expanded to include Pairings Wine Dinners, 
community-style wine dinners hosted regularly throughout each month. In 2019, the Company added a new experience offered throughout the
week called Pairings Exploration that features four wines paired with four small bites to educate guests on food and wine pairing. In
December 2021, the Company debuted a Pinot Noir Clonal Blending experience giving guests the ability to be a winemaker for a day by crafting
their own custom blends from barrel. 

The
Winery has developed a Winery Ambassador program, which connects its Ambassadors with customers throughout the United States
and offers personalized wine recommendations and easy ordering by phone or email. The Company sells its wine through its own e-commerce
website and direct ships where permissible. 

The
Company also operates seven additional tasting rooms at the following locations: (i) historic downtown McMinnville, Oregon; (ii) at its
Tualatin Vineyard, Oregon; (iii) Lake Oswego, Oregon; (iv) Happy Valley, Oregon; (v) downtown Walla Walla, Washington; (vi) Vancouver,
Washington and (vii) Folsom, California. 

The
Company holds various festivals and events at its locations throughout the year. Numerous private events, charitable and political events
are also held at Company locations. 

Direct
sales produce a higher profit margin because the Company can sell its wine directly to consumers at retail prices rather than to distributors
at free-on-board or FOB prices. Sales made directly to consumers at retail prices result in an increased profit margin equal
to the difference between retail prices and distributor prices. For 2022 and 2021, direct sales contributed approximately 46.4 and 41.8 
of the Company s net sales, respectively. 

Distributors
and wine brokers The Company uses both independent distributors and wine brokers primarily to market the Company s wines
in specific targeted areas. Only those distributors and wine brokers who have demonstrated knowledge of and a proven ability to market
premium, super premium, and ultra-premium wines are utilized. The Company s products are distributed in 49 states and the District
of Columbia, and there are 3 non-domestic (export) customers. For 2022 and 2021, sales to distributors and wine brokers contributed approximately
53.6 and 58.2 of the Company s revenue from operations, respectively. 

Tourists
 Oregon wineries are a popular tourist destination with many bed breakfasts, motels and fine dining restaurants available.
The Willamette Valley, Oregon s leading wine region has approximately 74 of the state s wineries and vineyards, is home to
approximately 781 wineries and was selected by Wine Enthusiast Magazine as its 2016 Wine Region of the Year. An additional advantage
for Willamette Valley wine tourism is the proximity of the wineries to Portland (Oregon s largest city and most popular destination).
From Portland, tourists can visit the Willamette Valley winery of their choice in anywhere from a 45 minute to a two-hour drive. 

The
Company believes the location of the Estate Winery next to Interstate 5, and Domaine Willamette Winery next to Highway 99W, significantly
increases direct sales opportunities to consumers. The Company believes these locations provide high visibility for the Company to passing
motorists, thus enhancing recognition of the Company s products in retail outlets and restaurants. These wineries are also each
approximately a 45-minute drive from Portland. 

Dependence
on Major Customers 

Historically,
the Company s revenue has been derived from thousands of customers annually. In 2022, sales to one distributor represented approximately
17.5 of total Company revenue. In 2021, sales to one distributor represented approximately 18.1 of total Company revenue. 

12 

Competition 

The
wine industry is highly competitive. In a broad sense, wines may be considered to compete with all alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages.
Within the wine industry, the Company believes that its principal competitors include wineries in Oregon, California, and Washington,
which, like the Company, produce premium, super premium, and ultra-premium wines. Wine production in the United States is dominated by
large California wineries that have significantly greater financial, production, distribution, and marketing resources than the Company.
Currently, no Oregon winery dominates the Oregon wine market. Several Oregon wineries, however, are older and better established and
have greater label recognition than that of the Company. 

The
Company believes that the principal competitive factors in the premium, super premium, and ultra-premium segment of the wine industry
are product quality, price, label recognition, and product supply. The Company believes it competes favorably with respect to each of
these factors. The Company has primarily received Excellent to Recommended reviews in tastings of its wines and
believes its prices are competitive with other Oregon wineries. Larger scale production is necessary to satisfy retailers and restaurants 
demand and the Company believes that additional production capacity will be needed to meet estimated future demand. Furthermore, the
Company believes that its estimated aggregate production capacity of 720,000 gallons (303,000 cases) per year at its Estate and Tualatin
locations give it significant competitive advantages over most Oregon wineries in areas such as marketing, distribution arrangements,
grape purchasing, and access to financing. The current production level of most Oregon wineries is generally much smaller than the estimated
production capacity level of the Company s Wineries. With respect to label recognition, the Company believes that its unique structure
as a publicly owned company will give it a significant advantage in gaining market share in Oregon, as well as penetrating other wine
markets. 

Governmental
Regulation of the Wine Industry 

The
production and sale of wine is subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade
Bureau and the Oregon Liquor Control Commission. The Company is licensed by and meets the bonding requirements of each of these governmental
agencies. Sale of the Company s wine is subject to federal alcohol tax, payable at the time wine is removed from the bonded area
of a winery for shipment to customers or for sale in its tasting room. 

In
December 2017, the federal government passed comprehensive tax legislation which included the Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform
Act. This legislation modified federal alcohol tax rates by expanding the lower 1.07 per gallon tax rate to wines up to 16.0 alcohol
content with wines containing higher alcohol levels being taxed at 1.57 per gallon. Additionally, the legislation provides for a 1
credit per gallon for the first 30,000 gallons produced; 0.90 for the next 100,000 gallons; and then 0.535 for up to 750,000 gallons.
These modifications were effective January 2020 and have since been made permanent. 

The
Company also pays the state of Oregon an excise tax of 0.67 per gallon for wines with alcohol content at or below 14.0 and 0.77 per
gallon for wines with alcohol content above 14.0 on all wine sold in Oregon. In addition, most states in which the Company s wines
are sold impose varying excise taxes on the sale of alcoholic beverages. As an agricultural processor, the Company is also regulated
by the Oregon Department of Agriculture and, as a producer of wastewater, by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality. The Company
has secured all necessary permits to operate its business. 

Prompted
by growing government budget shortfalls and public reaction against alcohol abuse, government entities often consider legislation that
could potentially affect the taxation of alcoholic beverages. Excise tax rates being considered are often substantial. The ultimate effects
of such legislation, if passed, cannot be assessed accurately. Any increase in the taxes imposed on table wines can be expected to have
a potentially adverse impact on overall sales of such products. However, the impact may not be proportionate to that experienced by producers
of other alcoholic beverages and may not be the same in every state. 

Costs
and Effects of Compliance with Local, State and Federal Environmental Laws 

The
Company management is strongly focused on environmental stewardship and maintains a variety of policies and processes designed to protect
the environment, the public and consumers of its wine. Although much of the Company s expenses for protecting the environment are
voluntary, the Company is regulated by various local, state and federal agencies regarding environmental laws. However, these regulatory
costs and processes are effectively integrated into the Company s regular operations and consequently do not generally cause significant
alternative processes or costs. 

13 

Employees 

As
of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately 169 full-time employees and 193 part-time, or on call employees. In addition, the
Company hires additional employees for seasonal work as required. The Company s employees are not represented by any collective
bargaining unit. The Company believes it maintains positive relations with its employees.

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

The
following disclosures should be read in conjunction with Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These disclosures are intended to discuss certain material risks of the Company s
business as they appear to Management at this time. However, this list is not exhaustive. Other risks may, and likely will, arise from
time to time. 

Agricultural
risks could adversely affect the Company 

Winemaking
and grape growing are subject to a variety of agricultural risks. Various diseases, pests, fungi, viruses, including Grapevine Red Blotch
Disease (GRBV), drought, frost and certain other weather conditions can affect the quantity of grapes available to the Company, decreasing
the supply of the Company s products and negatively impacting profitability. In particular, certain of the Company s vines
are not resistant to phylloxera; accordingly, those vines are particularly at risk to the effects from an infestation of phylloxera.
Phylloxera is a pest that attacks the rootstocks of wine grape plants. Vineyards in the United States, including some in Oregon and some
owned by us, have been infested with phylloxera. In particular, Tualatin Estate Vineyards have phylloxera. There can be no assurance
that the Company s existing vineyards, or the rootstocks the Company is now using in its planting programs, will not become susceptible
to current or new strains of phylloxera or that the phylloxera present at the Tualatin Vineyards will not spread to our other vineyards.
Pierce s Disease is a vine bacterial disease. It kills grapevines and there is no known cure. Small insects called Sharpshooters
spread this disease. A new strain of the Sharpshooter was discovered in Southern California and is believed to be migrating north. The
Company is actively supporting the efforts of the agricultural industry to control this pest and is making every reasonable effort to
prevent an infestation in its own vineyards. The Company cannot, however, guarantee that it will succeed in preventing contamination
in its vineyards. Additionally, any future government restrictions created in connection with government attempts to combat phylloxera,
GRBV or other pests or viruses may increase vineyard costs and/or reduce production. 

Our
operations are susceptible to changing weather patterns and other environmental factors 

Over
the past several years, changing weather patterns and climatic conditions have added to the unpredictability and frequency of natural
disasters, such as hail storms, wildfires and wind, snow and ice storms. Any such extreme weather condition could negatively impact the
harvest of grapes at our vineyards and/or the other vineyards that supply us with grapes for our wine. In particular, Oregon s Willamette
Valley has an unpredictable rainfall pattern particularly in early autumn. If significantly above-average rains occur just prior to the
autumn grape harvest, the quality of harvested grapes is often materially diminished, thereby affecting that year s wine quality. 

14 

Additionally,
long-term changes in weather patterns could adversely affect the Company, especially if such changes impacted the amount or quality of
grapes harvested. We cannot anticipate changes in weather patterns/conditions, and we cannot predict their impact on our operations if
they were to occur. 

As
weather patterns evolve, the Company s vineyards, and contracted vineyards, have become susceptible to potential smoke damage as
a result of wildfires within the region. In extreme events, smoke can produce effects on grapes that make them unusable in the production
of wine. The Company cannot predict smoke events, or their potential impact were they to occur. 

We
may not be able to economically insure certain risks 

The
Company maintains insurance policies to cover certain risks. However not all risks can be insured, or insured economically, and there
may be gaps in coverage that could expose the Company to liability should an event occur. Additionally, we cannot be certain that coverage
levels are adequate or that all of our insurers will be financially viable if we make a claim. 

Loss
of key employees could harm the Company s reputation and business 

The
Company s success depends to some degree upon the continued service of a number of key employees. The loss of the services of one
or more of these key employees, including James W. Bernau, our President and Chief Executive Officer, John Ferry, our Chief Financial
Officer and Joe Padilla, our Chief Operating Officer could harm the Company and its reputation and negatively impact its profitability,
particularly if one or more of the Company s key employees resigns to join a competitor or to form a competing company. 

The
Company s ability to operate requires adequate funding 

The
Company s cash flow from operations historically has not been sufficient to provide all funds necessary for the Company s operations.
The Company has entered into a line of credit agreement to provide such funds and entered into term loan arrangements. There is no assurance
that the Company will be able to comply with all conditions under its credit facilities in the future or that the amount available under
its line of credit facility or capital raises will be adequate for the Company s future needs. Failure to comply with all conditions
of the credit facilities, or to have sufficient funds for operations could adversely affect the Company s results of operations
and shareholder value. 

As
of December 31, 2022, the Company s outstanding long-term debt was approximately 7.1 million and 0.2 million under its short term
line of credit. Additionally, the Company had notes payable to private parties of approximately 1.2 million as of December 31, 2022. 

Costs
of being a publicly-held company may put the Company at a competitive disadvantage 

As
a public company, the Company incurs substantial costs that are not incurred by its competitors that are privately-held. These compliance
costs may result in the Company s wines being more expensive than those produced by its competitors and/or may reduce profitability
compared to such competitors. 

The
Company faces significant competition which could adversely affect profitability 

The
wine industry is intensely competitive and highly fragmented. The Company s wines compete in several premium wine market segments
with many other premium domestic and foreign wines, with imported wines coming from the Burgundy and Bordeaux regions of France, as well
as Italy, Chile, Argentina, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia. The Company s wines also compete with popular priced generic
wines and with other alcoholic and, to a lesser degree, non-alcoholic beverages, for shelf space in retail stores and for marketing focus
by the Company s independent distributors, many of which carry extensive brand portfolios. A result of this intense competition
has been and may continue to be upward pressure on the Company s selling and promotional expenses. In addition, the wine industry
has experienced significant consolidation. Many of the Company s competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing, and public
relations resources than the Company does. In particular, wine production in the United States is dominated by large California wineries
that have significantly greater resources than the Company. Additionally, greater worldwide label recognition and larger production levels
give many of the Company s competitors certain unit cost advantages. Company sales may be harmed to the extent it is not able to
compete successfully against such wine or alternative beverage producers costs. There can be no assurance that in the future the
Company will be able to successfully compete with its current competitors or that it will not face greater competition from other wineries
and beverage manufacturers.

The
Willamette Valley American Viticultural Area AVA value may be eroded by out of state competition who use it inappropriately
or as fanciful marketing 

Wine
grape growing regions in the United States are divided into American Viticultural Areas (AVAs) by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade
Bureau TTB ), of the United States Department of the Treasury, based on distinguishable geographic features. The Oregon wine
industry has historically embraced higher standards for wine production than those established by the federal government and other states.
As a result, wines from Oregon AVA s, and specifically the Willamette Valley AVA, have achieved recognition for their quality against
other wines in their class. As a result, these wines are often sold at a higher price point than wines not produced in Oregon. Because
of this recognition, out of state competitors have used Oregon AVAs on bottles and packaging claiming its use as fanciful marketing.
Such use, inappropriate or otherwise, could have a dilutive effect on the prestige of Oregon AVAs and ultimately the prices that can
be charged for wines from Oregon AVAs as a result of reduced competitor quality and/or pricing. 

The
Company competes for shelf space in retail stores and for marketing focus by its independent distributors, most of whom carry extensive
product portfolios 

Nationwide,
the Company sells its products primarily through independent distributors and brokers for resale to retail outlets, restaurants, hotels,
and private clubs across the United States and in some overseas markets. Sales to distributors are expected to continue to represent
a substantial portion of the Company s net revenue in the future. A change in the relationship with any of the Company s significant
distributors could harm the Company s business and reduce Company sales. The laws and regulations of several states prohibit changes
of distributors, except under certain limited circumstances, making it difficult to terminate a distributor for poor performance without
reasonable cause, as defined by applicable statutes. Any difficulty or inability to replace distributors, poor performance of the Company s
major distributors or the Company s inability to collect accounts receivable from its major distributors could harm the Company s
business. There can be no assurance that the distributors and retailers the Company uses will continue to purchase the Company s
products or provide Company products with adequate levels of promotional support. Consolidation at the retail tier, among club and chain
grocery stores in particular, can be expected to heighten competitive pressure to increase marketing and sales spending or constrain
or reduce prices. 

Loss
of the Willamette Valley Vineyards and Willamette trademarks could adversely affect the Company s distinction
within the AVA 

The
Company has long held the federal trademarks Willamette Valley Vineyards and Willamette as used in its wine brands.
While it is lawful for wine producers meeting the federal and state requirements to list the American Viticultural Area Willamette
Valley source of their wine grapes and wine on their labels, packaging and advertising materials, the Company has enforced its
trademarks on any unauthorized use as a wine brand. 

Fluctuations
in quantity and quality of grape supply could adversely affect the Company 

A
shortage in the supply of quality grapes may result from a variety of factors that determine the quality and quantity of the Company s
grape supply, including weather conditions, pruning methods, diseases and pests, the ability to buy grapes on long and short term contracts
and the number of vines producing grapes. Any shortage in the Company s grape production could cause a reduction in the amount of
wine the Company is able to produce, which could reduce sales and adversely impact the Company s results from operations. Factors
that reduce the quantity of the Company s grapes may also reduce their quality, which in turn could reduce the quality or amount
of wine the Company produces. Deterioration in the quality of the Company s wines could harm its brand name and could reduce sales
and adversely impact the Company s results of operations. 

16 

Contamination
of the Company s wines would harm the Company s business 

The
Company is subject to certain hazards and product liability risks, such as potential contamination, through tampering or otherwise, of
ingredients or products. Contamination of any of the Company s wines could cause it to destroy its wine held in inventory and could
cause the need for a product recall, which could significantly damage the Company s reputation for product quality. The Company
maintains insurance against certain of these kinds of risks, and others, under various insurance policies. However, the insurance may
not be adequate or may not continue to be available at a price or on terms that are satisfactory to the Company and this insurance may
not be adequate to cover any resulting liability. 

A
reduction in consumer demand for premium wines could harm the Company s business 

There
have been periods in the past in which there were substantial declines in the overall per capita consumption of beverage alcohol products
in the United States and other markets in which the Company participates. A limited or general decline in consumption in one or more
of the Company s product categories could occur in the future due to a variety of factors, including: a general decline in economic
conditions; increased concern about the health consequences of consuming alcoholic beverage products and about drinking and driving;
a trend toward a healthier diet including lighter, lower calorie beverages such as diet soft drinks, juices and water products; the increased
activity of anti-alcohol consumer groups; and increased federal, state or foreign excise and other taxes on beverage alcohol products.
The competitive position of the Company s products could also be affected adversely by any failure to achieve consistent, reliable
quality in the product or service levels to customers. 

Changes
in consumer spending could have a negative impact on the Company s financial condition and business results 

Wine
sales depend upon a number of factors related to the level of consumer spending, including the general state of the economy, federal
and state income tax rates, deductibility of business entertainment expenses under federal and state tax laws, and consumer confidence
in future economic conditions. Changes in consumer spending in these and other regions can affect both the quantity and the price of
wines that customers are willing to purchase at restaurants or through retail outlets. Reduced consumer confidence and spending may result
in reduced demand for the Company s products, limitations on the Company s ability to increase prices and increased levels
of selling and promotional expenses. This, in turn, may have a considerable negative impact upon the Company s sales and profit
margins. 

Increased
regulation and/or taxation could adversely affect the Company 

The
wine industry is subject to extensive regulation by the Federal Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau TTB and various
foreign agencies, state liquor authorities, such as the Oregon Liquor Control Commission OLCC ), and local authorities. These
regulations and laws dictate such matters as licensing requirements, trade, and pricing practices, permitted distribution channels, permitted
and required labeling, and advertising and relations with wholesalers and retailers. Any expansion of the Company s existing facilities
or development of new vineyards or wineries may be limited by present and future zoning ordinances, environmental restrictions, and other
legal requirements. In addition, new regulations or requirements or increases in excise taxes, income taxes, property and sales taxes
or international tariffs, could negatively affect the Company s financial condition or results of operations. Recently, many states
have considered proposals to increase, and some of these states have increased, state alcohol excise taxes. Additionally, many states
have revised, or are revising, statutes that broaden the definition of nexus to increase tax revenue from out of state businesses. 

New
or revised regulations, or increased licensing fees, requirements or taxes could have a material adverse effect on the Company s
financial condition or results of operations. There can be no assurance that new or revised regulations, taxes or increased licensing
fees and requirements will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s business and its results of operations and its cash
flows. 

The
Company s common stock is thinly traded, and therefore not as liquid as other investments. 

The
trading volume of the Company s common stock on NASDAQ is consistently thin, in that there is not a great deal of trading
activity on a daily basis. Because the average active trading volume is thin, there is less opportunity for shareholders to sell their
shares of the Company s common stock on the open market, resulting in the common stock being less liquid than common stock in other
publicly traded companies. 

17 

The
Company may face liabilities associated with the offer and sale of our preferred stock. 

In
August 2015, the Company commenced a public offering of our Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock pursuant to a registration statement
filed with the SEC. The Company registered this transaction with the securities authorities of the States of Oregon and Washington and,
in November 2015, achieved listing status on NASDAQ under the trading symbol WVVIP. The terms of our Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock
are unusual for a company of our size, and we believe the structure of these securities and of the offering are not commonplace among
issuers of any type. Federal and state securities laws impose significant liabilities on issuers of securities if the related offering
documents contain material misstatements of fact, or if the documents omit to state facts necessary, in light of the circumstances as
a whole, to prevent the documents from being misleading. These liabilities can include rescission liability to the purchasers of the
securities, as well as potential enforcement liability that could give rise to civil money penalties. Securities litigation can be extraordinarily
expensive and protracted, and if we are accused of misstatements or omissions in our offering documents, we may face economic harms and
management distractions regardless of the ultimate outcome of any such litigation. Further, if we ultimately are adjudged to have actually
made a material misstatement or omission, the Company may be liable for the repayment of the purchase price of the related securities,
plus interest from the date of purchase. Any one or more of these events or circumstances would have a material adverse impact upon our
business, financial condition or results of operations, and may make it more difficult or more expensive to undertake capital-raising
efforts in the future. 

The
Company may be unable to pay accumulated dividends on its Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock. 

The
Company s Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock bears a cumulative 5.3 dividend based upon the original issue price, or 0.22 per
share per annum. However, prior to the declaration and payment of dividends our board of directors must determine, among other things,
that funds are available out of the surplus of the Company and that the payment would not render us insolvent or compromise our ability
to pay our obligations as they come due in the ordinary course of business. Additionally, our existing credit facility limits, and future
debt obligations in the future may limit, both our legal and our practical ability to declare and pay dividends. As a result, although
the Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock will continue to earn a right to receive dividends, the Company s ability to pay dividends
will depend, among other things, upon our ability to generate excess cash. However, although shares of our Series A Redeemable Preferred
Stock will earn cumulative dividends, unpaid dividends will not, themselves, accumulate (as might compounding interest on a debt security,
for example). 

As
the Company s sales revenues are dependent in part upon the purchases made by and continued goodwill with its holders of Preferred
Stock, any failure to pay dividends timely could adversely effect the Company s sales. Additionally, as the Company focuses its
issuance of Preferred Stock to wine enthusiasts likely to purchase the Company s wines, any failure by the Management to successfully
target its stock sales could diminish the opportunity to maximize earnings and offset the administrative, regulatory, and legal costs
of this form of capital formation through Preferred Stockholder wine purchases. 

The
issuance of additional shares of our preferred stock or common stock in the future could adversely affect holders of common stock. 

The
market price of our common stock may be influenced by any preferred stock we may issue. Our board of directors is authorized to issue
additional classes or series of preferred stock without any action on the part of our stockholders. This includes the power to set the
terms of any such classes or series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights and preferences over
common stock with respect to the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the business and other terms. If we issue preferred stock
in the future that has preference over our common stock with respect to liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred
stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of holders of the common stock or the market price
of the common stock could be adversely affected.

Failures
or security breaches of our information technology systems could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business. 

We
use information technologies to manage our operations and various business functions. We rely on various technologies to process, store
and report on our business and to communicate electronically between our facilities, personnel, customers, and suppliers as well as for
administrative functions and many of such technology systems are independent on one another for their functionality. We also use information
technologies to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory,
legal and tax requirements. We rely on third party providers for some of these information technologies and support. Our ability to effectively
manage our business and coordinate the production, distribution and sale of our products is highly dependent on our technology systems.
Despite our security design and controls and other operational safeguards, and those of our third party providers, our information technology
systems may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions, including during the process of upgrading or replacing hardware, software, databases
or components thereof, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, hackers, unauthorized
access attempts and other security issues or may be breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such interruption
or breach could result in operational disruptions or the misappropriation of sensitive data that could subject us to civil and criminal
penalties, litigation or have a negative impact on our reputation. There can be no assurance that such disruptions or misappropriations
and the resulting repercussions will not negatively impact our cash flows and materially affect our results of operations or financial
condition. 

In
addition, many of our information technology systems, such as those we use for administrative functions, including human resources, payroll,
accounting, and internal and external communications, as well as the information technology systems of our third-party business partners
and service providers, whether cloud-based or hosted in proprietary servers, contain personal, financial or other information that is
entrusted to us by our customers and personnel. Many of our information technology systems also contain proprietary and other confidential
information related to our business, such as business plans and research and development initiatives. To the extent we or a third party
were to experience a material breach of our or such third party s information technology systems that result in the unauthorized
access, theft, use, destruction or other compromises of our customers or personnel s data or confidential information stored
in such systems, including through cyber-attacks or other external or internal methods could result in a violation of applicable privacy
and other laws, and subject us to litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure
to material liability. 

The
provisions in our articles of incorporation, our by-laws and Oregon law could delay or deter tender offers or takeover attempts that
may offer a premium for our common stock. 

Certain
provisions in our articles of incorporation, our by-laws and Oregon law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control
of us, even if that transaction could be beneficial to stockholders. These impediments include, but are not limited to; the classification
of our Board of Directors (the Board into three classes serving staggered three-year terms, which makes it more difficult
to quickly replace Board members; the ability of our Board, subject to certain limitations under the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market,
to issue shares of preferred stock with rights as it deems appropriate without stockholder approval; a provision that special meetings
of our Board may be called only by our chief executive officer or at the request of holders of not less than half of all outstanding
shares of our common stock; a provision that any member of the Board, or the entire Board, may be removed from office only for cause;
and a provision that our stockholders comply with advance-notice provisions to bring director nominations or other matters before meetings
of our stockholders. The Board may implement other changes that further limit the potential for tender offers or takeover attempts.

Wine
production facility We believe the Company s Estate Winery and production facilities are capable of efficiently producing
up to 275,000 cases (654,000 gallons) of wine per year, depending on the type of wine produced. In 2022, the Winery produced approximately
186,792 cases (444,107 gallons) from its 2020 and 2021 harvest. The Winery is 12,784 square feet in size and contains areas for processing,
fermenting, aging, and bottling wine, as well as an underground wine cellar, meeting rooms, and administrative offices. There is a 12,500
square foot outside production area for harvesting, pressing and fermenting wine grapes. The Company also has a 23,000 square foot storage
building to store its inventory of bottled product. The production area is equipped with a settling tank and sprinkler system for disposing
of wastewater from the production process in compliance with environmental regulations. The Company s hospitality Center located
as the Company s Estate Winery (the Hospitality Center is a large 35,642 square foot tasting and hospitality facility.
 The Hospitality Center sits above the underground barrel cellar and tunnel that connects with the

The
following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with
the Company s financial statements and related notes. Some statements and information contained in this Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are not historical facts but are forward-looking statements. For a discussion
of these forward-looking statements, and of important factors that could cause results to differ materially from the forward-looking
statements contained in this report, see Item 1 of Part I, Business Forward-Looking Statements. 

While
our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 1 to our financial statements, we believe the following accounting
policies are those most critical to the judgements and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses Willamette Valley Vineyards financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. As such, management is required to make certain
estimates, judgments and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable based upon the information available. On an on-going basis, management
evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to product returns, bad debts, inventories, leases, investments, income
taxes, financing operations, and contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience
and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

Revenue
 The Company s principal sources of revenue are derived from direct sales and sales through distributors of wine. Distributor
sales are recognized from wine sales at the time of shipment and passage of title. The Company s payment arrangements with wholesalers
provide primarily 30-day terms and, to a limited extent, 45-day, 60-day, or longer terms for some international wholesalers. Direct sales
through the Company s tasting rooms are recognized at the point of sales. Sales through the internet and wine club sales are recognized
when the product has shipped to the customer. 

The
Company pays depletion allowances to the Company s distributors based on their sales to their customers. The Company sets these
allowances on a monthly basis and the Company s distributors bill them back on a monthly basis. All depletion expenses associated
with a given month are recognized in that month as a reduction of revenues. The Company also reimburses for samples used by distributors
up to 1.5 of product sold to the distributors. Sample expenses are recognized at the time the Company is billed by the distributor as
a selling, general and administrative expense. 

21 

Amounts
paid by customers to the Company for shipping and handling expenses are included in the net revenue. Expenses incurred for outbound shipping
and handling charges are included in selling, general and administrative expense. 

Inventory
 The Company values inventories at the lower of actual cost to produce the inventory or net realizable value. The Company regularly
reviews inventory quantities on hand and adjusts its production requirements for the next twelve months based on estimated forecasts
of product demand. A significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand.
In the future, if the Company s inventory cost is determined to be greater than the net realizable value of the inventory upon sale,
the Company would be required to recognize such excess costs in its cost of goods sold at the time of such determination. Therefore,
although the Company makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of its forecasts of future product demand, any significant unanticipated
changes in demand could have a significant impact on the ultimate selling price and cases sold and, therefore, the carrying value of
the Company s inventory and its reported operating results. 

Additionally,
the Company regularly evaluates inventory for obsolescence and marketability and if it determines that the inventory is obsolete, or
no longer suitable for use or marketable, the cost of that inventory is recognized in cost of sales at the time of such determination. 

Vineyard
Development The Company capitalizes internal vineyard development costs prior to the vineyard land becoming fully productive. These
costs consist primarily of the costs of the vines and expenditures related to labor and materials to prepare the land and construct vine
trellises. Amortization of such costs as annual crop costs is done on a straight-line basis for the estimated economic useful life of
the vineyard, which is estimated to be 30 years. The Company regularly evaluates the recoverability of capitalized costs. Amortization
of vineyard development costs are included in capitalized crop costs that in turn are included in inventory costs and ultimately become
a component of cost of goods sold. 

Income
Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach. This requires the recognition of deferred
tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and the
tax basis of assets and liabilities at the applicable tax rates. The Company evaluates deferred tax assets, and records a valuation allowance
against those assets, if available evidence suggests that some of those assets will not be realized. 

The
effect of uncertain tax positions would be recorded in the financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability
that the uncertain tax positions would withstand an examination by tax authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The
tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized
upon ultimate settlement. As facts and circumstances change, management reassesses these probabilities and would record any changes in
the financial statements as appropriate. 

Overview 

The
Company generates revenue from the sales of wine to wholesalers and direct to consumers. The Company is experiencing increased levels
of competition in traditional wholesale to retail grocery distribution from large California based wineries that are acquiring, producing,
and marketing Oregon branded wines. Direct to consumer sales primarily include sales through the Company s tasting rooms and wine
club. Direct to consumer sales provide a higher gross profit to the Company due to prices received being closer to retail than those
prices paid by wholesalers. The Company continues to emphasize growth in direct to consumer sales through use of the Hospitality Center,
opening new tasting rooms and growth in wine club membership. The Company had 10,001 wine club memberships for the year ended December
31, 2022, a net increase of 1,376 when compared to 2021. Additionally, the Company s preferred stock sales since August 2015 have
resulted in approximately 11,778 preferred stockholders many of which the Company believes are wine enthusiasts. When considering joint
ownership, we believe these new shareholders represent approximately 17,667 potential customers of the Company. The Company also has
approximately 2,115 common shareholders which we believe represent an estimated 3,171 potential customers when considering joint ownership.
Additionally, the Company has made a significant investment in developing alternative wine brands, products, direct sales methods, and
venues. 

22 

Periodically,
the Company will sell grapes or bulk wine, which primarily consists of inventory that does not meet Company standards or is in excess
to production targets. However, this activity is not a significant part of the Company s activities. 

The
Company sold approximately 187,371 and 203,817 cases of produced wine during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively,
a decrease of 16,447 cases, or 8.1 in the current year over the prior year. The decrease in case sales was primarily the result of reduced
shipments to distributors in 2022 when compared to 2021. 

Cost
of Sales includes grape costs, whether purchased or grown at Company vineyards, crush costs, winemaking and processing costs, bottling,
packaging, warehousing, and shipping and handling costs associated with purchased production materials. For grapes grown at Company vineyards,
costs include farming expenditures and amortization of vineyard development costs. 

At
December 31, 2022, wine inventory included 92,779 cases of bottled wine and 688,154 gallons of bulk wine in various stages of the aging
process. Case wine is expected to be sold over the next 12 to 24 months and generally before the release date of the next vintage. The
Winery bottled 186,792 cases during the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Results
of Operations 

2022
compared to 2021 

Net
income (loss) was (646,492) and 2,445,463, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, a decrease of 3,091,955,
or 126.4 , for the year ended December 31, 2022 over the prior year period. The primary reason for this decrease was higher net
sales revenues being more than offset by higher cost of sales and operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to
the previous year. 

Net
income (loss) applicable to common shareholders was (2,512,943) and 1,001,180, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively, a decrease of 3,514,123, or 351.0 , for the year ended December 31, 2022 over the prior year period. This
decrease was primarily driven by lower net income and higher preferred stock dividends. 

The
Company had net sales revenues of 33,934,081 and 31,786,864 for the years December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, an increase of
 2,147,217, or 6.8 , for the year ended December 31, 2022 over the prior year period primarily as a result of an increase in revenue
from direct sales of 2,459,483, or 18.5 in 2022 compared to 2021, which more than offset a decrease in revenue from sales to distributors
of 312,266 or 1.7 in 2022 compared to 2021. 

The
Company has three primary sales channels: direct-to-consumer retail sales, in-state sales to distributors, and out-of-state sales to
distributors. During 2022, revenues from retail sales increased 18.6 , revenues from in-state sales increased 2.8 , and revenues from
out-of-state sales decreased 4.3 , compared to 2021. 

Direct
sales included 97,652 and 103,471 of bulk wine and grape sales in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and represented
approximately 46.4 and 41.8 of the Company s total revenue for 2022 and 2021, respectively, while the Company s remaining
revenues came from sales through distributors.

The
following table sets forth certain information regarding the Company s revenue, excluding excise taxes, from the Winery s operations
for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:

Retail
sales revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 15,786,241 and 13,306,156 respectively, an increase of 2,480,085,
or 18.6 , for the year ended December 31, 2022 over the prior year period. The increase in retail sales revenues in 2022 compared to
2021 was mostly a result of increased revenues from the opening of four new retail locations during 2022. 

Bulk
Wine/miscellaneous sales revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 97,652 and 103,471, respectively, a decrease
of 5,819, or 5.6 , for the year ended December 31, 2022, over the prior year period. 

In-state
sales revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 5,987,410 and 5,824,130, respectively, an increase of 163,280,
or 2.8 , for the year ended December 31, 2022 over the prior year period. 

Out-of-state
sales revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 12,374,881 and 12,937,605, respectively, a decrease of 562,724,
or 4.3 . Management believes this decrease is related to reduced availability of product at the beginning of 2022. 

The
Company pays alcohol excise taxes to both the OLCC and to the TTB. These taxes are based on product sales volumes. The Company is liable
for the taxes upon the removal of product from the Company s warehouse on a per gallon basis. The Company also pays taxes on the
grape harvest on a per ton basis to the OLCC for the Oregon Wine Board. The Company s excise related taxes for the years ended December
31, 2022 and 2021 were 312,103 and 384,498, a decrease of 72,395, for the year ended December 31, 2022 over the prior year period.
This decrease was due primarily to the timing of removals in 2022. 

Cost
of Sales was 15,119,985 and 13,121,191 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, an increase of 1,998,794, or
15.2 , for the year ended December 31, 2022, over the prior year period. This change was primarily the result of an increase in fruit
and packaging costs in 2022 and the mix of vintages sold between the two periods. 

Gross
profit was 18,814,096 and 18,665,673 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, an increase of 148,423, or 0.8 ,
for the year ended December 31, 2022 over the prior year period. This increase was generally driven by an increase in sales revenues
partially offset by a higher cost of sales. 

The
gross margin percentage was 55.4 and 58.7 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, a decrease of 3.3 percentage
points, for the year ended December 31, 2022 over the prior year period. This decrease in the gross profit percentage was primarily the
result of an overall decrease in per case margins mostly due to the release of wines in 2022 from vintages produced with higher product
costs for item such as packaging and vineyard labor. 

24 

Selling,
general and administrative expenses were 19,360,514 and 14,975,654 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively,
an increase of 4,384,860, or 29.3 , for the year ended December 31, 2022 over the prior year period. This increase was
primarily as a result of more sales coming from tasting rooms which have higher selling costs and from costs related to the opening and
development of four new tasting room and restaurant locations. 

Income
(loss) from operations was (546,418) and 3,690,019 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, a decrease
of 4,236,437, or 114.8 , for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year period. The decrease was primary
the result of the 1,821,106 contribution loss related to the opening of four new locations and the higher cost of sales in 2022. 

Interest
income was 5,496 and 12,412 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, a decrease of 6,916. Interest expense was
 367,745 and 391,272 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, a decrease of 23,527, or 6.0 , for the year ended
December 31, 2022 over the prior year period. The decrease in interest expense was mainly due to the decrease in average loan balances
in 2022 compared to the previous year. 

Other
income, net, was 142,529 and 155,183 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, a decrease of 12,654, or 8.2 ,
for the year ended December 31, 2022 over the prior year period. 

Provision
for income tax expense (benefit) was (119,646) and 1,020,879 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, a
decrease of 1,140,525, or 111.7 , for the year ended December 31, 2022 over the prior year period. This decrease in income
tax expense in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily the result of lower income from operations in 2022, and higher tax depreciation deductions
related to the higher capital spend. 

Income
(loss) per common share after preferred dividends was (0.51) and 0.20 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively,
a decrease of 0.71, or 351.0 , for the year ended December 31, 2022 over the prior year period. The primary reason for
this decrease was a decrease in net income in 2022 compared to 2021. 

The
Company had cash balances of 338,676 at December 31, 2022, and 13,747,285 at December 31, 2021. The Company had an outstanding line
of credit balance of 166,617 at December 31, 2022, and zero outstanding balance at December 31, 2021. 

EBITDA 

In
2022, the Company s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization EBITDA decreased 67.0 
to 1,912,012 from 5,797,295 in 2021, primarily as a result of a decrease in net income. 

EBITDA
does not reflect the impact of a number of items that affect our net income (loss), including financing costs. EBITDA is not a measure
of financial performance under the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, referred to as GAAP ,
and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or income (loss) from operations as a measure of performance, nor
as an alternative to net cash from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We use EBITDA as a benchmark measurement of our own
operating results and as a benchmark relative to our competitors. We consider it to be a meaningful supplement to operating income (loss)
as a performance measure primarily because depreciation and amortization expense are not actual cash costs, and depreciation expense
varies widely from company to company in a manner that we consider largely independent of the underlying cost efficiency of our operating
facilities. 

EBITDA
has significant limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our
GAAP results as reported. Because of these limitations, EBITDA should only be considered as a supplemental performance measure and should
not be considered as a measure of liquidity or cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. See the Statement of Cash
Flows set out in our financial statements included herein.

Approximately
56 of the Company s case sales during 2022 were of the Company s flagship varietal, Pinot Noir. Case sales of Pinot Gris and
Riesling follow with approximately 18 and 10 of case sales each, respectively. The Company sold approximately 187,371 and 203,817 cases
of Company-produced wine during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. This represents a decrease of approximately
16,447 cases, or 8.1 in 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease in case sales in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily the result of a decrease
in shipments through distributors, partially offset by an increase in direct to consumer cases. 

The
Company has three primary sales channels: direct-to-consumer sales, in-state sales to distributors, and out-of-state sales to
distributors. These three sales channels represent 46.4 , 17.5 and 36.1 , of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022,
respectively. This compares to 41.7 , 18.1 and 40.2 of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, respectively.
Miscellaneous and grape sales are included in direct-to-consumer sales. 

The
Company s direct-to-consumer sales and national sales to distributors offer comparable products to customers and utilize similar
processes and share resources for production, selling and distribution. Direct-to-consumer sales generate a higher gross profit margin
than national sales to distributors due to differentiated pricing between these segments. 

26 

Wine
Inventory 

The
Company had 92,779 cases of bottled wine on-hand at the end of 2022. Management believes sufficient bulk wine inventory is on-hand to
bottle 289,438 cases of wine in 2022 and that sufficient stock is on hand to meet current demand levels until the 2022 vintage becomes
available. 

Production
Capacity 

Current
production volumes are within the current production capacity constraints of the Winery when including storage capacity at the Tualatin
Winery and utilization of temporary storage when appropriate. In 2022, 186,792 cases were produced. We have the capacity to store and
process about 275,000 cases of wine per year at the Estate Winery but can expand that capacity by utilizing storage at the Tualatin Winery,
as well as temporary storage. Management continues to invest in new production technologies intended to increase the efficiency and quality
of wine production. During 2022, the Company did not choose to utilize the wine production facilities at the Tualatin Winery but did
utilize it for wine storage. The Tualatin Winery has capacity to produce approximately 28,000 cases of wine. Management intends to fully
utilize the production capacity at the Estate Winery before expanding into the Tualatin Winery. 

Grape
Supply 

For
the 2022 and 2021 vintages, the Company grew approximately 66 and 50 of all grapes harvested, respectively. The remaining grapes harvested
were purchased from other growers. In 2022 and 2021, 8 and 30 of grapes harvested were purchased under short-term contracts, and 26 
and 19 of grapes harvested were purchased under long-term contracts, respectively. The Company considers short-term contracts to be
for single vintage years and long-term contracts to cover multiple vintage years. 

Grapes
are typically harvested and received in September and October of the vintage year. Upon receipt, the grapes are weighed, and a quality
analysis is performed to ensure the grapes meet the standards set forth in the purchase contract. Based on the quantity of qualifying
grapes received, the full amount payable to the grower is recorded to the grapes payable liability account. Approximately 50 of the
grapes payable amount is due in November of the vintage year. The remaining amount is due in March of the following year. The grapes
are processed into wine, which is typically bottled and available for sale between five months and two years from date of harvest. 

The
Company received 1,868,742 and 1,166,116 worth of grapes from long-term contracts during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively. The Company received 639,677 and 1,762,282 worth of grapes from short-term contracts during the years ended December
31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Total grapes payable was 1,208,673 and 1,388,601 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Grapes
payable includes 934,371 and 538,677 of grapes payable from long-term contracts as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

The
Company plans to address long-term grape supply needs by developing new vineyards on properties currently owned or secured by lease.
The Company has approximately 37 acres of vineyards that have been planted but are in the pre-productive stage. We anticipate that these
vineyards will begin producing grapes within the next one to three years. The Company has approximately 231 acres of land that is suitable
for future vineyard development. The Company intends to seek out opportunities to acquire land for future grape plantings in order to
continue to increase available quantities, maintain control over farming practices, more effectively manage grape costs and mitigate
uncertainty associated with long-term contracts.

Seasonality 

The
Company has historically experienced and expects to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in its revenue and net income. Typically,
first quarter sales are the lowest of any given year, and sales volumes increase progressively through the fourth quarter mostly because
of consumer buying habits. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

At
December 31, 2022, the Company had a working capital balance of 17.9 million and a current ratio of 2.80:1. The Company had cash balances
of 338,676, at December 31, 2022. 

Total
cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 2,666,228, which resulted primarily from a net loss in 2022
as well as increased inventory, income tax receivable and accounts receivable, being partially offset by increased depreciation and non-cash
lease expense. 

Total
cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 15,479,674, which primarily consisted of cash used on construction
activity and vineyard development costs. 

Total
cash provided from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 4,737,293, which primarily consisted of proceeds from
the issuance of Preferred Stock and an increase in long term debt with Farm Credit Services, being partially offset by the payment of
a preferred stock dividend. 

In
December of 2005, the Company entered into a revolving line of credit agreement with Umpqua Bank that allows borrowing up to 2,000,000
against eligible accounts receivable and inventories, as defined in the agreement. The revolving line bears interest at prime less 0.5 ,
with a floor of 3.25 , is payable monthly, and is subject to renewal. In July 2021, the Company renewed the credit agreement until July
31, 2023. In November 2022, the Company increased the borrowing line up to 5,000,000. The Company had an outstanding line of credit
balance of 166,617 at December 31, 2022, at an interest rate of 6.5 , and zero outstanding balance at December 31, 2021. As
of December 31, 2022, the Company was out of compliance with a debt covenant. The Company has received a waiver from Umqua Bank waiving
this violation until the next measurement date of December 31, 2023. 

As
of December 31, 2022, the Company had a total long-term debt balance of 7,062,654, including the portion due in the next year, owed
to Farm Credit Services, exclusive of debt issuance costs of 119,237. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had a total long-term debt
balance of 5,535,096, exclusive of debt issuance costs of 132,483. The debt with Farm Credit Services was used to finance the Hospitality
Center and subsequent remodels, invest in winery equipment to increase the Company s winemaking capacity, complete the storage facility,
acquire new vineyard land for future development and provide operating capital. The debt in 2022 with Farm Credit Services was used to
finance completion of new restaurant and tasting room locations and provide operating capital. 

28 

As
of December 31, 2022, the Company had an installment note payable of 1,201,038, due in quarterly payments of 42,534 through February
2032, associated with the purchase of property in the Dundee Hills AVA. 

The
Company believes that cash flow from operations and funds available under its existing credit facilities and preferred stock program
will be sufficient to meet the Company s foreseeable short and long-term operating needs. 

The
Company s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2022 including long-term debt, note payable, grape payables and commitments

To
the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of 
Willamette Valley Vineyards, Inc. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Willamette Valley Vineyards, Inc. (the Company as of December 31, 2022
and 2021, the related statements of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for the years then ended and the related
notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant

The
cost of finished goods is recognized as cost of sales when the wine product is sold. Inventories are stated at the lower of first-in,
first-out FIFO cost or net realizable value by variety. Net realizable value is the value of an asset that can be
realized upon the sale of the asset, less a reasonable estimate of the costs associated with either the eventual sale or the disposal
of the asset in question. 

In
accordance with general practices in the wine industry, wine inventories are generally included in current assets in the accompanying
balance sheets, although a portion of such inventories may be aged for more than one year (Note 3). 

and at December
31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

a component of cost of goods sold. For the years ending December 31, 2022 and 2021, and , respectively, was amortized
into inventory costs. 

A
valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
The Company evaluates the potential realization of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the
amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization included the Company s forecast
of future taxable income or loss and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets.
Certain intangible assets and liabilities will be deductible for tax purposes and may result in deferred tax assets and liabilities as
the benefits are recognized in the Company s tax returns. 

The
Company files U.S. federal income tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service IRS as well as income tax returns in Oregon
and California. The Company may be subject to examination by the IRS for tax years 2019 through 2022. Additionally, the Company may be

Distributor
Sales Segment Wholesale wine sales are through distributors and the Company recognizes revenue when the product is shipped,
and title passes to the distributor. The Company s standard terms are FOB shipping point, with no customer acceptance
provisions. The cost of price promotions and rebates are treated as reductions of revenue. Credit sales are recorded as trade accounts
receivable, and no collateral is required. 

The
Company has price incentive programs with its distributors to encourage product placement and depletions. Sales are reported net of incentive
program expenses. Incentive program payments are made when completed incentive program payment requests are received from the customers.
For the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded incentive program expenses of 1,333,396 and 1,437,481, respectively,
as a reduction in sales on the Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company has recorded an incentive program
liability in the amount of 111,398 and 67,326, respectively, which is included in accrued expenses on the balance sheets. Estimates
are based on historical and projected experience for each type of program or customer and have historically been in line with actual
costs incurred. 

Direct
Sales Segment The Company sells wine directly to customers through its tasting rooms, web site and wine club. Additionally,
the Company sells merchandise, food, and hospitality related services through its tasting rooms. 

Tasting
room sales are recognized as revenue at the point of sale and internet sales are recognized at time of shipment. Hospitality sales, that
are paid in advance of the event, are accrued as unearned revenue, and are subsequently recognized as revenue in the period of the event.
Wine club sales are made under an agreement with the customer, which specifies the quantity and timing of the wine club shipment. Wine
club charges are billed to the customer s credit card, at the time of shipment, and revenue is then recognized. 

The
Company periodically sells bulk wine or grapes that either do not meet the Company s quality standards or are in excess of production
requirements. These sales are recognized when ownership transfers to the buyer which occurs at the point of shipment.

The
Company is authorized to issue shares of redeemable preferred stock. Each share of the Company s currently issued preferred
stock is non-voting. The Company s Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock includes an annual dividend of 0.22 per share and is payable
annually. Additionally, the Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock contains a liquidation preference over the Company s common stock

The
Company recognizes the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained
on examination by the tax authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit is measured based on the largest
benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Interest and penalties related to income tax
matters are recognized in income tax expense. The Company recognized no uncertain tax positions, or any accrued interest and penalties
associated with uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

FASB
ASC 740 requires that the tax benefit of net operating losses, temporary differences and credit carryforwards be recorded as an asset
to the extent that management assesses that realization is more likely than not. Realization of the future tax benefits is
dependent on the Company s ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period. Management believes that
the Company will generate sufficient taxable income in the timeframe required to utilize existing net operating losses and therefore
no valuation allowance has been recognized. 

As
of December 31, 2022, the Company has federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately 5,828,673 that do not expire, state net
operating loss carryforwards of approximately 5,118,609 which will start expiring in 2033.

Grape
Purchases The Company has entered into long-term grape purchase agreements with a number of Willamette Valley wine grape growers.
With these agreements the Company purchases an annually agreed upon quantity of fruit, at pre-determined prices, within strict quality
standards and crop loads. The Company cannot calculate the minimum or maximum payment as such a calculation is dependent in large part
on unknowns such as the quantity of fruit needed by the Company and the availability of grapes produced that meet the strict quality
standards in any given year. If no grapes are produced that meet the contractual quality levels, the grapes may be refused, and no payment
would be due. The Company purchased grapes amounting to 2,508,419 and 2,928,398 during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,

cards at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was

is redeemed by a customer. When the likelihood of a gift card being redeemed by a customer is determined to be remote and the Company
expects to be entitled to the breakage, then the value of the unredeemed gift card is recognized as revenue. We determine the gift card
breakage rate based upon Company-specific historical redemption patterns. To date we have determined that no breakage should be recognized
related to our gift cards.

Rules 13a-15 and 15d-5 under the Exchange Act. Based on that review, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have
concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act (1) is recorded, processed,
summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (2) is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. 

It
should be noted that any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions designed to obtain reasonable (and not absolute)
assurance as to its effectiveness, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals. 

Internal
Control over Financial Reporting 

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

The
Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Company s
financial reporting and the preparation of the Company s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under
the Exchange Act and includes those policies and procedures that: (a) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company s assets; (b) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that the Company s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company s management
and directors; and (c) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the Company s financial statements. All internal controls, no
matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable
assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. 

The
Company s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on this assessment, management has
concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was effective. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have not been any changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the Company s fourth fiscal quarter that our certifying officers concluded materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
