Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 In addition to historical information, from time to time the Company may publish forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements provide the reader with management s current expectations of future events. They include statements relating to such matters as anticipated financial performance, business prospects such as drilling of oil and gas wells, technological development and similar matters. 
 
 Although management believes that the expectations reflected in forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, a variety of factors could cause the Company s actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the Company s forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties that may affect the operations, performance, development and results of our business include, but are not limited to, the following: 

The Company s future operating results will depend upon management s ability to employ and retain quality employees, generate revenues and control expenses. Any decline in operating revenues, without a corresponding reduction in operating expenses, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

The Company has no significant long-term sales contracts for either oil or gas. For the most part, the price we receive for our product is based upon the spot market price, which in the past has experienced significant fluctuations. Management anticipates price fluctuations will continue in the future, making any attempt at estimating future prices subject to significant uncertainty. 

Exploration costs have been a significant component of the Company s capital expenditures in the past and are expected to remain so in the near term. Under the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas properties which the Company uses, these costs are capitalized if drilling is successful or charged to operating costs and expenses if unsuccessful. Estimating the amount of future costs which may relate to successful or unsuccessful drilling is extremely imprecise. 

The Company does not undertake any obligation to publicly revise forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the filing date of this Form 10-K. Readers should carefully review the information described in other documents the Company files from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q to be filed by the Company in 2023 and any Current Reports on Form 8-K filed by the Company. 

PART I 

ITEM 1. 
 BUSINESS 

Overview 
 
 The Reserve Petroleum Company (the Company, we, our or us is engaged principally in managing its owned mineral properties and the exploration for and the development of oil and natural gas properties. Other business segments are not significant factors in our operations. The Company is a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1931. 
 
 Oil and Natural Gas Properties 
 
 For a summary of certain data relating to the Company s oil and gas properties, including production, undeveloped acreage, producing and dry wells drilled and recent activity, see Item 2, Properties. For a discussion and analysis of current and prior years revenue and related costs of oil and gas operations and a discussion of liquidity and capital resource requirements, see Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 
 Owned Mineral Property Management 
 
 The Company owns non-producing mineral interests in 256,534 gross acres equivalent to 88,214 net acres. These mineral interests are in ten different states in the north and south-central United States. A total of 81,080 (92 net acres are in the states of Arkansas, Kansas, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas and Wyoming, the areas of concentration for the Company in our exploration and development programs. 

3

The Company has several options relating to the exploration and/or development of our owned mineral interests. Management continually reviews various industry reports and other sources for activity (leasing, drilling, significant discoveries, etc.) in areas where the Company has mineral ownership. Based on our analysis of any activity and assessment of the potential risk relative to the area, management may negotiate a lease or farmout agreement and accept a royalty interest, or we may choose to participate as a working interest owner and pay our proportionate share of any exploration or development drilling costs. 
 
 A substantial amount of the Company s oil and gas revenue has resulted from our owned mineral property management. In 2022, 5,060,545 (34 of oil and gas sales was from royalty interests versus 3,444,030 (38 in 2021. As a result of our mineral ownership, the Company had royalty interests in 5 gross (0.07 net) wells, which were drilled and completed as producing wells in 2022. This resulted in an average royalty interest of 1.4 for these 5 new wells. The Company has very little control over the timing or extent of the operations conducted on our royalty interest properties. See the following paragraphs for a discussion of mineral interests in which the Company chooses to participate as a working interest owner. 
 
 Development Program 
 
 Development drilling by the Company is usually initiated in one of three ways: 

by participating as a working interest owner with a third-party operator in the development of non-producing mineral interests, which it owns; 

by participating with a joint interest operator in drilling additional wells on our producing leaseholds; or 

if our exploration program, discussed below, results in a successful exploratory well, by participating in the drilling of additional wells on the exploratory prospect. 

In 2022, the Company participated in the drilling of 15 development wells with 14 (1.76 net) completed as producers and 1 (0.06 net) in progress at the end of 2022. 
 
 Exploration Program 
 
 The Company s exploration program is normally conducted by purchasing interests in prospects developed by independent third parties; participating in third party exploration of Company-owned non-producing minerals; developing our own exploratory prospects; or a combination of the above. 
 
 The Company normally acquires interests in exploratory prospects from someone in the industry with whom management has conducted business in the past and/or if management has confidence in the quality of the geological and geophysical information presented for evaluation to Company personnel. If evaluation indicates the prospect is within our risk limits, we may negotiate to acquire an interest in the prospect and participate in a non-operating capacity. 
 
 The Company develops exploratory drilling prospects by identification of an area of interest, development of geological and geophysical information and purchase of leaseholds in the area. The Company may then attempt to sell an interest in the prospect to one or more companies in the petroleum industry with one of the purchasing companies functioning as operator. In 2022, we participated in the drilling of 11 exploratory wells with 3 wells (0.47 net) completed as producers, 3 wells (0.35 net) completed as dry holes and 5 wells (0.88 net) in progress at the end of 2022. 
 
 For a summation of exploratory and development wells drilled in 2022 or planned for in 2023, see Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, subheading Exploration Costs. 
 
 Investment Program 
 
 The Company s primary investment objective is to achieve moderate growth and earnings to protect assets against inflation and provide cash flow from investing activities that supplement cash flow from operations. The Company s diversification of investments is designed to provide a level of protection against the ongoing volatility and political unpredictability of the energy sector. Company investments are focused on quality investments that include, but are not limited to, carefully vetted marketable securities, real estate and other assets, energy sector investments, and start-up ventures. Investments are diversified among asset classes and within broad industry categories to help minimize risk. Low cost, passive investment solutions are used where available and prudent. Generally, there is a correlation between portfolio returns and the amount of portfolio risk we are willing to assume. The Company understands investing requires a longer-term perspective. We are willing to accept some portfolio risk and tolerate fluctuations in market value and rates of return to achieve objectives, but we maintain a moderate approach to protect against significant losses.

Water Well Drilling 
 
 The Company s wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, Trinity Water Services, LLC, an Oklahoma limited liability company, has a water well drilling joint venture agreement JVA with TWS South, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (Collectively, TWS ). 
 
 Consolidated Entities 
 
 The Company consolidates Variable Interest Entities VIEs when the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is generally the party that both: (1) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the VIE. If the Company is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the Company accounts for the investment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP. Grand Woods Development, LLC Grand Woods and TWS are accounted for as consolidated VIEs. See Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on VIEs. 
 
 Customers 
 
 In 2022, the Company had one customer whose total purchases were greater than 10 of revenues from oil and gas sales. Redland Resources, LLC s purchases were 2,006,132 or 14 of total oil and gas sales. The Company sells most of its oil and gas under short-term sales contracts that are based on the spot market price. 
 
 Competition 
 
 The oil and gas industry is highly competitive in all its phases. There are numerous circumstances within the industry and related marketplace that are out of the Company s control such as cost and availability of alternative fuels, the level of consumer demand, the extent of other domestic production of oil and gas, the price and extent of importation of foreign oil and gas, the cost of and proximity of pipelines and other transportation facilities, the cost and availability of drilling rigs, regulation by state and federal authorities and the cost of complying with applicable environmental regulations. 
 
 The Company does not operate any of the wells in which we have an interest; rather, we partner with companies that have the resources, staff and experience to operate wells both in the drilling and production phases. The Company uses its strong financial base and its mineral and leasehold acreage ownership, along with its own geologic and economic evaluations, to participate in drilling operations with these companies. This methodology allows us to participate in exploration and development activities we could not undertake on our own due to financial and personnel limits and allows us to maintain low overhead costs. 
 
 Regulation 
 
 The Company s operations are affected in varying degrees by political developments and federal and state laws and regulations. Although released from federal price controls, interstate sales of natural gas are subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Oil and gas operations are affected by environmental laws and other laws relating to the petroleum industry, and both are affected by constantly changing administrative regulations. Rates of production of oil and gas have, for many years, been subject to a variety of conservation laws and regulations, and the petroleum industry is frequently affected by changes in the federal tax laws. 
 
 Generally, the respective state regulatory agencies supervise various aspects of oil and gas operations within their states and the transportation of oil and gas sold intrastate. 
 
 Environmental Protection and Climate Change 
 
 The Company may be, directly and indirectly, subject to the effects of climate change and may, directly or indirectly, be affected by government laws and regulations related to climate change. We cannot predict with any degree of certainty what effect, if any, climate change and government laws and regulations related to climate change will have on the Company and our business, whether directly or indirectly. While we believe that it is difficult to assess the timing and effect of climate change and pending legislation and regulation related to climate change on our business, we believe that those laws and regulations may affect, directly or indirectly, (i) the costs associated with drilling and production operations in which we participate, (ii) the demand for oil and natural gas, (iii) insurance premiums, deductibles and the availability of coverage and (iv) the cost of utilities paid by the Company. In addition, climate change may increase the likelihood of property damage and the disruption of operation of wells in which we participate. As a result, our financial condition could be negatively impacted, but we are unable to determine at this time whether that impact would be material.

Human Capital Resources 
 
 At December 31, 2022, the Company had six employees including officers, all of whom work in our corporate office. Because we are so small, our compensation philosophy and objectives are to provide compensation that is fair and reasonable for all employees at a competitive level that will allow us to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary to operate the Company at the most efficient level possible. Our objective is to fully comply with all the operational and financial rules and regulations required of any public company, and specifically, those relating to the oil and gas exploration and production E P industry. In addition, we try to maintain compensation at a level that is competitive with other companies in this industry. Our philosophy and objectives for compensation of our executive officers are no different from those with respect to our other employees. 
 
 Compensation levels for all employees, including our executive officers, are reviewed annually by our executive team. This review process includes reviews of salary and wage surveys, primarily for the oil and gas E P industry, and informal performance evaluations provided by supervisors. Compensation levels for the next fiscal year are determined during this review process and presented to the entire Board of Directors for approval. In addition to competitive salary, the Company offers generous bonuses, company sponsored employee benefits, such as life and health insurance benefits, vacation, sick leave and a qualified 401(k) savings plan. 
 
 We believe that each employee contributes directly to our Company s growth and success, and it is our hope that they will take great pride in being a member of our team. Accountability, integrity, and respect are our core values. We work to create an atmosphere where each employee is a valued and important member of the team. We respect the uniqueness of each employee and believe that diversity is maximized in contributions that create strong work groups and ideas. 
 
 Employees are encouraged to demonstrate an entrepreneurial spirit by taking initiative, solving problems, being accountable for results, acting as team players while developing individual skills and knowledge that will contribute to the growth of our Company. We want to provide opportunity, encouragement, resources, and feedback to help employees achieve their goals. 
 
 Our business can only continue to be successful if we allow certain ethical standards to guide the way we operate as a Company, relate to our partners, and exhibit personal integrity in the business community. We share a duty to make the Company a better place for all of us as well as our partners and the community. Employees are always expected to maintain the highest standard of professional conduct. 
 
 All our employees devote a portion of their time to duties with affiliated companies, and we were reimbursed for the affiliates share of compensation directly from those companies. See Item 8, Note 14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.

 PROPERTIES 

The Company s principal properties are oil and natural gas properties. We have interests in approximately 860 producing properties with 69 of them being working interest properties and the remaining 31 being royalty interest properties. About 79 of all properties are in Oklahoma and Texas and account for approximately 76 of our annual oil and gas sales. About 14 of the properties are in Arkansas, Kansas and South Dakota and account for approximately 19 of our annual oil and gas sales. The remaining 7 of these properties are in Colorado, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming and account for about 5 of our annual oil and gas sales. No individual property provides more than 10 of our annual oil and gas sales.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 

Estimates of future revenues from oil and gas sales are derived from a combination of factors which are subject to significant fluctuation over any given period. Reserve estimates, by their nature, are subject to revision in the short-term. The evaluating engineer considers production performance data, reservoir data and geological data available to the Company, as well as makes estimates of production costs, sale prices and the time period the property can be produced at a profit. A change in any of the above factors can significantly change the timing and amount of net revenues from a property. The Company s producing properties are composed of many small working interest and royalty interest properties. As a non-operating owner, we have limited access to the underlying data from which working interest reserve estimates are calculated. Estimates of royalty interest reserves are not made because the information required for the estimation is not available to the Company. While reserve estimates are not accounting estimates, they are the basis for impairment, depreciation, depletion and amortization described below. Additionally, the estimated economic life for each producing property from the reserve estimates is used in the calculation of asset retirement obligations. 

Reserves relating to the Company s proved properties may become uneconomic to produce resulting in impairment of proved properties.

The provisions for depreciation, depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties all constitute critical accounting estimates. Non-producing leaseholds are amortized over the life of the leases using a straight-line method; however, when leases are impaired or condemned, an appropriate adjustment to the provision is made at that time. 

The provision for impairment of long-lived assets is determined by review of the estimated future cash flows from the individual properties. A significant, unforeseen downward adjustment in future prices and/or potential reserves could result in a material change in estimated long-lived assets impairment. 

Depletion and depreciation of oil and gas properties are computed using the units-of-production method. A significant, unanticipated change in volume of production or estimated reserves would result in a material, unexpected change in the estimated depletion and depreciation provisions. 

The Company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and facilities associated with oil and gas wells and to restore land at the end of oil and gas production operations. Removal and restoration obligations are most often associated with plugging and abandoning wells. Estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations will take effect in the future. Additionally, these operations are subject to private contracts and government regulations that often have vague descriptions of what is required. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing as are regulatory, political, environmental and safety considerations. Inherent in the present value calculations are numerous assumptions and judgments, including the ultimate removal cost amounts, inflation factors and discount rate. 

The estimation of the amounts of income tax to be recorded by the Company involves interpretation of complex tax laws and regulations as well as the completion of complex calculations, including the determination of the Company s percentage depletion deduction, if any. To calculate the exact excess percentage depletion allowance, a well-by-well calculation is and can only be performed at the end of each year. During interim periods, a high-level estimate is made considering historical data and current pricing. Although our management believes its income tax accruals are adequate, differences may occur in the future depending on the resolution of pending and new tax matters. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 To supplement the following discussion, please refer to the consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated statements of cash flows included in this Form 10-K. 
 
 In 2022, as in prior years, the Company funded its business activity using internal sources of capital. For the most part, these internal sources are cash flows from operations, cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale debt securities. When cash flows from operating activities exceed those needed for other business activities, the remaining balance is used to increase cash, cash equivalents, equity securities, and/or available-for-sale debt securities. When cash flows from operating activities are not adequate to fund other business activities, withdrawals are made from cash, cash equivalents and equity securities. Cash equivalents are highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less. 
 
 In 2022, net cash provided by operating activities was 8,850,077, net cash applied to investing activities was 10,102,441 and net cash applied to financing activities was 1,577,569. 
 
 Other than cash and cash equivalents, other significant changes in working capital include the following: 
 
 Available-for-sale debt securities increased to 4,208,648 in 2022 from zero in 2021. This was the result of the Company s shift in cash management and investment strategy to available-for-sale debt securities from equity securities. 
 
 Equity securities decreased 6,839,398 (75 to 2,302,959 in 2022 from 9,142,357 in 2021. The net decrease is due to sales in excess of purchases of 5,204,158 and net realized and unrealized losses of 1,635,240. 
 
 Refundable income taxes decreased 230,697 (66 to 120,230 in 2022 from 350,927 in 2021, primarily resulting from increased taxable income that resulted in increases in the current tax provision. 
 
 Accounts receivable increased 955,220 (70 to 2,318,183 in 2022 from 1,362,963 in 2021, primarily due to changes in oil and gas sales receivables in an increased pricing environment. 
 
 Accounts payable increased 138,621 (53 to 399,735 in 2022 from 261,114 in 2021, primarily due to the timing of payable processing. 

9

Other current liabilities decreased 186,879 (71 to 75,675 in 2022 from 262,554 in 2021, due to a decrease in deferred revenues of 186,274 and a net decrease of 605 in gas balancing payables and other liabilities. 
 
 The note payable was recorded as a result of consolidation of Grand Woods. See Note 8 NOTE PAYABLE for details of note payable. 
 
 Discussion of Selected Material Line Items in Cash Flows. 
 
 The following is a discussion of material changes in cash flow by activity between the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Also, see the discussion of changes in operating results under Results of Operations below in this Item 7.

 Cash provided by oil and gas sales increased 5,872,374 (73 to 13,928,206 in 2022 from 8,055,832 in 2021, primarily the result of an increase in oil and gas sales prices and sales volumes. See Results of Operations below for a price/volume analysis and the related discussion of oil and gas sales. 
 
 Cash provided by lease bonuses increased 279,510 to 289,314 in 2022 from 9,804 in 2021. 
 
 Cash provided by service revenue was 788,941 in 2022, with 713,941 provided by water well drilling services. Cash provided in connection with a management services agreement with Mesquite Minerals, Inc. was 75,000, all of which was recorded as deferred revenue in other current liabilities. In 2021, of the 303,356 received for services, 42,082 was recognized in service revenue and 261,274 was recorded as deferred revenue in other current liabilities, all of which was recognized in service revenue in 2022. 
 
 Cash provided by interest increased 58,949 to 62,223 in 2022 from 3,274 in 2021. This increase was the result of the Company s shift in cash management and investment strategy to available-for-sale debt securities from equity securities. 
 
 Cash applied to production and exploration costs increased 1,247,063 (49 to 3,804,075 in 2022 from 2,557,012 in 2021 and cash applied to general suppliers, employees and taxes, other than income taxes increased 627,914 (27 to 2,961,853 in 2022 from 2,333,939 in 2021.

The 1,714,253 (65 increase in natural gas sales to 4,342,725 in 2022 from 2,628,472 in 2021 was the result of an increase in gas sales volumes and an increase in the average price received per thousand cubic feet (MCF). The average price per MCF of natural gas sales increased 2.27 per MCF to 6.11 per MCF in 2022 from 3.84 per MCF in 2021, resulting in a positive gas price variance of 1,611,126. A positive volume variance of 103,127 was the result of an increase in natural gas volumes sold of 26,848 MCF to 711,172 MCF in 2022 from 684,324 MCF in 2021. 
 
 As disclosed in Supplemental Schedule 1 of the Unaudited Supplemental Financial Information included in Item 8 below, working interests in natural gas extensions and discoveries were adequate to replace working interest reserves produced in 2021 but not in 2022. 
 
 The 4,070,217 (69 increase in crude oil sales to 9,976,153 in 2022 from 5,905,936 in 2021 was the result of an increase in the average price per barrel (Bbl) and an increase in oil sales volumes. The average price received per Bbl of oil increased 27.38 to 92.88 in 2022 from 65.50 in 2021, resulting in a positive oil price variance of 2,940,884. An increase in oil sales volumes of 17,241 Bbls to 107,406 Bbls in 2022 from 90,165 Bbls in 2021 resulted in a positive volume variance of 1,129,333. 
 
 As disclosed in Supplemental Schedule 1 of the Unaudited Supplemental Financial Information included below in Item 8, working interests in oil extensions and discoveries were not adequate to replace working interest reserves produced in 2021 or 2022. 
 
 For both oil and gas sales, the price change was mostly the result of a change in the spot market prices upon which most of the Company s oil and gas sales are based. These spot market prices have had significant fluctuations in the past and these fluctuations are expected to continue. 
 
 Operating Costs and Expenses 
 
 Operating costs and expenses increased 1,281,830 (15 to 9,741,059 in 2022 from 8,459,229 in 2021. The material components of operating costs and expenses are discussed below. 
 
 Production Costs. Production costs increased 918,097 (34 to 3,639,924 in 2022 from 2,721,827 in 2021. The increase was the result of a 589,095 (34 increase in lease operating expense to 2,320,736 in 2022 from 1,731,641 in 2021, a 336,395 (69 increase in gross production taxes to 825,205 in 2022 from 488,810 in 2021, and a 7,393 decrease in hauling and compression costs to 493,983 in 2022 from 501,376 in 2021. The increase in lease operating expense was primarily due to the addition of new wells in 2022, a significant portion of which were horizontal. Gross production taxes are state taxes, which are calculated as a percentage of gross proceeds from the sale of products from each producing oil and gas property, therefore, they fluctuate with the change in the dollar amount of revenues from oil and gas sales. 

11

Exploration Costs. Under the successful efforts method of accounting used by the Company, geological and geophysical costs are expensed as incurred, as are the costs of unsuccessful exploratory drilling. The costs of successful exploratory drilling and all development costs are capitalized. Total costs of exploration and development, excluding asset retirement obligations but inclusive of geological and geophysical costs, were 5,377,898 in 2022 and 1,209,748 in 2021. See Item 8, Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a breakdown of these costs. Exploration and acquisition costs charged to operations were 474,773 in 2022 and 687,648 in 2021, inclusive of geological and geophysical costs of 300,993 in 2022 and 468,199 in 2021. 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company participated in the drilling of 11 gross exploratory working interest wells and 15 gross development working interest wells, with working interests ranging from a high of 26 to a low of 0.4 . Of the 11 exploratory wells, 3 were completed as producing wells, 3 as dry holes and 5 wells were in progress at the end of 2022. Of the 15 development wells, 14 were completed as producing wells and 1 well was in progress at the end of 2022. 
 
 The following is a summary as of March 3, 2023, updating both exploration and development activity from December 31, 2021, for the period ended December 31, 2022. 
 
 The Company participated with its 16.71 working interest in the drilling of exploratory wells on two San Patricio County, Texas prospects. Completion attempts of both wells are in progress. Leasehold costs for the period were 2,439. Additional capitalized costs were 629,797.

 The Company purchased the working interest properties of Mesquite Minerals, Inc., an affiliated company, for 699,770 effective July 1, 2022. The Company already owned working interests in these properties. The Company also purchased non-producing leaseholds and other assets totaling 289,739. Management believes the amounts paid are reasonable estimates of fair values of the assets acquired. 
 
 Water Well Drilling Services. Water well drilling services increased 531,983 (142 to 907,447 from 375,554 in 2021. The increase was due to increases of 126,011 in contract labor, 218,135 in repairs and maintenance, 146,156 in equipment and auto expense, 36,306 in depreciation, and a net increase of 5,375 in other operating expenses. 
 
 Grand Woods Expenses. Grand Woods expenses were 32,827 in 2022. These costs consisted of 25,819 in property taxes, 3,400 in repairs and maintenance, and a net 3,608 in other general and administrative costs. Grand Woods was not a consolidated entity until the period ending September 30, 2022. As such, all applicable expenses for 2021 were included in equity method investments. 
 
 Depreciation, Depletion, Amortization and Valuation Provisions (DD A). Major components of DD A are the provision for impairment of undeveloped leaseholds, provision for impairment of long-lived assets, depletion of producing leaseholds and depreciation of tangible and intangible lease and well costs. Undeveloped leaseholds are amortized over the life of the leasehold (most are 3 years) using a straight-line method, except when the leasehold is impaired or condemned by drilling and/or geological interpretation of seismic data; if so, an adjustment to the provision is made at the time of impairment. The provision for impairment of undeveloped leaseholds was 82,308 in 2022 versus 64,835 in 2021. 

13

As discussed in Item 8, Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, accounting principles require the recognition of an impairment loss on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present. Impairment evaluation is a two-step process. The first step is to measure when the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets, determined on a well basis, is less than the assets carrying amounts. The second step is to adjust those assets meeting the first criterion to estimated fair value. Evaluation for impairment was performed in both 2022 and 2021. The 2022 impairment loss was 1,109,455 and the 2021 impairment loss was 1,673,929. 
 
 The depletion and depreciation of oil and gas properties are computed by the units-of-production method. The amount expensed in any year will fluctuate with the change in estimated reserves of oil and gas, a change in the rate of production or a change in the basis of the assets. The provision for depletion and depreciation was 1,543,184 in 2022 and 937,206 in 2021. The provision includes 149,402 for 2022 and 137,732 for 2021 for the amortization of the asset retirement costs. See Item 8, Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the asset retirement obligation. The provision for depreciation for other assets was 67,059 in 2022 and 78,953 in 2021. 
 
 Gain on Disposition of Oil and Gas Properties. The Company had gains on oil and gas property sales of 198,443 compared to a 16,313 gain in 2021. The current period gain was primarily due to the sale of 29.75 ownership of assets in a Nolan County, Texas prospect. 
 
 General, Administrative and Other (G A) . G A increased 118,940 (6 to 2,082,525 from 1,963,585 in 2021. The increase was primarily due to a net decrease of 99,473 in costs related to implementation of new accounting and mineral management software in 2021, offset by increases in salaries and 401K contributions of 147,682, real estate and franchise taxes of 20,383, and net increases in all other G A accounts of 50,348. 
 
 Equity Loss in Investees 
 
 Equity loss in investees increased 10,456 (7 to 164,497 in 2022 from 154,041 in 2021. The 2022 net loss consisted of Broadway Seventy-Two, LLC Broadway 72 losses of 168,228, Grand Woods loss of 15,972, Broadway Sixty-Eight, LLC Broadway 68 income of 15,217 and QSN Office Park, LLC QSN income of 4,486. 
 
 Other Income/(Loss), Net 
 
 Other income/(loss), net in 2022 was a loss of 1,185,161 and income of 693,250 in 2021. See Item 8, Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a breakdown of other income/(loss), net. The material components of other income/(loss) are discussed below. 
 
 Net realized and unrealized loss on equity securities was 1,635,240 in 2022 with a net realized and unrealized gain of 573,631 in 2021. Realized gains or losses result when an equity security is sold. Unrealized gains or losses result from adjusting the Company s carrying amount in equity securities owned at the reporting date to estimated fair value. In 2022, the Company had realized losses of 350,469 and unrealized losses of 1,284,771. In 2021, the Company had realized gains of 176,858 and unrealized gains of 396,773. 
 
 Income from other investments increased 104,779 to 108,034 in 2022 from 3,255 in 2021, primarily resulting from distributions of income on newly invested master limited partnerships. 
 
 The Company had a gain on asset sales of 49,823 in 2022 compared to a loss on asset sales of 201,119 in 2021. The gain in 2022 was the result of a gain of 26,777 on vehicle sales and other net gains of 23,046. 
 
 Interest income increased 74,232 (309 to 98,231 in 2022 from 23,999 in 2021 and dividend income decreased 100,434 to 264,035 in 2022 from 364,469 in 2021, primarily due to the Company s shift in investment strategy back to available-for-sale debt securities. 
 
 Income Tax Provision/(Benefit) 
 
 In 2022, the Company had an estimated income tax provision of 1,072,524 as the result of a deferred tax provision of 1,068,275 and a current tax provision of 4,249.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors 
 of The Reserve Petroleum Company 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Reserve Petroleum Company and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Proved Oil and Natural Gas Properties Oil and Natural Gas Reserve Quantities and Future Cash Flows Used to Determine Depletion and to Assess Impairment 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 As discussed in Notes 2, 10, and 11 to the financial statements, the Company's proved oil and natural gas properties are depleted using the units-of-production method on a property-by-property basis and is based primarily on estimates of proved reserve quantities. Additionally, the Company recognizes impairment of proved oil and natural gas properties on a property-by-property basis when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the property's carrying amount. The impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the property to its carrying amount. The Company's oil and natural gas reserve quantities and the related future net cash flows required management to make significant estimates and assumptions. As a result of changing market conditions and commodity prices, assumptions can change from period to period, causing the estimates of proved reserves to change. The Company employs a petroleum engineer to estimate oil and natural gas reserves using generally accepted engineering methods, calculation procedures and engineering data, and also engages an independent engineering firm to review the reasonableness of a portion of the Company's estimated reserves. Changes in these assumptions or engineering data could have a significant impact on reserve quantities and the amount of depletion and impairment recorded during a period. The proved oil and natural gas properties balance was 12,612,575 as of December 31, 2022, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion, amortization and valuation allowance. 
 
 Given the significant judgments made by management, performing audit procedures to evaluate the Company's oil and natural gas reserve quantities and the related cash flows including management's estimates and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 
 Our audit procedures to address management's significant judgments and assumptions related to oil and natural gas reserve quantities and estimates of the future cash flows included the following, among others: 
 
 a. Evaluated the experience, qualifications and objectivity of the Company's internal and external reservoir engineers, including the methodologies and calculation procedures used to estimate oil and natural gas reserves. 

b. Evaluated forecasted production by comparing to historical production and decline rates. 

c. Evaluated the future operating and capital cost assumptions used by the internal reservoir engineer to estimate future cash flows by comparing them to historical costs. 

d. Assessed management's estimated oil and natural gas prices by: 

i. Understanding the methodology used by management for development of the oil and natural gas prices used for assessing impairment and comparing the estimated prices to an independently determined range of prices, including published forward pricing indices and third-party industry sources. 

ii. Understanding the methodology used by management for development of the oil and natural gas prices used for calculating depletion and comparing the prices to average historical prices. 

iii. Evaluating the historical realized price differentials incorporated in the oil and natural gas prices.

Equity Method and Other Investments: 
 The Company accounts for its non-marketable investments in limited liability companies on the equity method if ownership allows the Company to exercise significant influence. 
 
 Other investments, without readily determinable fair values, that are not accounted for under the equity method are measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Management reviews our other investments and the underlying projects and activity periodically and assesses the need for any impairment. Management does not believe any investments need to be impaired at December 31, 2022 or 2021.

 and , respectively, of accrued oil and gas sales included in the consolidated statements of income. 
 
 The Company s contracts with customers originate at or near the time of delivery and transfer of control of oil and natural gas to the purchasers. As such, the Company does not have significant unsatisfied performance obligations. 
 
 The Company s oil is typically sold at delivery points under contract terms that are common in our industry. The Company s natural gas produced is delivered by the well operators to various purchasers at agreed upon delivery points under a limited number of contract types that are also common in our industry. However, under these contracts, the natural gas may be sold to a single purchaser or may be sold to separate purchasers. Regardless of the contract type, the terms of these contracts compensate the well operators for the value of the oil and natural gas at specified prices, and then the well operators will remit payment to the Company for its share in the value of the oil and natural gas sold. 
 
 The Company s disaggregated revenue has two primary revenue sources which are oil sales and natural gas sales. The following is an analysis of the components of oil and gas sales: 

Natural Gas Sales 
 Miscellaneous Oil and Gas Product Sales 

The Company recognizes revenue from lease bonuses when it has received an executed lease agreement with a third party transferring the rights to explore for and produce any oil or gas they may find within the terms of the lease, the payment has been collected and the Company has no obligation to refund the payment. The Company recognizes the lease bonus as a cost recovery with any excess above its cost basis in the mineral properties being treated as income. Service revenue primarily relates to water well drilling and related activities and is recognized based on the Company s right to invoice as services are performed.

These marketable equity securities are subject to overall market risks, which could result in a temporary or permanent decline in the fair value of these securities.

Excess federal percentage depletion, which is limited to certain production volumes and by certain income levels, reduces estimated taxable income projected for any year. When a provision for income taxes is recorded, federal excess percentage depletion benefits decrease the effective tax rate. When a benefit for income taxes is recorded, federal excess percentage depletion benefits increase the effective tax rate. The benefit of federal excess percentage depletion is not directly related to the amount of pre-tax income recorded in a period. Accordingly, in periods where a recorded pre-tax income is relatively small or a pre-tax loss, the proportional effect of these items on the effective tax rate may be significant.

Class C units accrue a dividend of per annum and will hold priority payment over Class A units upon sale of any Grand Woods property.

 Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 
 The Company s other financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, marketable securities, trade payables and dividends payable.

for 2022 and for 2021 are included in the consolidated statements of income in the line-item Depreciation, Depletion, Amortization and Valuation Provisions. The impairments for 2022 and 2021 were calculated by reducing the carrying value of the individual properties to an estimated fair value equal to the discounted present value of the future cash flows from these properties. Forward pricing was used for calculating future revenue and cash flow.

 WORKING INTEREST RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION 
 (Unaudited) 

Notes: 

1. 
 Estimates of royalty interests reserves, on properties in which the Company does not own a working interest, have not been included because the information required for the estimation of such reserves is not available. The Company s share of production from its net royalty interests was Bbls of oil and MCF of gas for 2022 and Bbls of oil and MCF of gas for 2021. 

2. 
 The preceding table sets forth estimates of the Company s proved oil and gas reserves, together with the changes in those reserves, as prepared by the Company s engineer for 2022 and 2021. The Company engineer s qualifications set forth in the Proxy Statement and as incorporated into Item 10 of this Form 10 -K, are incorporated herein by reference. All reserves are located within the United States. 

3. 
 The Company emphasizes that the reserve volumes shown are estimates, which by their nature are subject to revision in the near term. The estimates have been made by utilizing geological and reservoir data, as well as actual production performance data available to the Company. These estimates are reviewed annually and are revised upward or downward as warranted by additional performance data. The Company s engineer is not independent but strives to use an objective approach in calculating the Company s working interest reserve estimates. 

4. 
 The Company s internal controls relating to the calculation of its working interests reserve estimates include review and testing of the accounting data flowing into the calculation of the reserve estimates. In addition, the average oil and natural gas product prices calculated in the engineer s 2022 summary reserve report was tested by comparison to 2022 average sales price information from the accounting records.

 ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 As defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), the term "disclosure controls and procedures" means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Management of the Company, with the participation of the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. This system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements and provide reasonable assurance as to the detection of fraud. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Further, because of changes in conditions, effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting may vary over time. 
 
 With the participation of the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, the Company s management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting, based on the framework and criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, the Company s management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. As the Company is a Smaller Reporting Company, Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s independent registered public accounting firm. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Management of the Company, with the participation of the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the internal control over financial reporting and concluded that no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting occurred during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
