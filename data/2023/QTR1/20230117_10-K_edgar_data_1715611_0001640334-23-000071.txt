BUSINESS Company Overview Body and Mind is a multi-state cannabis operator, which has retail, distribution, cultivation, and/or processing operations in Nevada, California, Arkansas, Michigan and Ohio. Our platform approach to expansion focuses on limited license states and jurisdictions, entering new markets through lower cost license applications and opportunistic/targeted acquisitions. We have developed the marquis lifestyle Body and Mind brand in Nevada with strong penetration into dispensaries and have recently expanded our brand and products to dispensaries in California. The Body and Mind brand appeals to a wide range of cannabis consumers with products including flower, oils, extracts (wax, live resin, ambrosia) and edibles. We have a track record of producing award-winning cannabis products and we have success with winning licenses in new states and jurisdictions. We are a Nevada corporation that, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Nevada Medical Group, LLC NMG ), are engaged in the cultivation and production of medical and adult-use recreational marijuana products. NMG produces cannabis flower, oil extracts and edibles under license in the state of Nevada, which are available for sale under the brand name Body and Mind in dispensaries in Nevada. In April 2020, we closed the San Diego ShowGrow dispensary transaction, which is owned 60 by our wholly-owned subsidiary NMG San Diego, LLC NMG SD ), and has received all licenses, permits and authorizations required to conduct medical and adult-use commercial cannabis retail operations. The San Diego ShowGrow dispensary opened in early July 2020. We, through our wholly-owned subsidiary NMG Long Beach, LLC NMG LB ), have received all approvals for final transfer of the licenses required to operate the medical and adult-use cannabis retail dispensary in Long Beach which was acquired by NMG LB at the end of August 2020, and the acquisition of the dispensary is expected to close in the near future. NMG LB has been managing the Long Beach dispensary operations under the ShowGrow banner since early August 2019. On July 11, 2021, we announced receipt of local approval for a cannabis manufacturing facility in Cathedral City, California and execution of a lease for the facility. We have applications in process with the California Bureau of Cannabis Control (BCC) for a type N manufacturing license, and with the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) for a distribution license, which are anticipated to allow us to manufacture and distribute our BaM branded flower products, extracts, oils and edibles. The Company has received state and local approvals to advance the manufacturing facility and is evaluating the expansion opportunity. On November 30, 2021, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, DEP Nevada, Inc., a Nevada corporation DEP entered into two membership interest purchase agreements with Canopy Monterey Bay, LLC Canopy and the membership interest owners of Canopy to acquire an aggregate of 100 of Canopy, which owns a retail dispensary in the limited license jurisdiction of Seaside, California, called The Reef.

We received all approvals and final license and name transfer from the Ohio Department of Pharmacy in early September 2020 and transferred the dispensary license and all assets and liabilities associated with such dispensary from NMG Ohio LLC to a 100 owned subsidiary of Body and Mind; however, the transfer of the remaining 70 interest in NMG Ohio LLC to NMG did not occur until NMG Ohio LLC receives a production license. On September 17, 2021, the final award of the production license was transferred to our wholly owned subsidiary, NMG OH P1 LLC, and the transaction closed resulting in NMG now owning 100 of NMG Ohio.

The dispensary opened on April 27, 2020 and the cultivation commenced operations on April 6, 2021 On October 28, 2020, the dispensary was awarded best dispensary in Arkansas by Ark420.com. In Michigan we, through NMG MI 1, Inc. opened a retail location in Muskegon Michigan on February 2, 2022 and operate the dispensary as a Body and Mind branded dispensary. On September 21, 2021 we announced the Company has leased a commercial building in Manistee, MI with the intent of developing a cultivation facility with 50,000 square feet of canopy as well as a production facility. On April 7, 2022 the Company announced it would pause development of the cultivation and production developments. The Company continues to evaluate the projects.

Acquisition of Nevada Medical Group, LLC On September 14, 2017, we, with DEP, entered into a definitive agreement (the Share Exchange Agreement with Nevada Medical Group, LLC NMG ), whereby DEP acquired all of the issued and outstanding securities of NMG in exchange for (a) 16,000,000 post reverse-split Common Shares, (b) 2,000,000 cash, and (b) promissory notes (the Promissory Notes in the aggregate principal amount of 2,000,000, to the NMG securityholders on a pro rata basis in accordance with their respective ownership interest in NMG.

On November 14, 2017, each Subscription Receipt was exchanged in accordance with its terms, for no additional consideration, for one pre-Consolidation Common Share and one common share purchase warrant (each a Warrant of the Company. Each Warrant was exercisable by the holder at a price of CAD 0.90 for a period of 24 months from the date of issuance. On completion of the Share Exchange Agreement, we assumed the business of NMG, being the cultivation and production of medical marijuana products. Convertible Loan and Management Agreements with Comprehensive Care Group LLC On March 19, 2018, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiaries DEP and NMG, entered into a convertible loan agreement (the Convertible Loan Agreement and a management agreement (the Management Agreement ), respectively, with Comprehensive Care Group LLC CCG ), an Arkansas limited liability company, with respect to the development of a medical marijuana dispensary including a 50 flowering plant cultivation facility in West Memphis, Arkansas which agreements were effective as of March 15, 2019. 7 Table of Contents Pursuant to the Convertible Loan Agreement, DEP agreed to make loan advances to CCG from time to time in the aggregate principal amount of up to 1,250,000 and as of July 31, 2020, DEP has loaned 1,353,373 to CCG.

The construction was completed and all permits and licenses were received for the dispensary in late April 2020, which opened for operations on April 27, 2020. The interest on the outstanding principal amount is currently set at 6,000 per month, payable monthly in arrears on or before the first calendar day of each month. CCG is not obligated to repay any principal outstanding under the loan until March 30, 2021. Either CCG or DEP may unilaterally extend the maturity date by one year, and may thereafter continue to extend the maturity date on a yearly basis by increments of one year (each, an Extension Option by providing written notice of the exercise of the Extension Option by the party seeking an extension to the other party; provided, however, that under no circumstances shall any extended maturity date extend beyond the expiration of the term of the Management Agreement entered into between NMG and CCG. The Company extended the loan maturity date by one year resulting in a new maturity date of March 30, 2023. The Management Agreement has an expiration of March 15, 2024 and can be mutually extendable. Upon the latter of: (a) one year after granting of a medical marijuana dispensary license by the Arkansas Medical Marijuana Commission to CCG, or (b) one year after entering into the Convertible Loan Agreement, DEP may, in its sole discretion, subject to DEP providing all reasonable assistance to obtain all necessary approvals from the applicable government authorities to engage in the medical marijuana dispensary business, elect to convert all of the outstanding indebtedness into preferred units of CCG equal to 40 of the overall member units of CCG, subject to approval of the Arkansas Medical Marijuana Commission, with the following preferred rights: (i) the right to an allocative share of 66.67 of the net profits of CCG (as defined in the Convertible Loan Agreement) and the right to distributions equal to 66.67 of the net profits on a monthly basis; (ii) the right to a 66.67 share of CCG s assets upon dissolution of CCG; and (iii) the right to 66.67 of all voting rights of members of CCG. DEP is waiting for regulatory clearance from the State regulators before proceeding with the conversion Pursuant to the Management Agreement, NMG provides operations and management services to CCG (including management, staffing, operations administration, oversight and other related services) for the medical marijuana dispensary. In consideration for such services CCG pays NMG a monthly management fee in the amount equal to 66.67 of the Monthly Net Profits (as defined below) of CCG for the immediately-preceding month. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that DEP exercises its conversion right under the Convertible Loan Agreement, then NMG s monthly management fee shall be fixed at 6,000 per month, unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. For purposes of the Management Agreement, Monthly Net Profits means, for each calendar month, an amount equal to CCG s gross revenue for such calendar month less CCG s operating expenses (including cost of goods sold, interest, and tax for said month), as reasonably determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

The terms required semi-annual interest payments unless we elected to accrue the interest by adding it to the principal amount of the debt facility.

Nevada Production Facility On June 20, 2019, we announced the receipt of a conditional use permit from Clark County, Nevada, for a new production facility located within one mile of NMG s existing cultivation facility located at 3375 Pepper Lane, in Las Vegas. The facility is approximately 7,500 square feet, and tenant improvement of the building holding the facility was completed in February 2020. The facility includes high-volume extraction equipment, which we expect will dramatically increase our manufacturing capacity and efficiency for our extraction products, including oils, wax, live resin and ambrosia. The facility also expands the kitchen area and creates an opportunity for the Company to white label for brands seeking an entry to the Nevada market. After passing all inspections, receiving all permits, and finalizing license transfer approvals, the new production facility began operations in March 2020. 16 Table of Contents Our Products and Services We cultivate and produce medical and adult-use recreational marijuana products such as cannabis flower, oil extracts and edibles under the brand name Body and Mind . We also produce products under license agreements. We have built our business plan around capitalizing on the medical-use and recreational cannabis markets. The regulated medical and recreational use cannabis industry is a rapidly growing industry that presents a unique opportunity under current market conditions. In the United States, the development and growth of the industry has generally been driven by state law and regulation. Accordingly, the market varies on a state-by-state basis. State laws that legalize and regulate medical-use cannabis allow patients to consume cannabis for medicinal reasons with a doctor s recommendation subject to various requirements and limitations. States have authorized numerous medical conditions as qualifying conditions for treatment with medical-use cannabis, including but not limited to treatment for cancer, glaucoma, HIV/AIDS, wasting syndrome, pain, nausea, seizures, muscle spasms, multiple sclerosis, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), migraines, arthritis, Parkinson s disease, Alzheimer s disease, lupus, residual limb pain, spinal cord injuries, inflammatory bowel disease and terminal illness. We believe that the following conditions create an attractive opportunity for the cultivation and production of products within the medical and recreational use cannabis industry: Significant industry growth in recent years and expected continued growth; A shift in public opinion and increasing momentum toward the legalization of cannabis; Limited access to capital by industry participants in light of risk perceived by financial institutions of violating federal laws and regulatory guidelines for offering banking services to cannabis-related businesses; NMG currently has three main product lines: (i) flower, (ii) edibles, and (iii) extracts; and NMG currently cultivates recreational marijuana. Notwithstanding the foregoing market opportunity and trends, and despite legalization at the state level, we continue to believe that the current state of federal law creates significant uncertainty and potential risks associated with investing in medical-use and recreational-use cannabis facilities. We have a Nevada cannabis distribution license to distribute our products and our primary market is in the State of Nevada. In addition to Body and Mind branded products, NMG manufactures products for national brands including Her Highness and GPen. Our Strategy Body and Mind s strategy is focused on a platform approach to expansion which focuses on limited license states and jurisdictions. We work to maximize shareholder value through: 1) Production and distribution of Body and Mind branded products (production and/or cultivation); 2) Use excess production capacity to produce and distribute synergistic third party brands; 3) Own or operate strategic retail stores; and 4) Enter new markets though lower cost applications and opportunistic / targeted acquisitions. 17 Table of Contents We have a track record of award-winning cannabis strains, flower and extracts and as early entrants to the Nevada market management has experience with writing license applications, cultivating and operating efficiently and working within a strict metric or track and trace environment. We have developed the premium, marquis lifestyle Body and Mind brand in Nevada with strong penetration into dispensaries. The Body and Mind brand appeals to a wide range of cannabis consumers with products including oils, extracts (wax, live resin, ambrosia) and edibles. We have a long track record of producing award-winning cannabis products and we have success with licensing to manufacture for brands. We currently produce cannabis oil cartridges for Gpen, a well-known vaporizer manufacturer. We currently produce cannabis products for Her Highness, a female focused cannabis brand. We have constructed and are operating in a new larger production facility and are in discussions with several cannabis brands who may be interested in having Body and Mind produce their brand and products under license in Nevada. NMG was organized as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 3, 2014. NMG was an early applicant in Nevada in 2014 and was awarded one of the first state medical licenses for both cultivation and production of marijuana. NMG has been a licensed producer and cultivator of cannabis products since it was issued its first cultivation license on November 5, 2015 and production license on December 10, 2015. On July 1, 2017, NMG was awarded an additional state recreational cultivation and production license. NMG produces cannabis flower, oil extracts and edibles, which are available for sale under the brand name Body Mind in dispensaries in Nevada. NMG has several growth initiatives underway including new product introductions, product licensing, third party extraction, out-of-State licensing, and acquisitions. Since our acquisition of NMG, as discussed in more detail above, we have been focused on: (1) improving NMG s existing facility; (2) increasing product availability; and (3) lowering production costs. Increased Product Availability We focused on flower and developing top end strains during the early years of our business. When Nevada was a medical only market we performed significant research on edibles with products including granola bars, beef jerky, hard candies and gummies. We also performed significant research on extraction with products ranging from shatter, rosin, distillate and raw oil. As adult recreation rules changed the products that could be produced, we have focused on increasing our product offerings and licensing opportunities. We have determined that the edible market is a sector of the marijuana industry with a high profit margin. In addition, we have implemented improved recipes of our established edible products which has increased our product s shelf life and improved taste. We continually work on research for new edible products and developing recipes. Lowering Our Production Costs As cannabis flower continues to be the foundation product for the marijuana industry, we are striving for continuous improvement to our cultivation process. Our aim will always focus on increasing the production yields of each harvest, and to obtain the highest quality product harvest. Doing so achieves two things for us and our customers: (1) allows us to maximize our profit; and (2) gives our customers the best value for their dollar by offering high quality THC products. 18 Table of Contents Effect of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on the Business The United States Food and Drug Administration (the FDA regulates all food and food ingredients introduced into or offered for sale in interstate commerce (with the exception of meat, poultry, and certain processed egg products). At this time, our edible food products are not introduced into or offered for sale in interstate commerce, and FDA approval of our edible products is not required. However, we must, and do, comply with food labeling requirements set forth by the Southern Nevada Health District (the SNHD and the Nevada Department of Taxation, which include: a statement of identity, net quantity of contents, ingredient statement, manufacturer information, nutritional labeling, use-by date, safe handling instructions, an allergen statement, Keep out of reach of children statement, THIS IS A CANNABIS PRODUCT statement, cannabinoid profile, terpenoid profile, total amount of THC, our production license number, production run number, date of production, date of final testing, date on which the product was packaged, etc. Our operations as a licensed cultivator and producer of marijuana and marijuana products could be found in violation of the federal Controlled Substances Act. Due to this, we may face higher federal income tax liability as it is subject to Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code disallows a cannabis company from deducting any expenses from their income on its federal income tax return, except for those considered to be cost of goods sold (COGS). While this severely impacts marijuana retailers, as opposed to cultivators and producers, we do face higher federal income tax liability than a non-cannabis company. The State of Nevada, per Nevada Revised Statutes Section 372A.290, has implemented the following taxes on marijuana and marijuana products: (i) a fifteen percent (15 excise tax on the wholesale sale which is paid by the cultivator and is calculated on the fair market value at wholesale set by the Department of Taxation, and (ii) a ten percent (10 excise tax on the retail sale which is paid by the retail store. We are obligated to collect and remit the wholesale cultivation tax on all wholesale sales and file the appropriate tax returns on a monthly basis. We currently do not have retail operations in Nevada, and therefore are not required to collect and/or remit any retail taxes. All marijuana and marijuana products sold at retail must also pay and remit sales taxes at the applicable local sales tax level. Principal Products and Services We cultivate and produce medical and adult-use recreational marijuana products such as cannabis flower, oil, extracts and edibles under the brand name Body and Mind .

We use our in-house produced distillate oil to infuse all the edibles. We cultivate and produce medical and recreational marijuana products such as flower, oil extracts and edibles under the brand name Body and Mind . Competitive business conditions Supply Demand - as our competitors expand operations, there is more supply creating less demand for mid and low quality cannabis products. We continue to provide high quality products, excellent customer service, and competitive prices. We have built our business plan around capitalizing on the medical-use and recreational cannabis market. The regulated medical-recreational use cannabis industry is a rapidly growing industry that presents a unique opportunity under current market conditions. In the United States, the development and growth of the industry has generally been driven by state law and regulation, and accordingly, the market varies on a state-by-state basis. We believe that the following conditions create an attractive opportunity for the cultivation, production and retail sales of products within the medical recreational-use cannabis industry: Significant industry growth in recent years and expected continued growth; A shift in public opinion and increasing momentum toward the legalization of cannabis; Limited access to capital by industry participants in light of risk perceived by financial institutions of violating federal laws and regulatory guidelines for offering banking services to cannabis-related businesses; Opportunity for skilled operators to transfer operational and execution experience to new facilities and operations. Notwithstanding the foregoing market opportunity and trends, and despite legalization at the state level, we continue to believe that the current state of federal law creates significant uncertainty and potential risks associated with investing in medical-use and recreational-use cannabis facilities. We have a distribution licence and infrastructure to distribute our products and our primary market is in State of Nevada. Product Regulation State laws that legalize and regulate medical-use cannabis allow patients to consume cannabis for medicinal reasons with a doctor s recommendation subject to various requirements and limitations. In Ohio, patients must have a qualifying medical condition to be eligible for a medical-use card. Such qualifying medical conditions include: HIV/AIDS; Alzheimer s disease; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); cancer; chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE); Crohn s disease; epilepsy or another seizure disorder; fibromyalgia; glaucoma; hepatitis C; inflammatory bowel disease; multiple sclerosis; pain that is chronic and severe, or intractable; Parkinson s disease; post-traumatic stress disorder; sickle cell anemia; spinal cord disease or injury; Tourette s syndrome; traumatic brain injury; and ulcerative colitis. Ohio prohibits smoking of medical-use cannabis, but permits oils, tinctures, plant material, edibles and patches. Ohio medical-use card holders may not possess more than a 90-day supply of medical marijuana, which is defined by form, as follows: plant material- no more than eight ounces of tier I medical marijuana, no more than five and three-tenths ounces of tier II medical marijuana; no more than twenty-six and fifty-five-hundredths grams of THC content in patches for transdermal administration or lotions, creams, or ointments for topical administration; no more than nine and nine-tenths grams of THC content in oil, tincture, capsule, or edible form for oral administration; no more than fifty-three and one-tenths grams of THC content in medical marijuana oil for vaporization. (THC, which is short for tetrahydrocannabinol, is the principal psychoactive cannabinoid in cannabis.) 21 Table of Contents In November 2016, California and Nevada voters both approved cannabis use for adults over the age of 21 without a physician s prescription or recommendation, and permitted the cultivation and sale of marijuana, in each case subject to certain limitations: In November 2016, California voters approved Proposition 64, which is also known as the Adult Use of Marijuana Act (the AUMA ), in a ballot initiative. Among other things, the AUMA makes it legal for adults over the age of 21 to use marijuana and to possess up to 28.5 grams of marijuana flowers and 8 grams of marijuana concentrates. Individuals are also permitted to grow up to six marijuana plants for personal use. In addition, the AUMA establishes a licensing system for businesses to, among other things, cultivate, process and distribute marijuana products under certain conditions. On January 1, 2018, the California Bureau of Marijuana Control enacted regulations to implement the AUMA. Nevada voters approved Question 2 in a ballot initiative in November 2016. Among other things, Question 2 makes it legal for adults over the age of 21 to use marijuana and to possess up to one ounce of marijuana flowers and one-eighth of an ounce of marijuana concentrates. Individuals are also permitted to grow up to six marijuana plants for personal use. In addition, Question 2 authorizes businesses to cultivate, process and distribute marijuana products under certain conditions. We have obtained the necessary permits and licenses to expand our existing business to cultivate and distribute cannabis in compliance with the laws in the State of Nevada and California. Arkansas voters approved medical use in 2017 and we have obtained the necessary approvals and licenses to carry out our management agreement with a licensee in the state of Arkansas. In Michigan, the state has approved adult-use licenses and we operate an adult use retail center in Muskegon, MI. In Illinois, we plan to develop and manage the two dispensary licenses that we have access to through construction financing agreements. With the recent acquisition of a NJ company that holds the rights to a NJ dispensary, we plan to develop and operate a cannabis dispensary business in the forthcoming year. Despite the changes in state laws, cannabis remains illegal under federal law. The U.S. Department of Justice (the DOJ has not historically devoted resources to prosecuting individuals whose conduct is limited to possession of small amounts of marijuana for use on private property but has relied on state and local law enforcement to address marijuana activity. In the event the DOJ reverses its stated policy and begins strict enforcement of the CSA in states that have laws legalizing medical marijuana and recreational marijuana in small amounts, there may be a direct and adverse impact to our business and our revenue and profits. We are monitoring the current federal administration s, the DOJ s and Congress positions on federal marijuana law and policy. Recently, there have been positive discussions about the Federal Government s approach to cannabis, including the Medical Marijuana and Cannabidiol Research Expansion Law which enables research into marijuana-derived medications. The DOJ has not signaled any change in their enforcement efforts. Based on public statements and reports, we understand that certain aspects of those laws and policies are currently under review, but no official changes have been announced. It is possible that certain changes to existing laws or policies could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations. Although the possession, cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical and adult use is permitted in certain states, provided compliance with applicable state and local laws, rules, and regulations, marijuana is illegal under federal law. We believe we operate our business in compliance with applicable Nevada, California, Ohio, Michigan and Arkansas laws and regulations. However, any changes in federal, state or local law enforcement regarding marijuana may affect our ability to operate our business. Further, strict enforcement of federal law regarding marijuana would likely result in the inability to proceed with our business plans, could expose us to potential criminal liability and could subject our properties to civil forfeiture. Any changes in banking, insurance or other business services may also affect our ability to operate our business. Competitive Conditions and Position Production and Sales NMG has a number of licenses and a long-term lease for a facility allowing it to cultivate, produce and distribute medical and recreational marijuana. In addition to flower products, we produce marijuana extract products such as distillate oil, ice wax, dry sift, shatter, edibles and topicals. 22 Table of Contents The Nevada, California, Ohio and Arkansas Markets We face competition from a variety of competitors. Several factors impacting competition include, but are not limited to, the quality control and consistency of products being produced, the hiring and retention of competent personnel within the industry, brand marketing and production costs. The United States Market We face competition from a diverse mix of market participants, including, but not limited to, independent investors, hedge funds and other cannabis operators, all of whom may compete with us to acquire real estate zoned for medical-use and/or recreational-use cannabis facilities. The current market for medical and recreational marijuana products may be limited as more competitors enter the market. See Risk Factors Risks related to the Business and Industry.

RISK FACTORS In addition to the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have identified the following material risks and uncertainties which reflect our outlook and conditions known to us as of the date of this Annual Report. These material risks and uncertainties should be carefully reviewed by our stockholders and any potential investors in evaluating the Company, our business and the market value of our common stock. Furthermore, any one of these material risks and uncertainties has the potential to cause actual results, performance, achievements or events to be materially different from any future results, performance, achievements or events implied, suggested or expressed by any forward-looking statements made by us or by persons acting on our behalf. Refer to Forward-looking Statements . 30 Table of Contents There is no assurance that we will be successful in preventing the material adverse effects that any one or more of the following material risks and uncertainties may cause on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results, which may result in a significant decrease in the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, there is no assurance that these material risks and uncertainties represent a complete list of the material risks and uncertainties facing us. There may be additional risks and uncertainties of a material nature that, as of the date of this Annual Report, we are unaware of or that we consider immaterial that may become material in the future, any one or more of which may result in a material adverse effect on us. You could lose all or a significant portion of your investment due to any one of these material risks and uncertainties. Risks Related to the Business and Industry We have a limited operating history which may make it difficult for investors to predict future performance based on current operations. We have a limited operating history upon which investors may base an evaluation of our potential future performance. Our subsidiary, NMG was formed on March 3, 2014 and began carrying on business in the same year, and therefore, our prospects must be considered in light of the risks common to early-stage enterprises, including under-capitalization, cash shortages, limitations with respect to personnel, financial, and other resources and lack of revenues. We have incurred losses in prior periods, and losses in the future could cause the quoted price of our Common Shares to decline or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, our ability to pay our debts as they become due and on our cash flow. We have incurred losses in prior periods. For the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022, we incurred a comprehensive loss of 28,131,724 and, as of that date, we had an accumulated deficit of 45,803,026. Any losses in the future could cause the quoted price of our Common Shares on the CSE to decline or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, our ability to pay our debts as they become due, and on our cash flow. We are a holding company and investors are subject to the risks attributable to our subsidiaries which generate substantially all of our revenues. We are a holding company and essentially all of our operating assets are the capital stock of our subsidiaries. As a result, investors in us are subject to the risks attributable to our subsidiaries. As a holding company, we conduct our business through our subsidiaries, which generate substantially all of our revenues. Consequently, our cash flows and ability to complete current or desirable future enhancement opportunities are dependent on the earnings of our subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings to us. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and other distributions will depend on their operating results and will be subject to applicable laws and regulations which require that solvency and capital standards be maintained by such companies and contractual restrictions contained in the instruments governing their debt. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of our subsidiaries, holders of indebtedness and trade creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to us. As a manufacturer and distributor of ingestible products, we face exposure to product liability claims, regulatory action and litigation if products are alleged to have caused harm. We face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims, regulatory action and litigation if our products are alleged to have caused significant loss or injury. In addition, the manufacture and sale of our products involves the risk of injury to consumers due to tampering by unauthorized third parties or product contamination. Previously unknown adverse reactions resulting from human consumption of our products alone or in combination with other medications or substances could occur. We may be subject to various product liability claims, including, among others, that its products caused injury or illness, include inadequate instructions for use or include inadequate warnings concerning possible side effects or interactions with other substances. A product liability claim or regulatory action against us could result in increased costs, could adversely affect our reputation with our clients and consumers generally, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain or maintain product liability insurance on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities. Such insurance is expensive and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. The inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage on reasonable terms or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our potential products. 31 Table of Contents As a manufacturer and distributor of products, we face exposure to product recalls or return of products. We may be subject to the recall or return of our products for reasons such as, product defects, contamination, unintended harmful side effects, interactions with other substances, packaging safety and inadequate or inaccurate labeling disclosure. If any of our products are recalled, we could be required to incur the unexpected expense of the recall and any legal proceedings that might arise in connection with the recall. We may lose a significant amount of sales and may not be able to replace those sales at an acceptable margin or at all. In addition, a product recall may require significant management attention. There can be no assurance that any quality, potency or contamination problems will be detected in time to avoid unforeseen product recalls, regulatory action or lawsuits. Additionally, if one of our significant brands were subject to recall, the image of the brand and Body and Mind could be harmed. A recall for any of the foregoing reasons could lead to decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, product recalls may lead to increased scrutiny of our regulatory agencies, requiring further management attention and potential legal fees and other expenses. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our operations remains uncertain, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition and on the market price of our common shares. In December 2019, a strain of novel coronavirus (now commonly known as COVID-19) was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. COVID-19 has since spread rapidly throughout many countries, and, on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic. In an effort to contain and mitigate the spread of COVID-19, many countries, including the United States, Canada and China, have imposed unprecedented restrictions on travel, and there have been business closures and a substantial reduction in economic activity in countries that have had significant outbreaks of COVID-19. COVID-19 may have a future material impact on our results of operation with respect to retail sales at our dispensary locations as well as wholesales of our products in Nevada to dispensaries in Nevada. In Nevada, the state forced all in-store sales to be halted in March 2020, only allowing home delivery sales, and eventually curbside pickup sales. This order forced the retail market and the wholesale demand to nearly stop until retailers satisfied regulatory requirements to carry out home delivery and curbside pickup. This had a significant negative impact on our sales from March 2020 to May 2020 in Nevada. Although certain COVID-19 restrictions have been relaxed, significant uncertainty remains as to the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, and on the global economy as a whole. It is currently not possible to predict how long the pandemic will last or the time that it will take for economic activity to return to prior levels. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant financial market volatility and uncertainty. A continuation or worsening of the levels of market disruption and volatility seen in the recent past could have an adverse effect on our ability to access capital, on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and on the market price of our common shares. Our future success depends on our key executive officers and our ability to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. Our future performance depends on the continued services and continuing contributions of our senior management, particularly the Chief Executive Officer who consults to us. Certain members of our senior management team are generally contracted on an at-will basis, which means that they could terminate their employment with us at any time with little or short notice. The loss of the services of our senior management, the CEO, or other key employees/contractors for any reason could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our strategic objectives and harm our business, financial condition and operating results. 32 Table of Contents Our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel will also be critical to our success because of the need to hire and retain additional personnel as business grows. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified personnel. Because of these factors, we may not be able to effectively manage or grow our business, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operations. Litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We and/or our subsidiaries may become party to litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of our respective businesses which could adversely affect our respective operations. Should any litigation in which we and/or our subsidiaries become involved be determined against us and/or our subsidiaries, such a decision may adversely affect our respective abilities to continue operating, adversely affect the market price of our Common Shares and use significant resources. Even if we and/or our subsidiaries, as the case may be, is involved in litigation and succeeds, litigation can redirect significant company resources. In addition, litigation may also create a negative perception of our brand. Our intended growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline, do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality. Our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve, and visibility into our markets is limited. Our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast. Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our business operates in industries that may experience periodic, cyclical downturns. In addition, if our business demand depends on customers spending budgets, product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these customers. Demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns, which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in incentive programs, new product introductions and customer inventory levels. Any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period. We face intense competition and our competitors may have a longer operating history or greater financial resources allowing them to compete more effectively. We may face intense competition from other companies, some of which can be expected to have longer operating histories and more financial resources and manufacturing and marketing experience than us. Increased competition by larger and better financed competitors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The State of Nevada, as well as the states of Ohio, Illinois and New Jersey, have only issued to date a small number of licenses to produce and sell medical marijuana. There were, however, many applicants for licenses. Because of early stages of the industry in which we operate, we expect to face additional competition from new entrants. If the number of users of medical marijuana in the United States increases, the demand for products will increase and we expect that competition will become more intense, as current and future competitors begin to offer an increasing number of diversified products. We may not have sufficient resources to maintain research and development, marketing, sales and client support efforts on a competitive basis, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to comply with environmental and safety laws may result in us incurring additional costs for corrective measures. Medical marijuana operations are subject to environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions and discharges to water, air and land, the handling and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous materials and wastes, and employee health and safety. Our failure to comply with environmental and safety laws and regulations may result in additional costs for corrective measures, penalties or in restrictions in manufacturing operations. In addition, changes in environmental, employee health and safety or other laws, more vigorous enforcement thereof or other unanticipated events could require extensive changes to operations or give rise to material liabilities, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. 33 Table of Contents Our cannabis crop could be harmed by pests, plant diseases or other agricultural risks which would have a material adverse affect on our business. Our business involves the growing of cannabis, which is an agricultural product. As such, our business is subject to the risks inherent in the agricultural business, such as pests, plant diseases and similar agricultural risks. This could lead to a reduced yield when harvesting the cannabis affecting the supply of cannabis for distribution, and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and our ability to meet consumer demand. We may experience increased costs during the growth stage of the cannabis due to the possibility of rising energy costs. Growing cannabis requires a considerable amount of energy. We are vulnerable to rising costs of energy due to our need to consume considerable amounts of energy to grow our product. Rising or volatile energy costs may adversely impact our business by increasing production costs and decreasing revenue if those increased costs cannot be transferred to the consumer. The cannabis industry is difficult to forecast due to the industry being in the early growth stages. Detailed sales forecasts are not generally obtainable from sources at this early stage of the medical marijuana industry in the United States. A failure in the demand for products to materialize as a result of competition, technological change or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our public image and the consumer perception of us is greatly influenced by scientific research, regulatory investigations, and media attention. Negative publicity will result in an unfavorable public image and will negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. We believe the medical marijuana industry is highly dependent upon consumer perception regarding the safety, efficacy and quality of the medical marijuana produced. Consumer perception of our products and proposed products can be significantly influenced by scientific research or findings, regulatory investigations, litigation, media attention and other publicity regarding the consumption of medical marijuana products. There can be no assurance that future scientific research, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention or other research findings or publicity will be favorable to the medical marijuana market or any particular product, or consistent with earlier publicity. Our dependence upon consumer perceptions means that adverse reports, findings, attention or other publicity, whether or not accurate or with merit, could have a material adverse effect on us, the demand for our products and proposed products, and our business, financial condition, cash flow and results of operations. Further, adverse publicity reports or other media attention regarding the safety, efficacy and quality of medical marijuana in general, or our products and proposed products specifically, or associating the consumption of medical marijuana with illness or other negative effects or events, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Such adverse publicity reports or other media attention could arise even if the adverse effects associated with such products resulted from consumers failure to consume such products appropriately or as directed. 34 Table of Contents Risks related to the Federal and State Regulations Federal regulation and enforcement may adversely affect the implementation of cannabis laws and regulations may negatively impact our results of operations. Cannabis is a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substance Act (the CSA ). Even in those jurisdictions in which the manufacture and use of medical cannabis has been legalized at the state level, the possession, use, cultivation, and transfer of cannabis remains a violation of federal law. Federal law criminalizing the use of cannabis pre-empts state laws that legalize its use for medicinal or adult-retail purposes, and therefore strict enforcement of federal law regarding cannabis would severely restrict our ability to carry out our business plan. The U.S. Department of Justice under the Obama administration had issued memoranda, including the so-called Cole Memorandum on August 29, 2013, characterizing enforcement of federal cannabis prohibitions under the CSA to prosecute those complying with state regulatory systems allowing the use, manufacture and distribution of medical cannabis as an inefficient use of federal investigative and prosecutorial resources when state regulatory and enforcement efforts are effective with respect to enumerated federal enforcement priorities under the CSA. In the Cole Memorandum, the U.S. Department of Justice provided guidance to all federal prosecutors indicating that federal enforcement of the CSA against cannabis-related conduct should be focused on eight priorities, which are to prevent: (1) distribution of cannabis to minors; (2) revenue from sale of cannabis to criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels; (3) transfer of cannabis from states where it is legal to states where it is illegal; (4) cannabis activity from being a pretext for trafficking of other illegal drugs or illegal activity; (5) violence or use of firearms in cannabis cultivation and distribution; (6) drugged driving and adverse public health consequences from cannabis use; (7) growth of cannabis on federal lands; and (8) cannabis possession or use on federal property. On January 4, 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memo updating the Department of Justice s policy on federal marijuana enforcement (the Sessions Memorandum ). The Sessions Memorandum effectively rescinded and replaced the Cole Memorandum, and directed all U.S. Attorneys to enforce the laws enacted by Congress and to follow well-established principles when pursuing prosecutions related to marijuana activities. While in theory the protections under the Cole Memorandum have been abolished, the new policy does not explicitly direct local U.S. Attorneys to launch an attack on state-legal marijuana businesses. Rather, the new policy promulgated by the Sessions Memorandum is to return local control to federal prosecutors who know where and how to deploy Justice Department resources most effectively to reduce violent crime, stem the tide of the drug crisis, and dismantle criminal gangs. The threat of federal prosecution remains for legitimate, state-legal marijuana businesses, including our business. However, no assurance can be given that the federal prosecutor in each judicial district where we operate will agree that our activities within such prosecutor s district do not go contrary to the Justice Department s goals. There is also no guarantee that the current administration or future administrations will not revise the federal enforcement priorities enumerated in the Cole Memorandum, the Sessions Memorandum or otherwise choose to strictly enforce the federal laws governing cannabis production or distribution. On April 11, 2018, U.S. Senator Cory Gardner received assurances from former President Donald Trump that 1) states with legal marijuana industries would not be targeted by the Justice Department, 2) the rescission of the Cole Memorandum would not impact state s legal marijuana industries, and 3) that the former President would support a federalism-based legislative solution to fix the states rights issue once and for all. The former President s comments are encouraging to legal marijuana businesses; however, no legislative action at the federal level has been taken. Under U.S. federal law, banks or other financial institutions that provide us with banking services could be found guilty of money laundering, which restricts our ability to receive reputable banking services and adversely affects our business operations. Under U.S. federal law it may potentially be a violation of federal money laundering statutes for financial institutions to take any proceeds from marijuana sales or any other Schedule I substance. Banks and other financial institutions could be prosecuted and possibly convicted of money laundering for providing services to cannabis businesses. Under U.S. federal law, banks or other financial institutions that provide a cannabis business with a checking account, debit or credit card, small business loan, or any other service could be found guilty of money laundering or conspiracy. Financial institutions must submit a suspicious activity report SAR as required by federal money laundering laws. These marijuana related SARs are divided into three categories: marijuana limited, marijuana priority, and marijuana terminated, based on the financial institution s belief that the marijuana business follows state law, is operating out of compliance with state law, or where the banking relationship has been terminated. There can be no assurance that a negative SAR will not be filed against us limiting our access to banking services as well as subjecting us to Federal review. This will also negatively impact our public image and affect operations. 35 Table of Contents Risks related to Our Securities We may issue additional Common Shares in the future, which could cause significant dilution to all shareholders. Our Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of up to 900,000,000 Common Shares, with a par value of 0.0001 per share. As of January 13, 2023, the Company had 146,636,974 Common Shares issued and outstanding, 7,553,000 stock options outstanding and 36,415,284 share purchase warrants outstanding, of which 3,200,000 share purchase warrants were held in escrow. As at July 31, 2022, the Company s 9,453,000 stock options outstanding of which only 8,492,000 stock options are exercisable into 8,492,000 Common Shares of the Company with the following terms: Number of Options outstanding Exercise price Expiry dates 1,900,000 CAD 0.66 November 24, 2022 175,000 CAD 0.41 June 6, 2023 855,000 CAD 0.57 December 10, 2023 150,000 CAD 0.61 December 10, 2023 1,950,000 CAD 0.88 August 21, 2024 250,000 CAD 0.93 October 1, 2024 200,000 CAD 0.88 January 23, 2025 250,000 CAD 0.405 March 1, 2025 1,375,000 CAD 0.67 April 30, 2025 1,250,000 CAD 0.68 March 6, 2026 250,000 CAD 0.65 April 5, 2024 200,000 CAD 0.44 November 30, 2024 448,000 CAD 0.44 November 30, 2026 200,000 CAD 0.15 July 8, 2027 9,453,000 Number of Options exercisable Exercise price Expiry dates 1,900,000 CAD 0.66 November 24, 2022 175,000 CAD 0.41 June 6, 2023 855,000 CAD 0.57 December 10, 2023 150,000 CAD 0.61 December 10, 2023 1,950,000 CAD 0.88 August 21, 2024 250,000 CAD 0.93 October 1, 2024 200,000 CAD 0.88 January 23, 2025 250,000 CAD 0.405 March 1, 2025 1,375,000 CAD 0.67 April 30, 2025 625,000 CAD 0.68 March 6, 2026 250,000 CAD 0.65 April 5, 2024 200,000 CAD 0.44 November 30, 2024 112,000 CAD 0.44 November 30, 2026 200,000 CAD 0.15 July 8, 2027 8,492,000 As at July 31, 2022, the Company s 18,215,284 share purchase warrants outstanding are exercisable into 18,215,284 Common Shares of the Company with the following terms: Number of warrants outstanding and exercisable Exercise price Expiry dates 11,780,134 CAD 1.50 May 17, 2023 635,150 CAD 1.25 May 16, 2023 4,800,000 US 0.40 July 19, 2025 1,000,000 US 0.16 June 14, 2027 18,215,284 (1) This figure does not include 3,200,000 warrants issued to the Agent pursuant to the Loan Agreement, which warrants are held in escrow by us and are to be released to the Agent if we draw on the Delayed Draw Term Loan by March 31, 2023, or cancelled if we do not draw on the Delayed Draw Term Loan. Each warrant, if released to the Agent, will entitle the holder to acquire one share of common stock at an exercise price of US 0.45 per share until July 19, 2025. 36 Table of Contents We may issue additional Common Shares in the future in connection with a financing or an acquisition. Such issuances may not require the approval of our shareholders. Any issuance of additional shares of our Common Shares, or equity securities convertible into our Common Shares, including but not limited to, warrants and options, will dilute the percentage ownership interest of all shareholders, may dilute the book value per share of our Common Shares, and may negatively impact the market price of our Common Shares. Because we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our Common Shares, our shareholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them. We intend to retain any future earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our Common Shares in the foreseeable future. Declaring and paying future dividends, if any, will be determined by our Board, based upon earnings, financial condition, capital resources, capital requirements, restrictions in our Articles of Incorporation, contractual restrictions, and such other factors as our Board deems relevant. Unless we pay dividends, our shareholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them. There is no assurance that shareholders will be able to sell shares when desired. Our Common Shares are categorized as penny stock , which may make it more difficult for investors to buy and sell our Common Shares due to suitability requirements. Our Common Shares are considered penny stock . The SEC has adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price less than 5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than 5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. The price of our Common Shares is significantly less than 5.00 per share. This designation imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and accredited investors . The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer buying securities to disclose certain information concerning the transaction, obtain a written agreement from the purchaser and determine that the purchaser is reasonably suitable to purchase the securities given the increased risks generally inherent in penny stocks. These rules may restrict the ability and/or willingness of brokers or dealers to buy or sell our Common Shares, either directly or on behalf of their clients, may discourage potential stockholders from purchasing our Common Shares, or may adversely affect the ability of stockholders to sell their shares. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA sales practice requirements may also limit a shareholder s ability to buy and sell our Common Shares, which could depress the price of our Common Shares. In addition to the penny stock rules described above, FINRA has adopted rules that require a broker-dealer to have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer before recommending an investment to a customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer s financial status, tax status, investment objectives, and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. Thus, the FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our Common Shares, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our Common Shares, have an adverse effect on the market for our Common Shares, and thereby depress our price per Common Share. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 1B.

Refer to Forward-looking Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors. Introduction The following discussion summarizes the results of operations for each of our fiscal years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021 and our financial condition as at July 31, 2022 and 2021, with a particular emphasis on fiscal 2022, our most recently completed fiscal year. Overview Our business is the production and cultivation of medical and recreational marijuana in Nevada pursuant to licenses held by NMG operating under the marquee brand name of Body Mind and produces flower, oil, extracts and edibles and are available for sale in dispensaries in Nevada. In addition, we have retail / dispensary operations in Ohio, California, Michigan and Arkansas, and wholesale operations in Ohio and Arkansas that produce flower and/or concentrates from extraction. Results of Operations for the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021 The following table sets forth our results of operations for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021: July 31, 2022 July 31, 2021 Sales 31,638,163 26,900,869 Cost of sales and other (20,694,217 (14,910,660 General and Administrative Expenses (14,463,446 (11,402,882 Other Items (22,115,439 (397,079 Net Loss (28,228,104 (1,976,461 Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment 96,380 395,945 Comprehensive Loss (28,131,724 (1,580,516 Basic and Diluted Loss Per Share (0.25 (0.02 Revenues For the year ended July 31, 2022, we had total sales of 31,638,163 and cost of sales of 20,694,217 for a gross margin of 10,943,946 compared to total sales of 26,900,869 and cost of sales of 14,910,660 for a gross margin of 11,990,209 in the year ended July 31, 2021.

A significant reason for the increase in general and administrative expenses between the years related to increased depreciation from 1,457,550 to 1,490,516, license, utilities and office administration from 2,938,525 to 4,627,009, business development expense from 282,865 to 669,471 and consulting fees from 537,760 to 967,860 as a result of various ongoing acquisitions and expansions. Lease expense increased from 431,427 to 856,697 as a result of additional leased premises in Michigan, California, and Nevada. Salaries and wages increased from 3,400,472 to 3,907,971 as a result of increased operations in all regions including the total number of employees under payroll. Income Taxes The (benefit) expense for income taxes consists of the following: 2022 2021 Current: Federal 2,277,868 2,281,497 State 85,867 99,322 2,363,735 2,380,819 Deferred: Federal 6,598 (214,352 State 222,832 242 229,430 (214,110 Total (benefit) expense for income taxes 2,593,165 2,166,709 Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code IRC prohibits businesses engaged in the trafficking of Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substances from deducting normal business expenses, such as payroll and rent, from gross income (revenue less cost of goods sold). Section 280E was originally intended to penalize criminal market operators, but because cannabis remains a Schedule I controlled substance for U.S. Federal purposes, the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS has subsequently applied Section 280E to state-legal cannabis businesses. Cannabis businesses operating in states that align their tax codes with the IRC are also unable to deduct normal business expenses from their state taxes. The nondeductible expenses shown in the effective rate reconciliation above is comprised primarily of the impact of applying Section 280E to the Company s businesses that are involved in selling cannabis, along with other typical non-deductible expenses such as lobbying expenses. 2022 2021 Net loss for the year before income tax (25,634,939 (190,248 Federal and state income tax rates 21.00 21.00 Expected income tax recovery (5,383,335 39,951 IRC 280E disallowance 8,208,764 1,935,581 Stock options 118,816 243,829 Impairment of consolidated investment - 176,816 Other permanent differences (78,052 (82,301 Opening deferred tax adjustments (602,555 (284,621 State taxes (394,760 7,598 Change in benefit not recognized 724,287 129,856 Total income tax expense 2,593,165 2,166,709 The impact of the loss on impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, ROU assets, and loans receivable in the aggregate amount of 20,517,192 is included in the IRC 280E disallowance for 2022. Approximately 4.3 million was included in the IRC 280E disallowance for the year ended July 31, 2022 related to the impairment losses. 46 Table of Contents Other Items During the year ended July 31, 2022, our other items accounted for 22,115,439 in expenses as compared to 397,079 in expenses for the year ended July 31, 2021.

Trends and Uncertainties Potential Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic In December 2019, a strain of novel coronavirus (now commonly known as COVID-19) was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. COVID-19 has since spread rapidly throughout many countries, and, on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic. In an effort to contain and mitigate the spread of COVID-19, many countries, including the United States, Canada and China, have imposed unprecedented restrictions on travel, and there have been business closures and a substantial reduction in economic activity in countries that have had significant outbreaks of COVID-19. Although certain restrictions have been relaxed, COVID-19 may have a future material impact on our results of operation with respect to retail sales at our dispensary locations as well as wholesales of our products in Nevada to dispensaries in Nevada. Significant uncertainty remains as to the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, and on the global economy as a whole. It is currently not possible to predict how long the pandemic will last or the time that it will take for economic activity to return to prior levels. We do not yet know the full extent of any impact on our business or our operations, however, we will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely, and intend to follow health and safety guidelines as they evolve. 48 Table of Contents There are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

Each warrant, if released to the Agent, will entitle the holder to acquire one share of common stock at an exercise price of US 0.45 per share until July 19, 2025. Critical Accounting Policies Our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. In general, management s estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management. We believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Income taxes The determination of deferred income tax assets or liabilities requires subjective assumptions regarding future income tax rates and the likelihood of utilizing tax carry-forwards. Changes in these assumptions could materially affect the recorded amounts, and therefore do not necessarily provide certainty as to their recorded values. Foreign currency The Company determines the functional currency through an analysis of several indicators such as expenses and cash flows, financing activities, retention of operating cash flows, and frequency of transactions with the reporting entity. 49 Table of Contents Fair value of financial instruments Management uses valuation techniques, in measuring the fair value of financial instruments, where active market quotes are not available. In applying the valuation techniques, management makes maximum use of market inputs wherever possible, and uses estimates and assumptions that are, as far as possible, consistent with observable data that market participants would use in pricing the instrument. Where applicable data is not observable, management uses its best estimate about the assumptions that market participants would make. Such estimates include liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility may vary from the actual results that would be achieved in an arm s length transaction at the reporting date. The assessment of the timing and extent of impairment of intangible assets involves both significant judgements by management about the current and future prospects for the intangible assets as well as estimates about the factors used to quantify the extent of any impairment that is recognized. Long-lived assets and goodwill Long-lived assets and goodwill are reviewed for indicators of impairment at least annually. When there are indications of impairment, the Company calculates the fair value of reporting units for goodwill and the fair value of the asset groups for long-lived assets using various valuation techniques, which require the input of highly subjective assumptions that can materially affect the fair value estimate. Intellectual property The recoverability of the carrying value of the intellectual property is dependent on numerous factors. The carrying value of these assets is reviewed by management when events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recovered. If impairment is determined to exist, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. Stock-based compensation The option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, particularly the expected stock price volatility. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, and therefore the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the Company s stock options. Business Combination The results of businesses acquired in a business combination are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. Purchase accounting results in assets and liabilities of an acquired business being recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Any excess consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. We perform valuations of assets acquired and liabilities assumed on each acquisition accounted for as a business combination in order to record the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our best estimate of fair value. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenue and cash flows, discount rates and selection of comparable companies. Significant estimation is required in determining the fair value of the customer relationship intangible assets, deferred revenue and contingent consideration liabilities. The significant estimation is primarily due to the judgmental nature of the inputs to the valuation models used to measure the fair value of these intangible assets, deferred revenue and contingent consideration liabilities, as well as the sensitivity of the respective fair values to the underlying significant assumptions. We use the income approach to measure the fair value of these intangible assets. The significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the intangible assets included forecasted revenues from existing customers and existing customer attrition rates. When estimating the significant assumptions to be used in the valuation we include a consideration of current industry information, market and economic trends, historical results of the acquired business and other relevant factors. These significant assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. We engage the assistance of valuation specialists in concluding on fair value measurements in connection with determining fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13 Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected loss methodology, which will result in more timely recognition of credit losses. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company does not anticipate this amendment to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. 50 Table of Contents In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805), Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2021-08 requires the recognition and measurement of contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Considerations to determine the amount of contract assets and contract liabilities to record at the acquisition date include the terms of the acquired contract, such as timing of payment, identification of each performance obligation in the contract and allocation of the contract transaction price to each identified performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis as of contract inception.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Management of financial risks The financial risk arising from the Company s operations are credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and currency risk. These risks arise from the normal course of operations and all transactions undertaken are to support the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The risks associated with these financial instruments and the policies on how to mitigate these risks are set out below. Management manages and monitors these exposures to ensure appropriate measures are implemented on a timely and effective manner. Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss. The Company reduces its exposure to credit risk by maintaining its cash with major financial institutions. Credit risk associated with the convertible loans receivable arises from the possibility that the principal and/or interest due may become uncollectible. The Company mitigates this risk by managing and monitoring the underlying business relationship. The Company is not currently exposed to any significant credit risk associated with its trade receivable. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Company had working capital of 1,380,421 as at July 31, 2022. The Company outlined substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern in prior periods which has been alleviated by securing long term debt, cash flow positive operations and increased sales. The Company anticipates that current cashflow positive operations, cash on hand and working capital will ensure coverage for all expenses associated with current operations for at least the next 15 months from the issuance of these financial statements. Management believes that the Company has access to capital resources through potential public or private issuances of debt or equity securities to further contribute to the growth of the company. Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Company is not exposed to interest rate risk as it does not hold financial instruments that will fluctuate in value due to changes in market interest rates. Currency risk Currency risk is the risk that the fair values of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because they are denominated in currencies that differ from the respective functional currency. The Company is exposed to currency risk by incurring expenditures and holding assets denominated in currencies other than its functional currency. Assuming all other variables remain constant, a 1 change in the Canadian dollar against the US dollar would not result in a significant change to the Company s operations. Other risks The Company is not exposed to other risks unless otherwise noted. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA BODY AND MIND INC.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of July 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended July 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) related to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Business Combinations Description of the Critical Audit Matter As described in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed an acquisition wherein the Company acquired certain net assets from one entity for total consideration of approximately 5.8 million. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting which requires the determination of the fair value of the consideration transferred, assets acquired, and liabilities assumed. The Company utilized a third-party valuation specialist to assist in the determining the fair value of assets acquired, and liabilities assumed. The Company determined it acquired intangible assets (dispensary licenses and tradenames) with a fair value of approximately 1.2 million and recorded goodwill of approximately 4.8 million. The dispensary license was valued using the multi-period excess earnings model and trade names were valued using the relief-from-royalty method. The recognition, measurement, and disclosure of the Company s business combinations in the financial statements were considered especially challenging and required significant auditor judgment due to the complex determination by management of the appropriate assumptions, such as discount rates, revenue growth rates, and projected profit margins, for the valuation of acquired net assets and expected probabilities of key outcomes. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. F-2 Table of Contents How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the following: Testing management s process for developing the respective fair value estimates for intangible assets. Evaluating management s and the valuation specialist s identification of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation models used by the third-party specialist. Testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data provided to the specialist by management and used in the fair value estimates. Evaluating the significant assumptions used related to sales growth, discount rates, gross profit margins, contributary asset charges, tax rate and useful lives to discern whether they are reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the entity; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Evaluated the qualifications of the third-party firm engaged by the Company based on their credentials and experience. Evaluated the accuracy and completeness of the financial statement presentation and disclosure of the acquisitions. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were utilized by the Firm to assist in the evaluation of the valuation models and discount rate assumptions. Goodwill Impairment Assessment Description of the Critical Auditing Matter As described in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company tests goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Reporting units are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recorded based on the difference between the fair value and carrying amount, not to exceed the associated carrying amount of goodwill. The Company s annual impairment test occurred on July 31, 2022. The Company utilized a third-party valuation specialist to assist in the determining the fair value of each reporting unit. The valuation specialist primarily used a discounted cash flow income method to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. We identified the evaluation of the impairment analysis for goodwill as a critical audit matter because of the significant estimates and assumptions management used in the discounted cash flow analysis performed by the valuation specialist to determine fair value of the reporting unit. Performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of these estimates and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. F-3 Table of Contents How the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the following: Testing management s processes for estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. Evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow models utilized by the Company for the respective impairment analyses. Testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the discounted cash flow models. Evaluating the significant assumptions provided by management related to revenues, EBITDA, long term growth rates to discern whether they are reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the entity; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Evaluate assumptions developed by the valuation specialist, such as discount rates, net working capital needs and long-term growth rates, for reasonableness. In addition, professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were utilized by the Firm to assist in the evaluation of the discounted cash flow model, discount rate assumptions and market method approaches. Indefinite Lived Intangible Asset Impairment Assessment Description of the Critical Auditing Matter As described in note 12, the Company has two indefinite lived intangible assets (license and brand). Further, as described in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company tests indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. Indefinitely lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of such asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recorded based on the difference between the fair value and carrying amount. The Company performed an impairment analysis on July 31, 2022, on its license and brand indefinite lived intangible assets. The Company utilized a third-party valuation specialist to assist in the determining the fair value of each indefinite lived intangible asset. The valuation specialist primarily used a discounted cash flow income method to estimate the fair value of these assets. We identified the evaluation of the impairment analysis for these indefinite lived intangible assets as a critical audit matter because of the significant estimates and assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis performed by the valuation specialist to determine fair value of such assets. Performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of these estimates and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.

Evaluate assumptions developed by the valuation specialist, such as discount rates, contributory asset charges and long-term growth rates, for reasonableness. In addition, professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were utilized by the Firm to assist in the evaluation of the discounted cash flow model, discount rate assumptions and market method approaches. /s/ We have served as the Company s auditor since 2021.

These risks arise from the normal course of operations and all transactions undertaken are to support the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The risks associated with these financial instruments and the policies on how to mitigate these risks are set out below. Management manages and monitors these exposures to ensure appropriate measures are implemented on a timely and effective manner. Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss. The Company reduces its exposure to credit risk by maintaining its cash with major financial institutions. Credit risk associated with the convertible loans receivable arises from the possibility that the principal and/or interest due may become uncollectible. The Company mitigates this risk by managing and monitoring the underlying business relationship. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Company ensures, as far as reasonably possible, that it will have sufficient capital in order to meet short-term business requirements, after taking into account cash flows from operations and the Company s holdings of cash. The Company had working capital of at 31 July 2022 and the Company required additional financing to meet all current and future financial obligations which caused substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Subsequent to year-end, the Company alleviated the factor that caused substantial doubt by securing long term debt. The Company anticipates that cash on hand and working capital will ensure coverage for all expenses associated with current operations for at least the next 12 months from the issuance of these financial statements. Management believes that the Company has access to capital resources through potential public or private issuances of debt or equity securities to further contribute to the growth. Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Company is not exposed to interest rate risk as it does not hold financial instruments that will fluctuate in value due to changes in interest rates. Currency risk Currency risk is the risk that the fair values of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because they are denominated in currencies that differ from the respective functional currency. The Company is exposed to currency risk by incurring expenditures and holding assets denominated in currencies other than its functional currency. Finished goods Consumables Total During the year ended 31 July 2022 and 2021, overhead expenses of approximately 3,678,312 and , respectively, were included in inventory.

The loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 6,000 per month until the parties mutually agree to increase the interest. Upon the latter of one year of granting of a medical cannabis dispensary license by the appropriate authorities or one year after entering into the convertible loan agreement, DEP may elect to convert the loan into preferred units of CCG equal to 40 of all outstanding units of CCG, subject to approval of the Arkansas Medical Marijuana Commission. The Company evaluated the convertible loan receivable s settlement provisions and elected the fair value option in accordance with ASC 825 Financial Instruments , to value this instrument as management deems fair value to be more relevant than historical cost. Under such election, the loan receivable is measured initially and subsequently at fair value, with any changes in the fair value of the instrument being recorded in the consolidated financial statements as a change in fair value of the financial instruments. The Company estimates the fair value of this instrument by first estimating the fair value of the straight debt portion, excluding the embedded conversion option, using a discounted cash flow model. The Company then estimates the fair value of the embedded conversion option using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model. The sum of these two valuations is the fair value of the loan receivable balance of 1,250,000. At 31 July 2022, the Company had advanced 1,250,000 (2021 - 1,250,000) and accrued interest income of 72,000 (2021 - 72,000) for the year ended 31 July 2022. As of 31 July 2022, total interest receivable was 222,000 (2021 - 150,000). The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model are as follows: (i) equity price of 28,571 calculated as BAM s portion of the future projected profits, on a per unit basis, discounted using Weighted Average Cost of Capital of 27.5 ; (ii) exercise price of 31,250 per unit as there are 40 units in total, (iii) volatility of 90 using BAM as benchmark, and (iv) risk-free rate of 2.92 .

Since we acquired NMG, raised equity capital and have been generative revenues from the sale of our products, we have been compensating our NEOs at levels comparable to executive officers of companies within its industry at similar stages of growth. Our Compensation Committee reviews and recommends to our Board of Directors the salaries, and benefits of all employees, consultants, directors and other individuals compensated by us. The Board of Directors assumes responsibility for reviewing the recommendations of the Compensation Committee and monitoring the long-range compensation strategy for our senior management. The Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors reviews the compensation of senior management on a semi-annual basis taking into account compensation paid by other issuers of similar size and activity. The Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors receives independent competitive market information on compensation levels for executives. It uses salary data of comparable private and public companies as a benchmark for setting executive compensation. This data is obtained from various sources including online research and market surveys. Although permitted, at this time no NEO or director has or intends to purchase financial instruments that are designed to hedge or offset a decrease in market value of equity securities granted as compensation or held, directly or indirectly, by the NEO or director. Elements of the Compensation Program The total compensation plan for NEOs consists of a base compensation structure and equity-based compensation program in the form of stock options. The compensation program for our senior management is designed with a view that the level and form of compensation achieves certain objectives, including: (a) attracting and retaining qualified executives; (b) motivating the short and long-term performance of these executives; and (c) better aligning their interests with those of the Company s shareholders. In compensating our senior management, we have arranged for equity participation through our 2012 Incentive Stock Option Plan. Base Salary The base salary component of NEO compensation is intended to provide a fixed level of competitive pay that reflects each NEO s primary duties and responsibilities. The policy of Body and Mind is that salaries for its NEOs are competitive within its industry and generally set at the median salary level among entities its size. Stock Options Effective October 25, 2012, our Board adopted the 2012 Incentive Stock Option Plan (the 2012 Incentive Stock Option Plan ). The purpose of the 2012 Incentive Stock Option Plan is to enhance the long-term shareholder value by offering opportunities to our directors, executive officers, key employees and eligible consultants to acquire our Common Shares in order to give these persons the opportunity to participate in our growth and success, and to encourage them to remain in the service of the Company. Previous grants will be taken into account when considering new grants and a maximum of 10 of the number of our issued and outstanding Common Shares are available for issuance under the 2012 Incentive Stock Option Plan. There are currently 7,553,000 stock options issued under the 2012 Incentive Stock Option Plan. 60 Table of Contents Compensation Governance Our Compensation Committee is responsible for recommending to our Board of Directors the compensation to be paid to our directors and executive officers.

The adverse termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or a plea of no-lo contendere or its equivalent, shall not of itself create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner in which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. (b) The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a Director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation; provided, however, that no indemnification shall be made in respect to any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of his duty to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all circumstances of the case, such person is firmly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which such court shall deem proper. (c) To the extent that a Director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in subsections (a) and (b), or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith. (d) Any indemnification under subsections (a) or (b) (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in subsections (a) or (b). Such determination shall be made: (1) By the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (2) If such a quorum is not obtainable, or even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested Directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or Page 14 of 17 pages, plus History of Bylaws (3) By the stockholders by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of stockholders who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding. (e) Expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding as authorized in the manner provided in subsection (d) upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Director, officer, employee or agent to repay such amount, unless it shall ultimately be determined that he is entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this section. Section 2. Other Indemnification. The indemnification provided by these Articles shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those indemnified may be entitled under any Bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested Directors, or otherwise, both as to actions in his official capacity and as to actions in another capacity while holding such position and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
