Trust Co. are collectively referred to herein as U.S. Bank. ). Upon U.S. Bank Trust Co. s succession to the business of U.S. Bank N.A., it became a wholly owned subsidiary of U.S. Bank N.A. The Indenture Trustee will maintain the

 U.S. Bank N.A. and other large financial institutions have been sued in their capacity as trustee or successor trustee for certain residential
mortgage-backed securities RMBS trusts. The complaints, primarily filed by investors or investor groups against U.S. Bank N.A. and similar institutions, allege the trustees caused losses to investors as a result of alleged failures by
the sponsors, mortgage loan sellers and servicers to comply with the governing agreements for these RMBS trusts. Plaintiffs generally assert causes of action based upon the 
 3 

trustees purported failures to enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for alleged breaches of representations and warranties, notify securityholders of purported events of
default allegedly caused by breaches of servicing standards by mortgage loan servicers and abide by a heightened standard of care following alleged events of default. 
 U.S. Bank N.A. denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions were
not the cause of losses to investors, that it has meritorious defenses, and it has contested and intends to continue contesting the plaintiffs claims vigorously. However, U.S. Bank N.A. cannot assure you as to the outcome of any of the
litigation, or the possible impact of these litigations on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. On March 9, 2018, a law firm purporting
to represent fifteen Delaware statutory trusts (the DSTs that issued securities backed by student loans (the Student Loans filed a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery against U.S. Bank N.A. in its capacities as
indenture trustee and successor special servicer, and three other institutions in their respective transaction capacities, with respect to the DSTs and the Student Loans. This lawsuit is captioned The National Collegiate Student Loan Master Trust
I, et al. v. U.S. Bank National Association, et al. , C.A. No. 2018-0167-JRS (Del. Ch.) (the NCMSLT Action ). The complaint, as amended on June 15, 2018, alleged that the DSTs have been
harmed as a result of purported misconduct or omissions by the defendants concerning administration of the trusts and special servicing of the Student Loans. Since the filing of the NCMSLT Action, certain Student Loan borrowers have made assertions
against U.S. Bank N.A. concerning special servicing that appear to be based on certain allegations made on behalf of the DSTs in the NCMSLT Action. 
 U.S. Bank N.A. has filed a motion seeking dismissal of the operative complaint in its entirety with prejudice pursuant to Chancery Court Rules
12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) or, in the alternative, a stay of the case while other prior filed disputes involving the DSTs and the Student Loans are litigated. On November 7, 2018, the Court ruled that the case should be stayed in its entirety
pending resolution of the first-filed cases. On January 21, 2020, the Court entered an order consolidating for pretrial purposes the NCMSLT Action and three other lawsuits pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery concerning the DSTs and the
Student Loans, which remains pending. U.S. Bank N.A. denies liability in the NCMSLT Action and believes it has performed its obligations
as indenture trustee and special servicer in good faith and in compliance in all material respects with the terms of the agreements governing the DSTs and that it has meritorious defenses. It has contested and intends to continue contesting the
plaintiffs claims vigorously. PART II

Exhibit 33.2 
 Management s Assertion on 
 Compliance with Regulation AB Criteria 
 Discover Products Inc. DPI or the Asserting Party is responsible for assessing its compliance, as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2022 (the Reporting Period ), with the servicing criteria applicable to it in connection with the Second Amended and Restated Master Services Agreement, among Discover Financial Services, Discover Bank, DPI
and other affiliated entities thereto, dated as of March 15, 2018, as supplemented by the Fourth Amended and Restated Services Addendum, between DPI and Discover Bank, dated as of November 1, 2019. The Asserting Party used the criteria set
forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB, excluding the criteria set forth in Items 1122 (d)(1)(i), (d)(1)(iii), (d)(1)(iv), (d)(2)(ii), (d)(2)(iii), (d)(2)(iv), (d)(2)(v), (d)(2)(vi), (d)(2)(vii), (d)(3)(i), (d)(3)(ii), (d)(3)(iii),
(d)(3)(iv), (d)(4)(i), (d)(4)(ii), (d)(4)(iii), (d)(4)(v), (d)(4)(x), (d)(4)(xi), (d)(4)(xii), (d)(4)(xiii), and (d)(4)(xv) of Regulation AB, which the Asserting Party has concluded are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to
the asset-backed securities transactions covered by this report (such applicable criteria, after giving effect to the exclusions identified above, the Applicable Servicing Criteria ), to assess such compliance. The transactions covered by
this report include all asset-backed securities transactions involving credit card receivables conducted by Discover Card Master Trust I and Discover Card Execution Note Trust that were registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant
to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or were not required to be registered where the related asset-backed securities were outstanding during the Reporting Period (the Platform ), as listed in Appendix A. 
 With respect to servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(v), 1122(d)(2)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(iv) for the Reporting Period defined above, the Asserting Party
has engaged vendors to perform certain limited payment activities required by these servicing criteria. With respect to servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(v), 1122(d)(4)(vii) and 1122(d)(4)(viii) for the Reporting Period defined above, the Asserting
Party has engaged vendors to perform the collection activities required by these servicing criteria for a limited number of accounts that were delegated to such vendors. The Asserting Party has determined that none of these vendors engaged for
either payment or collection activities is a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Asserting Party has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor
as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06 (formerly SEC Manual Telephone Interpretation 17.06). The Asserting Party has policies and procedures
in place to provide reasonable assurance that each vendor s activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to such vendor. 

DPI has assessed its compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Reporting
Period and has concluded that the Asserting Party has complied, in all material respects, with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Reporting Period with respect to the Platform taken as a whole. 
 Deloitte Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report for the Platform on the
assessment of compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Reporting Period as set forth in this assertion.

the activities performed by the Bank with respect to the Platform. Appendix A to management s assertion identifies the individual asset-backed transactions defined by management as constituting the Platform. Management is responsible for the
Bank s compliance with the servicing criteria and its assertion. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Bank s compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with
attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about compliance
with the servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all material respects, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Bank s compliance with the servicing criteria, including tests on a sample basis of the servicing
activities related to the Platform, determining whether the Bank performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria during the specified period, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. Our procedures were limited to selected servicing activities performed by the Bank during the period covered by this report and, accordingly, such samples may not have included servicing activities related to each asset-backed
transaction included in the Platform. Further, an examination is not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to the period specified above that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or
reported by the Bank during the period covered by this report. We believe that the evidence we obtained in our examination is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 
 In our opinion, management s assertion that the Bank complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31,
2022, for the Discover Card Master Trust I and Discover Card Execution Note Trust Asset-Backed Securities Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.

 We have examined management of Discover Products Inc. s assertion, included in the accompanying Management s Assertion on Compliance with Regulation

are not applicable to the activities performed by DPI with respect to the Platform. Appendix A to management s assertion identifies the individual asset-backed transactions defined by management as constituting the Platform. Management is
responsible for DPI s compliance with the servicing criteria and its assertion. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about DPI s compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with
attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about compliance
with the servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all material respects, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about DPI s compliance with the servicing criteria, including tests on a sample basis of the servicing
activities related to the Platform, determining whether DPI performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria during the specified period, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. Our procedures were limited to selected servicing activities performed by DPI during the period covered by this report and, accordingly, such samples may not have included servicing activities related to each asset-backed transaction
included in the Platform. Further, an examination is not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to the period specified above that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by DPI
during the period covered by this report. We believe that the evidence we obtained in our examination is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 As described in management s assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(v), 1122(d)(2)(i), 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(vii) and 1122(d)(4)(viii), DPI
has engaged vendors to perform certain activities required by these servicing criteria. DPI has determined that none of these vendors are considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and DPI has elected to take
responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to these vendors as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06 ). As
permitted by C DI 200.06, DPI has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to these
vendors. DPI is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to DPI s
determination of its eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 

Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing
criteria. In our opinion, management s assertion that DPI complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2022 for the Discover Card Master Trust I and Discover Card Execution Note Trust Asset-Backed Securities Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 The Board of Directors U.S. Bank National Association 
 We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Report on Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, that U.S.
Bank National Association and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association (collectively, the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the
U.S. Bank Corporate Trust Asset-Backed Securities Platform (the Platform ), for which the Company provides trustee, securities administration, registrar and paying agent services, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022,
except for servicing criteria Items 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(4)(i)-(ii), and 1122(d)(4)(iv)-(xiv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the servicing platform covered by this
report. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria based on
our examination. Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than all of the individual asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities
related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected
transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected
the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. Although the Company is responsible for assessing compliance with Items 1122(d)(1)(ii),
1122(d)(1)(v), and 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB, there were no servicing activities performed by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2022 that required these servicing criteria to be complied with. We believe that the evidence we
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. We are required to be independent of the Company and to meet our
other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements related to our examination engagement. Our examination does not
provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company
complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, for the U.S. Bank Corporate Trust Asset-Backed Securities Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.
