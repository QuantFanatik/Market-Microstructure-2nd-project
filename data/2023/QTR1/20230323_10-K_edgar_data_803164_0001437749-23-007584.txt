PART I 

Item 1. 
 Business 

General 
 ChoiceOne is a financial holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended BHC Act ). The Company was incorporated on February 24, 1986, as a Michigan corporation. The Company was formed to create a bank holding company for the purpose of acquiring all of the capital stock of ChoiceOne Bank, which became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company on April 6, 1987. Effective November 1, 2006, the Company merged with Valley Ridge Financial Corp., a one-bank holding company for Valley Ridge Bank VRB ). In December 2006, VRB was consolidated into ChoiceOne Bank. Effective October 1, 2019, County Bank Corp. ("County"), a one-bank holding company for Lakestone Bank Trust Lakestone ), merged with and into the Company. Lakestone was consolidated into ChoiceOne Bank in May 2020. On July 1, 2020, Community Shores Bank Corporation ("Community Shores"), a one bank holding company for Community Shores Bank, merged with and into the Company. Community Shores Bank was consolidated into ChoiceOne Bank in October 2020. ChoiceOne Bank owns all of the outstanding common stock of ChoiceOne Insurance Agencies, Inc., an independent insurance agency headquartered in Sparta, Michigan (the "Insurance Agency"). 
 
 The Company's business is primarily concentrated in a single industry segment, banking. ChoiceOne Bank (referred to as the Bank is a full-service banking institution that offers a variety of deposit, payment, credit and other financial services to all types of customers. These services include time, savings, and demand deposits, safe deposit services, and automated transaction machine services. Loans, both commercial and consumer, are extended primarily on a secured basis to corporations, partnerships and individuals. Commercial lending covers such categories as business, industry, agricultural, construction, inventory and real estate. The Bank s consumer loan departments make direct and indirect loans to consumers and purchasers of residential and real property. In addition, the Bank offers trust and wealth management services. No material part of the business of the Company or the Bank is dependent upon a single customer or very few customers, the loss of which would have a materially adverse effect on the Company. 
 
 The Bank s primary market areas lie within Kent, Muskegon, Newaygo, and Ottawa counties in western Michigan, and Lapeer, Macomb, and St. Clair counties in southeastern Michigan in the communities where the Bank's respective offices are located. The Bank serves these markets through 31 full-service offices and five loan production offices. The Company and the Bank have no foreign assets or income. 
 
 At December 31, 2022 , the Company had consolidated total assets of 2.4 billion, net loans of 1.2 billion, total deposits of 2.1 billion and total shareholders' equity of 168.9 million. For the year ended December 31, 2022 , the Company recognized consolidated net income of 23.6 million. The principal source of revenue for the Company and the Bank is interest and fees on loans. On a consolidated basis, interest and fees on loans accounted for 59 , 58 , and 60 of total revenues in 2022, 2021, and 2020 , respectively. Interest on securities accounted for 24 , 19 , and 11 of total revenues in 2022, 2021, and 2020 , respectively. For more information about the Company's financial condition and results of operations, see the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this report. 
 
 Competition 
 The Bank s competition primarily comes from other financial institutions located within Kent, Muskegon, Newaygo, and Ottawa counties in western Michigan and Lapeer, Macomb, and St. Clair counties in southeastern Michigan. There are a number of larger commercial banks within the Bank s primary market areas. The Bank also competes with a large number of other financial institutions, such as savings and loan associations, insurance companies, consumer finance companies, credit unions, internet banks and other financial technology companies, and commercial finance and leasing companies for deposits, loans and service business. Money market mutual funds, brokerage houses and nonfinancial institutions provide many of the financial services offered by the Bank. Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources than the Bank. The principal methods of competition for financial services are price (the rates of interest charged for loans, the rates of interest paid for deposits and the fees charged for services) and the convenience and quality of services rendered to customers.

Supervision and Regulation 
 Banks and bank holding companies are extensively regulated. The Company is subject to supervision and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve Board ). The Company's activities are generally limited to owning or controlling banks and engaging in such other activities as the Federal Reserve Board may determine to be closely related to banking. Prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board, and in some cases various other government agencies, is required for the Company to acquire control of any additional bank holding companies, banks or other operating subsidiaries. Under Federal Reserve Board policy, the Company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to the Bank and to commit resources to support it. 
 
 The Bank is chartered under state law and is subject to regulation by the Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services DIFS ). State banking laws place restrictions on various aspects of banking, including permitted activities, loan interest rates, branching, payment of dividends and capital and surplus requirements. The Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System and is also subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve Board. The Bank s deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC to the maximum extent provided by law. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank system, which provides certain advantages to the Bank, including favorable borrowing rates for certain funds. 
 
 The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. The Company's primary source of funds available to pay dividends to shareholders is dividends paid to it by the Bank. There are legal limitations on the extent to which the Bank can lend or otherwise supply funds to the Company. In addition, payment of dividends to the Company by the Bank is subject to various state and federal regulatory limitations. 
 
 The Deposit Insurance Funds Act of 1996 authorized the Financing Corporation FICO to impose periodic assessments on all depository institutions. The purpose of these periodic assessments is to spread the cost of the interest payments on the outstanding FICO bonds issued to recapitalize the Savings Association Insurance Fund SAIF over a larger number of institutions. 
 
 The federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines to promote the safety and soundness of federally-insured depository institutions. These guidelines establish standards for, among other things, internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, asset quality and earnings. 
 
 The Company and the Bank are subject to regulatory risk-based capital guidelines. Failure to meet these capital guidelines could subject the Company or the Bank to a variety of enforcement remedies, including issuance of a capital directive, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, a prohibition on accepting brokered deposits, and other restrictions on its business. In addition, the Bank would generally not receive regulatory approval of any application that requires the consideration of capital adequacy, such as a branch or merger application, unless it could demonstrate a reasonable plan to meet the capital requirement within a reasonable period of time. 
 
 Under Federal Reserve Board policy, the Company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to the Bank and to commit resources to support the Bank. In addition, if DIFS deems the Bank's capital to be impaired, DIFS may require the Bank to restore its capital by a special assessment on the Company as the Bank's sole shareholder. If the Company fails to pay any assessment, the Company s directors will be required, under Michigan law, to sell the shares of the Bank's stock owned by the Company to the highest bidder at either a public or private auction and use the proceeds of the sale to restore the Bank's capital.

Table of Contents 

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act FDICIA requires, among other things, federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA sets forth the following five capital categories: well-capitalized, adequately-capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly-undercapitalized and critically-undercapitalized. A depository institution's capital category will depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures as established by regulation, which include a common equity Tier I risk-based capital ratio, Tier 1 risk-based and total risk-based capital ratio measures and a leverage capital ratio measure. In addition, a capital conservation buffer is required. Under certain circumstances, the appropriate banking agency may treat a well-capitalized, adequately-capitalized, or undercapitalized institution as if the institution were in the next lower capital category. 
 
 Federal banking regulators are required to take specified mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions in the three undercapitalized categories. The severity of the action depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed. Subject to a narrow exception, the banking regulator must generally appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized. An institution in any of the undercapitalized categories is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking agency. An undercapitalized institution is also generally prohibited from paying any dividends, increasing its average total assets, making acquisitions, establishing any branches, accepting or renewing any brokered deposits or engaging in any new line of business, except under an accepted capital restoration plan or with FDIC approval. 
 
 Banks are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, which have a material impact on their business. These include, among others, minimum capital requirements, state usury laws, state laws relating to fiduciaries, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Community Reinvestment Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, regulations of the Office of Foreign Assets Controls, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, electronic funds transfer laws, redlining laws, predatory lending laws, antitrust laws, environmental laws, money laundering laws and privacy laws. The monetary policy of the Federal Reserve Board may influence the growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits, and may also affect interest rates on loans and deposits. These policies may have a significant effect on the operating results of banks. 
 
 In general, the BHC Act limits the business of bank holding companies to banking, managing or controlling banks and other activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be closely related to the business of banking. In addition, bank holding companies that qualify and elect to be financial holding companies may engage in any activities that are financial in nature or complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system without prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. Activities that are financial in nature include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments. The Company has elected to be a financial holding company. 
 
 In order for the Company to maintain financial holding company status, the Bank must be categorized as "well-capitalized" and "well-managed" under applicable regulatory guidelines. If the Company or the Bank ceases to meet these requirements, the Federal Reserve Board may impose corrective capital and/or managerial requirements and place limitations on the Company s ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies. In addition, if the deficiencies persist, the Federal Reserve Board may require the Company to divest of the Bank. The Bank was categorized as "well-capitalized" and "well-managed" as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 Bank holding companies may acquire banks and other bank holding companies located in any state in the United States without regard to geographic restrictions or reciprocity requirements imposed by state banking law. Banks may also establish interstate branch networks through acquisitions of and mergers with other banks. The establishment of de novo interstate branches or the acquisition of individual branches of a bank in another state (rather than the acquisition of an out-of-state bank in its entirety) is allowed only if specifically authorized by state law.

Table of Contents 

Michigan banking laws do not significantly restrict interstate banking. The Michigan Banking Code permits, in appropriate circumstances and with the approval of DIFS, (1) acquisition of Michigan banks by FDIC-insured banks, savings banks or savings and loan associations located in other states, (2) sale by a Michigan bank of branches to an FDIC-insured bank, savings bank or savings and loan association located in a state in which a Michigan bank could purchase branches of the purchasing entity, (3) consolidation of Michigan banks and FDIC-insured banks, savings banks or savings and loan associations located in other states having laws permitting such consolidation, (4) establishment of branches in Michigan by FDIC-insured banks located in other states, the District of Columbia or U.S. territories or protectorates having laws permitting a Michigan bank to establish a branch in such jurisdiction, and (5) establishment by foreign banks of branches located in Michigan. 
 
 Banks are subject to the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA"). Under the terms of the CRA, the appropriate federal bank regulatory agency is required, in connection with its examination of a bank, to assess the bank's record in meeting the credit needs of the community served by that bank, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the institution. Under the CRA, institutions are assigned a rating of "outstanding," "satisfactory," "needs to improve," or "substantial non-compliance." The regulatory agency's assessment of the bank's record is made available to the public. Further, a bank's federal regulatory agency is required to assess the CRA compliance record of any bank that has applied to establish a new branch office that will accept deposits, relocate an office, or merge or consolidate with, or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of, a federally regulated financial institution. In the case of a bank holding company applying for approval to acquire a bank or another bank holding company, the Federal Reserve Board will assess the CRA compliance record of each subsidiary bank of the applicant bank holding company, and such compliance records may be the basis for denying the application. Upon receiving notice that a subsidiary bank is rated less than "satisfactory," a financial holding company will be prohibited from additional activities that are permitted to be conducted by a financial holding company and from acquiring any company engaged in such activities. The CRA rating of the Bank was "Satisfactory" as of its most recent examination. 
 
 Effects of Compliance With Environmental Regulations 
 The nature of the business of the Bank is such that it holds title, on a temporary or permanent basis, to a number of parcels of real property. These include properties owned for branch offices and other business purposes as well as properties taken in or in lieu of foreclosure to satisfy loans in default. Under current state and federal laws, present and past owners of real property may be exposed to liability for the cost of cleanup of environmental contamination on or originating from those properties, even if they are wholly innocent of the actions that caused the contamination. These liabilities can be material and can exceed the value of the contaminated property. Management is not presently aware of any instances where compliance with these provisions will have a material effect on the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the Company or the Bank, or where compliance with these provisions will adversely affect a borrower's ability to comply with the terms of loan contracts. 
 
 Employees 
 As of February 28, 2023, the Company, on a consolidated basis, e mp loyed 402 employees, of which 332 we re full -time employees. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining group. Management considers its employee relations to be good.

Loan maturities are classified according to the contractual maturity date or the anticipated amortization period, whichever is appropriate. The anticipated amortization period is used in the case of loans where a balloon payment is due before the end of the loan s normal amortization period. At the time the balloon payment is due, the loan can either be rewritten or payment in full can be requested. The decision regarding whether the loan will be rewritten or a payment in full will be requested will be based upon the loan s payment history, the borrower s current financial condition, and other relevant factors.

Additions to the allowance for loan losses charged to operations during the periods shown were based on management s judgment after considering factors such as loan loss experience, evaluation of the loan portfolio, and prevailing and anticipated economic conditions. There were no material changes to the factors considered since the prior year. The evaluation of the loan portfolio is based upon various risk factors such as the financial condition of the borrower, the value of collateral and other considerations, which, in the opinion of management, deserve current recognition in estimating loan losses. Note that NA means there are no non-accrual loans in the designated loan category.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 The Company is subject to many risks and uncertainties. Although the Company seeks ways to manage these risks and develop programs to control risks to the extent that management can control them, the Company cannot predict the future. Actual results may differ materially from management s expectations. Some of these significant risks and uncertainties are discussed below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties of which the Company is unaware, or that it currently does not consider to be material, also may become important factors that affect the Company and its business. If any of these risks were to occur, the Company s business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 Risks Related to the Company s Business 
 
 Asset quality could be less favorable than expected. 
 
 A significant source of risk for the Company arises from the possibility that losses will be sustained because borrowers, guarantors and related parties may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loan agreements. Most loans originated by the Company are secured, but some loans are unsecured depending on the nature of the loan. With respect to secured loans, the collateral securing the repayment of these loans includes a wide variety of real and personal property that may be insufficient to cover the obligations owed under such loans. Collateral values may be adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic, environmental and other conditions, including declines in the value of real estate, changes in interest rates, changes in monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government, terrorist activity, environmental contamination, public health crisis, and other external events. 
 
 The Company s allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses. 
 
 The risk of nonpayment of loans is inherent in all lending activities and nonpayment of loans may have a material adverse effect on the Company s earnings and overall financial condition, and the value of its common stock. The Company makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of its loan portfolio and provides an allowance for potential losses based on a number of factors. If its assumptions are wrong, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses, which could have an adverse effect on the Company s operating results and may cause it to increase the allowance in the future. The actual amount of future provisions for loan losses cannot now be determined and may exceed the amounts of past provisions for loan losses. Federal and state banking regulators, as an integral part of their supervisory function, periodically review the allowance for loan losses. These regulatory agencies may require the Company to increase its provision for loan losses or to recognize further loan charge-offs based upon their judgments, which may be different from the Company s judgments. Any increase in the allowance for loan losses could have a negative effect on the Company s regulatory capital ratios, net income, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, a large portion of the loan portfolio was marked to fair value as part of the mergers with County and Community Shores and does not carry an allowance as management determined no credit deterioration had occurred since the effective date of the merger. 
 
 ChoiceOne adopted ASU 2016-13 current expected credit loss ("CECL") on January 1, 2023. CECL changes the allowance for loan losses methodology from an incurred loss impairment methodology to an expected loss methodology, which is more dependent on future economic forecasts and models than previous accounting standards and could result in increases in, and add volatility to, our allowance for loan losses and future provisions for loan losses. These forecasts and models are inherently uncertain and are based upon management's reasonable judgment in light of information currently available. We believe the adoption of CECL as of January 1, 2023 will result in an estimated increase in our current allowance for loan losses of between 6.5 million and 7.0 million. If we misinterpret or make inaccurate assumptions under the new guidance, we may need to make significant and unanticipated changes in our allowance for loan losses in the future, and our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected.

General economic conditions in the state of Michigan could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations or financial condition. 
 
 The Company is affected by general economic conditions in the United States, although most directly within Michigan. An economic downturn within Michigan caused by inflation, recession or a recessionary environment, unemployment, changes in financial or capital markets or other factors, could negatively impact household and corporate incomes. This impact may lead to decreased demand for both loan and deposit products and increase the number of customers who fail to pay interest or principal on their loans. 
 
 The Company could be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions, including defaults by larger financial institutions. 
 
 The Company's ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of credit, trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships between financial institutions. The Company has exposure to multiple counterparties, and it routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial industry. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses or defaults by the Company or by other institutions. This is sometimes referred to as "systemic risk" and may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms and exchanges, with which the Company interacts on a daily basis, and therefore could adversely affect the Company. 
 
 If the Company does not adjust to changes in the financial services industry, its financial performance may suffer. 
 
 The Company s ability to maintain its financial performance and return on investment to shareholders will depend in part on its ability to maintain and grow its core deposit customer base and expand its financial services to its existing customers. In addition to other banks, competitors include credit unions, securities dealers, brokers, mortgage bankers, investment advisors, internet banks and other financial technology companies, and finance and insurance companies. The increasingly competitive environment is, in part, a result of changes in the economic environment within the state of Michigan, regulation, changes in technology and product delivery systems and consolidation among financial service providers. New competitors may emerge to increase the degree of competition for the Company s customers and services. Financial services and products are also constantly changing. The Company s financial performance will also depend in part upon customer demand for the Company s products and services and the Company s ability to develop and offer competitive financial products and services. 
 
 We are subject to significant government regulation, and any regulatory changes may adversely affect us. 
 
 We are subject to extensive government regulation under both federal and state law. We are subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the DIFS, in addition to other regulatory and self-regulatory organizations. Current laws and applicable regulations are subject to change and any new regulatory change could make compliance more expensive, difficult, or otherwise adversely affect our business. Specifically, regulation changes to overdraft fees could adversely affect our business. We cannot predict the ultimate effect of any changes to regulations affecting us, but such changes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition. 
 
 Changes in interest rates could reduce the Company's income and cash flow. 
 
 The Company s income and cash flow depends, to a great extent, on the difference between the interest earned on loans and securities, and the interest paid on deposits and other borrowings. Market interest rates are beyond the Company s control, and they fluctuate in response to general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies including, in particular, the Federal Reserve Board. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates and interest rate relationships, will influence the origination of loans, the purchase of investments, the generation of deposits and the rate received on loans and securities and paid on deposits and other borrowings. 
 
 Interest rates on our outstanding financial instruments might be subject to change based on regulatory developments, which could adversely affect our revenue, expenses, and the value of those financial instruments . 
 
 On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom s Financial Conduct Authority FCA ), which regulates LIBOR, publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. In November 2020, the FCA announced that it would continue to publish LIBOR rates through June 30, 2023. It is unclear whether, or in what form, LIBOR will continue to exist after that date. Any uncertainty regarding the continued use and reliability of LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate could adversely affect the value of our floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, as well as the revenue and expenses associated with those financial instruments. While, at this time, it appears that consensus is growing around using the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR as an alternative to LIBOR, it remains to be determined whether this will ultimately be the case and what the impact of a possible transition to SOFR or other alternative reference rates may have on our business, financial results and results of operations. We could become subject to litigation and other types of disputes as a consequence of the transition from LIBOR to SOFR or another alternative reference rate, which could subject us to increased legal expenses, monetary damages and reputational harm. 
 
 The Company is subject to liquidity risk in its operations, which could adversely affect its ability to fund various obligations. 
 
 Liquidity risk is the possibility of being unable to meet obligations as they come due or capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding on a timely basis, at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances. Liquidity is required to fund various obligations, including credit obligations to borrowers, loan originations, withdrawals by depositors, repayment of debt, dividends to shareholders, operating expenses and capital expenditures. Liquidity is derived primarily from retail deposit growth and earnings retention, principal and interest payments on loans and investment securities, net cash provided from operations and access to other funding. If the Company is unable to maintain adequate liquidity, then its business, financial condition and results of operations would be negatively affected. 
 
 If the Company were required to sell investment securities in an unrealized loss position to meet liquidity needs and realize losses, that could have a material adverse impact on its results of operation and financial condition. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, the Company had 161.0 million in unrealized losses on its investment securities, including 89.0 million in unrealized losses on available for sale securities and 72.0 in unrealized losses on held to maturity securities. If the Company were required to sell investment securities in an unrealized loss position to meet liquidity needs and realize losses, that could have a material adverse impact on its results of operations and financial condition, including a negative impact on net income and a permanent reduction in equity capital.

The Company has significant exposure to risks associated with commercial and residential real estate. 
 
 A substantial portion of the Company s loan portfolio consists of commercial and residential real estate-related loans, including real estate development, construction and residential and commercial mortgage loans. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately 645.7 million of commercial and construction real estate loans outstanding, which represented approximately 54.3 of its loan portfolio. As of that same date, the Company had approximately 229.9 million in residential real estate loans outstanding, or approximately 19.3 of its loan portfolio. Consequently, real estate-related credit risks are a significant concern for the Company. The adverse consequences from real estate-related credit risks tend to be cyclical and are often driven by national economic developments that are not controllable or entirely foreseeable by the Company or its borrowers. 
 
 Commercial loans may expose the Company to greater financial and credit risk than other loans. 
 
 The Company s commercial and industrial loan portfolio, including commercial mortgages, was approximately 210.2 million at December 31, 2022, comprising approximately 17.7 of its total loan portfolio. Commercial loans generally carry larger loan balances and can involve a greater degree of financial and credit risk than other loans. Any significant failure to pay on time by the Company s customers would hurt the Company s earnings. The increased financial and credit risk associated with these types of loans are a result of several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the size of loan balances, the effects of general economic conditions on income-producing properties and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans. 
 
 Legislative or regulatory changes or actions could adversely impact the Company or the businesses in which it is engaged. 
 
 The Company and the Bank are subject to extensive state and federal regulation, supervision and legislation that govern almost all aspects of their operations. Laws and regulations may change from time to time and are primarily intended for the protection of consumers, depositors and the deposit insurance fund, and not to benefit the Company's shareholders. The impact of any changes to laws and regulations or other actions by regulatory agencies may negatively impact the Company or its ability to increase the value of its business. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution, the classification of assets by the institution and the adequacy of an institution's allowance for loan losses. Future regulatory changes or accounting pronouncements may increase the Company's regulatory capital requirements or adversely affect its regulatory capital levels. Additionally, actions by regulatory agencies against the Company or the Bank could require the Company to devote significant time and resources to defending its business and may lead to penalties that materially affect the Company. 
 
 The Company relies heavily on its management and other key personnel, and the loss of any of them may adversely affect its operations. 
 
 The Company is and will continue to be dependent upon the services of its management team and other key personnel. Losing the services of one or more key members of the Company s management team could adversely affect its operations. 
 
 The Company s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented. 
 
 Management regularly reviews and updates the Company s internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. If the Company fails to identify and remediate control deficiencies, it is possible that a material misstatement of interim or annual financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In addition, any failure or circumvention of the Company s other controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 The Company may be a defendant in a variety of litigation and other actions, which may have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 The Company and the Bank are regularly involved in a variety of litigation arising out of the normal course of business. The Company's insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against it, and any claims asserted against it, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm its reputation or cause the Company to incur unexpected expenses, which could be material in amount. Should the ultimate expenses, judgments or settlements in any litigation exceed the Company's insurance coverage, they could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Company may not be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future, nor may it be able to obtain adequate replacement policies with acceptable terms, if at all. 
 
 If the Company cannot raise additional capital when needed, its ability to further expand its operations through organic growth or acquisitions could be materially impaired. 
 
 The Company is required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain specified levels of capital to support its operations. The Company may need to raise additional capital to support its current level of assets or its growth. The Company s ability to raise additional capital will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside its control, and on its financial performance. The Company cannot assure that it will be able to raise additional capital in the future on terms acceptable to it or at all. If the Company cannot raise additional capital when needed, its ability to maintain its current level of assets or to expand its operations through organic growth or acquisitions could be materially limited. 
 
 Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or customer information, whether through a breach of computer systems or otherwise, could severely harm the Company's business. 
 
 As part of its business, the Company collects, processes and retains sensitive and confidential client and customer information on behalf of itself and other third parties. Despite the security measures the Company has in place for its facilities and systems, and the security measures of its third party service providers, the Company may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer information, whether by the Company or by its vendors, could severely damage the Company's reputation, expose it to the risks of litigation and liability, disrupt the Company's operations and have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.

The Company's information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security. 
 
 The Company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business and deliver its products. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in the Company's customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. While the Company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of its information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches of the Company's information systems or its customers' information or computer systems would not damage the Company's reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject the Company to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose the Company to civil litigation and financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations. 
 
 Global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology (IT) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company and/or its third party service providers. Although we employ comprehensive measures to prevent, detect, address and mitigate these threats (including access controls, employee training, data encryption, vulnerability assessments, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems), cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include reputational damage, litigation with third parties and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could materially adversely affect our results of operations. 
 
 Employee misconduct could adversely impact our reputation and results of operations. 
 
 Our reputation is crucial to maintaining and developing relationships with our customers. There is a risk our employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. For example, if an employee were to engage (or be accused of engaging) in fraudulent, illegal, or suspicious activities, including fraud or theft, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions or penalties, or litigation, and suffer significant harm to our reputation, financial position, and customer relationships as a result. Additionally, our business often requires that we deal with sensitive customer information. If our employees were to improperly use or disclose this information, even inadvertently, we could suffer significant harm to our reputation, financial position and current and future business relationships. We may not be able to deter all employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this misconduct may not be effective in all circumstances. Misconduct or harassment by our employees (or unsubstantiated allegations of the same), or improper use or disclosure of confidential information by our employees, even inadvertently, could result in a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, or results of operations. 
 
 Environmental liability associated with commercial lending could result in losses. 
 
 In the course of its business, the Company may acquire, through foreclosure, properties securing loans it has originated or purchased that are in default. Particularly in commercial real estate lending, there is a risk that hazardous substances could be discovered on these properties. In this event, the Company might be required to remove these substances from the affected properties at the Company's sole cost and expense. The cost of this removal could substantially exceed the value of affected properties. The Company may not have adequate remedies against the prior owner or other responsible parties and could find it difficult or impossible to sell the affected properties. These events could have an adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 The Company depends upon the accuracy and completeness of information about customers. 
 
 In deciding whether to extend credit to customers, the Company relies on information provided to it by its customers, including financial statements and other financial information. The Company may also rely on representations of customers as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and on reports of independent auditors on financial statements. The Company's financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted to the extent that the Company extends credit in reliance on financial statements that do not comply with generally accepted accounting principles or that are misleading or other information provided by customers that is false or misleading. 
 
 Our reliance on third party vendors could cause operational losses or business interruptions. 
 
 We rely on third party service providers for certain components of our business activity. If these third party service providers experience difficulties or terminate their services and we are unable to replace them with other service providers, our operations could be interrupted. Even if we are able to replace them with another service provider, the replacement may be more expensive or offer an inferior service. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 The Company operates in a highly competitive industry and market area. 
 
 The Company faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have more financial resources. Such competitors primarily include national and regional banks within the various markets where the Company operates, as well as internet banks and other financial technology companies. The Company also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions, including savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies and other financial intermediaries. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Banks, securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking. The Company competes with these institutions both in attracting deposits and in making new loans. Technology has lowered barriers to entry into the market and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Many of the Company's competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures, such as credit unions that are not subject to federal income tax. Due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than the Company can.

Severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, public health crisis, and other external events could significantly impact the Company's business. 
 
 Severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, risks posed by an outbreak of a widespread epidemic or pandemic of disease (or widespread fear thereof) or other public health crisis, and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on the Company's ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the stability of the Company's deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause the Company to incur additional expenses. 
 
 The Company relies on dividends from the Bank for most of its revenue. 
 
 The Company is a separate and distinct legal entity from the Bank. It receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from the Bank. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay cash dividends on the Company's common stock. Various federal and/or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay to the Company. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Company, the Company may not be able to pay cash dividends on its common stock. The earnings of the Bank have been the principal source of funds to pay cash dividends to shareholders. Over the long-term, cash dividends to shareholders are dependent upon earnings, as well as capital requirements, regulatory restraints and other factors affecting the Company and the Bank. 
 
 Additional risks and uncertainties could have a negative effect on financial performance. 
 
 Additional factors could have a negative effect on the financial performance of the Company and the Company s common stock. Some of these factors are financial market conditions, changes in financial accounting and reporting standards, new litigation or changes in existing litigation, regulatory actions and losses. 
 
 Risks Related to the Company s Common Stock 
 
 Investments in the Company s common stock involve risk. 
 
 The market price of the Company s common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, including: 
 Variations in quarterly or annual operating results Changes in dividends per share Changes in interest rates New developments, laws or regulations in the banking industry Acquisitions or business combinations involving the Company or its competition Regulatory actions, including changes to regulatory capital levels, the components of regulatory capital and how regulatory capital is calculated Volatility of stock market prices and volumes Changes in market valuations of similar companies New litigation or contingencies or changes in existing litigation or contingencies Changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other regulatory agencies Rumors or erroneous information Credit and capital availability Issuance of additional shares of common stock or other debt or equity securities of the Company 
 Market conditions General economic conditions 
 
 The Company's common stock, while publicly traded, has less liquidity than the average liquidity of stocks listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
 
 The Company's common stock is listed for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market. However, the Company's common stock has less liquidity than the average liquidity for companies listed in the Nasdaq Stock Market. The public trading market for the Company's common stock depends on a marketplace of willing buyers and sellers at any given time, which in turn depends on factors outside of the Company's control, including general economic and market conditions and the decisions of individual investors. The limited market for the Company's common stock may affect a shareholder's ability to sell their shares at any given time, and the sale of a large number of shares at one time could temporarily adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 
 
 The Company's common stock is not insured by any government entity. 
 
 The Company's common stock is not insured by the FDIC or any other government entity. Investment in the Company's common stock is subject to risk and potential loss. 
 
 A shareholder's ownership of common stock may be diluted if the Company issues additional shares of common stock in the future. 
 
 The Company's articles of incorporation authorize the Company's Board of Directors to issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock without shareholder approval. To the extent the Company issues additional shares of common stock or preferred stock, or issues options or warrants permitting the holder to purchase or acquire common stock in the future and such warrants or options are exercised, the Company's shareholders may experience dilution in their ownership of the Company's common stock. Holders of the Company's common stock do not have any preemptive or similar rights to purchase a pro rata share of any additional shares offered or issued by the Company.

Table of Contents 

The value of the Company's common stock may be adversely affected if the Company issues debt and equity securities that are senior to the Company's common stock in liquidation or as to distributions. 
 
 The Company may increase its capital by issuing debt or equity securities or by entering into debt or debt-like financing. This may include the issuance of common stock, preferred stock, senior notes, or subordinated notes. Upon any liquidation of the Company, the Company's lenders and holders of its debt securities would be entitled to distribution of the Company's available assets before distributions to the holders of the Company's common stock, and holders of preferred stock may be granted rights to similarly receive a distribution upon liquidation prior to distribution to holders of the Company's common stock. The Company cannot predict the amount, timing or nature of any future debt financings or stock offerings, and the decision of whether to incur debt or issue securities will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond the Company's control. Future offerings could dilute a shareholder's interests in the Company or reduce the per-share value of the Company's common stock. 
 
 The Company's articles of incorporation and bylaws, and certain provisions of Michigan law, contain provisions that could make a takeover effort more difficult. 
 
 The Michigan Business Corporation Act, and the Company's articles of incorporation and bylaws, include provisions intended to protect shareholders and prohibit, discourage, or delay certain types of hostile takeover activities. In addition, federal law requires the Federal Reserve Board's prior approval for acquisition of "control" of a bank holding company such as the Company, including acquisition of 10 or more of the Company's outstanding securities by any person not defined as a company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHC Act"). These provisions and requirements could discourage potential acquisition proposals, delay or prevent a change in control, diminish the opportunities for a shareholder to participate in tender offers, prevent transactions in which our shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares, or limit the ability for our shareholders to approve transactions that they may believe to be in their best interests. 
 
 An entity or group holding a certain percentage of the Company's outstanding securities could become subject to regulation as a "bank holding company" or may be required to obtain prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. 
 
 Any bank holding company or foreign bank with a presence in the United States may be required to obtain approval of the Federal Reserve Board under the BHC Act to acquire or retain 5 or more of the Company's outstanding securities. Further, if any entity (including a "group" comprised of individual persons) owns or controls the power to vote 25 or more of the Company's outstanding securities, or 5 or more of the outstanding securities if the entity otherwise exercises a "controlling influence" over the Company, the entity may become subject to regulation as a "bank holding company" under the BHC Act. An entity that is subject to regulation as a bank holding company would be subject to regulatory and statutory obligations and restrictions, and could be required to divest all or a portion of the entity's investment in the Company's securities or in other investments that are not permitted for a bank holding company.

ChoiceOne s principal source of funds to pay cash dividends is the earnings and dividends paid by the Bank. The Bank is restricted in its ability to pay cash dividends under current banking regulations. See Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of these restrictions. Based on information presently available, management expects ChoiceOne to declare and pay regular quarterly cash dividends in 2023, although the amount of the quarterly dividends will be dependent on market conditions and ChoiceOne s requirements for cash and capital, among other things.

ChoiceOne's asset mix has shifted from loans held for investment of 51.6 at December 31, 2021 to 56.2 at December 31, 2022.
 Core loans, which exclude PPP loans, loans held for sale, and loans to other financial institutions, grew organically by 206.1 million or 21.0 during the full year 2022. Loans to other financial institutions, consisting of a warehouse line of credit, were suspended at the end of the third quarter 2022 to preserve liquidity for loan growth. ChoiceOne continues to have ample on balance sheet liquidity to fund future loan growth, including an estimated 178.7 million of cash flow from securities over the next two years. Overall, t
 otal assets grew less than 1 or 19.2 million in 2022. ChoiceOne saw deposits decline 38.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 due to some seasonality in municipal deposits and increased competition. The cost of these deposits also increased by 940,000 in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the third quarter of 2022 and 1.8 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Deposits have increased by 65.7 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2022; however, during that time deposit expense has increased 2.5 million. Cost of interest-bearing deposits increased to 0.66 in the fourth quarter of 2022 primarily due to the increases in rates offered to retain clients and an increased customer interest in certificates of deposit. ChoiceOne is actively managing these costs while still retaining funds, and anticipates that deposit expense will continue to lag the cumulative increases in the federal funds rate. Borrowing interest expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, increased 1.2 million as compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to the issuance of 32.5 million in subordinated debt that was completed in the third quarter of 2021 and the increase in rates on short-term borrowings. 

Interest income increased 10.4 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021. The increase was driven by a 6.3 million increase in securities interest income largely due to an increase in the average balance of securities of 190.1 million during 2022. In 2022, ChoiceOne liquidated a total of 47.2 million in securities resulting in an 809,000 realized loss, in order to redeploy funds into higher yielding loans and securities, and to reduce the risk of extension on certain fixed income securities which include a call option. Interest income on loans increased 4.2 million during 2022 and was primarily a result of higher loan balances and 919,000 of additional accretion income from acquired loans, partially offset by a decrease in PPP fee income of 3.9 million. 

ChoiceOne had 250,000 of provision for loan losses expense for the year ended December 31, 2022. Management has seen declining deferrals and very few past due loans during 2022; however, the additional provision was deemed necessary due to increased loan growth in 2022. On December 31, 2022, the allowance for loan losses represented 0.64 of total loans. ChoiceOne adopted ASU 2016-13 current expected credit loss ("CECL") on January 1, 2023. Due to the current economic environment, the nature of the new calculation, and purchase accounting with our recent mergers, we anticipate an increase in our current allowance for loan losses of between 6.5 million and 7.0 million, which will result in an expected allowance for loan losses to total loan coverage ratio between 1.15 and 1.25 on January 1, 2023. Approximately 20 to 25 of this increase is related to the migration of purchased loans into the portfolio assessed by the CECL calculation. Purchased loans carry approximately 4.0 million of accretable yield, which will be recognized into income over the remaining life of the loans. ChoiceOne will also record a liability for expected credit losses on unfunded loans and other commitments of between 2.5 million to 3.0 million related to the adoption of CECL. These unfunded loans and other commitments are open credit lines with current customers and loans approved by ChoiceOne but not yet funded. The increase in the reserve and the cost of the liability will result in a decrease in retained earnings account on our Consolidated Balance Sheet equal to the after-tax impact, with the tax impact portion being recorded in deferred taxes in our Consolidated balance Sheet in accordance with FASB guidance. Further discussion of the change in accounting policy can be found in Item 8 Note 1.

Noninterest Income 

Total noninterest income declined 5.1 million during 2022 compared to 2021. 4.4 million of this decline is due to the change in the mortgage sales environment from the prior year. With the rapid rise in interest rates, refinancing activity has slowed, and demand has shifted toward adjustable-rate products, which ChoiceOne keeps in portfolio. Customer service charges increased 722,000 during 2022 compared to 2021 as prior year service charges were depressed by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The change in market value of equity securities declined 1.4 million during 2022 compared to 2021 consistent with general market conditions. Equity investments include local community bank stocks and Community Reinvestment Act bond mutual funds. 

Noninterest Expense 

Total noninterest expense increased 557,000, or 1.1 , in 2022 compared to 2021. Expense management was a focus in 2022 and will continue to be a focus in 2023 given inflationary pressures. The increase in total noninterest expense was related to an increase in salaries and wages due to annual wage increases and the addition of new commercial loan production and wealth management staff. This increase was offset by decreases in other categories including professional fees and loan-driven incentive-based compensation. ChoiceOne continues to monitor expenses and looks to improve our efficiency through automation and use of digital tools.

Paycheck Protection Program 

ChoiceOne processed over 126 million in PPP loans in 2020, acquired an additional 37 million in PPP loans in the merger with Community Shores, and originated 89.1 million in PPP loans in 2021. In the third quarter of 2022, the remaining 1.8 million of PPP loans were forgiven resulting in 68,000 of fee income. For the full year 2022, 33.1 million of PPP loans were forgiven resulting in 1.2 million of fee income. At December 31, 2022, no PPP loans remain in ChoiceOne s loan portfolio.

Dividends 

Cash dividends of 7.6 million or 1.01 per common share were declared in 2022 compared to 7.2 million or 0.94 per common share in 2021. The dividend yield for ChoiceOne s common stock was 3.48 as of the end of 2022, compared to 3.55 as of the end of 2021. The cash dividend payout as a percentage of net income was 32 as of December 31, 2022, compared to 33 as of December 31, 2021.

Inco me Taxes 

Income tax expense was 438,000 lower in
 2022 than in
 2021. The decline is related to additional tax-exempt interest income from securities and additional tax-exempt earnings on bank-owned life insurances in
 2022 compared to
 2021. The effective tax rate was 15 in
 2022 compared to 17 in
 2021. For further details, refer to Note 12 (Income Taxes) of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report.

 Adjusted to a fully tax-equivalent basis to facilitate comparison to the taxable interest-earning assets. The adjustment uses an incremental tax rate of 21 . The presentation of these measures on a tax-equivalent basis is not in accordance with GAAP, but is customary in the banking industry. These non-GAAP measures ensure comparability with respect to both taxable and tax-exempt loans and securities.

 Non-accruing loan and PPP loan balances are included in the balances of average loans. Non-accruing loan average balances were 1.3 million, 3.3 million, and 5.0 million for the year ended 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. PPP loan average balances were 8.7 million, 95.9 million, and 84.2 million for the year ended 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. At December 31, 2022 no PPP loans remain in ChoiceOne s loan portfolio.

 The volume variance is computed as the change in volume (average balance) multiplied by the previous year s interest rate. The rate variance is computed as the change in interest rate multiplied by the previous year s volume (average balance). The change in interest due to both volume and rate has been allocated to the volume and rate changes in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each. 

(2) 
 Interest on tax-exempt securities and loans has been adjusted to a fully tax-equivalent basis using an incremental tax rate of 21 for 2022, 2021, and 2020. 

Net I nterest Income 

Tax-equivalent net interest income increased 6.8 million for the full year 2022, compared to the same period in 2021. The Federal Reserve increased the federal funds rate by 4.0 during 2022 in response to published inflation rates. This both increased rates on newly originated loans and increased the rates paid on deposits and led to a net decline in tax equivalent net interest margin of 5 basis points in 2022 compared to 2021. GAAP based net interest margin declined 7 basis points in 2022 compared to 2021.

The following table presents the cost of deposits and the cost of funds for the years ended December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020.

Net interest income increased 6.7 million in 2022 compared to 2021 due to the 224.8 million increase in the average balance of securities and a 14 basis point increase in the average rate earned on securities during the full year 2022 as ChoiceOne deployed excess deposit dollars into securities with the intent to transition to loans as good credits become available. ChoiceOne has also experienced core loan growth during 2022 leading to an increase in interest income from loans of 4.2 million in the full year 2022, compared to the same period in the prior year. Average core loans, which exclude PPP loans, loans held for sale, and loans to other financial institutions, grew 153.9 million during the full year 2022. In addition, the average rate earned on loans increased 11 basis points in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase in interest income from loans and the average rate increase on loans is muted by a 3.9 million decline in PPP fee income in the full year 2022 compared to 2021. This decline was somewhat offset by a 919,000 increase in accretion income from acquired loans in 2022 compared to 2021. 

Interest expense increased 3.8 million for the full year 2022, compared to the same period in 2021. Growth of 163.8 million in the average balance of interest-bearing demand deposits and savings deposits and a combined 11 basis point increase in the average rate paid, caused interest expense to increase 1.9 million in 2022 compared to the prior year. The increase in the average balance of certificates of deposit of 9.3 million, combined with a 31 basis point increase in the rate paid on certificates of deposits in 2022 compared to 2021, led to an increase in interest expense of 664,000. In September 2021, ChoiceOne completed a private placement of 32.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.25 fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due 2031. In addition, ChoiceOne holds certain subordinated debentures issued in connection with a trust preferred securities offering that were obtained as part of the merger with Community Shores. These increased the average balance of subordinated debentures by 22.4 million in 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year and caused interest expense to increase by 920,000 over the same period. 

The rise in interest rates has led to ChoiceOne's cost of funds increasing 15 basis points from 0.21 in 2021 to 0.35 in 2022. 10 basis points of this increase is due to the rising cost of deposits, while the remainder is due to the increased cost of borrowing and a full year's expense of the subordinated notes completed in September of 2021.

The provision for loan losses was 250,000 in 2022, compared to 416,000 in the prior year. The provision for loan losses expense was deemed necessary to reserve for core loan growth of 206.1 million in 2022. Our methodology for measuring the appropriate level of allowance for loan losses and related provision for loan losses involves specific allocations for loans considered impaired, and general allocations for homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience. 

Loans classified as impaired loans declined by 2.6 million during 2022 which led to a decline in the specific allowance for loan losses for impaired loans of 350,000 in 2022 compared to 2021.

The determination of our loss factors is based, in part, upon our actual loss history adjusted for significant qualitative factors that, in management's judgment, affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the analysis date. ChoiceOne uses a rolling 20 quarter actual net charge-off history as the basis for the computation. 

Nonperforming loans were 2.7 million as of December 31, 2022 compared to 5.5 million as of December 31, 2021. The allowance for loan losses was 0.64 of total loans at December 31, 2022, compared to 0.76 at December 31, 2021. Loans acquired in the mergers with County and Community Shores were recorded at fair value and as a result do not have an allowance for loan losses allocated to them unless credit deteriorates subsequent to acquisition. 

Net charge-offs were 319,000 in 2022 compared to net charge-offs of 321,000 during the same period in 2021. Net charge-offs on an annualized basis as a percentage of average loans were 0.03 in 2022 compared to 0.03 in 2021. Management is aware that the economic climate in Michigan will continue to affect business and individual borrowers. 

ChoiceOne adopted ASU 2016-13 current expected credit loss ("CECL") on January 1, 2023. Due to the current economic environment, the nature of the new calculation, and purchase accounting with our recent mergers, we anticipate an increase in our current allowance for loan losses of between 6.5 million and 7.0 million, which will result in an expected allowance for loan losses to total loan coverage ratio between 1.15 and 1.25 on January 1, 2023. Approximately 20 to 25 of this increase is related to the migration of purchased loans into the portfolio assessed by the CECL calculation. ChoiceOne will also record a liability for expected credit losses on unfunded loans and other commitments of between 2.5 million to 3.0 million related to the adoption of CECL. These unfunded loans and other commitments are open credit lines with current customers and loans approved by ChoiceOne but not yet funded. The increase in the reserve and the cost of the liability will result in a decrease in retained earnings account on our Consolidated Balance Sheet equal to the after-tax impact, with the tax impact portion being recorded in deferred taxes in our Consolidated balance Sheet in accordance with FASB guidance. Further discussion of the change in accounting policy can be found in Item 8 Note 1.

Financial Condition 

Summary 

Total assets grew 19.2 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. Core loans grew 206.1 million or 21.0 and were offset by a decline in securities of 143.2 million, and a decline in loans to other financial institutions of 42.6 million. ChoiceOne also grew deposits by 65.7 million during 2022. Deposit costs rose steadily during the year with larger increases coming in the fourth quarter as competition and rate awareness has amplified.

In the last two years ChoiceOne has grown its securities portfolio substantially. Total available for sale securities on December 31, 2020, amounted to 577.7 million and grew steadily to an available for sale balance on December 31, 2021, of 1.1 billion. Many of the securities making up this balance include local municipals and other securities ChoiceOne has no intent to sell prior to maturity. During the first quarter of 2022, ChoiceOne elected to move 428.4 million of the portfolio into a held to maturity status. 

Total investment securities declined 143.2 million from 
 December 31, 2021
 to 
 December 31, 2022
 . ChoiceOne purchased 63.6 million of securities in 2022. This was offset by the liquidation of 47.2 million in securities during 2022, resulting in an 809,000 realized loss and reduced the risk of extension on certain fixed income securities which included a call option.
 Securities totaling 19.6 million were called or matured in 
 2022
 . ChoiceOne received principal payments for municipal and mortgage-backed securities totaling 40.1 million during 
 2022
 . 

At December 31, 2022, the Company had 161.0 million in unrealized losses on its investment securities, including 89.0 million in unrealized losses on available for sale securities and 72.0 in unrealized losses on held to maturity securities. Unrealized losses on corporate and municipal bonds have not been recognized into income because the issuers bonds are of high credit quality, and management does not intend to sell prior to their anticipated recovery, and the decline in fair value is largely due to changes in interest rates and other market conditions. The issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments on the bonds. The fair value is expected to recover as the bonds approach maturity.

ChoiceOne utilizes interest rate derivatives as part of its asset liability management strategy to help manage its interest rate risk position. In order to hedge the risk of rising rates and unrealized losses on securities resulting from the rising rates, ChoiceOne currently holds four interest rate swaps with a total notional value of 400.1 million. These derivative instruments increase in value as long-term interest rates rise, which offsets the reduction in equity due to unrealized losses on securities available for sale. Refer to footnote 8 and 23 for more discussion on ChoiceOne s derivative position. 

The Bank s Investment Committee continues to monitor the portfolio and purchases securities as it considers prudent. 

Equity securities included a money market preferred security ("MMP") of 1.0 million and common stock of 7.6 million as of 
 December 31, 2022
 . As of 
 December 31, 2021
 , equity securities included an MMP of 1.0 million and common stock of 7.5 million.

Core loans, which exclude PPP loans, held for sale loans, and loans to other financial institutions, grew organically by 206.1 million in 2022. Excluding PPP loans, ChoiceOne saw growth of 144.7 million in commercial loans and 56.7 million in retail loans in 2022. Additions to our commercial lending staff in 2021 and 2022 as well as investments in the automation of our commercial loan process have helped drive our pipeline of commercial loans and corresponding growth. 

Loans to other financial institutions declined 42.6 million from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022, as management chose to suspend the program at the end of the third quarter 2022. Additionally, the remaining 33.1 million of PPP loans were forgiven resulting in 1.2 million of fee income. At December 31, 2022, all PPP loans have been fully forgiven, and the associated fee income has been recognized.

ChoiceOne recorded accretion income related to acquired loans in the amount of 2.0 million during 2022. Remaining credit and yield mark on acquired loans from the recent mergers with County Bank Corp. and Community Shores will accrete into income as the acquired loans mature. ChoiceOne estimates that roughly 4.0 million will accrete into income over the next two to four years.

Information regarding impaired loans can be found in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. In addition to its review of the loan portfolio for impaired loans, management also monitors various nonperforming loans. Nonperforming loans are comprised of (1) loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis; (2) loans, not included in nonaccrual loans, which are contractually past due 90 days or more as to interest or principal payments; and (3) loans, not included in nonaccrual or past due 90 days or more, which are considered troubled debt restructurings. Troubled debt restructurings consist of loans where the terms have been modified to assist the borrowers in making their payments. The modifications can include capitalization of interest onto the principal balance, reduction in interest rate, and extension of the loan term.

Loans considered troubled debt restructurings which were not on a nonaccrual basis and were not 90 days or more past due as to principal or interest payments consisted of 3,000 in agricultural loans, 58,000 in commercial and industrial loans, 131,000 in commercial real estate loans and 1.2 million in residential real estate loans at December 31, 2022, compared to 1.8 million in agricultural loans, 73,000 in commercial and industrial loans, 601,000 in commercial real estate loans and 1.3 million in residential real estate loans at December 31, 2021.

Management also maintains a list of loans that are not classified as nonperforming loans but where some concern exists as to the borrowers abilities to comply with the original loan terms. There were 10 loans totaling 180,000 fitting this description as of 
 December 31, 2022
 , and no loans fitting that description on 
 December 31, 2021

Total deposits increased 65.7 million from 
 December 31, 2021
 to 
 December 31, 2022
 ; however, most of this was in the first half of 2022. ChoiceOne saw deposits decline 38.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 due to some seasonality in municipal deposits and increased competition. 
 The Federal Reserve increased the federal funds rate by 4.0 during 2022 in response to published inflation rates. In response, the cost of interest-bearing deposits increased to 0.66 in the fourth quarter of 2022 primarily due to the increases in rates offered to retain clients and an increased interest in certificates of deposit. ChoiceOne is actively managing these costs while still retaining funds, and anticipates that deposit expense will continue to lag the cumulative increases in the federal funds rate. The actual cost of deposits increased by 940,000 in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the third quarter of 2022 and 1.9 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. 

In September 2021, ChoiceOne completed a private placement of 32.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.25 fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due 2031. ChoiceOne used a portion of net proceeds from the private placement to redeem senior debt, fund common stock repurchases, and support bank-level capital ratios. ChoiceOne also holds 3.2 million in subordinated debentures issued in connection with a 4.5 million trust preferred securities offering, which were obtained in the merger with Community Shores, offset by the mark-to-market adjustment. 

At December 31, 2022, the aggregate balance of all deposits exceeding the FDIC insured limit of 250,000 totaled 823.2 million, or 39 of total deposits, compared to 889.2 million, or 43 of total deposits and 583.7 million, or 35 of total deposits at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 
 Core deposits, which we define as insured branch deposits less certificates of deposit, totaled 1.2 billion or 55.0 of total deposits at December 31, 2022. 

Shareholders Equity 

Total shareholders' equity declined 52.8 million in 2022. Accumulated other comprehensive income declined 69.2 million in 2022 as a result of market value declines in ChoiceOne s available for sale securities. The change was caused by increases in certain general market interest rates since the beginning of 2022. ChoiceOne's derivative strategy implemented during the second quarter of 2022 and repositioned during the fourth quarter of 2022, is expected to better position the Bank should rates continue to rise. The net impact on equity of the derivative strategy as of December 31, 2022, was 957,000 net of tax. 
 
 For further details refer to Footnote 8 "Derivatives and Hedging Activities". As permitted by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, unrecognized losses on securities held to maturity do not reduce other comprehensive income and, as a result, are not reflected as a reduction to shareholders equity on our balance sheet. ChoiceOne Bank remains well-capitalized with a total risk-based capital ratio of 13.0 as of December 31, 2022, compared to 12.9 on December 31, 2021. 

ChoiceOne repurchased 25,899 shares for 683,000, or a weighted average all-in cost per share of 26.35, during the first quarter of 2022. This was part of the common stock repurchase program announced in April 2021 which authorized repurchases of up to 390,114 shares, representing 5 of the total outstanding shares of common stock as of the date the program was adopted. No shares of common stock were repurchased for the remainder of 2022; however, ChoiceOne may strategically repurchase shares of common stock in the future depending on market and other conditions. 

Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements presents regulatory capital information for ChoiceOne and the Bank at the end of 2022 and 2021. Management will monitor these capital ratios during 2023 as they relate to asset growth and earnings retention. ChoiceOne s Board of Directors and management do not plan to allow capital to decrease below those levels necessary to be considered "well capitalized" by regulatory guidelines. At December 31, 2022, the Bank was categorized as "well-capitalized" under regulatory guidelines.

Liquidity and Interest Rate Risk 

Net cash provided by operating activities was 45.0 million in 2022 compared to 37.7 million in 2021. The change was due to lower net proceeds from loan sales in 2022 compared to 2021, which was offset by the change in other assets and liabilities. Net cash used in investing activities was 90.5 million in 2022 compared to 521.4 million in 2021. ChoiceOne purchased 63.6 million of securities and had maturities or sales of securities of 106.4 million in 2022 compared to 637.9 million in purchases and 83.9 million in maturities or sales in 2021, respectively. An increase in net loan originations led to cash used of 130.6 million in 2022 compared to cash provided of 45.4 million in the prior year. Net cash provided by financing activities was 57.5 million in 2022, compared to 436.0 million in 2021. ChoiceOne experienced growth of 65.7 million in deposits in 2022 compared to growth of 377.7 million in 2021, while also seeing a 73.2 million decrease in borrowings in 2022, which led to the change.

ChoiceOne's primary market risk exposure occurs in the form of interest rate risk. Liquidity risk also can have an impact but to a lesser extent. ChoiceOne's business is transacted in U.S. dollars with no foreign exchange risk exposure. Agricultural loans comprise a relatively small portion of ChoiceOne's total assets. Management believes that ChoiceOne's exposure to changes in commodity prices is insignificant. 

Management believes that the current level of liquidity and sources of additional liquidity are sufficient to meet the Bank's future liquidity needs. This belief is based upon the availability of deposits from both the local and national markets, our core deposit base, maturities of and cash flows from securities, normal loan repayments, income retention, federal funds purchased and advances available from the FHLB. Liquidity risk deals with ChoiceOne's ability to meet its cash flow requirements. These requirements include depositors desiring to withdraw funds and borrowers seeking credit. The Bank also has a line of credit secured by ChoiceOne s commercial loans with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago for 380.4 million, which is designated for nonrecurring short-term liquidity needs. Longer-term liquidity needs may be met through core deposit growth, maturities of and cash flows from securities, normal loan repayments, advances from the FHLB, brokered certificates of deposit, and income retention. ChoiceOne had 50.0 million in outstanding borrowings at FHLB as of December 31, 2022, and 39.6 million of additional borrowing capacity was available based on residential real estate loans pledged as collateral at the end of 2022. The acceptance of brokered certificates of deposit is not limited as long as the Bank is categorized as well capitalized under regulatory guidelines.
 
 ChoiceOne continues to review its liquidity management and has taken steps in an effort to ensure adequacy. These steps include limiting bond purchases in the first two months of 2023, moving safekeeping of securities to FHLB in order to increase borrowing capacity, if pledged, by an amount of roughly 300.0 million, and using alternative funding sources such as brokered deposits. ChoiceOne is also investigating additional borrowing capacity by use of the new Bank Term Funding Program announced March 12, 2023. As of February 28, 2023 ChoiceOne estimates that it has total borrowing capacity of 398.3 million, and if additional securities are pledged with the FHLB, will have the ability to borrow up to 716.3 million.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 

This report contains financial measures that are not defined in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Management believes this non-GAAP financial measure provides additional information that is useful to investors in helping to understand the underlying financial performance of ChoiceOne.

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations. Readers should be aware of these limitations and should be cautious with respect to the use of such measures. To compensate for these limitations, we use non-GAAP measures as comparative tools, together with GAAP measures, to assist in the evaluation of our operating performance or financial condition. Also, we ensure that these measures are calculated using the appropriate GAAP or regulatory components in their entirety and that they are computed in a manner intended to facilitate consistent period-to-period comparisons. ChoiceOne s method of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from methods used by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for those financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP or in-effect regulatory requirements.

Table of Contents 

Critical Accounting Policies And Estimates 

Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as well as disclosures found elsewhere in this report are based upon the Company s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near-term relate to the determination of the market value of securities, the amount of the allowance for loan losses, loan servicing rights, carrying value of goodwill, and income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Securities 

Debt securities are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost when management has the positive intent and ability to hold them to maturity. Debt securities available for sale may be sold prior to maturity due to changes in interest rates, prepayment risks, yield, availability of alternative investments, liquidity needs, credit rating changes, or other factors. Debt securities classified as available for sale are reported at their fair value with changes flowing through other comprehensive income. Declines in the fair value of securities below their cost that are considered to be other than temporary are recorded as losses in the income statement. In estimating whether a fair value decline is considered to be other than temporary, management considers the length of time and extent that the security s fair value has been less than its carrying value, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the Bank s ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.

Market values for securities available for sale are obtained from outside sources and applied to individual securities within the portfolio. The difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of securities is recorded as a valuation adjustment and reported net of tax effect in other comprehensive income.

Equity securities are reported at their fair value with changes in market value flowing through net income. Prior to 2018, equity securities were accounted for in a manner similar to available for sale debt securities.

Allowance for Loan Losses 

The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in the consolidated loan portfolio. Management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is an estimate based on reviews of individual loans, assessments of the impact of current economic conditions on the portfolio and historical loss experience of seasoned loan portfolios.

Management believes the accounting estimate related to the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate because (1) the estimate is highly susceptible to change from period to period because of assumptions concerning the changes in the types and volumes of the portfolios and current economic conditions and (2) the impact of recognizing an impairment or loan loss could have a material effect on the Company s assets reported on the balance sheet as well as its net income.

Loan Servicing Rights 

Loan servicing rights represent the estimated value of servicing loans that are sold with servicing retained by ChoiceOne and are initially recorded at estimated fair value. Servicing rights are expensed in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing revenues. Management s accounting treatment of loan servicing rights is estimated based on current prepayment speeds that are typically market driven.

Management believes the accounting estimate related to loan servicing rights is a critical accounting estimate because (1) the estimate is highly susceptible to change from period to period because of significant changes within long-term interest rates affecting the prepayment speeds for current loans being serviced and (2) the impact of recognizing an impairment loss could have a material effect on ChoiceOne s net income. Management has obtained a third-party valuation of its loan servicing rights to corroborate its current carrying value at the end of each reporting period.

Goodwill 

Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated annually for impairment and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. The goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, and an impairment charge would be recognized for any amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. Accounting pronouncements allow a company to first perform a qualitative assessment for goodwill prior to a quantitative assessment (Step 1 assessment). If the results of the qualitative assessment indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, then a quantitative assessment must be performed. If not, there is no further assessment required. The Company acquired Valley Ridge Financial Corp. in 2006, County in 2019, and Community Shores in 2020, which resulted in the recognition of goodwill of 13.7 million, 38.9 million and 7.3 million, respectively. 

We conducted an annual assessment of goodwill as of June 30, 2022 and no impairment was identified. The Company used a qualitative assessment to determine goodwill was not impaired as of June 30, 2022. 
 
 Additionally, the Company engaged a third party valuation firm to assist in performing a quantitative analysis of goodwill as of November 30, 2022 ("the valuation date"). In deriving the fair value of the reporting unit (the Bank), the third-party firm assessed general economic conditions and outlook; industry and market considerations and outlook; the impact of recent events to financial performance; the market price of ChoiceOne s common stock and other relevant events. In addition, the valuation relied on financial projections through 2027 and growth rates prepared by management. Based on the valuation prepared, it was determined that ChoiceOne's estimated fair value of the reporting unit at the valuation date was greater than its book value and impairment of goodwill was not required. 

Management concurred with the conclusion derived from the quantitative goodwill analysis as of the valuation date and determined that there were no material changes and that no triggering events had occurred that indicated impairment from the valuation date through December 31, 2022, and as a result that it is more likely than not that there was no goodwill impairment as of December 31, 2022.

Table of Contents 

Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities 

Income taxes include both a current and deferred portion. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded to account for differences in the timing of the recognition of revenues and expenses for financial reporting and tax purposes. Generally accepted accounting principles require that deferred tax assets be reviewed to determine whether a valuation allowance should be established using a more likely than not standard. Based on its review of ChoiceOne s deferred tax assets as of
 December 31, 2022, management determined that no valuation allowance was necessary. The valuation of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is considered critical, as it requires management to make estimates based on provisions of the enacted tax laws. The assessment of tax assets and liabilities involves the use of estimates, assumptions, interpretations, and judgments concerning certain accounting pronouncements and the federal tax code.

Item 7A. 
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Interest rate risk is related to liquidity because each is affected by maturing assets and sources of funds. ChoiceOne s Asset/Liability Management Committee (the "ALCO") attempts to stabilize the interest rate spread and avoid possible adverse effects when unusual or rapid changes in interest rates occur. The ALCO uses a simulation model to measure the Bank's interest rate risk. The model incorporates changes in interest rates on rate-sensitive assets and liabilities. The degree of rate sensitivity is affected by prepayment assumptions that exist in the assets and liabilities. One method the ALCO uses of measuring interest rate sensitivity is the ratio of rate-sensitive assets to rate-sensitive liabilities. An asset or liability is considered to be rate-sensitive if it matures or otherwise reprices within a given time frame.

Under this method, the ALCO measures interest rate sensitivity by focusing on the one-year repricing gap. ChoiceOne s ratio of rate-sensitive assets to rate-sensitive liabilities that matured or repriced within a one-year time frame was 36 at
 December 31, 2022, compared to 43 at
 December 31, 2021. Table 5 above shows the entire balance of interest-bearing demand deposits, savings deposits, and money market deposits in the shortest repricing term. Although these categories have the ability to reprice immediately, management has some control over the actual timing or extent of the changes in interest rates on these liabilities. The ALCO plans to continue to monitor the ratio of rate-sensitive assets to rate-sensitive liabilities on a quarterly basis in 2023. As interest rates change, the ALCO will attempt to match its maturing assets with corresponding liabilities to maximize ChoiceOne s net interest income.

Another method the ALCO uses to monitor its interest rate sensitivity is to subject rate-sensitive assets and liabilities to interest rate shocks. At 
 December 31, 2022
 , management used a simulation model to subject its assets and liabilities up to an immediate 200 basis point increase and decline. The maturities of loans and mortgage-backed securities were affected by certain prepayment assumptions. Maturities for interest-bearing core deposits were based on an estimate of the period over which they would be outstanding. The maturities of advances from the FHLB were based on their contractual maturity dates. In the case of variable rate assets and liabilities, repricing dates were used to determine their values. The simulation model measures the effect of immediate interest rate changes on both net interest income and shareholders' equity.

As of December 31, 2022, the Bank was within its guidelines for immediate rate shocks up and down for all net interest income scenarios and for the up rate scenarios for the market value of shareholders equity. The Bank s percent change in the 100 and 200 basis points down scenarios for the market value of shareholders equity was higher than the policy guidelines. As of December 31, 2021, the Bank was within its guidelines for immediate rate shocks up and down for all net interest income scenarios and for the up rate scenarios and the down 100 and down 200 basis points scenarios for the market value of shareholders equity. The ALCO plans to continue to monitor the effect of changes in interest rates on both net interest income and shareholders equity and will make changes in the duration of its rate-sensitive assets and rate-sensitive liabilities where necessary.

 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of ChoiceOne Financial Services, Inc. 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ChoiceOne Financial Services, Inc. (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Allowance for Loan Losses - Current Factor Adjustments - Refer to Notes 1 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 The general component of management s estimate of the allowance for loan losses covers nonimpaired loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors. Management s adjustment for current factors is based on trends in delinquencies, trends in charge-offs and recoveries, trends in the volume of loans, changes in underwriting standards, trends in loan review findings, experience and ability of lending staff, national and economic trends and conditions, industry conditions, trends in real estate values, and other conditions. Identification of factors to consider and adjustments to those factors involve management s judgement. 
 
 Given the significant estimates and assumptions management makes to estimate the current factor adjustments of the allowance for loan losses, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management s estimates and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 
 Our audit procedures related to the current factor adjustments used in the estimate of the allowance for loan losses included the following, among others: 

We obtained an understanding of management s process for determining the current factor adjustments, which included identification of internal and external data used in the analysis and understanding how management selects inputs from a range of potential assumptions. 

We evaluated the design of controls over management s allowance for loan losses estimate, including those over current factor adjustments. 

We evaluated management s selection of factors to consider when making current factor adjustments. 

We evaluated management's determination of adjustments for each factor, including evaluation of each adjustment for consistency with the direction and magnitude of changes in internal and external data.

 and
 on
 January 1, 2023. Approximately
 to
 of this increase is related to the migration of purchased loans into the portfolio assessed by the CECL calculation. ChoiceOne will also record a liability for expected credit losses on unfunded loans and other commitments of between
 million to
 million related to the adoption of CECL. These unfunded loans and other commitments are open credit lines with current customers and loans approved by ChoiceOne but
 not yet funded. The increase in the reserve and the cost of the liability will result in a decrease in retained earnings account on our Consolidated Balance Sheet equal to the after-tax impact, with the tax impact portion being recorded in deferred taxes in our Consolidated balance Sheet in accordance with FASB guidance. 

ChoiceOne has elected the discounted cash flow methodology for all loan types, and will be utilizing 
 third party software to store and measure historical loss experience. ChoiceOne has worked with a
 third party advisory group to develop loss drivers which we believe have a strong correlation to our historical loss trends. The loss drivers ChoiceOne has elected are unemployment and GDP growth which have readily available

 ChoiceOne evaluates all securities on a quarterly basis to determine whether unrealized losses are temporary or other than temporary. Consideration is given to the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the intent and ability of ChoiceOne to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value of amortized cost basis. Management believed that unrealized losses as of December 31, 2022 were temporary in nature and were caused primarily by changes in interest rates, increased credit spreads, and reduced market liquidity and were not caused by the credit status of the issuer. other than temporary impairments were recorded in 2022 or 2021. 
 
 Following is information regarding unrealized gains and losses on equity securities for the years ending December 31: 
 Less: Net gains and losses recognized during the period on securities sold 
 
 Unrealized gains and losses recognized during the reporting period on securities still held at the reporting date 

At December 31, 2022 , there were securities with an unrealized loss, compared to securities with an unrealized loss as of December 31, 2021 . Unrealized losses on corporate and municipal bonds have not been recognized into income because the issuers bonds are of high credit quality, and management does not intend to sell prior to their anticipated recovery, and the decline in fair value is largely due to changes in interest rates and other market conditions. The issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments on the bonds. The fair value is expected to recover as the bonds approach maturity. 
 
 The majority of unrealized losses at December 31, 2022, are related to U.S. Treasury notes and bonds, State and municipal bonds and mortgage backed.

ChoiceOne manages its credit risk through the use of its loan policy and its loan approval process and by monitoring of loan credit performance. The loan approval process for commercial loans involves individual and group approval authorities. Individual authority levels are based on the experience of the lender. Group authority approval levels can consist of an internal loan committee that includes the Bank s President or Senior Lender and other loan officers for loans that exceed individual approval levels, or a loan committee of the Board of Directors for larger commercial loans. Most consumer loans are approved by individual loan officers based on standardized underwriting criteria, with larger consumer loans subject to approval by the internal loan committee. 
 
 Ongoing credit review of commercial loans is the responsibility of the loan officers. ChoiceOne s internal credit committee meets at least monthly and reviews loans with payment issues and loans with a risk rating of 6, 7, or 8. Risk ratings of commercial loans are reviewed periodically and adjusted if needed. ChoiceOne s consumer loan portfolio is primarily monitored on an exception basis. Loans where payments are past due are turned over to the applicable Bank s collection department, which works with the borrower to bring payments current or take other actions when necessary. In addition to internal reviews of credit performance, ChoiceOne contracts with a third party for independent loan review that monitors the loan approval process and the credit quality of the loan portfolio.

The process to monitor the credit quality of ChoiceOne s loan portfolio includes tracking 1 the risk ratings of business loans, 2 the level of classified business loans, and 3 delinquent and nonperforming consumer loans. Business loans are risk rated on a scale of 1 to 9. A description of the characteristics of the ratings follows: 
 
 Risk Rating 1 through 5 or pass: These loans are considered pass credits. They exhibit acceptable credit risk and demonstrate the ability to repay the loan from normal business operations. 
 
 Risk rating 6 or special mention: Loans and other credit extensions bearing this grade are considered to be inadequately protected by the current sound worth and debt service capacity of the borrower or of any pledged collateral. These obligations, even if apparently protected by collateral value, have well-defined weaknesses related to adverse financial, managerial, economic, market, or political conditions that have clearly jeopardized repayment of principal and interest as originally intended. Furthermore, there is the possibility that ChoiceOne Bank will sustain some future loss if such weaknesses are not corrected. Clear loss potential, however, does not have to exist in any individual assets classified as substandard. Loans falling into this category should have clear action plans and timelines with benchmarks to determine which direction the relationship will move. 
 Risk rating 7 or substandard: Loans and other credit extensions graded 7 have all the weaknesses inherent in those graded 6 , with the added characteristic that the severity of the weaknesses makes collection or liquidation in full highly questionable or improbable based upon currently existing facts, conditions, and values. Loans in this classification should be evaluated for non-accrual status. All nonaccrual commercial and Retail loans must be at a minimum graded a risk code 7 . 
 Risk rating 8 or doubtful: Loans and other credit extensions bearing this grade have been determined to have the extreme probability of some loss, but because of certain important and reasonably specific factors, the amount of loss cannot be determined. Such pending factors could include merger or liquidation, additional capital injection, refinancing plans, or perfection of liens on additional collateral. 
 Risk rating 9 or loss: Loans in this classification are considered uncollectible and cannot be justified as a viable asset of ChoiceOne Bank. This classification does not mean the loan has absolutely no recovery value, but that it is neither practical nor desirable to defer writing off this loan even though partial recovery may be obtained in the future.

Goodwill adjustment from merger with Community Shores Bank Corporation 
 Balance, end of year 

Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated annually for impairment and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. The goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, and an impairment charge would be recognized for any amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. Accounting pronouncements allow a company to first perform a qualitative assessment for goodwill prior to a quantitative assessment (Step 1 assessment). If the results of the qualitative assessment indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, then a quantitative assessment must be performed. If not, there is no further assessment required. The Company acquired Valley Ridge Financial Corp. in 2006, County in 2019, and Community Shores in 2020, which resulted in the recognition of goodwill of million, million and million, respectively. 
 
 We conducted an annual assessment of goodwill as of June 30, 2022 and impairment was identified. The Company used a qualitative assessment to determine goodwill was not impaired as of June 30, 2022. 
 
 Additionally, the Company engaged a third party valuation firm to assist in performing a quantitative analysis of goodwill as of November 30, 2022 "the valuation date"). In deriving the fair value of the reporting unit (the Bank), the third -party firm assessed general economic conditions and outlook; industry and market considerations and outlook; the impact of recent events to financial performance; the market price of ChoiceOne s common stock and other relevant events. In addition, the valuation relied on financial projections through 2027 and growth rates prepared by management. Based on the valuation prepared, it was determined that ChoiceOne's estimated fair value of the reporting unit at the valuation date was greater than its book value and impairment of goodwill was not required. 

Management concurred with the conclusion derived from the quantitative goodwill analysis as of the valuation date and determined that there were
 no material changes and that
 no triggering events had occurred that indicated impairment from the valuation date through
 December 31, 2022, and as a result that it is more likely than
 not that there was
 no goodwill impairment as of
 December 31, 2022.

pay-floating/receive-fixed interest rate swaps (the Pay Floating Swap Agreements for a total notional amount of million that were designated as cash flow hedges. These derivatives hedge the variable cash flows of specifically identified available-for-sale securities, cash and loans. The Pay Floating Swap Agreements were determined to be highly effective during the periods presented and therefore no amount of ineffectiveness has been included in net income. The Pay Floating Swap Agreements will pay a coupon rate equal to SOFR while receiving a fixed coupon rate of . 
 
 Net cash settlements received for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, on pay-floating/ received-fixed swaps were as of December 31, 2022, which were included in interest income. 
 
 In the second quarter of 2022, ChoiceOne entered into forward starting pay-fixed/receive-floating interest rate swap (the Pay Fixed Swap Agreement for a notional amount of million that was designated as a cash flow hedge. This derivative hedges the risk of variability in cash flows attributable to forecasted payments on future deposits or floating rate borrowings indexed to the SOFR Rate. The Pay Fixed Swap Agreement is two years forward starting with an eight -year term set to expire in 2032. The Pay Fixed Swap Agreements will pay a fixed coupon rate of while receiving the SOFR Rate. 
 
 In the fourth quarter of 2022, ChoiceOne entered into pay-fixed/receive-floating interest rate swaps for a total notional amount of million that were designated as fair value hedges. These derivatives hedge the risk of changes in fair value of certain available for sale securities for changes in the SOFR benchmark interest rate component of the fixed rate bonds. All of these hedges were effective immediately on December 22, 2022. Of the total notional value, million has a ten -year term set to expire in 2032, with the benchmark SOFR interest rate risk component of the fixed rate bonds equal to . Of the total notional value, million has a nine -year term set to expire in 2031, with the benchmark SOFR interest rate risk component of the fixed rate bonds equal to . The remaining notional value of million has a nine -year term set to expire in 2031, with the benchmark SOFR interest rate risk component of the fixed rate bonds equal to . ChoiceOne adopted ASC2022 - 01, as of December 20, 2022, to use the portfolio layer method. The fair value basis adjustment associated with an available-for-sale fixed rate bonds initially results in an adjustment to AOCI. For available-for-sale securities subject to fair value hedge accounting, the changes in the fair value of the fixed rate bonds related to the hedged risk (the benchmark interest rate component and the partial term) are then reclassed from AOCI to current earnings offsetting the fair value measurement change of the interest rate swap, which is also recorded in current earnings. Net cash settlements are received/paid semi-annually, with the first starting in March 2023, and will be included in interest income. 
 
 Subsequent to December 31, 2022, ChoiceOne terminated all pay-floating/receive-fixed pay floating swap agreements interest rate swaps with a notational amount of million which resulted in a loss of million. The pay floating swap agreements were designated as cash flow hedges against specifically identified available-for-sale securities, cash and loans. The loss was capitalized to available for sale securities and loans on the statement of financial condition and will be amortized into interest income over 13 months, or the remaining period of the agreements. Refer to footnote 23 for further discussion. 

Interest rate caps 
 ChoiceOne also uses interest rate caps to provide stability to net interest income and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. Interest rate caps designated as hedges involve the payment of a fixed premium by ChoiceOne who will then receive payments equivalent to the spread between the current rate and the strike rate until the conclusion of the term from the counterparty. 
 
 In the second quarter of 2022, ChoiceOne entered into forward starting interest rate cap agreements with a total notional amount of million SOFR Cap Agreements ). Three of the SOFR Cap Agreements with a total notional amount of million are designated as fair value hedges and hedge against changes in the fair value of certain fixed rate tax-exempt municipal bonds. ChoiceOne utilizes the interest rate caps as hedges against adverse changes in interest rates on the designated securities attributable to fluctuations in the SOFR rate above , as applicable. An increase in the benchmark interest rate hedged reduces the fair value of these assets. The remaining SOFR Cap Agreement with a notional amount of million is designated as a cash flow hedge and hedges against the risk of variability in cash flows attributable to fluctuations in the SOFR rate above for forecasted payments on future deposits or borrowings indexed to the SOFR Rate. All of the SOFR Cap Agreements are two -year forward starting with an eight -year term set to expire in 2032. The initial amount excluded from hedge effectiveness testing and amortized into earnings over the life of the interest rate cap derivatives is million. 
 
 In the fourth quarter of 2022, ChoiceOne sold all four of the SOFR Cap Agreements for a total of , which resulted in a loss of . Of the total loss, was related to the SOFR Cap Agreements designated as a cash flow hedge and recognized immediately in interest expense. The remaining loss of was related to the SOFR Cap Agreements designated as fair value hedges and was capitalized to available for sale securities on the statement of financial condition and will be amortized into interest income over the weighted average life of the available for sale securities hedged.

Cumulative Preferred Securities trust preferred securities at per security in a December 2004 offering. The proceeds from the sale of the trust preferred securities were used by the Capital Trust to purchase an equivalent amount of subordinated debentures from Community Shores. The trust preferred securities and subordinated debentures carry a floating rate of over the 3 -month LIBOR and the rate was at December 31, 2022 and at December 31, 2021. The stated maturity is December 30, 2034. The trust preferred securities are redeemable at par value on any interest payment date and are, in effect, guaranteed by ChoiceOne. Interest on the subordinated debentures is payable quarterly on March 30, June 30, September 30 and December 30. ChoiceOne is not considered the primary beneficiary of the Capital Trust (under the variable interest entity rules), therefore the Capital Trust is not consolidated in the consolidated financial statements, rather the subordinated debentures are shown as a liability, and the interest expense is recorded in the consolidated statement of income. 
 
 The terms of the subordinated debentures, the trust preferred securities and the agreements under which they were issued give ChoiceOne the right, from time to time, to defer payment of interest for up to 20 consecutive quarters, unless certain specified events of default have occurred and are continuing. The deferral of interest payments on the subordinated debentures results in the deferral of distributions on the trust preferred securities. 
 
 In September 2021, ChoiceOne completed a private placement of million in aggregate principal amount of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due 2031. The notes will initially bear interest at a fixed interest rate of 3.25 per annum until September 3, 2026, after which time the interest rate will reset quarterly to a floating rate equal to a benchmark rate, which is expected to be the then current three -month term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") plus basis points until the notes maturity on September 3, 2031. The notes are redeemable by ChoiceOne, in whole or in part, on or after September 3, 2026, and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events. The notes have been structured to qualify as Tier 2 capital for ChoiceOne for regulatory capital purposes. ChoiceOne used a portion of net proceeds from the private placement to redeem senior debt, fund common stock repurchases, and support bank-level capital ratios.

The estimated fair values approximate the carrying amounts for all financial instruments except those described later in this paragraph. The methodology for determining the estimated fair value for securities available for sale is described in Note 18. The estimated fair value for loans follows an exit price approach, which incorporates discounts for credit, liquidity, and marketability. The allowance for loan losses is considered to be a reasonable estimate of discount for credit quality concerns. The estimated fair value of loans also included the mark to market adjustments related to the Company s mergers. 
 
 The estimated fair value of deposits is based on comparing the average rate paid on deposits compared to the three month LIBOR rate which is assumed to be the replacement value of these deposits. The estimated fair values for time deposits and FHLB advances are based on the rates paid at December 31 for new deposits or FHLB advances, applied until maturity. The estimated fair values for other financial instruments and off-balance sheet loan commitments are considered nominal.

Securities classified as available for sale are generally reported at fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs. ChoiceOne s external investment advisor obtained fair value measurements from an independent pricing service that uses matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique widely used in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities' relationship to other benchmark quoted securities (Level 2 inputs). The fair value measurements considered observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows and the bonds' terms and conditions, among other things. Securities classified in Level 2 included U.S. Government and federal agency securities, state and municipal securities, mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds, and asset backed securities. The Company classified certain state and municipal securities and corporate bonds, and equity securities as Level 3. Based on the lack of observable market data, estimated fair values were based on the observable data available and reasonable unobservable market data.

Of the Level 3 assets that were held by the Company at December 31, 2022, the net unrealized gain as of December 31, 2022 was , compared to as of December 31, 2021. The change in the net unrealized gain or loss is recognized in noninterest income or other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets and income statements. Amounts recognized in noninterest income relate to changes in equity securities. A total of and of Level 3 securities were purchased in 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Both observable and unobservable inputs may be used to determine the fair value of positions classified as Level 3 assets and liabilities. As a result, the unrealized gains and losses for these assets and liabilities presented in the tables above may include changes in fair value that were attributable to both observable and unobservable inputs. 
 
 Available for sale investment securities categorized as Level 3 assets consist of bonds issued by local municipalities and a trust-preferred security. The Company estimates the fair value of these assets based on the present value of expected future cash flows using management s best estimate of key assumptions, including forecasted interest yield and payment rates, credit quality and a discount rate commensurate with the current market and other risks involved. 
 
 The Company also has assets that under certain conditions are subject to measurement at fair value on a non-recurring basis. These assets are not normally measured at fair value, but can be subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as impairment. Disclosures concerning assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis are as follows:

Impaired loans categorized as Level 3 assets consist of non-homogeneous loans that are considered impaired. The Company estimates the fair value of the loans based on the present value of expected future cash flows using management s best estimate of key assumptions. These assumptions include future payment ability, timing of payment streams, and estimated realizable values of available collateral (typically based on outside appraisals). The changes in fair value consisted of charge-downs of impaired loans that were posted to the allowance for loan losses and write-downs of other real estate owned that were posted to a valuation account. The fair value of other real estate owned was based on appraisals or other reviews of property values, adjusted for estimated costs to sell. 

Commitments to fund loans (at market rates) 

Commitments to fund loans are generally made for periods of 180 days or less. The fixed rate loan commitments have interest rates ranging from to and maturities ranging from year to years.

million which resulted in a loss of million. The pay floating swap agreements were designated as cash flow hedges against specifically identified available-for-sale securities, cash and loans. The loss was capitalized to available for sale securities and loans on the statement of financial condition and will be amortized into interest income over 13 months, or the remaining period of the agreements. 
 
 With the rapid increase in interest rates during 2022 and 2023 the pay floating swap agreements were in a loss position. At termination, the expected negative carry for the remainder of the term was greater than the exit price of the agreements. 
 
 ChoiceOne has four remaining interest rate swaps with a total notional value of million. These derivative instruments increase in value as long-term interest rates rise, which offsets the reduction in equity due to unrealized losses on securities available for sale.

 Controls and Procedures 

An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on and as of the time of that evaluation, the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and principal financial officer, concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods. 
 
 Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting that is designed to produce reliable financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The system of internal control over financial reporting as it relates to the financial statements is evaluated for effectiveness by management and tested for reliability through a program of internal audits. Actions are taken to correct potential deficiencies as they are identified. Any system of internal control, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations, including the possibility that a control can be circumvented or overridden and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, because of changes in conditions, internal control effectiveness may vary over time. Accordingly, even an effective system of internal control will provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. 
 
 Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s system of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Management s assessment is based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting as described in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). Based on this assessment, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, its system of internal control over financial reporting was effective and meets the criteria of the Internal Control Integrated Framework." 
 
 There was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2022 that has materially affected, or that is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Exhibit 4.4 

Description of Rights of Shareholders 

General 

The authorized capital stock of ChoiceOne Financial Services, Inc. ("ChoiceOne") consists of 15,000,000 shares of common stock, no par value, and 100,000 shares of preferred stock, no par value. 

As of February 28, 2023, there were 7,519,318 shares of ChoiceOne common stock issued and outstanding, and no shares of ChoiceOne preferred stock were outstanding. ChoiceOne's common stock trades on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the trading symbol COFS. ChoiceOne's transfer agent is Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company. 

Each share of common stock has the same relative powers, preferences and rights as, and is identical in all respects with, all the other shares of common stock. Holders of ChoiceOne common stock have no conversion rights and are not entitled to any preemptive or subscription rights. ChoiceOne common stock is not subject to redemption or any further calls or assessments. ChoiceOne common stock does not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors. 

Voting rights 

Each holder of common stock is entitled to one vote for each share held by such shareholder. The ChoiceOne Bylaws provide that any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the ChoiceOne shareholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice, and without a vote, if all the shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting consent in writing. Except as otherwise provided in ChoiceOne's Articles of Incorporation (the "ChoiceOne Articles"), ChoiceOne's Bylaws, or applicable law, a majority of the votes cast at a meeting is required to take any action. Directors are elected by a vote of the plurality of the votes cast with respect to the director at any meeting for the election of directors. 

Number and Classification of Directors 

The ChoiceOne Articles provide that the board of directors is divided into three classes. Each class of directors is as equal as possible in number and serves for a three-year term of office, except that directors may be elected for shorter terms so that approximately one-third of the directors are elected each year. One class of ChoiceOne s directors is elected each year, to hold office for a three-year term (or until their respective successors are elected and qualified, or until their respective resignation or removal). ChoiceOne s board currently consists of 15 directors. 

Dividend policies 

Holders of ChoiceOne common stock are entitled to receive dividends, if any, as may be declared by ChocieOne's board of directors out of assets legally available therefor after payment to holders of any outstanding shares of any class having preference over ChoiceOne common stock as to the payment of dividends. The amount of and nature of any dividends declared on ChoiceOne common stock will be determined by ChoiceOne's board of directors in their sole discretion. 

Liquidation rights 

In the event ChoiceOne liquidates, dissolves or winds up, each holder of ChoiceOne common stock will be entitled to receive a pro rata portion of all assets available for distribution, after ChoiceOne pays or provides for payment of all of ChoiceOne's debts and liabilities and of any amounts owing to holders of any outstanding shares of any class having preference over ChoiceOne common stock in such event. 

Issuance of additional shares 

In the future, ChoiceOne's board of directors may authorize the issuance of additional shares of common stock and preferred stock, in one or more series, up to the amounts authorized in the ChoiceOne Articles. Generally, no shareholder approval would be required for the issuance of these additional shares, subject only to the restrictions of the Michigan Business Corporation Act and the ChoiceOne Articles. 

Modification of Rights of Shareholders 

The ChoiceOne Articles may be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding ChoiceOne shares entitled to vote, except that certain provisions of the ChoiceOne Articles related to directors, interested party transactions, business combinations and tender or exchange offers, and amendment of the ChoiceOne Articles may be amended only by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3 of the outstanding ChoiceOne shares entitled to vote. ChoiceOne's Bylaws may be amended by the affirmative vote of a majority of the board of directors or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding ChoiceOne shares entitled to vote. 

Business Combination Restrictions 

The ChoiceOne Articles include certain provisions related to business combinations with a person who owns 10 or more of the outstanding ChoiceOne stock or who is an affiliate who in the past two years owned 10 or more of the outstanding ChoiceOne stock. Such business combinations require approval by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3 of outstanding ChoiceOne stock (other than stock held by certain related persons involved in such business combination). However, approval by the affirmative vote of the holders of only a majority of outstanding ChoiceOne stock is required if the business combination has been approved by a vote of a majority of disinterested directors or if payment to shareholders in connection with the business combination is solely in cash and certain additional conditions are met.
