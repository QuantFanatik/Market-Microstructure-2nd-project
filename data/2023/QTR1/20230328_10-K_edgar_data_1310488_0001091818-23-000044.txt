SPECIAL
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

In
light of the risks and uncertainties inherent in all projected operational matters, the inclusion of forward-looking statements in this
Form 10-K, should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that any of our objectives or plans will be achieved
or that any of our operating expectations will be realized. Our revenues and results of operations are difficult to forecast and
could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K, as a result of certain risks
and uncertainties including, but not limited to, our business reliance on third parties to provide us with technology, our ability to
integrate and manage acquired technology, assets, companies and personnel, changes in market condition, the volatile and intensely competitive
environment in the business sectors in which we operate, rapid technological change, and our dependence on key and scarce employees in
a competitive market for skilled personnel. These factors should not be considered exhaustive; we undertake no obligation to release
publicly the results of any future revisions we may make to forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date
hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

ITEM
1. Business . 

The
Company 

BioForce
Nanosciences Holdings, Inc. BioForce or the Company was previously in the business of manufacturing nano-particular
measurement devices and molecular printers, but due to a lack of profitability, the subsidiary of the company that owned that technology
filed for bankruptcy. That subsidiary and related technology was later bought out of bankruptcy by an unrelated third party. Subsequently,
new management came into the Company to pursue a better business model and now the Company s mission is to become a leading provider
of natural vitamins, minerals and other nutritional supplements, powders and beverages, formulated to promote a healthier lifestyle for
active individuals in all age ranges. The Company private labels products with key distributors and manufacturing providers. 

BioForce
entered into the supplement business in or about 2015. These supplements, powders and beverages offer vitamins and minerals to
complement a healthy intake of protein and carbohydrates for active individuals and participants in sports. 

BioForce
recently changed its business plan and it is in the process of establishing a dynamic marketing campaign to achieve brand awareness of
its product offerings to drive business growth through sales of nutrition supplements to retailers, sporting goods retailers, supermarkets,
mass merchandisers, and online. BioForce currently markets its products through social media and telemarketing. The Company plans to
expand marketing efforts with a direct marketing and B2B (Business to Business) sales campaign, with the eventual expectation to expand
throughout the entire United States. 

The
Company proactively seeks to expand its BioForce Eclipse nutritional powder for use into households throughout the U.S.,
and the Company will approach retail stores, including health food and sporting goods stores to create a vendor relationship. During
this phase, the Company will continue to try to advance its social media platform with direct online and targeted advertisements to health
conscience individuals. 

Nutrition
retailers, grocery stores, retail pharmacies, and online stores, like Amazon, will be important channels for the Company s Eclipse product-lines.
In The USA, there are thousands of direct outlets like grocery stores, pharmacies, hospitals, department stores, medical clinics, surgery
clinics, universities, nursing homes, prisons, and other facilities which are all targets of potential sales of the vitamin and mineral
supplemental products. 

The
Company plans to offer its products for direct sales on its website at www.bioforceeclipse.com . 

- 2 - 

The
approximate 35.0 billion vitamin and supplement manufacturing industry grows on average 2.5 annually. 

The
Company will seek out retail sales opportunities with gyms, health clubs, and fitness centers with incentive base sales agreements based
on volume of sales obtained. 

Currently,
the Company BioForce Eclipse, a private label brand powder supplements. The product is a mixture of amino acids, key vitamins, and other
plant based proteins, essential to the physical well-being of the individual. Protein supplements are known to promote muscular growth,
so athletes or others often take them as a dietary supplement to gain muscle mass. 

Nutritional
Products are made up of a wide range of products, which include supplements, meal replacement products, multivitamins, and convenience
products. As these products have increased in popularity, more individuals have been attempting to get in optimal physical condition,
wanting to use products that complement their lifestyles, exercise, or athletic regimen. BioForce s Management is aware of other potential
products and will continue to evaluate these potential markets and possible new products lines. 

BioForce
entered into a market that has some reputable players, but has limited leadership. BioForce will work to get the product available through
most retail channels, so that customers will see both convenience in purchasing the product, and convenience over having to take numerous
different supplements. After BioForce launches its products into the sports nutrition supplement industry, it is anticipated that there
will be other firms that will work to offer similar products. This fact magnifies the importance of BioForce s quality and its support
of its products. 

The
initial marketing efforts will focus on the online stores, B2B sales, direct mail, industry trade shows, conventions, and affiliate marketing
designed to educate prospective users and distributors, including retail channels, doctors and gyms. Less direct methods will include
TV and radio advertising until such time as the Company s budget allows it to upgrade its marketing plan and to do so effectively. 

BioForce
Nanosciences Holdings, Inc. maintains an executive office in Virginia Beach, Virginia. All marketing, sales, and customer support will
be managed from its Virginia Beach Office. Private labeling is done on a contractual basis unless an opportunity to vertically integrate
production makes fiscal sense. 

BioForce
Nanosciences Holdings sells the BioForce Eclipse powder multivitamin and mineral supplement without non-compete and non-disclosure agreements.
The Company currently private labels the powder through a manufacturer located in Virginia. The Company has a Supplier Agreement with
this manufacturer that gives the Company non-exclusion rights to market the product. The distributor owns the rights to the formula
for this product. If the Company can source product in a more cost-effective way without diminished quality, the Company would
evaluate such opportunities when presented. Currently, the distributor who provides the private label powder provides Consignment
Terms, which allows us to only pay for the product when it is sold. 

In
addition to manufacturing the product, this private label vitamin distributor also offers custom labeling and packaging of the product.
BioForce utilizes these services, and will seek out examples from other potential manufacturer and distributor of future products to
ensure that the quality of work reflects the Company s standards for presentation and quality.

The
FDA has rules regarding the fitness for consumption of foods as well as vitamins and supplements sold to the public, and those laws apply
to our product. However, our product does not require pre-clearance like a drug in order to be sold into the marketplace. 

BioForce s
management understands that similar competing products are available to the consumer, and customers may consider switching from BioForce
Eclipse to a competitor s product. Manufacturers and distributors who provide private label services generally incentives larger orders,
which the Company might not be financially able to provide. Management remains conscience of changes in the marketplace, its relationship
with the Private Label manufacture distributor, and other risk associated with supply chain issues. 

BioForce s
dietary supplements and vitamins cannot take the place of a well-balanced diet. Some people believe that the ingestion of supplements,
pills and beverages can make up for poor eating habits; but vitamin and mineral supplements don t offer a wellness solution. None of
BioForces products are approved by the FDA and are sold without doctors prescriptions through the Company s marketing channels. 

The
Company caters to the needs of customers with a focus on the elderly and athletes across numerous sports, ages, and economic backgrounds. 

The
Company plans to offer numerous products beyond nutritional supplement powder, but will only offer products that advance the BioForce
product-line name, BioForce Eclipse (See Fig. 1-product labels). 

The
aging baby boomers, report regular use of multivitamin and multi-mineral supplements at a higher rate than other demographic group. Recent
surveys have indicated that women, Caucasians, individuals with higher education levels, people with lower body mass indexes and people
with higher physical activity levels were more likely to use supplements. These groups were also most likely to talk to a doctor about
the need for supplements, because they knew about their benefits, they are subject to a higher risk of deficiencies, or had a family
history of medical type issues. 

Health
conscience Baby Boomers, sports participants, and other active individuals continue to extend their health education awareness.
The industry s traditional focus on these groups is shifting to an ever-expanding group that includes recreational and lifestyle users,
such as fitness enthusiasts, weekend athletes and gym-goers, of all ages. 

BioForce
will provide its consumer base with products that serve their health needs, and which add value even beyond their needs. The Company
first introduced its multivitamin and mineral supplemental powder product, BioForce Eclipse in December, 2014. With the introduction
of this first product, BioForce advances the Company s name offering additional products that meet the standards for a healthy lifestyle.
 BioForce Eclipse is a private label branding produced by Body Align, LLC from a distributor located in Virginia, USA. 

The
Company had no customer during its 2021 and 2022 fiscal years. Customers are not required to purchase the product in the future and the
Company s marketing plan is to broaden the Company s customer base. 

The
Company intends to increase its U.S. market share by offering new incentives and promotions to attract customers on trying its products.
The Company intends to market a new biodegradable, recyclable container of its products to attract enviromentally conscience customers
and to develop new markets. BioForce will evaluate the success of its marketing objectives and determine which marketing strategy provides
the best results. As sale volumes increase, we expect that it will become necessary to hire sales associates. 

The
Company in May 2020 formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Element Acquisition Corporation, a Wyoming corporation, with unlimited common shares
authorized, par value 0.001. Element Acquisition Corporation was formed to pursue potential acquisitions in the media, entertainment,
media technology and sports sectors. The Company on October 15, 2020 changed the name of its wholly-owned subsidiary Element Acquisition
Corporation, a Wyoming corporation, to BioForce Nanosciences Holdings, Inc, a Wyoming corporation. On December 14, 2021, the Company
changed the name of its wholly-owned subsidiary to Element Global, Inc.

Coronavirus
Impact (COVID-19) 

Due
to the recent outbreak of the coronavirus reported in many countries worldwide, local and federal governments have issued travel advisories,
canceled large scale public events and closed schools. In addition, companies have begun to cancel conferences and travel plans and require
employees to work from home. Global financial markets have also experienced extreme volatility and disruptions to capital and credit
markets. 

Adverse
events such as health-related concerns about working in our offices, the inability to travel, potential impact on our business partners
and customers, and other matters affecting the general work and business environment could harm our business and delay the implementation
of our business strategy.

Management
is currently aware of the global and domestic issues arising from the Covid-19 pandemic and the possible direct and indirect effects
on the Company s operations which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s current financial position, future results of
operations, or liquidity, because its current operations are limited. However, investors should also be aware of factors, which includes
the possibility of Covid-19 effects on operational status, could have a negative impact on the Company s prospects and the consistency
of progress in the areas of revenue generation, liquidity, and generation of capital resources. These may include: (i) variations in
revenue, (ii) possible inability to attract investors for its equity securities or otherwise raise adequate funds from any source should
the company seek to do so, (iii) increased governmental regulation or significant changes in that regulation, (iv) increased competition,
(v) unfavorable outcomes to litigation involving the Company or to which the Company may become a party in the future, and (vi) a very
competitive and rapidly changing operating environment. The adverse events may also adversely impact our ability to raise capital or
to continue as a going concern. We continue to monitor the recent outbreak of the coronavirus on our operations. The global economic
slowdown and the other risks and uncertainties associated with the pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and growth prospects. In addition, to the extent the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the
Company s business and results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks and uncertainties which
the Company faces. 

Going
Concern 

On
December 31, 2022, we had total assets of 734 and total liabilities of 1,348,011. In the absence of significant revenue and profits,
we will be completely dependent on additional debt and equity financing. If we are unable to raise needed funds on acceptable terms,
we will not be able to execute our business plan, develop or enhance existing services, take advantage of future opportunities, if any,
or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements. If we do not obtain sufficient capital, we will not be able to continue
operations. 

As
of December 31, 2022, BioForce had an accumulated deficit of 160,157,776, which included a net loss of 485,514. Also, during the year
ended December 31 2022, we used net cash of 68,389 for operating activities. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability
to continue as a going concern. 

While
we are attempting to generate revenues, our cash position may not be significant enough to support our daily operations. Management
intends to raise additional funds by way of an offering of our debt or equity securities. Management believes that the actions
presently being taken to further implement our business plan and generate revenues provide the opportunity for BioForce to continue as
a going concern. While we believe in the viability of our strategy to generate revenues and in our ability to raise additional
funds, we may not be successful. 

Our
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our capability to raise additional funds and to further implement our business
plan and generate revenues. 

Results
of Operations 

Year
Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021. 

Revenues
for the Company s year ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 totaled -0- from the sales of its vitamin supplements. 

Cost
of Goods Sold for the year ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 totaled -0- . Company had -0- unit sales of the BioForce
Eclipse supplement product in 2022 and 2021. 

Gross
margins for year ended December 2022 and 2021 was -0- due to -0- units sold of the BioForce Eclipse supplement product. 

Gross
profit for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was -0- due to -0- sales of the Company s vitamin supplements. 

General
and Administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 totaled 62,514 compared to 78,955 for December 31, 2021, primarily
due to decreases in professional service fees. 

Net
Loss 

Net

Liquidity
and Capital Resources: 

As
of December 31, 2022, our assets totaled 734 in cash. The Company s total liabilities were 1,348,011 which consisted of accounts payable
and accrued expenses, accrued board of directors compensation and amounts due to related parties. As of December 31, 2022, the Company
had an accumulated deficit of 160,157,776 and working capital deficit of 1,347,277. 

The
Company s significant operating losses raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. As indicated herein, we need capital
for the implementation of our business plan, and we will need additional capital for continuing our operations. We do not have
sufficient revenues to pay our operating expenses at this time. Unless the Company is able to raise working capital, it is likely
that the Company will either have to cease operations or substantially change its methods of operations or change its business plan.
For the next 12 months the Company has an oral commitment from its Chairman, Merle Ferguson, to advance funds as necessary to meeting
our operating requirement. 

Investing

Net
cash used in investing activities was 0 for both calendar years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021. 

Cash
from Financing Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was 58,018 for year ended December 31, 2022, and was 49,012 for year ended December 31, 2021. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Our
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in
the United States. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that impact the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application
of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies include revenue recognition and impairment of long-lived assets. 

Revenue
Recognition 

In
accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 ), revenues are recognized when control of the
promised goods or services is transferred to our clients, in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled
in exchange for those goods and services. To achieve this core principle, we apply the following five steps: 1) Identify the contract
with a client; (2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) Determine the transaction price; (4) Allocate the transaction
price to performance obligations in the contract; and (5) Recognize revenues when or as the company satisfies a performance obligation. 

We
adopted this ASC on January 1, 2018. Although the new revenue standard is expected to have an immaterial impact, if any, on our ongoing
net income, we did implement changes to our processes related to revenue recognition and the control activities within them. 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

We
account for employee and non-employee stock-based compensation in accordance with the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock
Compensation, which requires all share-based payments, including grants of stock options, to be recognized in the financial
statements based on their fair values. The fair value of the equity instrument is charged directly to compensation expense and
credited to additional paid-in capital over the period during which services are rendered. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

The
Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and is evaluating any that may impact its financial statements,
including revenue recognition. The Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been
issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

ITEM
9A. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end
of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management
recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints, and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative
to their costs. 

Based
on our evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, after considering the existence of material weaknesses
identified, determined that our internal control over financial reporting disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of
December 31, 2022. 

Evaluation
of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

Our
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that
in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets, (ii) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of our management and directors,
and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our
assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management,
including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). 

- 11 - 

We
identified the following deficiencies which together constitute a material weakness in our assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022: 

-
The Company has inadequate segregation of duties within its cash disbursement control design. 

- During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company internally performed all aspects of its financial reporting process, including,
but not limited to the underlying accounting records and the recording of journal entries and for the preparation of financial statements.
This process was deficient, because these duties were performed often times by the same people, and therefore a lack of review was created
over the financial reporting process that might result in a failure to detect errors in spreadsheets, calculations, or assumptions used
to compile the financial statements and related disclosures as filed with the SEC. These control deficiencies could result in a material
misstatement to our interim or annual financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. 

It
should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about
the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control system, there can be no assurance that any
design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over
financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to
rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management s report in this annual report. 

We
regularly review our system of internal control over financial reporting to ensure that we maintain an effective internal control environment.
If deficiencies appear in our internal controls, management will make changes that address those deficiencies. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2022
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BioForce Nanosciences Holdings, Inc. as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 

Substantial Doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 4 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a significant accumulated deficit. In addition, the Company continues to experience negative cash flows from operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 4. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion 

Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
