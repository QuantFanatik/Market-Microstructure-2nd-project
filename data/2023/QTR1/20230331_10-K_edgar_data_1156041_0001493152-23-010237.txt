PART
I 

Item 1. 
 Business 

General 

Houston
American Energy Corp is an independent oil and gas company focused on the development, exploration, exploitation, acquisition, and production
of natural gas and crude oil properties. Our principal properties, and operations, are in the U.S. Permian Basin and the South American
country of Colombia. Additionally, we have properties in the U.S. Gulf Coast region, particularly Texas and Louisiana. 

We
focus on early identification of, and opportunistic entrance into, existing and emerging resource plays. We do not operate properties
but typically seek to partner with, or invest along-side, larger operators in the development of resources or retain interests, with
or without contribution on our part, in prospects identified, packaged and promoted to larger operators. By entering these plays earlier,
identifying stranded blocks and partnering with, investing along-side or promoting to, larger operators, we believe we can capture larger
resource potential at lower cost and minimize our exposure to drilling risks and costs and ongoing operating costs. 

We,
along with our partners, actively manage our resources through opportunistic acquisitions and divestitures where reserves can be identified,
developed, monetized and financial resources redeployed with the objective of growing reserves, production and shareholder value. 

Properties 

Our
exploration and development projects are focused on existing property interests, and future acquisition of additional property interests,
in the Texas Permian Basin, the South American country of Colombia and the onshore Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast region. 

Each
of our property interests differ in scope and character and consists of one or more types of assets, such as 3-D seismic data, owned
mineral interests, leasehold positions, lease options, working interests in leases, partnership or limited liability company interests,
corporate equity interests or other mineral rights. Our percentage interest in each property represents the portion of the interest in
the property we share with other partners in the property. Because each property consists of a bundle of assets that may or may not include
a working interest in the project, our stated interest in a property simply represents our proportional ownership in the bundle of assets
that constitute the property. Therefore, our interest in a property should not be confused with the working interest that we will own
when a given well is drilled. Each of our exploration and development projects represents a negotiated transaction between the project
partners relating to one or more properties. Our working interest may be higher or lower than our stated interest.

In
2022, our net acreage in the U.S. decreased as a result of lease expirations in Hockley County, Texas (730 net acres) and Yoakum County,
Texas (41 net acres). In Colombia, we increased our net acreage position (up 18,038 net acres) by increasing our ownership interest in
Hupecol Meta from 7.85 to approximately 18 , which was partially offset by the relinquishment of our rights in our long-disputed Serrania
block. As a result, we effectively increased our interest in the underlying assets of Hupecol Meta to an approximately 16 interest in
the 69,128 acre Venus Exploration Area and an approximately 8.0 interest in 570,277 additional acres in which Hupecol Meta holds a 50 
interest (resulting in an increase in our interest in the CPO-11 block by 31,884 net acres; offset by the decrease in our interest in
the 13,846 net acre Serrania block).

United States Properties: 

In
the United States, our principal properties and operations are located in the on-shore Permian Basin and Gulf Coast regions of Louisiana
and Texas. 

Texas
Properties Permian Basin 

Reeves
County . We hold a 18.1 average working interest in 320 gross acres in Reeves County, Texas, consisting of (1) the 160 gross acre
Johnson Lease, in which we hold a 25 working interest, subject to a proportionate 5 back-in after payout, and (2) the 160 gross acre
O Brien Lease, in which we hold an average 11.2 working interest. Our Reeves County acreage lies within the Delaware sub-basin
of the Permian Basin, with resource potential in the Wolfcamp, Bone Spring and Avalon formations. During 2017, we drilled and completed
our initial wells on both lease blocks, the Johnson State #1H well and the O Brien #3H well, both horizontally drilled and hydraulically
fractured wells in the Wolfcamp A formation. The Johnson #1H well and O Brien #3H well were both placed on gas lift during 2021
and were producing at December 31, 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our production in Reeves County totaled 5,679 barrels
of oil and 73,635 mcf of natural gas. 

As
of December 31, 2022, no additional development or drilling operations are planned with respect to our Reeves County acreage. 

Yoakum
County . We hold a 12.5 working interest, subject to a proportionate 10 back-in after payout, in an approximately 360 gross acre
block in Yoakum County, Texas and hold a 100 working interest in 46.1 gross acres subject to our obligation to offer participation in
that acreage to our partners in the area of mutual interest associates with our Yoakum County acreage. Our Yoakum County acreage lies
within the Midland sub-basin of the Permian Basin. 

During
2019, we drilled the Frost #1H well, the first well on our Yoakum County acreage. The well was horizontally drilled, hydraulically fractured
in the San Andres Formation and completed and commenced production in mid-2019. A second well on our Yoakum County acreage, the Frost
#2H well, was horizontally drilled, hydraulically fractured in the San Andres Formation and completed and commenced production during
the third quarter of 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our production in Yoakum County totaled 5,009 barrels of oil. 

As
of December 31, 2022, no additional development or drilling operations are planned with respect to our Yoakum County acreage.

Louisiana
Properties 

Our
principal producing and exploration properties in Louisiana consist of a 23.437 mineral interest in 2,485 gross acres in East Baton
Rouge Parish. 

There
are no present wells, or plans to conduct drilling operations, on our Louisiana acreage.

Colombian Properties: 

At
December 31, 2022, we held interests in multiple prospects, all operated by Hupecol Operating and affiliates, in Colombia covering 920,841
gross acres. We identify our Colombian prospects by the concessions operated.

 In 2022, we increased our ownership interest Hupecol Meta,
resulting in an increase in our interest in the CPO-11 block with our ownership interest in the Venus Exploration Area increasing to
approximately 18 and our ownership interest in the remainder of the block increasing to approximately 8 . 

At
December 31, 2022, we held interests in three concessions operated by Hupecol Operating Co. related entities in Colombia. The CPO-11
concession, including the Venus Exploration Area, is located in the Llanos Basin and is owned and operated by Hupecol Meta. The Loc Picachos
and Macaya concessions are located in the Caguan Putumayo Basin of Colombia. The concessions cover an aggregate area of 920,841 gross
acres. 

CPO-11 

During
2019, we acquired a two percent ownership interest in Hupecol Meta, LLC Hupecol Meta ). Hupecol Meta owns the 639,405 gross
acre CPO-11 block in the Llanos Basin in Colombia. The CPO-11 block is comprised of the 69,128 acre Venus Exploration area and 570,277
acres which was 50 farmed out by Hupecol to Parex Resources. In 2021, Hupecol Meta increased its ownership interest in the CPO-11 block
and we agreed to contribute 99,716. In 2022, we acquired additional interests in Hupecol Meta for an aggregate of 657,638. As a result
of our acquisition of additional interests in 2021 and 2022, our ownership interest in Hupecol Meta was approximately 18 at December
31, 2022. Through our ownership interest in Hupecol Meta, at December 31, 2022, we hold an approximately 16 interest in the Venus Exploration
Area and an approximately 8 interest in the remainder of the CPO-11 block. 

The
CPO-11 block covers almost 1,000 square miles with multiple identified leads and prospects. During 2022, in the Venus Exploration Area,
Hupecol Meta drilled and completed the Saturno ST1 well and drilled the Bugalu1 well. At December 31, 2022, the Saturno ST1 well and
the Venus 2A legacy well, that was previously shut-in, were on production and the Bugalu 1 well was awaiting testing. All wells drilled
to date in the Venus Exploration Area are vertical wells. In early 2023, a determination was made to defer testing on, and temporarily
abandon, the Bugalu 1 well, in order to focus efforts and resources on drilling an initial horizontal well in the Venus Exploration Area.
Drilling operations on the CPO-11 block in 2023 and beyond are expected to be focused on efforts to secure seismic data covering the
Venus Exploration Area, delineating future drilling sites based on that data and, subject to market conditions and analysis of such data,
drilling one or more horizontal wells, and possibly additional vertical wells, in the Venus Exploration Area. 

Our investment in Hupecol Meta is accounted for using the cost method of
accounting and, accordingly, this report does not include any reserves, production and operating results of Hupecol Meta.

Los
Picachos and Macaya Prospects 

Hupecol
has advised us that they have put on hold plans to begin seismic and other work on the Los Picachos and Macaya concessions until a satisfactory
resolution of the ongoing permitting disputes. The ANH has granted extensions of required development commitments, including seismic
acquisition, until conditions in the area allow operations. 

As
operator of our various prospects, Hupecol has substantial control over the timing of drilling and selection of prospects to be drilled
and we have limited ability to influence the selection of prospects to be drilled or the timing of such drilling operations and have
no effective means of controlling the costs of such drilling operations. Accordingly, our drilling budget is subject to fluctuation based
on the prospects selected to be drilled by Hupecol, the decisions of Hupecol regarding timing of such drilling operations and the ability
of Hupecol to drill and operate wells within estimated budgets. 

Drilling
Activity 

During
2022, we, through Hupecol Meta, drilled two wells in Colombia. The following table summarizes the number of wells drilled during 2022,
2021 and 2020, excluding any wells drilled under farmout agreements, royalty interest ownership, or any other wells in which we do not
have a working interest.

Productive
wells are wells that are found to be capable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities such that proceeds from the sale of the
production exceed production expenses and taxes. As of December 31, 2022, we had no drilling operations in progress. Our Bugalu 1 well
in Colombia was drilled and awaiting testing at December 31, 2022. In early 2023, a determination was made to defer testing on, and temporarily
abandon, the Bugalu 1 well. 

Productive
Wells 

Productive
wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of production, including shut-in wells. A well bore with multiple completions is counted
as only one well. As of December 31, 2022, we owned interests in six gross wells (including indirect interests in wells in Colombia through
our equity interest in Hupecol Meta). As of December 31, 2022, we had interests in productive wells, categorized by geographic area,

Reserve
Estimates 

The
following tables sets forth, by country and as of December 31, 2022, our estimated net proved oil and natural gas reserves, and the estimated
present value (discounted at an annual rate of 10 of estimated future net revenues before future income taxes PV-10 and after future income taxes Standardized Measure of our proved reserves, each prepared in accordance with assumptions
prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). 

The
PV-10 value is a widely used measure of value of oil and natural gas assets and represents a pre-tax present value of estimated cash
flows discounted at ten percent. PV-10 is considered a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the SEC. We believe that our PV-10 presentation
is relevant and useful to our investors because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our proved reserves
before taking into account the related future income taxes, as such taxes may differ among various companies because of differences in
the amounts and timing of deductible basis, net operating loss carry forwards and other factors. We believe investors and creditors use
our PV-10 as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our proved reserves to the reserve estimates of other companies.
PV-10 is not a measure of financial or operating performance under GAAP and is not intended to represent the current market value of
our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. PV-10 should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure
of discounted future net cash flows as defined under GAAP.

(1) 
 In accordance with applicable financial accounting and reporting
standards of the SEC, the estimates of our proved reserves and the PV-10 set forth herein reflect estimated future gross revenue to be
generated from the production of proved reserves, net of estimated production and future development costs, using prices and costs under
existing economic conditions at December 31, 2022. For purposes of determining prices, we used the unweighted arithmetical average of
the prices on the first day of each month within the 12-month period ended December 31, 2022. The average prices utilized for purposes
of estimating our proved reserves were 90.16 per barrel of oil and 5.39 per mcf of natural gas for our US properties, adjusted by property
for energy content, quality, transportation fees and regional price differentials. The prices should not be interpreted as a prediction
of future prices. The amounts shown do not give effect to non-property related expenses, such as corporate general administrative expenses
and debt service, future income taxes or to depreciation, depletion and amortization. 

(2) 
 Natural gas is converted on the basis of six Mcf of gas per
one barrel of oil equivalent. 

(3) 
 Under the cost method of accounting, we do not report any reserves attributable
to our investment in Hupecol Meta. 

(4) 
 The Standard Measure differs from PV-10 only in that the Standard
Measure reflects estimated future income taxes. 

Due
to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, proved reserves are subject to change as additional information
becomes available. The estimates of reserves, future cash flows and present value are based on various assumptions, including those prescribed
by the SEC, and are inherently imprecise. Although we believe these estimates are reasonable, actual future production, cash flows, taxes,
development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary substantially from these
estimates. 

Reserve
Estimation Process, Controls and Technologies 

The
reserve estimates, including PV-10 and Standard Measure estimates, set forth above were prepared by Russell K. Hall Associates,
Inc. for our Permian Basin, Texas reserves. 

These
calculations were prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally accepted by the petroleum industry and in accordance
with SEC financial accounting and reporting standards. 

8 

Our
year-end reserve reports are prepared by reserve engineering firms based upon a review of property interests being appraised, production
from such properties, current costs of operation and development, current prices for production, agreements relating to current and future
operations and sale of production, geosciences and engineering data, and other information provided to them by our management team. Upon
analysis and evaluation of data provided, the reserve engineering firms issue a preliminary appraisal report of our reserves. The preliminary
appraisal report and changes in our reserves are reviewed by our President and board for reasonableness of the results obtained. Once
any questions have been addressed, the reserve engineering firms issue final appraisal reports, reflecting their conclusions. 

Russell
K. Hall Associates is an independent Midland, Texas based professional engineering firm providing reserve evaluation services to
the oil and gas industry. Their report was prepared under the direction of Russell K. Hall, founder and President of Russell K. Hall
 Associates. Mr. Hall holds a BS in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Oklahoma, is a registered professional engineer
and a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers, the Society of Independent Professional Earth Scientists and the West Texas Geological
Society. Mr. Hall has more than 30 years of experience in reserve evaluation for the oil and gas industry and the oil and gas finance
industry. Russell K. Hall Associates, and its employees, have no interest in our company or our properties and were objective in
determining our reserves. 

The
SEC s rules with respect to technologies that a company can use to establish reserves allows use of techniques that have been proved
effective by actual production from projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology
that establishes reasonable certainty. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods)
that have been field tested and have been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the
formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. 

Our
reserve engineering firm used a combination of production and pressure performance, simulation studies, offset analogies, seismic data
and interpretation, geophysical logs and core data to calculate our reserves estimates. 

Proved
Undeveloped Reserves 

We
had no proved undeveloped reserves at either December 31, 2021 or December 31, 2022. 

Developed
and Undeveloped Acreage 

The
following table sets forth the gross and net developed and undeveloped acreage (including both leases and concessions, but excluding
acreage in which we hold a royalty interest but no working interest), categorized by geographical area, which we held as of December
31, 2022:

Developed
acreage is comprised of leased acres that are within an area spaced by or assignable to a productive well and acreage in which we hold
a mineral interest with no potential development related lease expirations. Undeveloped acreage is comprised of leased acres with defined
remaining terms and not within an area spaced by or assignable to a productive well. 

As
is customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we can generally retain our interest in undeveloped acreage by drilling activity that
establishes commercial production sufficient to maintain the leases or by paying delay rentals during the remaining primary term of leases.
The oil and natural gas leases in which we have an interest are for varying primary terms and, if production under a lease continues
from our developed lease acreage beyond the primary term, we are entitled to hold the lease for as long as oil or natural gas is produced. 

The
leases and concessions comprising the U.S. undeveloped acreage set forth in the table above relate primarily to our Yoakum County, Texas
acreage and our Louisiana acreage. The Yoakum County, Texas acreage lease will expire in 2023 unless production from the acreage has
been established prior to such date, in which event the lease or concession will remain in effect until the cessation of production. 

9 

Title
to Properties 

Title
to properties is subject to royalty, overriding royalty, carried working, net profits, working and other similar interests and contractual
arrangements customary in the gas and oil industry, liens for current taxes not yet due and other encumbrances. As is customary in the
industry in the case of undeveloped properties, little investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisition (other than preliminary
review of local records). 

Investigation,
including a title opinion of local counsel, generally is made before commencement of drilling operations. 

Marketing 

At
December 31, 2022, we had no contractual agreements to sell our gas and oil production and all production was sold on spot markets. 

Human
Capital 

As
of December 31, 2022, we had 2 full-time employees and no part time employees. The employees are not covered by a collective bargaining
agreement, and we do not anticipate that any of our future employees will be covered by such agreements. 

Competition 

We
encounter intense competition from other oil and gas companies in all areas of our operations, including the acquisition of producing
properties and undeveloped acreage. Our competitors include major integrated oil and gas companies, numerous independent oil and gas
companies and individuals. Many of our competitors are large, well-established companies with substantially larger operating staffs and
greater capital resources and have been engaged in the oil and gas business for a much longer time than our Company. These companies
may be able to pay more for productive oil and gas properties, exploratory prospects and to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a
greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional properties
and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate
transactions in this highly competitive environment. 

Regulatory
Matters 

Regulation
of Oil and Gas Production, Sales and Transportation 

The
oil and gas industry is subject to regulation by numerous national, state and local governmental agencies and departments. Compliance
with these regulations is often difficult and costly and noncompliance could result in substantial penalties and risks. Most jurisdictions
in which we operate also have statutes, rules, regulations or guidelines governing the conservation of natural resources, including the
unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties, minimum well spacing, plugging and abandonment of wells and the establishment of maximum
rates of production from oil and gas wells. Some jurisdictions also require the filing of drilling and operating permits, bonds and reports.
The failure to comply with these statutes, rules and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties and the suspension
or cessation of operations in affected areas. 

Environmental
Regulation 

Various
federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including the discharge of materials into
the environment, may affect our exploration, development and production operations and the costs of those operations. These laws and
regulations, among other things, govern the amounts and types of substances that may be released into the environment, the issuance of
permits to conduct exploration, drilling and production operations, the discharge and disposition of generated waste materials and waste
management, the reclamation and abandonment of wells, sites and facilities, financial assurance and the remediation of contaminated sites.
These laws and regulations may impose substantial liabilities for noncompliance and for any contamination resulting from our operations
and may require the suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. 

10 

The
environmental laws and regulations applicable to our U.S. operations include, among others, the following United States federal laws
and regulations: 

Clean Air Act, and its amendments, which govern air emissions; 

Clean Water Act, which governs discharges into waters of the
United States; 

Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
Act, which imposes liability where hazardous releases have occurred or are threatened to occur (commonly known as Superfund 

Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which governs the management
of solid waste; 

Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which imposes liabilities resulting
from discharges of oil into navigable waters of the United States; 

Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, which requires
reporting of toxic chemical inventories; 

Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the underground injection
and disposal of wastewater; and 

U.S. Department of Interior regulations, which impose liability
for pollution cleanup and damages. 

Colombia
has similar laws and regulations designed to protect the environment. 

We
routinely obtain permits for our facilities and operations in accordance with these applicable laws and regulations on an ongoing basis.
There are no known issues that have a significant adverse effect on the permitting process or permit compliance status of any of our
facilities or operations. 

The
ultimate financial impact of these environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determined as new standards
are enacted and new interpretations of existing standards are rendered. Environmental laws and regulations are expected to have an increasing
impact on our operations. In addition, any non-compliance with such laws could subject us to material administrative, civil or criminal
penalties, or other liabilities. Potential permitting costs are variable and directly associated with the type of facility and its geographic
location. Costs, for example, may be incurred for air emission permits, spill contingency requirements, and discharge or injection permits.
These costs are considered a normal, recurring cost of our ongoing operations and not an extraordinary cost of compliance with government
regulations. 

Although
we do not operate the properties in which we hold interests, noncompliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations by the
operators of our oil and gas properties could expose us, and our properties, to potential costs and liabilities associated with such
environmental laws. While we exercise no oversight with respect to any of our operators, we believe that each of our operators is committed
to environmental protection and compliance. However, since environmental costs and liabilities are inherent in our operations and in
the operations of companies engaged in similar businesses and since regulatory requirements frequently change and may become more stringent,
there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred in the future. Such costs may result in increased
costs of operations and acquisitions and decreased production. 

Hydraulic
Fracturing Regulation 

Hydraulic
fracturing, or fracking , is a common practice used to stimulate production of oil and natural gas from tight formations,
including shales. Fracking involves the injection of fluids usually consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts
of chemical additives as well as sand into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the rock that allow oil or
gas to flow more freely to the wellbore. 

Except
as applies to federal lands, fracking generally is exempt from regulation under many federal environmental rules and is generally regulated
at the state level. 

For
example, in Texas, the Texas Railroad Commission administers regulations related to oil and gas operations, including regulations pertaining
to protection of water resources in connection with those operations. The Texas Legislature adopted new legislation requiring oil and
gas operators to publicly disclose the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process, effective as of September 1, 2011. The Texas
Railroad Commission has adopted rules and regulations implementing this legislation that apply to all wells for which the Railroad Commission
issues an initial drilling permit after February 1, 2012. This law requires that the well operator disclose the list of chemical ingredients
subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act OSHA for disclosure on an internet website
and also file the list of chemicals with the Texas Railroad Commission with the well completion report. The total volume of water used
to hydraulically fracture a well must also be disclosed to the public and filed with the Texas Railroad Commission. 

11 

There
is public controversy regarding fracking with regard to the use of fracking fluids, impacts on drinking water supplies, use of water
and the potential for impacts to surface water, groundwater and the environment generally. Lawsuits and enforcement actions have been
initiated across the country implicating hydraulic fracturing practices. If new laws or regulations restricting hydraulic fracturing
are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations as
well as make it easier to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could
adversely affect groundwater. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal or state level, fracturing activities
could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased
monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and
potential increases in costs. Such legislative changes could cause operators to incur substantial compliance costs, and compliance or
the consequences of any failure to comply could have a material adverse effect on well operations and economics. 

We
do not operate wells but contract well operations to third party operators. Operators of our wells may perform fracking operations, or
contract third parties to perform such operations, on wells in which we participate. Many newer wells would not be economical without
the use of fracking to stimulate production from the well. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of
newly enacted or potential federal or state legislation governing hydraulic fracturing. 

Climate
Change Legislation and Greenhouse Gas Regulation 

Federal,
state and local laws and regulations are increasingly being enacted to address concerns about the effects the emission of greenhouse
gases may have on the environment and climate. These effects are widely referred to as climate change. Since its
December 2009 endangerment finding regarding the emission of greenhouse gases, the Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA has begun regulating sources of greenhouse gas emissions under the federal Clean Air Act. Among several regulations requiring reporting
or permitting for greenhouse gas sources, the EPA finalized its tailoring rule in May 2010 that determines which stationary
sources of greenhouse gases are required to obtain permits to construct, modify or operate on account of, and to implement the best available
control technology for, their greenhouse gases. The EPA s final greenhouse gas reporting requirements pertain to certain oil and
gas production facilities. 

Moreover,
the U.S. Congress has considered establishing a cap-and-trade program to reduce U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases. Under past proposals,
the EPA would issue or sell a capped and steadily declining number of tradable emissions allowances to certain major sources of greenhouse
gas emissions so that such sources could continue to emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These allowances would be expected to
escalate significantly in cost over time. The net effect of such legislation, if ever adopted, would be to impose increasing costs on
the combustion of carbon-based fuels such as crude oil, refined petroleum products, and natural gas. In addition, while the prospect
for such cap-and-trade legislation by the U.S. Congress remains uncertain, several states have adopted, or are in the process of adopting,
similar cap-and-trade programs. 

Since
taking office in 2021, the Biden presidential administration has signaled a commitment to cutting greenhouse gases, and an accompanying
commitment to moving the U.S. away from fossil fuels and to so-called green or renewable energy sources. Among the steps taken by the
Biden Administration are rejoining the Paris Agreement on climate change, a stated commitment to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by
2030 to roughly half of 2005 levels, limitations on land available for oil and gas leasing, the United States Methane Emissions Reduction
Action Plan and certain Clean Air Act rules and various executive orders and certain provisions of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act,
each of which imposes costs, burdens, restrictions or otherwise is designed to discourage the use of oil and gas and, accordingly, is
potentially harmful to the U.S. oil and gas industry. 

As
a crude oil and natural gas company, the debate on climate change is relevant to our operations because the regulatory response is designed
to reduce demand for, and use of, our products, oil and gas, in favor of alternative forms of energy. We cannot presently predict the
ultimate impact of existing or future climate change initiatives on our company or our industry although we do anticipate that, at a
minimum, we will incur additional operating and other costs to respond to such initiatives.

Item
 1A. 
 Risk
 Factors 

Our
business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant hazards and risks, including those described below. If
any of such events should occur, our business, financial condition, liquidity and/or results of operations could be materially harmed,
and holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments. 

Company
and Organization Risks 

We
have experienced recurring operating losses and may not attain profitability; attainment of profitability will require successful drilling
and development operations to support substantial increases in production and revenues. 

We
have incurred losses from operations in each year since 2011 and, at December 31, 2022, had an accumulated deficit of 73,787,720. While
we have implemented cost control initiatives that have brought down our cash overhead in recent years and have brought additional wells
onto production in 2022, our ability to attain profitability is substantially dependent upon increasing our production and production
revenues while continuing to control costs. In order to increase production and revenues, we will need to successfully drill new wells
on our existing, or future acquired, acreage at a pace, and with results, significantly greater than in recent years. If, for any reason,
we are unable to substantially increase our production and revenues, while controlling drilling costs and overhead, we may never attain,
or sustain, profitability. Our ability to so increase production and revenues and attain profitability is subject to all of the other
risks of oil and gas operations as well as our ability to fund our share of drilling and development operations. 

Our
ability to operate profitably and our financial condition are highly dependent on energy prices. A substantial or extended decline in
oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and our ability to meet our
capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments. 

The
price we receive for our oil and natural gas production heavily influences our revenue, profitability, access to capital and future rate
of growth. Oil and natural gas are commodities and, therefore, their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively
minor changes in supply and demand. Historically, the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile. These markets will likely continue
to be volatile in the future. The prices we receive for our production depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include,
but are not limited to, the following: 

changes
 in global supply and demand for oil and natural gas, including changes in demand resulting from general and specific economic conditions
 relating to the business cycle and other factors (e.g., global health pandemics such as COVID-19); 

the
 actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC; 

the
 price and quantity of imports of foreign oil and natural gas; 

political
 conditions, including embargoes, in or affecting other oil-producing activity; 

the
 level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production activity; 

the
 level of global oil and natural gas inventories; 

weather
 conditions; 

technological
 advances affecting energy consumption, including renewable energy initiatives that result in energy consumption transitioning away
 from fossil fuels; and 

the
 price and availability of alternative fuels. 

Global
economic growth drives demand for energy from all sources, including fossil fuels. Should the U.S. and global economies experience weakness,
demand for energy may decline. Similarly, should growth in global energy production outstrip demand, excess supplies may arise. Declines
in demand and excess supplies may result in accompanying declines in commodity prices and deterioration of our financial position along
with our ability to operate profitably and our ability to obtain financing to support operations. 

13 

With
respect to our business, we have experienced periodic declines in demand thought to be associated with slowing economic growth in certain
markets, including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with new oil and gas supplies coming on line and other circumstances
beyond our control that resulted in oil and gas supply exceeding global demand which, in turn, resulted in steep declines in prices of
oil and natural gas. 

Past
declines in prices reduced, and any declines that may occur in the future can be expected to reduce, our revenues and profitability as
well as the value of our reserves. Such declines adversely affect well and reserve economics and may reduce the amount of oil and natural
gas that we can produce economically, resulting in deferral or cancellation of planned drilling and related activities until such time,
if ever, as economic conditions improve sufficiently to support such operations. Any extended decline in oil or natural gas prices may
materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to finance planned
capital expenditures. 

Supply
chain challenges arising in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our operations. 

Supply
and demand imbalances arising from the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in shortages, backlogs and delayed deliveries of a wide array of products
and services, including products and services critical to oil and gas operations. As a result of such supply chain challenges, we may
experience unavailability, or delay in delivery, of products and services that are critical to our well operations. Any such delays may
result in deferral or reduction of revenues and increased costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our profitability. 

Competition
in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, which may adversely affect our ability to compete. 

We
operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing oil and natural gas and securing trained personnel. Many
of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours, which can be particularly
important in the areas in which we operate. Those companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and
exploratory prospects and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel
resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability
to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. Also, there is substantial
competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry. We may not be able to compete successfully in the
future in acquiring prospective reserves, developing reserves, marketing hydrocarbons, attracting and retaining quality personnel and
raising additional capital. 

14 

Our
ability to acquire additional mineral acreage and to drill and develop our existing acreage as well as other acreage that may be acquired
is subject to availability of financing on satisfactory terms. 

Our
financial resources are limited and may not be adequate to fully drill and develop our acreage or to consummate any meaningful acquisition.
While our available funds as of March 2023 are expected to be adequate to fund our share of well costs on wells expected to be drilled,
as of that date, during 2023, our funds on hand are not expected to be adequate to support a long-term drilling and development plan
with respect to our existing acreage holdings, should such a plan be implemented. 

We
may continue to seek to access the capital markets to support planned drilling operations or acquisitions through sales of equity securities
or may seek debt financing to support such capital requirements. We do not presently have any commitments to provide equity or debt financing
to support any future drilling operations or acquisitions and there can be no assurance that such financing will be available if and
when needed on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to fund our share of drilling and completion costs of future wells, we may
experience flat and declining production and revenues and decreased profitability and may be subject to penalties with respect to our
interest in acreage. 

Our
ability to utilize our common stock to finance future capital needs, or for other purposes, is limited by our authorized shares available
for issuance. 

As
of March 2023, we had authority to issue a total of 12 million shares of
common stock, of which approximately 10,622,518 shares had been issued and 1,038,577 shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to outstanding
stock options and warrants. Absent an increase in authorized shares of common stock, we only have approximately 338,905 shares of common
stock available for issuance to raise capital or to support additional stock option grants and for other uses. 

We
have historically utilized at-the-market sales of our common stock to provide financing to support growth and operations.
With the limited shares of common stock presently available for issuance, our ability to secure additional funding through the sale of
common stock is limited. Absent an increase in the shares of common stock authorized to be issued, we will be limited to other financing
structures in the event additional financing is required. Such alternative structures may be less favorable or unavailable in which case
we may be forced to forego opportunities or required to downsize operations due to lack of funding. 

In
2021 and 2022, we recommended that our shareholders approve an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to increase authorize shares
to support potential future capital requirements. While an overwhelming majority of shares voted approved such increase, the vote was
insufficient to implement the amendment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure the necessary shareholder vote to increase
our authorized shares of common stock and, therefore, we may continue to be limited in the shares of common stock we may issue. 

We
may be unable to make attractive acquisitions and any acquisitions may be subject to substantial risks that could adversely affects our
business. 

Acquisitions
of additional mineral acreage at favorable prices is part of our strategy to increase and diversify our holdings and grow our production
and revenues. We expect to focus our acquisition efforts in the Permian Basin and in Colombia with an emphasis on partnering with proven
operators in the area to acquire positions at favorable prices. Competition for mineral acreage in the Permian Basin is intense. Other
operators, particularly large operators, have historically paid substantially higher prices for Permian Basin acreage than we have paid.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully acquire additional acreage in the Permian Basin, Colombia or elsewhere
at favorable prices or at all. Even if we are successful in acquiring additional acreage on favorable terms, it is possible that such
acreage (i) will be more speculative than higher priced acreage, (ii) may face challenges or limitations in drilling and operations such
as lack of, or limited access to, critical infrastructure, or (iii) may prove uneconomical. 

Our
success depends on our staff, which is small in size and limited in technical capabilities, and third party consultants, the loss of
any of whom could disrupt our business operations. 

Our
success will depend on our ability to attract and retain key staff members. Our staff is extremely small in size and possesses limited
technical capabilities. We do not presently maintain any significant internal technical capabilities but rely on the engineering, geological
and other technical skills of our board and, from time to time, third party consultants. If members of our staff should resign or we
are unable to attract the necessary personnel, our business operations could be adversely affected. 

15 

Our
charter and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it difficult for a third party to acquire our company and also
could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. 

Delaware
corporate law and our charter and bylaws contain provisions that could delay, deter or prevent a change in control of our Company or
our management. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors
and take other corporate actions without the concurrence of our management or board of directors. These provisions: 

authorize
 our board of directors to issue blank check preferred stock, which is preferred stock that can be created and issued
 by our board of directors, without stockholder approval, with rights senior to those of our common stock; 

provide
 for a staggered board of directors and three-year terms for directors, so that no more than one-third of our directors could be replaced
 at any annual meeting; 

provide
 that directors may be removed only for cause; and 

establish
 advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can
 be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting. 

We
are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could also delay or prevent a change of control. Taken together,
these provisions of our charter, bylaws, and Delaware law may discourage transactions that otherwise could provide for the payment of
a premium over prevailing market prices of our common stock and also could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future
for shares of our common stock. 

Oil
and Gas Operating Risks 

Drilling
for and producing oil and natural gas are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial
condition or results of operations. 

Our
future success will depend on the success of our exploitation, exploration, development and production activities. Our oil and natural
gas exploration and production activities are subject to numerous risks beyond our control, including the risk that drilling will not
result in commercially viable oil or natural gas production. Our decisions to purchase, explore, develop or otherwise exploit prospects
or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses, production data and
engineering studies, the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. Please read Reserve estimates
depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate (below) for a discussion of the uncertainty involved in these processes.
Our cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences. Overruns in budgeted expenditures
are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomical. Further, many factors may curtail, delay or cancel drilling, including
the following: 

delays
 imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements; 

pressure
 or irregularities in geological formations; 

shortages
 of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified personnel; 

equipment
 failures or accidents; 

adverse
 weather conditions; 

reductions
 in oil and natural gas prices; 

title
 problems; and 

limitations
 in the market for oil and natural gas. 

16 

Cost
overruns, curtailments, delays and cancellations of operations as a result of the above factors and other factors common in our industry
may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial position and our ability to maintain our interests in prospects. 

We
are dependent upon third party operators of our oil and gas properties. 

Under
the terms of the operating agreements related to our oil and gas properties, third parties act as the operator of each of our oil and
gas wells and control the drilling and operating activities to be conducted on our properties. Therefore, we have limited control over
certain decisions related to activities on our properties, which could affect our results of operations. Decisions over which we have
limited control include: 

the
 timing and amount of capital expenditures; 

the
 timing of initiating the drilling and recompleting of wells; 

the
 extent of operating costs; and 

the
 level of ongoing production. 

Decisions
made by our operators may be different than those we would make reflecting priorities different than our priorities and may materially
adversely affect our operating results and financial position, including potential declines in production and revenues from properties,
declines in value of properties and lease expirations, among other potential consequences. 

Prospects
that we decide to drill may not yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities. 

Our
prospects are properties on which we have identified what we believe, based on available seismic and geological information, to be indications
of oil or natural gas potential. Our prospects are in various stages of evaluation, ranging from a prospect that is ready to drill to
a prospect that will require substantial seismic data processing and interpretation. There is no way to predict in advance of drilling
and testing whether any particular prospect will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion
costs or to be economically viable. The use of seismic data and other technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area
will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or, if present, whether oil or natural
gas will be present in commercial quantities. We cannot assure that the analogies we draw from available data from other wells, more
fully explored prospects or producing fields will be applicable to our drilling prospects. 

Our
operations are expected to involve use of horizontal drilling and completion techniques, which involve risks and uncertainties in their
application. 

Our
operations, in most instances, are expected to involve utilizing some of the latest drilling and completion techniques as developed by
our service providers, including horizontal drilling and completion techniques. Risks that we face while drilling horizontal wells include,
but are not limited to, the following: 

landing
 the wellbore in the desired drilling zone; 

staying
 in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation; 

running
 casing the entire length of the wellbore; and 

being
 able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal wellbore. 

Risks
that we face while completing wells include, but are not limited to, the following: 

the
 ability to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages; 

the
 ability to run tools the entire length of the wellbore during completion operations; and 

The
 ability to successfully clean out the wellbore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage. 

17 

Horizontal
drilling in emerging areas with little or no history of use of such techniques is more uncertain than drilling in areas that are more
developed and have a longer history of established horizontal drilling operations. If our horizontal drilling fail to adequately address
the risks described, we may incur costs overruns, underperformance by wells or non-productive wells. 

The
unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel, water disposal and oil field services could adversely affect
our ability to execute on a timely basis our exploration and development plans within our budget and operate profitably. 

Shortages
or the high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies or personnel, including shortages or unavailability of personnel, supplies and
equipment arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, could delay or adversely affect our development and exploration operations. If the price
of oil and natural gas increases, the demand for production equipment and personnel will likely also increase, potentially resulting,
at least in the near-term, in shortages of equipment and personnel. In addition, larger producers may be more likely to secure access
to such equipment by virtue of offering drilling companies more lucrative terms. In particular, high levels of horizontal drilling and
hydraulic fracturing operations in the Permian Basin have, from time to time, created increased demand, and higher costs, for associated
drilling and completion services, water supply, handling and disposal and access to production handling and transportation infrastructure,
each of which have resulted in higher than anticipated prices with respect to our initial Reeves County wells. If we are unable to acquire
access to such resources, or can obtain access only at higher prices, not only would this potentially delay our ability to convert our
reserves into cash flow but could also significantly increase the cost of producing those reserves, thereby negatively impacting anticipated
net income. 

We
may not be able to obtain access on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise to pipelines and storage facilities, gathering systems
and other transportation, processing, fractionation and refining facilities to market our oil and gas production; we rely on a limited
number of purchasers of our products. 

The
marketing of oil and gas production depends in large part on the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines and storage facilities,
gathering systems and other transportation, processing, fractionation and refining facilities, as well as the existence of adequate markets.
If there were insufficient capacity available on these systems, if these systems were unavailable to us, or if access to these systems
were to become commercially unreasonable, the price offered for our production could be significantly depressed, or we could be forced
to shut in some production or delay or discontinue drilling plans and commercial production following a discovery of hydrocarbons while
we construct our own facility or await the availability of third party facilities. We rely on facilities developed and owned by third
parties in order to store, process, transport, fractionate and sell our oil and gas production. Our plans to develop and sell our oil
and gas reserves could be materially and adversely affected by the inability or unwillingness of third parties to provide sufficient
transportation, storage or processing and fractionation facilities to us, especially in areas of planned expansion where such facilities
do not currently exist. 

The
amount of oil and gas that can be produced is subject to limitations in certain circumstances, such as pipeline interruptions due to
scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, excessive pressure, physical damage to the gathering, transportation, refining or processing facilities,
or lack of capacity on such facilities. Curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several
months, resulting in lost or curtailed production and revenues. 

We
may operate in areas with limited or no access to pipelines, thereby necessitating delivery by other means, such as trucking, or requiring
compression facilities. This may be particularly true with respect to our Colombian acreage where infrastructure is limited or, in some
cases, non-existent. Such restrictions on our ability to sell our oil or natural gas could have several adverse effects, including higher
transportation costs, fewer potential purchasers (thereby potentially resulting in a lower selling price) or, in the event we were unable
to market and sustain production from a particular lease for an extended time, possibly causing us to lose a lease due to lack of production. 

To
the extent that we enter into transportation contracts with pipelines that are subject to FERC regulation, we are subject to FERC requirements
related to use of such capacity. Any failure on our part to comply with FERC s regulations and policies or with an interstate pipeline s
tariff could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties. 

18 

A
limited number of companies purchase a majority of our production. The loss of a significant purchaser could have a material adverse
effect on our ability to sell production. 

Our
oil and gas holdings and operations are concentrated, and we are dependent upon the results of drilling and production operations on
a small number of prospects and wells. If those properties and wells perform below expectations, we may experience production, revenues
and profitability below expectations. 

We
have historically been focused on development of a small number of geographically concentrated prospects. Accordingly, we lack diversification
with respect to the nature and geographic location of our holdings. As a result, we are exposed to higher dependence on individual resource
plays and may experience substantial losses should a single individual prospect prove unsuccessful. At December 31, 2022, we owned interests
in 738 net acres and 0.68 net wells in the United States and, through properties owned and/or operated by Hupecol entities, 91,826 net
acres and 0.32 net wells in Colombia. While we continually evaluate potential prospects in operations in diverse regions, our production,
revenues and profitability for the foreseeable future are expected to be highly dependent upon the results of existing and future wells
we may drill in the Permian Basis and the CPO-11 block in Colombia. In order grow our revenues and improve profitability, we must continue
to drill productive wells. If existing wells, or future wells we may drill, perform below expectations, we may experience flat or declining
production and revenues and may be unable to attain profitability. 

Unless
we replace our oil and natural gas reserves, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our cash flows and
income. 

Unless
we conduct successful development, exploitation and exploration activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved
reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Producing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining
production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Our future oil and natural gas reserves and production,
and, therefore our cash flow and income, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves
and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. If we are unable to develop, exploit, find or acquire additional
reserves to replace our current and future production, our cash flow and income will decline as production declines, until our existing
properties would be incapable of sustaining commercial production. 

A
substantial percentage of our properties are unproven and undeveloped; therefore, the cost of proving and developing our properties and
risk associated with our success is greater than would be the case if the majority of our properties were categorized as proved developed
producing. 

Because
a substantial percentage of our properties are unproven and/or undeveloped, we require significant capital to prove and develop such
properties before they may become productive. Because of the inherent uncertainties associated with drilling for oil and gas, some of
these properties may never be successfully drilled and developed to the extent that they result in positive cash flow. Even if we are
successful in our drilling and development efforts, it could take several years for a significant portion of our unproven properties
to be converted to positive cash flow. 

We
may incur substantial uninsured losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our oil and natural gas operations. 

We
are not insured against all risks. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely
affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are
subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas, including the possibility of: 

environmental
 hazards, such as uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, toxic gas or other pollution into the environment,
 including groundwater and shoreline contamination; 

abnormally
 pressured formations; 

mechanical
 difficulties, such as stuck oil field drilling and service tools and casing collapse; 

fires
 and explosions; 

19 

personal
 injuries and death; and 

natural
 disasters. 

Any
of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to our company. We may elect
not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition,
pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. The occurrence of a significant accident or other event that is
not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 

If
oil and natural gas prices decrease, we may be required to take write-downs of the carrying values of our oil and natural gas properties. 

Accounting
rules require that we review periodically the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties for possible impairment. Based on
specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews, and the continuing evaluation of development
plans, production data, economics and other factors, we have written down the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties periodically
and may be required to further write down the carrying value of oil and gas properties in the future. A write-down would constitute a
non-cash charge to earnings. It is likely the cumulative effect of a write-down could also negatively impact the trading price of our
securities. 

Reserve
estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying
assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves. 

The
process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex, requiring interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions,
including assumptions relating to economic factors. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially
affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves reported. 

In
order to prepare our estimates, we must project production rates and timing of development expenditures. We must also analyze available
geological, geophysical, production and engineering data. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also
requires economic assumptions about matters such as oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures,
taxes and availability of funds. Therefore, estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are inherently imprecise. 

Actual
future production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable
oil and natural gas reserves most likely will vary from our estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated
quantities and present value of our reserves. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history,
results of exploration and development activities, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond
our control. 

The
present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves, as reported from time to time, should not be assumed to be the current
market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we generally base the estimated discounted
future net cash flows from our proved reserves on costs on the date of the estimate and average prices over the preceding twelve months.
Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimate. If future prices decline or costs
increase it could negatively impact our ability to finance operations, and individual properties could cease being commercially viable,
affecting our decision to continue operations on producing properties or to attempt to develop properties. All of these factors would
have a negative impact on earnings and net income, and most likely the trading price of our securities. 

20 

Our
operations will be subject to environmental and other government laws, regulations and policies that are costly, could potentially subject
us to substantial liabilities and potentially result in decreased demand for products. 

Crude
oil and natural gas exploration and production operations in the United States and in Colombia are subject to extensive federal, state
and local laws and regulations. Oil and gas companies are subject to laws and regulations addressing, among others, land use and lease
permit restrictions, bonding and other financial assurance related to drilling and production activities, spacing of wells, unitization
and pooling of properties, environmental and safety matters, plugging and abandonment of wells and associated infrastructure after production
has ceased, operational reporting and taxation. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations can subject us to governmental sanctions,
such as fines and penalties, as well as potential liability for personal injuries and property and natural resources damages. We may
be required to make significant expenditures to comply with the requirements of these laws and regulations, and future laws or regulations,
or any adverse change in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations, could increase such compliance costs. Regulatory requirements
and restrictions could also delay or curtail our operations and could have a significant impact on our financial condition or results
of operations. 

Our
oil and gas operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations relating to the release or disposal of materials into the environment
or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations: 

require
 the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences; 

restrict
 the types, quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production
 activities; 

limit
 or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; and 

impose
 substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations. 

Failure
to comply with these laws and regulations may result in: 

the
 imposition of administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties; 

incurring
 investigatory or remedial obligations; and 

the
 imposition of injunctive relief. 

Changes
in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent or costly waste handling, storage,
transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance and may
otherwise have a material adverse effect on our industry in general and on our own results of operations, competitive position or financial
condition. Although we intend to be in compliance in all material respects with all applicable environmental laws and regulations, we
cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with existing or new regulations. In addition, the risk of accidental spills, leakages
or other circumstances could expose us to extensive liability. 

We
are unable to predict the effect of additional environmental laws and regulations that may be adopted in the future, including whether
any such laws or regulations would materially adversely increase our cost of doing business or affect operations in any area. 

Under
certain environmental laws that impose strict, joint and several liability, we may be required to remediate our contaminated properties
regardless of whether such contamination resulted from the conduct of others or from consequences of our own actions that were or were
not in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. In addition, claims for damages to persons or property
may result from environmental and other impacts of our operations. Moreover, new or modified environmental, health or safety laws, regulations
or enforcement policies could be more stringent and impose unforeseen liabilities or significantly increase compliance costs. Therefore,
the costs to comply with environmental, health or safety laws or regulations or the liabilities incurred in connection with them could
significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

In
addition, many countries as well as several states and regions of the U.S. have agreed to regulate emissions of greenhouse gases 
and have adopted policies to actively promote alternative energy green energy sources that are specifically designed to
replace fossil fuels. Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, a byproduct of burning of natural gas and oil,
are greenhouse gases. Regulation of greenhouse gases could adversely impact some of our operations and green energy initiatives
could substantially reduce demand for our products in the future. 

21 

Increased
regulation, or limitations on the use, of hydraulic fracturing could increase our cost of operations and reduce profitability. 

Our
existing Permian Basin wells have been hydraulically fractured and future wells that we may drill in the Permian Basin are expected to
be economically viable only if hydraulic fracturing is utilized to increase flows of oil and natural gas, particularly in shale formations.
The use of hydraulic fracturing has been the subject of much scrutiny and debate in recent years with many activists and state and federal
legislators and regulators actively pushing for most stringent regulation of such operations or even the ban of such operations. 

In
the event that state or federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing is increased or hydraulic fracturing is substantially curtailed or
prohibited through law or regulation, our cost of drilling and operating wells may increase substantially. In some cases, increased costs
associated with increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing, or the prohibition of hydraulic fracturing, may result in wells being uneconomical
to drill and operate that would otherwise be economical to drill and operate in the absence of such regulations or prohibitions. Should
wells be determined to be uneconomical as a result of increasing regulation of hydraulic fracturing, we may be required to write-down
or abandon oil and gas properties that are determined to be uneconomical to drill and develop. Additionally, potential litigation arising
from alleged harm resulting from hydraulic fracturing may materially adversely affect our financial results and position regardless of
whether we prevail on the merits of such litigation. 

International
Operations Risks 

Our
operations in Colombia are subject to uncertainty, delays and other risks relating to political and economic instability. 

We
currently have interests in multiple oil and gas concessions in Colombia and anticipate that operations in Colombia may constitute a
substantial element of our strategy going forward. 

The
political climate in Colombia is unstable and could be subject to radical change over a very short period of time. While each of our
past and current oil and gas concessions in Colombia have been granted by the federal government, we have experienced multiple extended
delays in obtaining necessary permits to commence drilling operations on three of our four current concessions. The delays in obtaining
necessary permits have been attributed to numerous factors beyond our control but not uncommon in Colombia, including strong local opposition
to drilling operations based on environmental and other concerns. In the face of such opposition, our operator has shelved any near term
drilling on the three concessions in question and is pursuing discussions with the federal government and local governments to determine
if there are any viable options to drill those concessions or if acceptable arrangements can be made to compensate for the inability
to drill and develop the concessions. Unless we are able to secure necessary permits or to secure substitute concessions, we may be forced
to abandon or suspend our operations with respect to those concessions and record a loss of our entire investment in those concessions. 

Armed
conflict between government forces and anti-government insurgent groups and illegal paramilitary groups both funded by the drug
trade has persisted in Colombia for many years with insurgents attacking civilians and violent guerilla activity continues in many
parts of the country. While the parties have expressed a continuing commitment to a peace process, until such process is formalized,
any operations we may conduct in Colombia, and any assets we may hold in Colombia, may continue to be subject to risk associated with
guerilla activity that may disrupt operations and result in losses from operations and of assets. There can also be no assurance that
we can maintain the safety of our operations and personnel in Colombia or that this violence will not affect our operations in the future.
Continued or heightened security concerns in Colombia could also result in a significant loss to us. 

Where
the local political climate and/or guerilla activity in an area threaten our ability to secure necessary support of the local populace
or necessary permits to operate, or our ability to assure the safety of our personnel and/or assets, we have, in the past delayed, and
may in the future delay, the commencement of operations on prospects until such concerns are satisfactorily resolved. While our operator
works diligently with local and federal officials to overcome such uncertainties and obstacles, there can be no assurance that conditions
in the vicinity of our planned operations will ever support exploration and/or development operations with respect to one or multiple
prospects. Even though we have conducted successful operations on multiple prospects in Colombia, our current prospects continue to be
characterized by political risks and, in fact, our operator has on more than one occasion delayed planned operations on prospects due
to such political risks with such delays extending, in some cases, for multiple years. In the event of continued, or future, delays in
operations on prospects arising from political risks, we may experience financial loss associated with our cost of holding prospects,
the incurrence of costs associated with addressing political risks or the loss of value associated with our inability to explore and
develop potentially valuable prospects. 

Inflation
rates in Colombia have increased in recent years, including by over 10 in 2022. A variety of factors, including a recent increase in
the minimum wage, have contributed to this increase. The situation does not meet the definition of highly inflationary, but in the event
it does meet that definition, we may experience financial loss associated with the related increase in operating expenses. 

22 

Additionally,
Colombia is among several nations whose eligibility to receive foreign aid from the United States is dependent on its progress in stemming
the production and transit of illegal drugs, which is subject to an annual review by the President of the United States. Although Colombia
is currently eligible for such aid, Colombia may not remain eligible in the future. A finding by the President that Colombia has failed
demonstrably to meet its obligations under international counter-narcotics agreements may result in the loss of certain financial aid
and the imposition of trade sanctions. 

Each
of these consequences could result in adverse economic consequences in Colombia and could further heighten the political and economic
risks associated with our operations there. Any changes in the holders of significant government offices could have adverse consequences
on our relationship with key governmental agencies and the Colombian government s ability to control guerrilla activities and could
exacerbate the factors relating to our foreign operations. Any sanctions imposed on Colombia by the United States government could threaten
our ability to obtain necessary financing to develop the Colombian properties or cause Colombia to retaliate against us, including by
nationalizing our Colombian assets. Accordingly, the imposition of the foregoing economic and trade sanctions on Colombia would likely
result in a substantial loss and a decrease in the price of our common stock. 

Our
operations in Colombia are controlled by operators which may carry out transactions affecting our Colombian assets and operations without
our consent. 

Our
operations in Colombia are subject to a substantial degree of control by the operators of the properties in which we hold indirect interests
in Colombia. We are an investor in a number of ventures operated by Hupecol and our interest in the assets and operations of Hupecol
related entities and ventures represent all of our current assets in Colombia. In the past, Hupecol sold its interest in multiple concessions
and entities holding multiple concessions each representing, at the time, the largest prospect(s) in terms of reserves and revenues in
which we then held an interest. Additionally, Hupecol has, on occasion, temporarily shut-in production from our Colombian properties.
It is possible that Hupecol will carry out similar sales or acquisitions of prospects or make similar decisions in the future. Our management
intends to closely monitor the nature and progress of future transactions by Hupecol in order to protect our interests. However, we have
no effective ability to alter or prevent a transaction and are unable to predict whether or not any such transactions will in fact occur
or the nature or timing of any such transaction. 

We
may be exposed to additional expenses and losses arising from the financial position of our joint interest partners in Colombia. 

Our
Colombian properties are developed under financial arrangements with various joint interest partners. In 2022, we acquired a portion
of a joint interest partner s interest in the CPO-11 block when the joint interest partner was unable to fund its portion of development
costs. As a result of such acquisition, while we did increase our ownership interest in the prospect, we assumed an increased portion
of the prospect s development costs. If other joint interest partners are unable, or unwilling, to satisfy their various obligations
relating to prospects, we may be required to pay a proportionately higher share of development costs on those prospects or the prospect
may be inadequately capitalized to achieve optimal results. 

We
may be exposed to substantial fines and penalties if we or our partners fail to comply with laws and regulations associated with our
activities in foreign countries, including Colombia, regarding U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws prohibiting
corrupt payments to governmental officials and other corrupt practices. 

Third
parties act as the operator of each of our oil and gas wells and control all drilling and operating activities conducted with respect
to our Colombian properties. Therefore, we have limited control over decisions related to activities on our properties, and we cannot
provide assurance that our partners or their employees, contractors or agents will not take actions in violation of applicable anti-corruption
laws and regulations. In the course of conducting business in Colombia, we have relied primarily on the representations and warranties
made by our operating and non-operating partners in the farmout and joint operating agreements which govern our respective project interests
to the effect that: 

each
 party has not and will not offer or make payments to any person, including a government official, that would violate the laws of
 the country of operations, the country of formation of any of the partners or the principals described in the Convention on Combating
 Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions; and 

each
 party will maintain adequate internal controls, properly record and report all transactions and comply with the laws applicable to
 the transaction. 

23 

While
we periodically inquire as to the continuing accuracy of these representations, as a minority non-operator, we are limited in our ability
to assure compliance. Consequently, we cannot provide assurance that the procedural safeguards, if any, adopted by our partners or the
representations and warranties contained in these agreements and our reliance on them will protect us from liability should a violation
occur. Any violations of the anti-bribery, accounting controls or books and records provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by
us or our partners could subject us and, where deemed appropriate, individuals, in certain cases, to a broad range of civil and criminal
penalties, including but not limited to, imprisonment, injunctive relief, disgorgement, substantial fines or penalties, prohibitions
on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, imposed modifications to business practices and compliance programs, including
retention of an independent monitor to oversee compliance, and could also materially damage our reputation, our business and our operating
results. 

Stock
Related Risks 

The
price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and this may make it difficult to resell common stock when, or at prices, desired. 

The
price of our common stock constantly changes. We expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate. 

Our
stock price may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include: 

quarterly
 variations in our operating results; 

operating
 results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors; 

changes
 in expectations as to our future financial performance; 

announcements
 by us, our partners or our competitors of leasing and drilling activities; 

the
 operating and securities price performance of other companies that investors believe are comparable to us; 

future
 sales of our equity or equity-related securities; 

changes
 in general conditions in our industry and in the economy, the financial markets and the domestic or international political situation; 

fluctuations
 in oil and gas prices; 

departures
 of key personnel; and 

regulatory
 considerations. 

The
stock market periodically experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market
price of securities issued by many companies for reasons often unrelated to their operating performance. These broad market fluctuations
may adversely affect our stock price, regardless of our operating results. 

24 

The
sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may affect our stock price. 

We
may require additional capital to support our future drilling plans and may issue additional shares of our common stock or equity-related
securities to secure such capital. Future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock or equity-related securities in the public
market or privately, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect prevailing trading prices of our common stock
and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity-related securities. No prediction can be made
as to the effect, if any, that future sales of shares of common stock or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale will
have on the trading price of our common stock.

 Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

General 

We
are an independent energy company focused on the development, exploration, exploitation, acquisition, and production of natural gas and
crude oil properties with principal holdings in the U.S. Permian Basin, the South American country of Colombia and additional holdings
in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. 

Our
mission is to deliver outstanding net asset value per share growth to our investors via attractive oil and gas investments. Our strategy
is to focus on early identification of, and opportunistic entrance into, existing and emerging resource plays. We do not operate wells
but typically seek to partner with larger operators in development of resources or retain interests, with or without contribution on
our part, in prospects identified, packaged and promoted to larger operators. By entering these plays earlier, identifying stranded blocks
and partnering with, or promoting to, larger operators, we believe we can capture larger resource potential at lower cost and minimize
our exposure to drilling risks and costs and ongoing operating costs. 

We,
along with our partners, actively manage our resources through opportunistic acquisitions and divestitures where reserves can be identified,
developed, monetized and financial resources redeployed with the objective of growing reserves, production and shareholder value. 

Generally,
we generate nearly all our revenues and cash flows from the sale of produced natural gas and crude oil, whether through royalty interests,
working interests or other arrangements. We may also realize gains and additional cash flows from the periodic divestiture of assets. 

Recent
Developments 

Lease
Activity 

Colombia .
In 2019, we acquired a 2 interest in Hupecol Meta, LLC Hupecol Meta (the Hupecol Meta Acquisition ). Pursuant
to the terms of the Hupecol Meta Acquisition, we paid total consideration of approximately 197,000. During 2020, we invested an additional
 63,405 in Hupecol Meta. In 2021, we contributed an additional 99,716 to Hupecol Meta, increasing our ownership interest to 7.85 . In
2022, we acquired additional interests in Hupecol Meta from other investors, for aggregate consideration of 657,638, increasing our
ownership interest to approximately 18 . 

Hupecol
Meta holds a working interest in the 639,405 gross acre CPO-11 block in the Llanos Basin in Colombia, comprised of the 69,128 acre Venus
Exploration Area and 570,277 acres, which was 50 farmed out by Hupecol Meta. At December 31, 2022, through our ownership interest in
Hupecol Meta, we hold an approximately 16 interest in the Venus Exploration Area and an approximately 8 interest in the remainder of
the block. 

During
2022, we experienced lease expirations in Yoakum County, Texas (41 net acres) and Hockley County, Texas (730 net acres) and relinquished
our interest in the Serrania block in Colombia (13,846 net acres). 

Drilling
Activity and Well Operations 

During
2022, Hupecol Meta drilled 3 vertical wells (the Saturno ST1, the Bugalu 1 and Caonabo) in the Venus Exploration Area of the CPO-11 block.
In order to handle disposal of produced water from wells, in November 2022, Hupecol Meta secured a water injection permit allowing injection
of produced water in an old well. The Saturno ST1 well and the Venus 2A well, a legacy well that was previously shut-in, were brought
on production in November 2022. The Bugalu 1 well was temporarily abandoned in early 2023. The Caonabo well was determined to be a dry
hole. 

Capital
Investments 

During
2022, our capital investment expenditures for acreage acquisitions, drilling, completion and related operations, as well as investments
relating to Hupecol Meta, totaled 1,661,405, principally relating to acquisitions of additional interests in Hupecol Meta 657,638),
direct investments in Hupecol Meta 988,722) and plugging and abandonment of our Lou Brock well 15,045). 

27 

Financing
Activities 

In
November 2022, we entered into a Sales Agreement with Univest Securities, LLC Univest pursuant to which we could sell,
at our option, up to an aggregate of 3,500,000 in shares of common stock through Univest, as sales agent. Sales of shares under the
Sales Agreement (the 2022 ATM Offering were made, in accordance with placement notices delivered to Univest, which notices
set parameters under which shares could be sold. The 2022 ATM Offering was made pursuant to a shelf registration statement by methods
deemed to be at the market, as defined in Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933. We agreed to pay Univest
a commission in cash equal to 3 of the gross proceeds from the sale of shares in the 2022 ATM Offering. Additionally, we reimbursed
Univest for 25,000 of expenses incurred in connection with the 2022 ATM Offering. As of December 31 2022, 2 million remained available to raise from the 2022 ATM offering. 

During
2022, we sold an aggregate of 394,678 shares in the 2022 ATM Offering and
received proceeds, net of commissions, of 1,543,000. After December 31, 2022, through the date of this report, we sold an additional
294,872 shares in the 2022 ATM Offering and received proceeds, net of commissions, of 874,309. 

Proceeds
from the 2022 ATM Offering were used to support our acquisition of additional interest in Hupecol Meta and to support our future financial
commitments relating to anticipated drilling operations on the CPO-11 block. 

Colombian
Election 

In
June 2022, Colombia elected as its President, leftist candidate, Gustavo Petro. President-elect Petro has publicly vowed to wind down
fossil fuel production in Colombia and end fracking in Colombia as part of a plan to transition to renewable green energy. While the
President-elect s proclamations are openly hostile to the oil and gas industry and appear to bar grants of future oil and gas contracts,
those proclamations appear to honor existing oil and gas contracts. Moreover, the President-elect s proclamations do not appear
to be supported by the Colombian lawmakers which may make it difficult for the President-elect to effectively carry out his proclamations.
Nonetheless, hostility from the executive branch may make the climate for drilling wells on existing acreage more challenging than is
already the case. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
following describes the critical accounting policies used in reporting our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases,
accounting standards allow more than one alternative accounting method for reporting. Such is the case with accounting for oil and gas
activities described below. In those cases, our reported results of operations would be different should we employ an alternative accounting
method. 

28 

Full
Cost Method of Accounting for Oil and Gas Activities. We follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas property acquisition,
exploration and development activities. Under this method, all productive and nonproductive costs incurred in connection with the exploration
for and development of oil and gas reserves are capitalized. Capitalized costs include lease acquisition, geological and geophysical
work, delay rentals, costs of drilling, completing and equipping successful and unsuccessful oil and gas wells and related internal costs
that can be directly identified with acquisition, exploration and development activities, but does not include any cost related to production,
general corporate overhead or similar activities. Gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties is not recognized
unless significant amounts of oil and gas reserves are involved. No corporate overhead has been capitalized as of December 31, 2022.
The capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, plus estimated future development costs relating to proved reserves, are amortized on
a units-of-production method over the estimated productive life of the reserves. Unevaluated oil and gas properties are excluded from
this calculation. The capitalized oil and gas property costs, less accumulated amortization, are limited to an amount (the ceiling limitation)
equal to the sum of: (a) the present value of estimated future net revenues from the projected production of proved oil and gas reserves,
calculated using the average oil and natural gas sales price received by the company as of the first trading day of each month over the
preceding twelve months (such prices are held constant throughout the life of the properties) and a discount factor of 10 ; (b) the cost
of unproved and unevaluated properties excluded from the costs being amortized; (c) the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved
properties included in the costs being amortized; and (d) related income tax effects. Costs in excess of this ceiling are charged to
proved properties impairment expense. 

Revenue
recognition. On January 1, 2018, we adopted the new revenue guidance using the modified retrospective method for contracts that were
not complete at December 31, 2017. ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) . Topic 606 requires
an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. We adopted Topic 606 on January 1, 2018, using the modified
retrospective method applied to contracts that were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Under the modified retrospective method, prior
period financial positions and results are not adjusted. The cumulative effect adjustment recognized in the opening balances included
no significant changes as a result of this adoption. While our 2018 net earnings were not materially impacted by revenue recognition
timing changes, Topic 606 requires certain changes to the presentation of revenues and related expenses beginning January 1, 2018. 

Our
revenue is comprised principally of revenue from exploration and production activities. Our oil is sold primarily to marketers, gatherers,
and refiners. Natural gas is sold primarily to interstate and intrastate natural-gas pipelines, direct end-users, industrial users, local
distribution companies, and natural-gas marketers. NGLs are sold primarily to direct end-users, refiners, and marketers. Payment is generally
received from the customer in the month following delivery. 

Contracts
with customers have varying terms, including spot sales or month-to-month contracts, contracts with a finite term, and life-of-field
contracts where all production from a well or group of wells is sold to one or more customers. We recognize sales revenues for oil, natural
gas, and NGLs based on the amount of each product sold to a customer when control transfers to the customer. Generally, control transfers
at the time of delivery to the customer at a pipeline interconnect, the tailgate of a processing facility, or as a tanker lifting is
completed. Revenue is measured based on the contract price, which may be index-based or fixed, and may include adjustments for market
differentials and downstream costs incurred by the customer, including gathering, transportation, and fuel costs. 

Revenues
are recognized for the sale of our net share of production volumes. 

Unevaluated
Oil and Gas Properties. Unevaluated oil and gas properties consist principally of our cost of acquiring and evaluating undeveloped
leases, net of an allowance for impairment and transfers to depletable oil and gas properties. When leases are developed, expire or are
abandoned, the related costs are transferred from unevaluated oil and gas properties to oil and gas properties subject to amortization.
Additionally, we review the carrying costs of unevaluated oil and gas properties for the purpose of determining probable future lease
expirations and abandonments, and prospective discounted future economic benefit attributable to the leases. 

Unevaluated
oil and gas properties not subject to amortization include the following at December 31, 2022 and 2021: 

At 
 December

The
carrying value of unevaluated oil and gas prospects includes 2,343,126 expended for properties in South America at December 31, 2022
and 2021. We are maintaining our interest in these properties. 

29 

Stock-Based
Compensation. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions. These assumptions
include estimating the volatility of our common stock price over the expected life of the options, dividend yield, an appropriate risk-free
interest rate and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements. Changes in the subjective assumptions
can materially affect the estimated fair value of stock-based compensation and consequently, the related amount recognized on the Statements
of Operations. 

Full
Cost Method of Accounting for Oil and Gas Activities. We follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas property acquisition,
exploration and development activities. Under this method, all productive and nonproductive costs incurred in connection with the exploration
for and development of oil and gas reserves are capitalized. Capitalized costs include lease acquisition, geological and geophysical
work, delay rentals, costs of drilling, completing and equipping successful and unsuccessful oil and gas wells and related internal costs
that can be directly identified with acquisition, exploration and development activities, but does not include any cost related to production,
general corporate overhead or similar activities. Gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties is not recognized
unless significant amounts of oil and gas reserves are involved. No corporate overhead has been capitalized as of December 31, 2022.
The capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, plus estimated future development costs relating to proved reserves, are amortized on
a units-of-production method over the estimated productive life of the reserves. Unevaluated oil and gas properties are excluded from
this calculation. The capitalized oil and gas property costs, less accumulated amortization, are limited to an amount (the ceiling limitation)
equal to the sum of: (a) the present value of estimated future net revenues from the projected production of proved oil and gas reserves,
calculated using the average oil and natural gas sales price received by the company as of the first trading day of each month over the
preceding twelve months (such prices are held constant throughout the life of the properties) and a discount factor of 10 ; (b) the cost
of unproved and unevaluated properties excluded from the costs being amortized; (c) the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved
properties included in the costs being amortized; and (d) related income tax effects. Costs in excess of this ceiling are charged to
proved properties impairment expense. 

Results
of Operations 

Year
Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021 

Oil
and Gas Revenues . Total oil and gas revenues increased 23 to 1,638,841 in 2022 from 1,330,198 in 2021. 

The
increase in revenues was attributable to (i) improved commodity pricing, including 46 and 24 increases in crude oil prices and natural
gas prices, respectively, realized during 2022 compared to 2021, and (ii) a 23 increases in natural gas production volumes during 2022
compared to 2021; partially offset by a 26 decline in crude oil production. 

The
following table sets forth the gross and net producing wells, net oil and gas production volumes and average hydrocarbon sales prices
for 2022 and 2021 (excluding information pertaining to cost method investments):

The
change in production volumes reflects domestically, increased production from our Reeves County wells after being put on gas lift in
late 2021, partially offset by natural production declines. 

The
change in average sales prices realized reflects a spike in global energy prices in early- to mid-2022 accompanying uncertainty associated
with the Russian invasion of Ukraine. 

All
oil and gas sales revenues for 2022 and 2021, by region, were as follows:

Lease
Operating Expenses. Lease operating expenses, excluding expenses attributable to our cost method investment in Colombia, decreased
12.3 to 531,675 in 2022 from 606,210 in 2021. 

Lease
operating expense, by region, for 2022 and 2021, were as follows:

 631,033 
 631,033 
 
 2021 
 
 626,210 
 626,210 

The
change in lease operating expenses was principally attributable to a decrease in non-recurring water disposal and operating costs incurred
on the Lou Brock well during testing in 2021, which well was ultimately plugged and abandoned. 

30 

Depreciation
and Depletion Expense. Depreciation and depletion expense decreased by 16 to 205,458 in 2022 from 245,606 in 2021. The decrease
in depreciation and depletion during 2022 was attributable to the decrease in oil production during 2022. 

General
and Administrative Expenses (Excluding Stock-Based Compensation). General and administrative expense increased by 18 to 1,374,060
in 2022 from 1,168,969 in 2021. The change in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to a bonus payment to our
CEO of 200,000 and increase in the base salary of our CEO from 120,000 to 180,000 annually, effective September 1, 2022. 

Stock-Based
Compensation. Stock-based compensation decreased to 206,210 in 2022 from 323,611 in 2021. The decrease in stock-based compensation
was attributable to vesting during 2021 of prior year option grants. 

Other
Income (Expense) . Other income/expense, net, totaled 33,641 of income during 2022, compared to 12,668 of income during 2021. Other
income consisted of interest earned on cash balances. The increase in other income was attributable to higher interest rates earned on
cash balances. 

Financial
Condition 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources. At December 31, 2022, we had a cash balance of 4,547,210 and working capital of 4,601,168, compared to a
cash balance of 4,894,577 and working capital of 5,052,685 at December 31, 2021. 

Cash
Flows . Operating activities used cash of 228,962 during 2022, compared to 680,691 used during 2021. The change in cash flows from
operating activities was attributable to increased revenues and a resulting lower loss incurred during 2022. 

Investing
activities used cash of 1,661,405 during 2022, compared to 238,180 used during 2021. The increase in cash used in investing activities
is primarily attributable to the acquisition of additional interests in Hupecol Meta 657,638) and direct investments in Hupecol Meta 988,722). 

Financing
activities provided cash of 1,543,000 during 2022, compared to 4,570,888 provided during 2021. During 2022, cash provided by financing
activities was attributable to funds received from the sale of common stock under our 2022 ATM Offering. During 2021, cash provided by
financing activities was attributable to funds received from the sale of common stock 6,575,889) under our 2021 ATM Offering and 2021
Supplemental ATM Offering, partially offset by the payment of dividends on preferred stock 37,201) and redemption of all remaining
outstanding shares of preferred stock 1,967,800). As of December 31, 2022, 2 million was still available under the 2022 ATM offering. 

Long-Term
Liabilities. At December 31, 2022, we had long-term liabilities of 219,148, compared to 279,953 at December 31, 2021. Long-term
liabilities, as of December 31, 2022, consisted of a reserve for plugging costs of 72,789 and a lease liability of 146,359. 

31 

Capital
and Exploration Expenditures and Commitments. Our principal capital and exploration expenditures relate to ongoing efforts to acquire,
drill and complete prospects, in particular our Colombian acreage held through Hupecol Meta. During 2022, capital expenditures relating
to Hupecol Meta increased sharply with our acquisition of additional interests in Hupecol Meta and our investments in Hupecol Meta to
fund our share of costs associated with the initial wells drilled on the CPO-11 block. Based on discussions with Hupecol Meta, we anticipate
that additional expenditures will be made to acquire seismic data and to support additional drilling operations on the CPO-11 block in
2023 and beyond with an initial focus on drilling a horizontal well in the Venus Exploration Area. There are no present plans to conduct
additional drilling operations on our U.S. properties. The actual timing and number of well operations undertaken will be principally
controlled by the operators of our acreage based on a number of factors, including but not limited to availability of financing, performance
of existing wells on the subject acreage, energy prices and industry condition and outlook, costs of drilling and completion services
and equipment and other factors beyond our control or that of our operators. 

In
addition to possible operations on our existing acreage holdings, we continue to evaluate drilling prospects in which we may acquire
an interest and participate. 

As
our allocable share of well costs will vary depending on the timing and number of wells drilled as well as our working interest in each
such well and the level of participation of other interest owners, we have not established a drilling budget but will budget on a well-by-well
basis as our operators propose wells. 

We
believe that we have the ability, through our cash on-hand, to fund operations and our cost for all planned seismic expenditures and
wells expected to be drilled during 2023 and for the twelve months following the issuance of these financial statements. 

In
the event that we pursue additional acreage acquisitions or expand our drilling plans, we may be required to secure additional funding
beyond our resources on hand. While we may, among other efforts, seek additional funding from at-the-market sales of common
stock, and private sales of equity and debt securities, we presently have, as of December 31, 2022, less than 600,000 authorized shares
of common stock available for issuance to support equity capital raises and we have no commitments to provide additional funding, and
there can be no assurance that we can secure the necessary capital to fund our share of drilling, acquisition or other costs on acceptable
terms or at all. If, for any reason, we are unable to fund our share of drilling and completion costs and fail to satisfy commitments
relative to our interest in our acreage, we may be subject to penalties or to the possible loss of some of our rights and interests in
prospects with respect to which we fail to satisfy funding commitments and we may be required to curtail operations and forego opportunities. 

Item
7A. Quantitative
 and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Commodity
Price Risk 

The
price we receive for our oil and gas production heavily influences our revenue, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth.
Crude oil and natural gas are commodities and, therefore, their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor
changes in supply and demand. Historically, the markets for oil and gas have been volatile, and these markets will likely continue to
be volatile in the future. The prices we receive for production depends on numerous factors beyond our control. 

We
have not historically entered into any hedges or other derivative commodity instruments or transactions designed to manage, or limit
exposure to oil and gas price volatility.

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under the supervision and with the participation of management,
including our principal executive officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
based on the 2013 framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (the COSO Framework ). Based on this evaluation under the COSO Framework, management concluded
that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2022. Such conclusion reflects our chief executive
officer s assumption of duties of the principal financial officer and the resulting lack of segregation of duties. Until we are
able to remedy this material weakness, we are relying on third party consultants to assist with financial reporting. 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the
Securities and Exchange Commission that permit smaller reporting companies to provide only management s report in this annual report. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2022 that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Shareholders and Board of Directors of 

 Houston
American Energy Corp. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Houston American Energy Corp. (the Company as of December
31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the years
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our
opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31,
2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

The
critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters
does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Depreciation,
depletion and amortization and impairment of oil and gas properties 

At
December 31, 2022, the net carrying value of the Company s oil and gas properties was 65.1 million, depreciation, depletion and
amortization DD A expense was 0.2 million, and impairment expense was 0 million for the year then ended. As described
in Note 1, the Company follows the full cost method of accounting for its oil and gas properties. DD A of the cost of proved oil
and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method based on proved oil and gas reserves, as estimated by the Company s
internal and external reservoir engineers. Under the full cost method, a ceiling test is performed each quarter. The ceiling test determines
a limit, on a country-by-country basis, on the book value of oil and gas properties. The capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties,
net of accumulated DD A, impairment, and the related deferred income taxes, may not exceed the estimated future net cash flows from
proved oil and gas reserves. If capitalized costs exceed this limit, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. 

Proved
oil and gas reserves are those quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and natural gas liquids, which by analysis of geoscience
and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known
reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. Additionally, the expected future
cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes
from estimated oil and gas reserves. Significant judgment is required by the Company s internal and external reservoir engineers
in evaluating geological and engineering data when estimating oil and gas reserves. Estimating reserves also requires the selection of
inputs, including oil and gas price assumptions, future operating and capital costs assumptions, and tax rates by jurisdiction, among
others. Because of the complexity involved in estimating oil and gas reserves, management engaged independent petroleum engineers to
prepare the proved oil and gas reserve estimates for select properties as of December 31, 2022. 

Auditing
the Company s DD A and impairment calculations is complex because of the use of the work of the internal reservoir engineers
and the independent petroleum engineers and the evaluation of management s determination of the inputs described above used by
the engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves. We obtained an understanding of the Company s controls over its process to calculate
DD A and impairment, including management s controls over the completeness and accuracy of the financial data provided to the
engineers for use in estimating oil and gas reserves. Our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the professional qualifications
and objectivity of the independent petroleum engineers primarily responsible for the preparation of the reserve estimates for select
properties. In addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the
financial data and inputs described above used by the engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves by agreeing them to source documentation,
and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. For proved undeveloped reserves, we evaluated management s
development plan for compliance with the SEC rule that undrilled locations are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific
circumstances justify a longer time, by assessing consistency of the development projections with the Company s development plan
and the availability of capital relative to the development plan. We also tested the mathematical accuracy of the DD A and impairment
calculations, including comparing the oil and gas reserve amounts used in the calculations to the Company s reserve reports.

 NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

for the year ended December 31, 2022. As a result of the steep global economic slowdown that began in March 2020 as the coronavirus
pandemic COVID-19 spread, oil and gas demand and prices realized from oil and gas sales declined sharply. While the COVID-19
crisis has subsided and the global economy and oil and gas prices have recovered, future spikes in COVID-19 infection rates could result
in declines in global economic activity and oil and gas prices. Any such future declines in prices would adversely affect the Company s
revenues and profitability. 

During
2021 and 2022, the Company raised million and million, net of offering costs, from the sale of common stock. With those funds,
the Company believes that it has the ability to fund, from cash on hand, its operating costs and anticipated drilling operations for
at least the next twelve months following the issuance of these financial statements. 

The
actual timing and number of wells drilled during 2023 will be principally controlled by the operators of the Company s acreage,
based on a number of factors, including but not limited to availability of financing, performance of existing wells on the subject acreage,
energy prices and industry condition and outlook, costs of drilling and completion services and equipment and other factors beyond the
Company s control or that of its operators. 

In
the event that the Company pursues additional acreage acquisitions or expands its drilling plans, the Company may be required to
secure additional funding beyond our resources on hand. While the Company may, among other efforts, seek additional funding from
 at-the-market sales of common stock, and private sales of equity and debt securities, it presently has limited shares
of common stock authorized for issuance to support sales of such shares and does not have any commitments to provide additional
funding, and there can be no assurance that the Company can secure the necessary capital to fund its share of drilling, acquisition
or other costs on acceptable terms or at all. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had million remaining available from the 2022
ATM offering. If, for any reason, the Company is unable to fund its share of drilling and completion costs, it would forego
participation in one or more of such wells. In such event, the Company may be subject to penalties or to the possible loss of some
of its rights and interests in prospects with respect to which it fails to satisfy funding obligations and it may be required to
curtail operations and forego opportunities. 

cash equivalents outstanding. 

million in excess of the FDIC s current insured limit of at December 31,
2022 for interest bearing accounts. The Company also had cash deposits of in Colombian banks at December 31, 2022 that are not
insured by the FDIC. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash and cash equivalents.

directors and sole officer. The options have a ten -year life and are exercisable at per share. The aggregate options granted
to directors . The options granted to the Company s
sole officer vest one year from the date of grant. The grant date fair value of these stock options was based on the Black-Scholes
Option Pricing model based on the following assumptions: market value of common stock on grant date ; risk free interest
rate based on the applicable US Treasury bill rate ; dividend yield ; volatility factor based on the trading history

approval of the Company s 2021 Plan, received the requisite approval of shareholders and are treated as granted during 2021. The
options have a ten-year life, are exercisable at per share and vested in full on shareholder approval of the 2021 Plan. The
grant date fair value of these stock options was based on the Black-Scholes Option Pricing model based on the following assumptions:
market value of common stock on grant date ; risk free interest rate based on the applicable US Treasury bill rate - ;
dividend yield ; volatility factor based on the trading history of the Company ; weighted average expected life
in years ; and expected forfeiture rate .

The
Company is currently subject to a three-year statute of limitation for federal tax purposes and, in general, three to four-year statute
of limitation for state tax purposes. State NOL expiration will occur beginning in 2033 and Federal NOL expiration
will begin in 2032.

March 27, 2020. The CARES Act amended the net operating loss provisions in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act TCJA and allows
for the carryback of NOL s arising in the taxable years ending December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2021, to each of the five
taxable years preceding the taxable year of the loss. Additionally, the limitation related to application of NOL s towards
current federal taxable income has been removed for taxable years prior to January 1, 2021; thereby allowing of the NOL to be applied
to federal taxable income.

Legal
Contingencies 

The
Company is subject to legal proceedings, claims and liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of its business. The Company accrues
for losses associated with legal claims when such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. These accruals are adjusted as
further information develops or circumstances change. 

Environmental
Contingencies 

The
Company s oil and natural gas operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the
release or disposal of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may
require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences, restrict the types, quantities and concentration of substances that can
be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities, limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain
lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas, and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our
operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties,
incurrence of investigatory or remedial obligations or the imposition of injunctive relief. Changes in environmental laws and regulations
occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent or costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements
could require the Company to make significant expenditures to maintain compliance, and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on
its results of operations, competitive position or financial condition as well as the industry in general. Under these environmental
laws and regulations, the Company could be held strictly liable for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property
contamination regardless of whether the Company was responsible for the release or if its operations were standard in the industry at
the time they were performed. The Company maintains insurance coverage, which it believes is customary in the industry, although the
Company is not fully insured against all environmental risks. 

Development
Commitments 

During
the ordinary course of oil and gas prospect development, the Company commits to a proportionate share for the cost of acquiring mineral
interests, drilling exploratory or development wells and acquiring seismic and geological information. 

Production
Incentive Arrangements and ORRIs 

In
conjunction with our efforts to secure oil and gas prospects, financing and services, we have, from time to time, granted overriding
royalty interests ORRI in various properties and have adopted a Production Incentive Compensation Plan under which grant
interests in pools, which may take the form of ORRIs, to provide additional incentive identify and secure attractive oil and gas properties. 

Production
Incentive Compensation Plan. In August 2013, the Company s compensation committee adopted a Production Incentive Compensation
Plan. The purpose of the Plan is to encourage employees and consultants participating in the Plan to identify and secure for the Company
participation in attractive oil and gas opportunities. 

Under
that Plan, the committee may establish one or more Pools and designate employees and consultants to participate in those Pools and designate
prospects and wells, and a defined percentage of the Company s revenues from those wells, to fund those Pools. Only prospects acquired
on or after establishment of the Plan, and excluding all prospects in Colombia, may be designated to fund a Pool. (the Pool Cap provided,
however, that with respect to wells with a net revenue interest to the 8/8 of less than , the Pool Cap with respect to such wells
shall be reduced on a 1-for-1 basis such that no portion of the Company s revenues from a well may be designated to fund a Pool
if the NRI is or less . 

Designated
participants in a Pool will be assigned a specific percentage out of the Company s revenues assigned to the Pool and will be paid
that percentage of such revenues from all wells designated to such Pool and spud during that participant s employment or services
with the Company. In no event may the percentage assigned to the Company s chief executive officer relative to any well within
a Pool exceed one-half of the applicable Pool Cap for that well. Payouts of revenues funded into Pools shall be made to participants
not later than 60 days following year end, subject to the committee s right to make partial interim payouts. Participants will
continue to receive their percentage share of revenues from wells included in a Pool and spud during the term of their employment or
service so long as revenues continue to be derived by the Company from those wells even after termination of employment or services of
the Participant; provided, however, that a participant s interest in all Pools shall terminate on the date of termination of employment
or services where such termination is for cause. 

In
the event of certain changes in control of the Company, the acquirer or survivor of such transaction must assume all obligations under
the Plan; provided, however, that in lieu of such assumption obligation, the committee may, at its sole discretion, assign overriding
royalty interests in wells to substantially mirror the rights of participants under the Plan. Similarly, the committee may, at any time,
assign overriding royalty interests in wells in settlement of obligations under the Plan. 

The
Plan is administered by the Company s compensation committee which shall consult with the Company s chief executive officer
relative to Pool participants, prospects, wells and interests assign although the committee will have final and absolute authority to
make all such determinations. 

During
2022, no pools were established under the Plan. 

The
Company records amounts payable under the plan as a reduction to revenue as revenues are recognized from prospects included in pools
covered by the plan based on the participants interest in such prospect revenues and records the same as accounts payable until
such time as such amounts are paid out. 

ORRI
Grants . All present and future prospects in Colombia are subject to a ORRI in favor of each of our Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer and a former director. 

Payments
made by the Company under the Plan and ORRI s totaled and in 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022
and 2021, the Company had accrued and , respectively, under the Plan as accounts payable.

Reserve
Information and Related Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows 

The
unaudited supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities has been presented in accordance with reserve
estimation and disclosures rules issued by the SEC in 2008. Under those rules, average first-day-of-the-month price during the 12-month
period before the end of the year are used when estimating whether reserve quantities are economical to produce. This same -month average
price is also used in calculating the aggregate amount of (and changes in) future cash inflows related to the standardized measure of
discounted future net cash flows. The rules also allow for the use of reliable technology to estimate proved oil and gas reserves if
those technologies have been demonstrated to result in reliable conclusions about reserve volumes. Disclosures by geographic area include
the United States and South America, which consists of our interests in Colombia. The supplemental unaudited presentation of proved reserve
quantities and related standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows provides estimates only and does not purport to reflect
realizable values or fair market values of the Company s reserves. Volumes reported for proved reserves are based on reasonable
estimates. These estimates are consistent with current knowledge of the characteristics and production history of the reserves. The Company
emphasizes that reserve estimates are inherently imprecise and that estimates of new discoveries are more imprecise than those of producing
oil and gas properties. Accordingly, significant changes to these estimates can be expected as future information becomes available. 

Proved
reserves are those estimated reserves of crude oil (including condensate and natural gas liquids) and natural gas that geological and
engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic
and operating conditions. Proved developed reserves are those expected to be recovered through existing wells, equipment, and operating
methods. 

The
reserve estimates set forth below were prepared by Russell K. Hall and Associates, Inc. R.K. Hall ), utilizing reserve
definitions and pricing requirements prescribed by the SEC. R.K. Hall is an independent professional engineering firm specializing in
the technical and financial evaluation of oil and gas assets. R.K. Hall s report was conducted under the direction of Russell K.
Hall, founder and President of R.K. Hall. Mr. Hall holds a BS in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Oklahoma and is a registered
professional engineer with more than years of experience in reserve evaluation services. R.K. Hall and their respective employees
have no interest in the Company and were objective in determining the results of the Company s reserves.

As

The
standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves is computed using average first-day-of
the-month prices for oil and gas during the preceding 12 month period (with consideration of price changes only to the extent provided
by contractual arrangements), applied to the estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves, less estimated future expenditures
(based on year-end costs) to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves, less estimated related future income tax expenses
(based on year-end statutory tax rates, with consideration of future tax rates already legislated), and assuming continuation of existing
economic conditions. Future income tax expenses give effect to permanent differences and tax credits but do not reflect the impact of
continuing operations including property acquisitions and exploration. The estimated future cash flows are then discounted using a rate
of ten percent a year to reflect the estimated timing of the future cash flows.
