 Shown below is a profile and geographical footprint of the Bank as of December 31, 2022: We serve affluent and growing markets in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont with more than 50 thousand, 48 thousand, and 24 thousand customers, respectively in those states. Within these markets, tourism, agriculture, and fishing industries remain strong and continue to drive economic activity. These core markets have also maintained their strength through diversification into various service industries. Maine We have 22 full-service branches in operation and two wealth management offices principally located in the regions of downeast, midcoast and central Maine, which are generally characterized as rural areas. We also have a commercial loan production office in Portland, Maine. In Maine, we consider our primary market areas to be Hancock, Penobscot, Washington, Kennebec, Knox, and Sagadahoc counties. The economies in these counties are based primarily on tourism, healthcare, fishing and lobstering, agriculture, state government, and small local businesses. They are also supported by a large contingent of retirees. New Hampshire We have 21 full-service branches in operation and five wealth management offices in New Hampshire located in the Lake Sunapee, Upper Valley, and Merrimack Valley regions. There are several distinct markets within each of these regions. The towns or cities of Nashua, Manchester, and Concord are considered part of the Merrimack Valley. Nashua, New Hampshire is a regional commercial, entertainment, and dining destination. With its border to Massachusetts, it also enjoys a vibrant high-tech industry and a robust retail industry due in part to New Hampshire s absence of a sales tax. The upper valley region of New Hampshire includes the towns of Lebanon and Hanover, which are home to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center and Dartmouth College, respectively. The Lake Sunapee market is a popular year-round recreation and resort area that includes both Lake Sunapee and Mount Sunapee and includes the towns of Claremont, New London, and Newport. Vermont We have 10 full-service branches in operation in Vermont. The branches are primarily located in central Vermont within the counties of Rutland, Windsor and Orange. These markets are home to many attractions, including Killington Mountain, Okemo Resort, and the city of Rutland. Popular vacation destinations in this region include Woodstock, Brandon, and Ludlow.

 SUBSIDIARY ACTIVITIES Bar Harbor Bankshares is a legal entity separate and distinct from its first-tier bank subsidiary, Bar Harbor Bank Trust, and its second-tier subsidiaries, Bar Harbor Wealth Management and Cottage Street Corporation. There are two Connecticut statutory trusts for which all of the common stock is owned. These capital trusts are unconsolidated, and their only material asset is a 20.6 million trust preferred security related to the junior subordinated debentures reported in Note 7 Borrowed Funds of the Consolidated Financial Statements. AVAILABLE INFORMATION Annual, quarterly, and current reports, proxy statements and other information are required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. The SEC maintains a website at www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy statements, and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. The Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements, and amendments to those documents filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, are also available free of charge on our website at www.barharbor.bank under the Shareholders Relations link as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. Investors should note announcements of material information to investors and others are performed using SEC filings, press releases, and postings on our website (www.barharbor.bank), including news and announcements regarding financial performance, key personnel, brands, and business strategy.

The information on the website is not, and shall not be deemed to be, a part hereof or incorporated into this or any other filings with the SEC. COMPETITION Major competitors in market areas include local independent banks, local branches of large regional and national bank affiliates, thrift institutions, savings and loan institutions, mortgage companies, and credit unions. We effectively compete with other financial institutions by emphasizing quality customer service, making decisions at the local level, maintaining long-term customer relationships, building customer loyalty, and providing products and services designed to address customers specific needs. However, no assurance can be provided regarding the ongoing ability to compete effectively with other financial institutions in the future. No part of the business is materially dependent upon one or a few customers or upon a particular industry segment, the loss of which would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. LENDING ACTIVITIES General Loans are originated in four basic portfolio categories, which are discussed below. These portfolios include the categories commercial real estate, commercial and industrial, residential real estate and other consumer loans. Loan interest rates and other key loan terms are affected principally by our lending policy, asset/liability strategy, loan demand, competition, and the supply of money available for lending purposes. The amount of long-term fixed-rate lending and adjustable-rate loan products is monitored according to the Bank s interest rate management policy. Loans originated are held for investment except for certain residential mortgages that are underwritten with the intention to be sold in the secondary mortgage market.

For commercial loans, this may result in a period of forbearance or restructuring of the loan, which is normally done at current market terms and may not result in a troubled loan designation. For residential mortgage loans, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB guidelines are followed to attempt a restructuring that will enable owner-occupants to remain in their home. However, if these processes fail to result in a performing loan, foreclosure or other proceedings will be initiated no later than the 120th day of a delinquency, as necessary, to minimize any potential loss. Management reports on delinquent loans and non-performing assets to the Company s Board of Directors monthly. Loans are generally removed from accruing status when they reach 90 days delinquent, except for certain loans which are well secured and in the process of collection. Loan collections are managed by a combination of the related business units and the managed assets group, which focuses on larger, riskier collections.

The ACL is comprised of reserves measured on a collective (pool) basis based on a lifetime loss-rate model when similar risk characteristics exist. Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis, generally comprised of larger non-accruing commercial loans and troubled debt restructurings TDRs ).

For further discussion on derivatives see Note 10 Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Derivative products are offered in the form of interest rate swaps and interest rate caps, to commercial loan customers to facilitate their risk management strategies. An interest rate swap is entered into with a customer, while at the same time an offsetting interest rate swap with another financial institution is entered into to offset. These interest rate swap transactions allow customers to effectively fix the interest rate on their loans. Customer loan derivative income is recognized for the upfront fee paid by the customer at origination. These swaps are designated as economic hedges and transactions are cleared through arrangements with third-party financial institutions. Mortgage banking activities result in two types of derivative instruments. Interest rate lock commitments are offered to residential loan customers, to allow them the ability to lock into a fixed interest rate prior to closing, for loans intended to sell are classified as non-hedging derivatives. To offset this risk, an offsetting forward sale commitments may be entered into with national financial institutions to purchase the loans selected for sale under a best efforts or mandatory delivery contract accounted for as an economic hedge. Floating-rate fundings are certain hedging transactions and certain products, such as floating-rate loans and mortgages, determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount by reference to a benchmark rate, such as the secured interbank overnight financing rate SOFR ), London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR ), or to an index, basket or other financial metric. We continue to transition loans with LIBOR based interest rates to other benchmark rates due to recent national, international, and other regulatory rate reform guidance. The transition of those variable rate loans is expected to be complete by June 30, 2023. DEPOSIT ACTIVITIES A variety of deposit products to consumers, businesses and institutional customers with a wide range of interest rates and terms are offered. Deposits consist of interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing demand accounts, savings accounts, money market deposit accounts, and certificates of deposit. Deposits are solicited primarily in the market area, excluding brokered deposits. Competitive pricing policies, marketing and customer service to attract and retain deposits are relied upon. Customer-related deposit fees are a significant source of fee income and principally derived from debit card interchange fees earned from transaction fees that merchants pay whenever a customer uses a debit card to make a purchase. Customer deposit fees are also earned from a variety of deposit accounts with various fee schedules and terms, which are designed

 to meet the customer s financial needs. Other depositor-related fee services provided to customers include ATMs, remote deposit capture, ACH origination, wire transfers, internet bill pay, and other cash management services. Pricing of deposits is managed in keeping with the asset/liability management, liquidity and profitability objectives, subject to market competitive factors. Based on our experience, deposits are relatively stable sources of funds. Despite this stability, the ability to attract and maintain these deposits and rates are significantly affected by market conditions.

Borrowings historically have included advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston FHLB ), securities sold under repurchase agreements, and a correspondent bank unsecured line of credit. Advances may be obtained from the FHLB by collateralizing the advances with certain loans and investment securities. These advances may be made pursuant to several different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate, range of maturities and call features. We also have subordinated notes, junior subordinated debenture and other sources of liquidity that are fully described in Note 7 Borrowed Funds of the Consolidated Financial Statements RETAIL BROKERAGE SERVICES Bar Harbor Financial Services principally serves the brokerage needs of individuals ranging from first-time purchasers, to sophisticated investors.

Certain Laws and Regulations Applicable to the Company The BHC Act and other federal laws subject bank holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which the Company may engage, and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations. Below is a summary of certain provisions of the BHC Act and 
 15 

Table of Contents 
 certain other laws and regulations applicable to the Company. These laws or regulations may be amended or changed by Congress or through other governmental or legal processes, which could have a material effect on the results of the Company. Permitted Activities Generally, bank holding companies are prohibited under the BHC Act from engaging in non-banking activities, or acquiring direct or indirect control of any company engaged in non-banking activities. The Federal Reserve Board has allowed by regulation some exceptions based on activities closely related to banking including: (i) making or servicing loans; (ii) performing certain data processing services; (iii) providing discount brokerage services; (iv) acting as fiduciary, investment or financial advisor; and (v) acquiring a savings and loan association whose direct and indirect activities are limited to those permitted for bank holding companies. The Federal Reserve Board has the authority to require a bank holding company to terminate an activity or terminate control of or liquidate or divest certain subsidiaries or affiliates when the Federal Reserve Board believes the activity or the control of the subsidiary or affiliate constitutes a significant risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of any of its banking subsidiaries. A bank holding company that qualifies and elects to become a financial holding company is permitted to engage in additional activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to financial activity. The Company currently has no plans to make a financial holding company election. Safe and Sound Banking Practices Bank holding companies and their non-banking subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in activities that represent unsafe and unsound banking practices. For example, under certain circumstances the Federal Reserve Board s Regulation Y requires a holding company to give the Federal Reserve Board prior notice of any redemption or repurchase of its own equity securities if the consideration to be paid, together with the consideration paid for any repurchases during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10 or more of the company s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may oppose the transaction if it believes that the transaction would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate a regulation. As another example, a holding company is prohibited from impairing its subsidiary bank s safety and soundness by causing the bank to make funds available to non-banking subsidiaries or their customers if the Federal Reserve Board believes it not prudent to do so. The Federal Reserve Board has the power to assess civil money penalties for knowing or reckless violations, if the activities leading to a violation caused a substantial loss to a depository institution. Potential penalties are as high as 1,000,000 for each day the activity continues. Dividends Dividends from the Bank are the Company s principal source of cash revenues. The Company s earnings and activities are affected by federal and state legislation, regulations, local legislative and administrative bodies, and decisions of courts in the jurisdictions in which business is conducted. These include limitations on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Company and the Company s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders. It is the policy of the Federal Reserve Board that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization s expected future needs and financial condition. The policy provides that bank holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines the bank holding company s ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiary. Consistent with such policy, a banking organization should have comprehensive policies on dividend payments that clearly articulate the organization s objectives and approaches for maintaining a strong capital position and achieving the objectives of the policy statement. The FDIC has the authority to use its enforcement powers to prohibit a bank from paying dividends if, in its opinion, the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. Federal law also prohibits the payment of dividends by a bank that will result in the bank failing to meet its applicable capital requirements on a pro forma basis. Maine law requires the approval of the BFI for any dividend that would reduce a bank s capital below prescribed limits.

 Source of Strength In accordance with Federal Reserve Board policy, the Company is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to the Bank. Section 616 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act Dodd-Frank Act codifies the requirement that bank holding companies serve as a source of financial strength to their subsidiary depository institutions. Under this policy, the holding company is expected to commit resources to support its bank subsidiary, including at times when the holding company may not be in a financial position to provide it. As discussed below, the Company could be required to guarantee the capital plan of the Bank if it becomes undercapitalized for purposes of banking regulations. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. The BHC Act provides that, in the event of a bank holding company s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a bank subsidiary will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment. Anti-tying Restrictions Bank holding companies and their affiliates are prohibited from tying the provision of services, such as extensions of credit, to other services offered by a holding company or its affiliates. Mergers Acquisitions The BHC Act, the federal Bank Merger Act, the laws of the State of Maine applicable to financial institutions and other federal and state statutes regulate acquisitions of banks and their holding companies. The BHC Act generally limits acquisitions by bank holding companies to banks and companies engaged in activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. The BHC Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board before (i) acquiring more than 5 of the voting stock of any bank or other bank holding company, (ii) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or bank holding company, or (iii) merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company. In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and acquisition transactions, the bank regulatory authorities generally consider, among other things, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the combined organization (including the capital position of the combined organization), the applicant s performance record under the federal Community Reinvestment Act (see Community Reinvestment Act included in Item I), fair housing laws and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities. Limitations on Acquisitions of the Company s Common Stock The federal Change in Bank Control Act prohibits a person or group of persons from acquiring control of a bank holding company unless the appropriate federal bank regulator has been notified and has not objected to the transaction. Under a rebuttable presumption established by the federal bank regulator, the acquisition of 10 or more of a class of voting securities of a bank holding company with a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act would constitute the acquisition of control of a bank holding company. In addition, the BHC Act prohibits any company from acquiring control of a bank or bank holding company without first having obtained the approval of the federal bank regulator. Among other circumstances, under the BHC Act, a company has control of a bank or bank holding company if the company owns, controls or holds with power to vote 25 or more of a class of voting securities of the bank or bank holding company, controls in any manner the election of a majority of directors or trustees of the bank or bank holding company, or the federal bank regulator has determined, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that the company has the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the bank or bank holding company. Transactions with Affiliates The holding company and the Bank are considered affiliates of each other under the Federal Reserve Act, and transactions between a bank and its affiliates are subject to certain restrictions, under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal 
 17 

Table of Contents 
 Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve Board s implementing Regulation W. Generally, Sections 23A and 23B: (1) limit the extent to which an insured depository or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions (a) with an affiliate (as defined in such sections) to an amount equal to 10 of such institution s capital and surplus, and (b) with all affiliates, in the aggregate to an amount equal to 20 of such capital and surplus; and (2) require all transactions with an affiliate, whether or not covered transactions, to be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the institution or subsidiary, as the terms provided or that would be provided to a non-affiliate. The term covered transaction includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of a guarantee and other similar types of transactions. State Law Restrictions As a Maine corporation, the Company is subject to certain limitations and restrictions under applicable Maine corporate law. For example, state law restrictions in Maine include limitations and restrictions relating to indemnification of directors, distributions and dividends to shareholders, transactions involving directors, officers or interested shareholders, maintenance of books, records, and minutes, and observance of certain corporate formalities. Further, as a Maine financial institution holding company, the Company is also subject to certain requirements and restrictions under applicable Maine banking law. Capital Adequacy and Prompt Corrective Action In July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued final rules (the Capital Rules that established the current capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. The Capital Rules generally implement the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision s December 2010 final capital framework referred to as Basel III for strengthening international capital standards. In addition, the Capital Rules implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, including the requirements of Section 939A to remove references to credit ratings from the federal banking agencies rules. The Capital Rules substantially revised the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries. The risk based capital guidelines are designed to make regulatory capital requirements sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies, to account for off-balance sheet exposures and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid, low-risk assets. The Capital Rules: (i) require a capital measure called Common Equity Tier 1 CET1 and related regulatory capital ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets; (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and Additional Tier 1 capital instruments meeting certain revised requirements; (iii) mandate that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital; and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions from and adjustments to capital as compared to existing regulations. The Capital Rules revised the definitions and the components of regulatory capital and impacted the calculation of the numerator in banking institutions regulatory capital ratios. The Capital Rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weightings, generally ranging from 0 for U.S. government and agency securities to 600 for certain equity exposures, resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset classes. Pursuant to Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act FDI Act ), federal banking agencies are required to take prompt corrective action should an insured depository institution fail to meet certain capital adequacy standards. At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits. Furthermore, if an insured depository institution is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the appropriate federal banking agency, and the holding company must guarantee the performance of that plan. Based upon its capital levels, a bank that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such treatment. For purposes of Section 38 of the FDI Act, for an insured depository institution to be classified as well-capitalized, it must have a: 
 18 

Table of Contents 
 (i) total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10 , (ii) Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8 , (iii) CET1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.5 , and (iv) leverage ratio of at least 5 . In order to be classified as well-capitalized under the relevant regulatory framework, the Company must, on a consolidated basis, have a: (i) total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10 , and (ii) Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6 . Both the Bank and the Company have always maintained regulatory capital ratios above the levels to be considered quantitatively well-capitalized. For information regarding the regulatory capital ratios of the Bank and the Company as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022, respectively, see the discussion under the section captioned Capital Resources included in Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report and Note 12 Shareholders Equity and Earnings Per Common Share of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Significant Banking Regulations Applicable to the Bank Deposit Insurance The Bank s deposit accounts are fully insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund DIF of the FDIC up to the deposit insurance limits set forth in applicable law and regulations. The FDIC uses a risk-based assessment system that imposes insurance premiums based upon a risk matrix that accounts for a bank s capital level and supervisory rating (CAMELS rating). The risk matrix uses different risk categories distinguished by capital levels and supervisory ratings. The base for deposit insurance assessments is consolidated average assets less average tangible equity. Assessment rates are calculated using formulas that take into account the risk of the institution being assessed. The FDIC may increase or decrease the assessment rate schedule in order to manage the DIF to prescribed statutory target levels. An increase in the risk category for the Bank or in the assessment rates could have an adverse effect on the Bank s and consequently the Company s earnings. The FDIC may terminate deposit insurance if it determines the institution involved has engaged in or is engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition, or has violated applicable laws, regulations or orders. Consumer Financial Protection The Company is subject to a number of federal and state consumer protection laws that govern its relationship with its customers. These laws include, for example, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act and these federal laws respective state law counterparts, as well as state usury laws and laws regarding unfair and deceptive acts and practices. These and other federal laws, among other things, require disclosures of the cost of credit and terms of deposit accounts, provide substantive consumer rights, prohibit discrimination in credit transactions, regulate the use of credit report information, provide financial privacy protections, prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive practices, restrict the Bank s ability to raise interest rates and subject the Bank to substantial regulatory oversight. Violations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant potential liability from litigation brought by customers, including actual damages, restitution and attorneys fees. Further, the CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial laws that apply to all banks, including, among other things, the authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices. Abusive acts or practices are defined as those that materially interfere with a consumer s ability to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service or take unreasonable advantage of a consumer s: (i) lack of understanding on the part of the consumer of the material risks, costs, or conditions of the product or service, (ii) inability of the consumer to 
 19 

Table of Contents 
 protect its interests in selecting or using a consumer financial product or service, or (iii) reasonable reliance on a covered entity to act in the consumer s interests. Neither the Dodd-Frank Act nor the individual consumer financial protection laws prevent states from adopting stricter consumer protection standards. Brokered Deposit Restrictions Under the FDIC Improvement Act, banks may be restricted in their ability to accept brokered deposits, depending on their classification. Well-capitalized institutions are permitted to accept brokered deposits, but all banks that are not well- capitalized could be restricted from accepting such deposits. The Bank is currently well-capitalized and not restricted from accepting brokered deposits. Community Reinvestment Act The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 CRA ), requires depository institutions to assist in meeting the credit needs of their market areas consistent with safe and sound banking practice. Under the CRA, each depository institution is required to help meet the credit needs of its market areas by, among other things, providing credit to low- and moderate-income individuals and communities. These factors are also considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility. The applicable federal regulators regularly conduct CRA examinations to assess the performance of financial institutions and assign one of four ratings to the institution s records of meeting the credit needs of its community. During its last examination, the Bank received a CRA rating of satisfactory . Insider Credit Transactions Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act (the FRA and its implementing Regulation O, restricts loans to directors, executive officers, and principal shareholders insiders ). Under Section 22(h), loans to insiders and their related interests may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such persons and affiliated entities, the institution s total capital and surplus. Loans to insiders above specified amounts must receive the prior approval of the Board of Directors. Further, under Section 22(h) of the FRA, loans to directors, executive officers and principal shareholders must be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons, except that such insiders may receive preferential loans made under a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to the bank s employees and does not give preference to the insider over the employees. Section 22(g) of the FRA places additional limitations on loans to executive officers. A violation of these restrictions may result in the assessment of substantial civil monetary penalties on the affected bank or any officer, director, employee, agent or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of that bank, the imposition of a cease and desist order, and other regulatory sanctions. Safety and Soundness Under the FDI Act, each federal banking agency has prescribed, by regulation, non-capital safety and soundness standards for institutions under its authority. These standards cover internal controls, information and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, such other operational and managerial standards as the agency determines to be appropriate, and standards for asset quality, earnings and stock valuation. An institution that fails to meet these standards must develop a plan acceptable to the agency, specifying the steps that the institution will take to meet the standards. Failure to submit or implement such a plan may subject the institution to regulatory sanctions. Financial Privacy Section V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act GLBA and its implementing regulations require all financial institutions, including the Company and the Bank and the Bank s subsidiaries, to adopt privacy policies, restrict the sharing of nonpublic customer data with non-affiliated parties at the customer s request, limit the reuse of certain consumer information received from non-affiliated financial institutions, and establish procedures and practices to protect customer data from unauthorized access. In addition, the Fair Credit Reporting Act FCRA ), as amended by the Fair and Accurate 
 20 

Table of Contents 
 Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (the FACT Act ), includes many provisions affecting the Company, Bank, and/or their affiliates, including provisions concerning obtaining consumer reports, furnishing information to consumer reporting agencies, maintaining a program to prevent identity theft, sharing of certain information among affiliated companies, and other provisions. The FACT Act requires entities subject to FCRA to notify their customers if they report negative information about them to a credit bureau or if they are granted credit on terms less favorable than those generally available. The CFPB and the Federal Trade Commission FTC have extensive rulemaking authority under the FACT Act, and the Company and the Bank are subject to the rules that have been promulgated under the FACT Act, including rules requiring financial institutions with covered accounts (e.g. consumer bank accounts and loans) to develop, implement, and administer an identity theft protection program, as well as rules regarding limitations on affiliate marketing and implementation of programs to identify, detect and mitigate certain identity theft red flags. The Company has developed policies and procedures for itself and its subsidiaries, including the Bank, and believes it is in compliance with all privacy, information sharing, and notification provisions of the GLBA and the FACT Act. The Bank is also subject to data security standards, privacy and data breach notice requirements, primarily those issued by the FDIC, as well as under state laws. Anti-Money Laundering Initiatives and the USA Patriot Act A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions over the last two decades has been combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 USA Patriot Act ), substantially broadened the scope of United States anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued a number of regulations that apply various requirements of the USA Patriot Act to financial institutions such as the Bank. These regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identities of their customers. Financial institutions are also prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must use enhanced due diligence procedures in their dealings with certain types of high-risk customers and implement a written customer identification program. Financial institutions must take certain steps to assist government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering and report certain types of suspicious transactions. Regulatory authorities routinely examine financial institutions for compliance with these obligations, and failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, can have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These are typically known as the OFAC rules based on their administration by the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control OFAC ). The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on U.S. persons engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. The Company is responsible for, among other things, blocking accounts of, and transactions with, such targets and countries, prohibiting unlicensed trade and financial transactions with them and reporting blocked transactions after their occurrence. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences. Guidance on Sound Compensation Policies The Dodd-Frank Act requires publicly traded companies to give shareholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation at least every three years (the so-called say-on-pay vote and on so-called golden parachute payments in connection with approvals of mergers and acquisitions. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires publicly traded 
 21 

Table of Contents 
 companies to give shareholders a non-binding vote, at least once every six years, on how frequently to hold the say on pay vote. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires the federal banking agencies and the SEC to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities with at least 1 billion in total consolidated assets that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. The federal banking agencies and the SEC most recently proposed such regulations in 2016, but the regulations have not yet been finalized. If the regulations are adopted in the form initially proposed, they will restrict the manner in which executive compensation is structured. Changing Regulatory Structure and Future Legislation and Regulation Congress may enact further legislation that affects the regulation of the financial services industry, and state legislatures may enact further legislation affecting the regulation of financial institutions. Federal and state regulatory agencies also periodically propose and adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. The Company cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulations, or the application thereof, although enactment of the proposed legislation could impact the regulatory structure under which the Company operates and may significantly increase costs, impede the efficiency of internal business processes, require an increase in regulatory capital, require modifications to the Company s business strategy, and limit the Company s ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries could have a material effect on its business. Other Laws and Regulations The Company is not only subject to federal laws applicable to it, it is also subject to the rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing these federal laws. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS An investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent to our business. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect us are described below. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference herein. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair our business operations. This Annual Report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors. If any of the events described in the risk factors should actually occur, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of our securities could decline significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Credit Risks Deterioration in local economies or real estate market may adversely affect our financial performance, as our borrowers ability to repay loans and the value of the collateral securing the loans may decline. We serve individuals and businesses located in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. A substantial portion of the loan portfolio is secured by real estate in these areas and the value of the associated collateral is subject to local real estate market conditions. Furthermore, many customers in the hospitality industry rely upon a high number of tourists to vacation destinations and attractions within our markets. Our success is largely dependent on the economic conditions, including employment levels, population growth, income levels, savings trends and government policies in those market areas. A downturn in the local economies may adversely affect collateral values, sources of funds, and demand for products, all of which could have a negative impact on results of operations, financial condition and business expansion.

 High concentrations of commercial loans may increase exposure to credit loss upon borrower default. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 64 of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate, commercial and industrial and construction loans. Commercial loan portfolio concentration generally exposes lenders to greater risk of delinquency and loss than residential real estate loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation and income streams from the property. Commercial loans typically involve larger balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers as compared to residential real estate loans. As our loan portfolio contains a significant number of large commercial loans, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in non-performing loans, provision for loan losses, and/or an increase in loan charge-offs, all of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Greater than anticipated credit losses in the loan portfolios may adversely affect our earnings. Credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans and could have a material adverse effect on operating results. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loan portfolio and provide an allowance for credit losses based on a number of factors. The allowance for credit losses is evaluated on a periodic basis using current information, including the quality of the loan portfolio, economic conditions, and value of the underlying collateral and the level of non-accrual loans. Although we believe the allowance for credit losses is appropriate to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio, this allowance may not be adequate. Increases in the allowance will result in an expense for the period, thereby reducing reported net income. We are exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which we take title. In the course of business, we may own or foreclose and take title to real estate that may be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to subject property. As a result, we may be held liable for property damage, personal injury, investigation and restoration costs. The cost associated with investigation or restoration activities could be substantial. In addition, as the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. Liquidity and Interest Rate Risks Interest rate volatility could significantly reduce our profitability. Our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-bearing assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions, demand for loans, securities and deposits, policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, or the slope of the yield curve could influence not only the interest received on loans and securities and the amount of interest paid on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect (i) the ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (ii) the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities, and (iii) the average duration of loans and securities that are collateralized by mortgages. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. If interest rates decline, higher-rate loans and investments may be subject to prepayment risk, which could negatively impact our net interest margin. Conversely, if interest rates increase, loans and investment securities may be subject to extension risk, which could negatively impact our net interest margin as well. Wholesale funding sources may prove insufficient to replace deposits, support operations and future growth. We must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of customers. To manage liquidity, we use a number of funding sources in addition to core deposit growth, loan repayments and maturities of loans and securities. These sources include FHLB and FRB advances, proceeds from the sale of securities and loans and liquidity resources at the holding company. Our ability to manage liquidity will be severely constrained if unable to maintain access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable costs. In addition, if we need to rely heavily on more expensive funding sources to support future growth, revenues may not increase proportionately to cover costs. In this case, our operating margins and profitability would be adversely affected.

 Loss of deposits or a change in deposit mix could increase our cost of funding. Deposits are a low cost and stable source of funding. We compete with banks and other financial institutions for deposits. Funding costs may increase if deposits are lost and are forced to replace them with more expensive sources of funding, if customers shift their deposits into higher cost products or if we need to raise interest rates to avoid losing deposits. Higher funding costs reduce our net interest income, net interest margin, and net income. Our access to funds from subsidiaries may be restricted. The Company is a separate and distinct legal entity from the Bank and its non-banking subsidiaries. The Company depends on dividends, distributions and other payments from its banking and non-banking subsidiaries to fund dividend payments on its common stock, debt service of subordinated borrowings, fund stock repurchase program and to fund strategic initiatives or other obligations. The Company s subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to the Company based on assertion that certain payments from subsidiaries are considered an unsafe or unsound practice. Prepayments of loans may negatively impact our business as customers may prepay the principal amount of their outstanding loans at any time. The speeds at which such prepayments occur, as well as the size of such prepayments, are within the customers discretion. Fluctuations in interest rates, in certain circumstances, may also lead to high levels of loan prepayments, which may also have an adverse impact on net interest income. If customers prepay the principal amount of their loans, and we are unable to lend those funds to other borrowers or invest the funds at the same or higher interest rates, interest income will be reduced. A significant reduction in interest income could have a negative impact on results of operations and financial condition. Secondary mortgage market conditions may adversely affect financial condition and earnings. The secondary mortgage markets are impacted by interest rates and investor demand for residential mortgage loans and increased investor yield requirements for these loans. These conditions may fluctuate in the future. As a result, a prolonged period of secondary market illiquidity may reduce our loan production volumes, change loan portfolio composition, and reduce operating results. Secondary markets are affected by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginny Mae for loan purchases that meet their conforming loan requirements. These agencies could limit purchases of conforming loans due to capital constraints, changes in conforming loan criteria or other factors. Proposals to reform mortgage finance could affect the role of these agencies and the market for conforming loans. Operational Risks We are subject to a variety of operational risks, including reputational risk, and the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations. We are exposed to many types of operational risks, including reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, and unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors, including clerical or record-keeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems. If personal, non-public, confidential, or proprietary information of customers in our possession were to be mishandled or misused, we could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage, and financial loss. Because the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified. Our necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process transactions and its large transaction volume may further increase the risk that technical flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect. We may also be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond its control (e.g., computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages, natural disaster, pandemics, or other damage to property or physical assets), which may give rise to disruption of service to customers and to financial loss or liability. We are further exposed to the risk that its external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations (or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees) and to the risk that our vendors business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate. The occurrence of any of these risks could result in a diminished ability to operate (e.g., by requiring us to expend significant resources to correct the defect), as well as potential liability to customers, reputational damage, and regulatory intervention.

 Disruptions to our information systems and security breaches may adversely affect our business and reputation. In the ordinary course of business, we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct its businesses and to store sensitive data, including financial information regarding its customers. The integrity of information systems is under significant threat from cyberattacks by third parties, including through coordinated attacks sponsored by foreign nations and criminal organizations to disrupt business operations and other compromises to data and systems for political or criminal purposes. We employ an in-depth, layered, defense approach that leverages people, processes and technology to manage and maintain cybersecurity controls. Notwithstanding the strength of defensive measures, the threat from cyberattacks is severe, attacks are sophisticated and attackers respond rapidly to changes in defensive measures. Cybersecurity risks may also occur with our third-party service providers, and may interfere with their ability to fulfill their contractual obligations to us, with additional potential for financial loss or liability that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. We offer our customers the ability to bank remotely and provide other technology-based products and services, which services include the secure transmission of confidential information over the Internet and other remote channels. To the extent that our customers systems are not secure or are otherwise compromised, its network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, malicious software, phishing schemes and other security breaches. To the extent that our activities or the activities of its customers or third-party service providers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and malicious software could expose us to claims, regulatory scrutiny, litigation and other possible liabilities. Information security risks have generally increased in recent years, and continue to increase, in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the implementation of work-from-home arrangements, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties, some of which may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our systems or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities. System enhancements and updates may also create risks associated with implementing and integrating new systems. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of information technology systems, the process of enhancing our systems can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues. While to date we have not experienced a significant compromise, significant data loss or material financial losses related to cybersecurity attacks, our systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers, are under constant threat and may experience a significant event in the future. We may suffer material financial losses related to these risks or be subject to liability for compromises to its customers or third-party providers. Any such losses or liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations, and could expose us to reputation risk, the loss of client business, increased operational costs, as well as additional regulatory scrutiny, possible litigation, and related financial liability. These risks also include possible business interruption, including the inability to access critical information and systems. We have a continuing need for technological change, and we may not have the resources to implement new technology effectively, or we may experience operational challenges when implementing new technology or technology needed to compete effectively with larger institutions may not be available to us on a cost-effective basis. The financial services industry undergoes rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services, including developments in telecommunications, data processing, automation, internet-based banking, debit cards and so-called smart cards and remote deposit capture. In addition to serving clients better, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success will depend, at least in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy client demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations as we continue to grow and expand our products and service offerings. We offer electronic banking services for consumer and business customers via our website, including Internet banking and electronic bill payment, as well as mobile banking. We also offer debit cards, ATM cards, and automatic and ACH transfers. We may experience operational challenges as we implement these new technology enhancements or products, which could impair our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from such new technology or require us to incur significant costs to remedy any such challenges in a timely manner.

 Many of our larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. Third parties upon which we rely for our technology needs may not be able to develop on a cost-effective basis the systems that will enable us to keep pace with such developments. As a result, competitors may be able to offer additional or superior products compared to those that we will be able to provide, which would put us at a competitive disadvantage. We may lose clients seeking new technology-driven products and services to the extent we are unable to provide such products and services. Accordingly, the ability to keep pace with technological change is important and the failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our operations are reliant on outside vendors. Our operations are dependent on the use of certain outside vendors for its day-to-day operations. Vendors may not perform in accordance with established performance standards required in their agreements for any number of reasons including a change in the vendor s senior management, financial condition, product line or mix and how they support existing customers, or simply change their strategic focus putting us at risk. While we have comprehensive policies and procedures in place to mitigate risk in all phases of vendor management from selection to performance monitoring, the failure of a vendor to perform in accordance with contractual agreements could be disruptive to our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions. Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Bank and non-bank financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. We have exposure to different industries and counterparties through transactions with counterparties in the bank and non-bank financial services industries, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more bank or non-bank financial services companies, or the bank or non-bank financial services industries generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. These losses or defaults could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in the federal, state or local tax laws may negatively impact our financial performance and we are subject to examinations and challenges by tax authorities. We are subject to federal and applicable state tax laws and regulations. Changes in these tax laws and regulations, some of which may be retroactive to previous periods, could increase our effective tax rates and, as a result, could negatively affect our current and future financial performance. Furthermore, tax laws and regulations are often complex and require interpretation. In the normal course of business, we are routinely subject to examinations and challenges from federal and applicable state tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due in connection with investments we have made and the businesses in which we have engaged. Recently, federal and state taxing authorities have become increasingly aggressive in challenging tax positions taken by financial institutions. These tax positions may relate to tax compliance, sales and use, franchise, gross receipts, payroll, property and income tax issues, including tax base, apportionment and tax credit planning. The challenges made by tax authorities may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. If any such challenges are made and are not resolved in our favor, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The performance of our investment securities portfolio is subject to fluctuation due to changes in interest rates and market conditions, including credit deterioration of the issuers of individual securities. Changes in interest rates can negatively affect the performance of most of our investment securities. Interest rate volatility can reduce unrealized gains or increase unrealized losses in our portfolio, as was the case in 2022 with the rising rate environment. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors including monetary policies, domestic and international economic, social and political conditions and issues, including trade disputes, global health pandemics, and other factors beyond our control. Fluctuations in interest rates can materially affect both the returns on and market value of our investment securities. In addition, from time to time we may restructure portions of our investment securities portfolio as part of our asset liability management strategies or in response to liquidity needs, and we may incur losses, which may be material, in connection with any such restructuring. If we were to sell any of these securities before their value recovers, including as 
 26 

Table of Contents 
 a result of asset liability management strategies or in response to liquidity needs, we would be required to recognize these losses and the recognition of those losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, capital and financial. Impairment of investment securities or goodwill could result in a negative impact on our results of operations. In assessing whether the impairment of securities is related to a deterioration in credit factors, we consider the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the intent and ability to retain the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value in the near term. Under current accounting standards, goodwill is not amortized but, instead, is subject to impairment tests on at least an annual basis or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. A decline in our stock price or occurrence of a triggering event following any of its quarterly earnings releases and prior to the filing of the periodic report for that period could, under certain circumstances, require performance of a goodwill impairment test and result in an impairment charge being recorded for that period which was not reflected in such earnings release. During 2022, our annual impairment test conducted in October, using discounted cash flows and market based approaches, indicated that the estimated fair value of our sole reporting unit Bar Harbor Bank Trust exceeded the carrying value. In a future assessment, we could conclude that all or a portion of our goodwill is impaired, which would result in a non-cash charge to earnings. Revenues from our wealth management business are significant to earnings. Generating returns that satisfy customers in a variety of asset classes is important to maintaining existing business and attracting new business. Administering or managing assets in accordance with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws is also important to client satisfaction. Failure in either of the foregoing areas can expose us to liability, and result in a decrease in revenues and earnings. Our wealth management business may be negatively affected by changes in economic and market conditions. A decline in economic conditions, such as recession, economic downturn, and/or inflationary conditions, changes in domestic and foreign economic conditions, volatility in financial markets, and general trends in business and finance, all of which are beyond our control, could adversely impact the market value of wealth management assets under management, which are primarily marketable securities, and the fee revenues derived from the management of these assets. Strategic and External Risks Changes and instability in economic conditions, geopolitical matters and financial markets, including a contraction of economic activity, could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our success depends, to a certain extent, upon global, domestic and local economic and political conditions, as well as governmental monetary policies. Conditions such as changes in interest rates, money supply, levels of employment and other factors beyond our control may have a negative impact on economic activity. Any contraction of economic activity, including an economic recession, may adversely affect our asset quality, deposit levels and loan demand and, therefore, our earnings. In particular, interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including global, domestic and local economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, specifically, the Federal Reserve Bank FRB ). Throughout 2022 the Federal Open Market Committee FOMC raised the target range for the Federal funds rate on seven separate occasions and-citing factors including the hardships caused by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, continued global supply chain disruptions and imbalances, and increased inflationary pressure-the FOMC has indicated that ongoing increases may be appropriate. The tightening of the FRB s monetary policies, including repeated and aggressive increases in the target range for the Federal funds rate as well as the conclusion of the FRB s tapering of asset purchases, together with ongoing economic and geopolitical instability, increases the risk of an economic recession. Although forecasts have varied, many economists are projecting that U.S. economic growth will slow and inflation will remain elevated in the coming quarters, potentially resulting in a contraction of U.S. gross domestic output in 2023. Any such downturn, especially domestically and in the regions in which we operate, may adversely affect our asset quality, deposit levels, loan demand and results of operations. 
 27 

Table of Contents 
 As a result of the economic and geopolitical factors discussed above, financial institutions also face heightened credit risk, among other forms of risk. Of note, because we have a significant amount of real estate loans, decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral, which, in turn, can adversely affect the value of our loan and investment portfolios. Adverse economic developments, specifically including inflation-related impacts, may have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans or to finance future home purchases. Moreover, while commercial real estate values have stabilized as demand has returned to pre-pandemic levels in several markets; the post-pandemic outlook for commercial real estate demand remains dependent on the broader economic environment and, specifically, how major subsectors respond to a rising interest rate environment, the reduction of office utilization due to the impact of hybrid working patterns, greater flexibility for work location, and higher prices for commodities, goods and services. In each case, credit performance over the medium- and long-term is susceptible to economic and market forces and therefore forecasts remain uncertain. Instability and uncertainty in the commercial and residential real estate markets, headwinds for lease rates and landlord cash flows, as well as in the broader commercial and retail credit markets, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Monetary policy and economic environment could impact our financial performance. Our earnings are significantly affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of governmental authorities, including the Federal Reserve Board. Among the instruments of monetary policy used by the Federal Reserve Board to implement these objectives are open-market operations in U.S. Government securities and federal funds, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings, and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits. These instruments of monetary policy are used in varying combinations to influence the overall level of bank loans, investments, and deposits, and the interest rates charged on loans and paid for deposits. The Federal Reserve Board frequently uses these instruments of monetary policy, especially its open-market operations and the discount rate, to influence the level of interest rates, thereby affecting the strength of the economy, the level of inflation, or the price of the dollar in foreign exchange markets. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board have had a significant effect on the operating results of banking institutions in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. It is not possible to predict the nature of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies, or the effect which they may have on our business and earnings. Involvement in wealth management creates risks associated with the industry. Our wealth management operations present special risks not borne by institutions that focus exclusively on other traditional retail and commercial banking products. For example, the investment advisory industry is subject to fluctuations in the stock market and interest rate volatility that may have a significant adverse effect on transaction fees, client activity and client investment portfolio gains and losses. Also, additional or modified regulations may adversely affect our wealth management operations. In addition, our wealth management operations, are dependent on a small number of established financial advisors, whose departure could result in the loss of a significant number of client accounts. A significant decline in fees and commissions or trading losses suffered in the investment portfolio could adversely affect our income and potentially require the contribution of additional capital to support our operations. Strong competition within our markets may significantly impact profitability. We compete with an ever-increasing array of financial service providers. See the section entitled Competition of Item 1 of this Annual Report for additional competitor information. Competition from nationwide banks, as well as local institutions, continues to mount in our markets. To compete, we focus on quality customer service, making decisions at the local level, maintaining long-term customer relationships, building customer loyalty, and providing products and services designed to address the specific needs of customers. Failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect growth and profitability. Market changes may adversely affect demand for our services and impact revenue, costs, and earnings. Channels for servicing our customers are evolving rapidly, with less reliance on traditional branch facilities, increased use of e-commerce channels, and demand for universal bankers and other relationship managers who can service multiple product lines. We have an ongoing process for evaluating the profitability of its branch system and other office and operational facilities. The identification of unprofitable operations and facilities can lead to restructuring charges and introduce the risk of disruptions to revenues and customer relationships. We compete with larger financial institutions who are rapidly evolving their service channels and escalating the costs of evolving the service process.

 Expansion, growth, and acquisitions could negatively impact earnings if not successful. We may grow organically both by geographic expansion and through business line expansion, as well as through acquisitions. Success of these activities depends on our ability to continue to maintain and develop an infrastructure appropriate to support and integrate such growth. Success may also depend on acceptance of the Bank by customers in these new markets and, in the case of expansion through acquisitions, these factors include the long-term recruitment and retention of key personnel and acquired customer relationships. Profitability depends on whether the marginal revenue generated in the new markets will offset the increased expenses of operating a larger entity, with more staff, more locations, and more product offerings. Failure to achieve any of these success factors may have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We may be adversely affected by continuous technological change. The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional operational efficiencies. The introduction of new products and services can entail significant time and resources. Our failure to manage risks and uncertainties associated with new products and services exposes us to enhanced risk of operational lapses which may result in the recognition of financial statement liabilities. Regulatory and internal control requirements, capital requirements, competitive alternatives, vendor relationships and shifting market preferences may also determine if such initiatives can be brought to market in a manner that is timely and attractive to our customers. Products and services relying on internet and mobile technologies may expose us to fraud and cybersecurity risks. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation. Societal responses to climate change could adversely affect our business and performance, including indirectly through impacts on our customers. Concerns over the long-term impacts of climate change have led and will continue to lead to governmental efforts around the world to mitigate those impacts. Consumers and businesses also may change their behavior on their own as a result of these concerns. Our company and customers will need to respond to new laws and regulations as well as consumer and business preferences resulting from climate change concerns. Our company and customers may face cost increases, asset value reductions and operating process changes, among other impacts. The impact on our customers will likely vary depending on their specific attributes. In addition, we could face reductions in creditworthiness on the part of some customers or in the value of assets securing loans. Our efforts to take these risks into account in making lending and other decisions may not be effective in protecting us from the negative impact of new laws and regulations or changes in consumer or business behavior. Pandemics, severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, and other external events could significantly impact our business and the business of our customers. Pandemics, including the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the stability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. In particular, such events may have a particularly negative impact upon the business of customers who are engaged in the hospitality industry in our markets, which could have a direct negative impact on our business and results of operations. Further, work-from-home and other modified business practices may introduce additional operational risks, including cybersecurity and execution risks, which may result in inefficiencies or delays, and may affect our ability to, or the manner in which we, conduct our business activities. Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks

Table of Contents 
 We are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision, which may interfere with the ability to conduct business and may negatively impact our financial results. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds, the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund and the safety and soundness of the banking system as a whole, not shareholders. These regulations affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject us to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products we can offer, and/or limit the pricing we can charge on certain banking services, among other things. Compliance personnel and resources may increase costs of operations and adversely impact earnings. We are subject to possible claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibilities. From time to time, customers make claims and take legal action pertaining to our performance of fiduciary responsibilities. Whether customer claims and legal action related to our performance of fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a favorable manner, they may result in significant financial liability and/or adversely affect the market perception of us and products and services as well as impact customer demand for our products and services. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations, there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur. Fee revenues from overdraft protection programs constitute a significant portion of our noninterest income and may be subject to increased supervisory scrutiny. Revenues derived from transaction fees associated with overdraft protection programs offered to our customers represent a significant portion of its noninterest income. In response to recent increased congressional and regulatory scrutiny, and in anticipation of enhanced supervision and enforcement of overdraft protection practices in the future, certain banking organizations have begun to modify their overdraft protection programs, including by discontinuing the imposition of overdraft transaction fees. These competitive pressures, as well as any adoption by the Bank s regulators of new rules or supervisory guidance or more aggressive examination and enforcement policies in respect of banks overdraft protection practices, could cause it to modify programs and practices in ways that may have a negative impact on revenue and our earnings. General Risk Factors Changes in accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect our results of operations, and financial condition. Accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our results of operations, and financial condition. Some of the accounting policies are critical because they require us to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. We may experience material losses if such estimates or assumptions underlying in our financial statements are incorrect. From time to time, the FASB and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards or the interpretation of those standards that govern the preparation of our external financial statements. These changes could materially impact how we report our results of operations and financial condition. New or revised standards could also require retroactive application, which could result in the restatement of our prior period financial statements in material amounts. Internal controls may become ineffective in preventing or detecting material errors. We regularly review and update our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the controls are met. Any 
 30 

Table of Contents 
 failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We may be unable to attract and retain key personnel. Our success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in the financial services industry can be intense and we may not be able to hire or retain the key personnel. In addition, the Bank s rural geographic marketplace, combined with relatively expensive real estate purchase prices in the many tourist communities we serve, create additional risks for the our ability to attract and retain key personnel. The unexpected loss of key personnel could have an adverse impact on our business because of their skills, knowledge of the markets in which the we operate, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Our principal executive office is in a building located at 82 Main Street, Bar Harbor, Maine. We provide full-banking services at 53 locations throughout Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont, of which 34 are owned and 19 are leased. We also have one stand-alone drive-up window in Vermont. In addition to banking offices, we also have Operations Centers located in Ellsworth, Maine, and Newport, New Hampshire that house our operations and data processing centers. We have leased spaces in Hampden, Maine, Portland, Maine, Rockland, Maine and Manchester, New Hampshire where back office support for multiple lines of business and related functions are located. Additionally, we own a Wealth Management office located in Concord, New Hampshire. In the opinion of management, our physical properties are considered adequate to meet the needs of customers in the communities served. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are from time to time subject to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. These claims and litigation may include, among other things, allegations of violation of banking and other applicable regulations, competition laws, labor laws and consumer protection laws, as well as claims or litigation relating to intellectual property, securities, breach of contract and tort. We intend to defend ourselves vigorously against any pending or future claims and litigation. At this time, in the opinion of management, the likelihood is remote that the impact of such proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. However, one or more unfavorable outcomes in any claim or litigation against us could have a material adverse effect for the period in which they are resolved. In addition, regardless of their merits or their ultimate outcomes, such matters are costly, divert management s attention and may materially adversely affect our reputation, even if resolved in our favor.

 ITEM 6. [Reserved] ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion is management s analysis to assist in the understanding and evaluation of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Company. It should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes and selected financial data presented elsewhere in this Annual Report. Within the tables presented, certain columns and rows may not sum due to the use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes. The detailed financial discussion that follows focuses on 2022 results compared to 2021. For a discussion of 2021 results compared to 2020, see the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 . GENERAL The Company is a bank holding company headquartered in Maine, providing a broad array of banking and nonbanking products and services to businesses and consumers primarily within our three-state footprint. The Company s primary sources of revenue, through the Bank, are net interest income (predominantly from loans and investment securities) and noninterest income (principally fees and other revenue from financial services provided to customers or ancillary services tied to loans and deposits). ANNUAL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY Earnings (For year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period of 2021) Net income was 43.6 million, an increase of 11 , or 25 on a non-GAAP basis when excluding the accretion from Paycheck Protection Program PPP loan fees. The increase is primarily due to a benefit to net interest income as our assets repriced to higher rates and efficiency measures on non-interest expense. Diluted earnings per share was 2.88, an increase of 0.27 or 11 . Diluted earnings per share included a 0.01 and 0.30 benefit from PPP loans in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Return on assets increased to 1.16 from 1.06 . Return on equity was 10.91 compared to 9.50 . Both ratios include the benefit of higher net income and lower average balances related to unrealized losses on securities as noted below under the Financial Position section. Net interest income was 113.7 million, an increase of 19 . Net interest margin (NIM) was 3.36 , an increase of 48 basis points from the same period in 2021. The increase is primarily due to the repricing of variable rate assets and continued loan growth. The provision for credit losses was an expense of 2.9 million mainly due to loan growth compared to a net benefit of 1.3 million reflecting improved economic forecasts. Non-interest income was 35.3 million, down from 42.3 million primarily due to a 5.0 million decrease in mortgage banking income and 2.9 million of gains on security sales in 2021 that did not reoccur in 2022. Non-interest expense was 91.2 million versus 90.5 million. Prior year included a 2.9 million loss on extinguishment of debt. Efficiency ratio improved to 59 from 61 , excluding the impact of PPP loans it improved 59 from 64 . The improvement in the ratio showcases our displaced approach to expense management.

Table of Contents 
 Financial Position (For year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period of 2021) Total assets increased 200.6 million to 3.9 billion mainly due to strong loan growth offset in part by unfavorable fair value adjustments on our securities portfolio. Cash and cash equivalents decreased to 92.3 million, from 250.4 million principally due to self-funding loan growth in the first half of 2022. Securities were 574.4 million, or 15 of total assets, compared to 625.7 million, or 16 of total assets. Net unrealized losses were 71.8 million, or 12 of gross securities, compared with a gain of 2.6 million, or 0.4 of gross securities as fixed rate securities continued to reprice to higher interest rates. All securities are classified as available for sale preserving capital flexibility. Total loans grew 15 year-over-year as commercial loans increased 21 . Loan growth was generated across all of our footprint while adhering to selective criteria and only experienced operators. We believe that the economy in Northern New England continues to be strong despite pressures from the broader economy. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to total loans was 0.89 , decreasing from 0.90 , which reflects solid credit quality. Net charge-offs continue to be insignificant and each credit metric improved during the year. While deposit balances were consistent with 2021, we did see a decline during the fourth quarter of 2022 primarily in institutional accounts with low activity, which tend to be most rate sensitive. We continue to work with each customer on rates rather than make sweeping movements, which allows us to focus on expanding those relationships as we review individual requests. Borrowings increased to 394.2 million from 178.5 million as short-term funding was used to grow loans in the second half of 2022. Total book value per share was 26.09 compared to 28.27. Net unrealized security losses reduced book value per share by 3.87. Tangible book value per share excluding net unrealized security losses (non-GAAP) increased 9 on annualized basis on net income offset by dividends to shareholders.

 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Our accounting and reporting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP and the prevailing practices in the financial services industry. However, we also evaluate our performance by reference to certain additional financial measures discussed in this Annual Report that we identify as being non-GAAP financial measures. In accordance with SEC rules, we classify a financial measure as being a non-GAAP financial measure if that financial measure excludes or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding or including amounts, that are included or excluded, as the case may be, in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP as in effect from time to time in the United States in our statements of income, balance sheets or statements of cash flows. Non-GAAP financial measures do not include operating and other statistical measures or ratios or statistical measures calculated using exclusively either financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, operating measures or other measures that are not non-GAAP financial measures or both. The non-GAAP financial measures that we discuss in this Annual Report should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable or other financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which we calculate the non-GAAP financial measures that we discuss in this Annual Report may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names. You should understand how such other banking organizations calculate their financial measures similar or with names similar to the non-GAAP financial measures we have discussed in this Annual Report when comparing such non-GAAP financial measures. The following reconciliation table provides a more detailed analysis of these, and reconciliation for, each of non-GAAP financial measures.

 COMPARISON OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AT DECEMBER 31, 2022 AND 2021 Cash and cash equivalents Total cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2022 were 92.3 million, compared to 250.3 million at December 31, 2021. Interest-earning cash held with other banks totaled 52.4 million at year-end 2022 compared to 216.9 million at year end 2021 carrying a yield of 1.07 in 2022 versus 0.15 in 2021. The decrease in cash reflects loan growth on relatively flat deposit balances on a year-over-year basis. Securities Securities totaled 574.4 million at year-end 2022 and 625.7 million at year-end 2021. During 2022, security purchases totaled 109.0 million and were offset by 7.1 million of sales and 73.7 million of maturities, calls and pay-downs of amortizing securities. There were 11.0 million of purchases and 3.5 million in sales of FHLB stock during the year. Fair value adjustments decreased the security portfolio by 71.8 million in 2022 compared to a 2.8 million unrealized gain in 2021. Unrealized gains shifted to loss position in 2022 due to changes in the long-term treasury yield curve. The weighted average yield of the securities portfolio was 2.99 as of December 31, 2022 compared to 2.63 at year-end 2021. At the end of 2022, our securities portfolio had an average life of 9.4 years with an effective duration of 5.0 compared to an average life of 5.3 years with an effective duration of 4.2 years at the end of 2021. The extension of duration during 2022 was driven by the increase in rates. All securities remain classified as available for sale to provide flexibility in loan funding and management of our cost of funds. Loans Loans increased by 370.8 million from year-end 2021 or 15 . The increase was the net result of the strategy to grow commercial portfolios. Total commercial loans were 1.8 billion growing 19 in 2022 and 10 in 2021 when excluding PPP loans, which was driven mostly from new relationships in commercial real estate fixed-rate products. Total residential loans increased 3 or 25.5 million from year-end 2021, as we placed more originations on the balance sheet instead of selling into the secondary market. Residential loan origination volume in 2022 is significantly down as compared to the respective period of 2021 on lower refinancing activity due to increasing market rates. Allowance for Credit Losses The ACL was 25.9 million at the end of 2022 compared to 22.7 million at year-end 2021. The increase is primarily due to the loan portfolio growth. Non-accruing loans decreased to 6.5 million, or 0.23 of total loans at the end of 2022 from 10.2 million or 0.40 of total loans at year-end 2021. The ratio of accruing past due loans to total loans improved to 0.09 of total loans from 0.32 . Total delinquent and non-accruing loans as percentage of total improved to 0.32 from 0.72 . Net charge-offs continue to be historically low with a net recovery of 238 thousand in 2022 compared to a net charge-off of 209 thousand in 2021. Other Assets Total other assets increased 47.8 million to 366 million at December 31, 2022 from 318 million as of December 31, 2021. The increase is primarily attributed to a 10.1 million increase in partnership investments, and a 16.2 million increase in the asset position of the derivative and hedging instruments. Deferred tax assets, net, increased 18.9 million as of December 31, 2022 compared to 2021 driven by the unrealized loss position in the securities available for sale portfolio. Deposits and Borrowings Total deposits were 3.0 billion at the end of 2022 and 2021. Non-maturity deposits increased 97.0 million in 2022, or 4 due to growth in new accounts with over 2,460 new accounts opened. Time deposits decreased 102.1 million to 323.4 million at year-end 2022 versus 425.5 million in 2021. 178 million of brokered deposits matured in of 2021 and were not replaced due to excess liquidity. Retail time deposits decreased 63.0 million as customers moved funds to transactional accounts upon contractual maturity. Total borrowings increased by 215.6 million at December 31, 2022 primarily due to funding loan growth opportunities. Derivative Financial Instruments and Other Liabilities Other liabilities totaled 78.7 million at the end of 2022 compared to 58.0 million as of December 31, 2021. The 20.7 million increase primarily reflects a 10.1 million increase in capital commitments on limited partnership investments, a

 6.4 million net increase in customer loan swaps, and a 4.2 million variable rate loan hedge increase due to higher interest rates compared to 2021. The net fair value of all derivatives was an asset of 4.8 million at the end of 2022 compared to a 1.1 million liability at year-end 2021. The increase in net derivative fair values reflects the rise in long-term interest rates. Unused credit lines grew at the end of 2022 increasing reserves by 1.7 million, which are also recorded in other liabilities. Equity Total equity was 393.5 million at year-end 2022, compared with 424.1 million at year-end 2021. Book value per share was 26.09 as of December 31, 2022 compared with 28.27 at December 31, 2021. Equity included net unrealized losses on securities, derivative and pension revaluations, net of tax, totaling a 58.3 million loss at the end of 2022 compared to a 2.3 million gain at year-end 2021. During 2022 and 2021, the Company declared and distributed regular cash dividends on its common stock in the aggregate amounts of 15.3 million, respectively. The Company s 2022 dividend payout ratio amounted to 35 , compared with 36 in 2021. Total cash dividends paid in 2022 was 1.02 per common share of stock, compared with 0.88 in 2021. The Company and the Bank remained well-capitalized under regulatory guidelines at period end as further described in Note 12 Shareholders Equity and Earnings Per Common Share on the Consolidated Financial Statements. COMPARISON OF OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 AND 2021 Net Interest Income Net interest income for 2022 was 113.7 million compared with 95.6 million in 2021. The net interest margin was 3.36 in 2022 compared to 2.88 in the prior year. The 2022 adjusted net interest margin (non-GAAP measure), which excludes PPP loans was 3.35 versus 2.93 in 2021. Acceleration of PPP loan fee amortization due to forgiveness contributed 1 basis point to NIM in 2022 and 14 basis points in the same period of 2021. Interest-earning cash balances, held mostly at the Federal Reserve Bank, reduced NIM by 5 basis points in the year and 19 basis points in 2021. The yield on earning assets totaled 3.73 compared to 3.33 in 2021. Excluding the impact of PPP and excess cash, the yield on earning assets totaled 3.79 and 3.42 for the same periods. The yield on loans was 3.98 in 2022 and 3.78 in 2021. Excluding PPP loans the yield on loans was 3.97 in 2022, and 3.62 in 2021. Costs of interest-bearing liabilities decreased to 0.52 from 0.59 in 2021 due to decreased core deposit levels offset by increased deposit rates. Provision for Credit Losses The provision in 2022 was a 2.9 million expense versus a recapture of 1.3 million in 2021. The expense is primarily attributed to the 15 loan growth in 2022. Overall credit quality remains strong and credit quality metrics improved with decreases in non-accruing and past due loans. The benefit in 2021 is primarily due to a partial recapture of the Day 1 CECL allowance that was established January 1, 2021 given steady improvements in most macroeconomic drivers to the ACL during that year. Non-Interest Income Non-interest income in 2022 was 35.3 million compared to 42.3 million in 2021. Trust management fees were 14.6 million in 2022 compared to 15.2 in 2021 due to lower market valuation of assets under management AUM ). While assets under management were 2.3 billion compared to 2.5 billion in 2021, we added more than 132 million of new account balances. We believe that we have a strong wealth management group and are well positioned to realize an organic lift as market valuations return. Customer service fees increased 12 to 14.8 million in 2022 due to higher transaction volumes associated with 2,460 net new core accounts that opened during the year. The Company sold securities resulting in gains of 53 thousand in 2022 compared to 2.9 million during 2021. Mortgage banking income decreased to 1.6 million from 6.5 million in 2021 primarily driven by the rate environment and lower loan sales. Non-Interest Expense Non-interest expense was 91.3 million in 2022 compared to 90.5 million in 2021. Salaries and benefits expense increased 1.5 million to 48.7 million in 2022 due to a 1.5 million increase in incentive accruals on stronger performance metrics and a 1.5 million decrease in deferred loan origination costs driven by lower residential loan volume. Those additional costs in 2022 were offset in part by a 767 thousand benefit from the revaluation of post-retirement plan

 liabilities as discount rates increased throughout the year, and 539 thousand in savings from employee insurance and other benefit plans. The provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments increased 1.6 million due to higher commercial construction unused lines of credit. Other expenses increased 1.7 million in 2022 due to a 352 thousand one-time charitable contribution and a 1.4 million increase in various operating expenses including travel, software and statement processing and postage. The increases were offset with a 4.1 million decrease in non-recurring expenses. Non-recurring expenses in 2022 were mostly contract renegotiation costs totaling 267 thousand compared to 4.9 million in 2021 which included a 2.9 million prepayment penalty on debt extinguishment and 1.4 million in reduction in workforce expenses. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense was 11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared with 9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The effective tax rate increased to 20.6 in 2022 from 19.2 in 2021 due to a higher proportion of revenue from non-exempt sources. LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOWS Liquidity is measured by the ability to meet short-term cash needs at a reasonable cost or minimal loss. Favorable sources of liabilities are sought to maintain prudent levels of liquid assets in order to satisfy varied liquidity demands. Besides serving as a funding source for maturing obligations, liquidity provides flexibility in responding to customer initiated needs. Many factors affect the ability to meet liquidity needs, including variations in the markets served by its network of offices, its mix of assets and liabilities, reputation and credit standing in the marketplace, and general economic conditions. The liquidity position is actively managed through target ratios established under our liquidity and funding policy. Continual monitoring of these ratios, by using historical data and through forecasts under multiple rate and stress scenarios, allows the ability to employ strategies necessary to maintain adequate liquidity. The policy is to maintain a liquidity position of at least 8 of total assets. A portion of the deposit base has been historically seasonal in nature, with balances typically declining in the winter months through late spring, during which period the liquidity position tightens. A liquidity contingency plan is approved by the Bank s Board of Directors. This plan addresses the steps that would be taken in the event of a liquidity crisis, and identifies other sources of liquidity available to the Company. Management believes that the level of liquidity is sufficient to meet current and future funding requirements. However, changes in economic conditions, including consumer savings habits and availability or access to the brokered deposit market could potentially have a significant impact on the liquidity position. The existing cash and cash equivalents (including an interest-bearing deposit at the FRB Boston), securities available for sale and cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Future working capital needs will depend on many factors, including the rate of business and revenue growth. To the extent cash and cash equivalents, securities available for sale and cash flows from operating activities are insufficient to fund future activities, the need to raise additional funds through debt arrangements or public or private debt or equity financings may be utilized. The need to raise additional funds may be needed in the event it is determined in the future to effect one or more acquisitions of banks or businesses. If additional funding is required, we may not be able to obtain debt arrangements or to effect an equity or debt financing on terms acceptable or at all. Capital Resources Consistent with our long-term goal of operating a sound and profitable organization, at December 31, 2022, we continue to be a well-capitalized financial institution according to applicable regulatory standards. Management believes this to be vital in promoting depositor and investor confidence and providing a solid foundation for future growth. At December 31, 2022, available same-day liquidity totaled approximately 1.0 billion, including cash, borrowing capacity at FHLB and the Federal Reserve Discount Window and various lines of credit. Additional sources of liquidity include cash flows from operations, wholesale deposits, cash flow from the Company s amortizing securities and loan portfolios. We have unused borrowing capacity at the FHLB of 275 million, unused borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve of

 90 million and unused lines of credit totaling 51 million, in addition to over 200 million in unencumbered, liquid investment portfolio assets. Purchase Obligations In the normal course of conducting our banking and financial services business, and in connection with providing products and services to our customers, a variety of traditional third-party contracts for support services have been entered into. Examples of such contractual agreements include, but are not limited to: services providing core banking systems, ATM and debit card processing, trust services software, accounting software and the leasing of T-1 telecommunication lines and other technology infrastructure supporting our network. These types of purchase obligations that will come due during 2023 totaled 7.7 million as of December 31, 2022 which is expected to be funded by cash flows generated from our operations. IMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Please refer to the notes on Recently Adopted Accounting Principles and Future Application of Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Consolidated Financial Statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 contains a summary of significant accounting policies. Various elements of these accounting policies, by their nature, are subject to estimation techniques, valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments. Certain assets are carried in the consolidated statements of financial condition at estimated fair value or the lower of cost or estimated fair value. Policies with respect to the methodology used to determine the allowance for credit losses is a critical accounting policy and estimate because of its importance to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations. The critical accounting policy involves a higher degree of complexity and requires management to make difficult and subjective judgments which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters. The use of different judgments, assumptions, and estimates could result in material differences in the results of operations or financial condition. Allowance for credit losses on loans (the allowance ). The allowance is sensitive to a number of internal factors, such as modifications in the mix and level of loan balances outstanding, portfolio performance and assigned risk ratings. The allowance is also sensitive to external factors such as the general health of the economy, as evidenced by changes in unemployment rates, home pricing index, gross domestic product, retail sales and changes in commercial real estate values. We consider these variables and all other available information when establishing the final level of the allowance. These variables and others have the ability to result in actual loan losses that differ from the originally estimated amounts. Changes in the factors used by management to determine the appropriateness of the allowance or the availability of new information could cause the allowance to be increased or decreased in future periods. Additionally, changes in circumstances related to individually large credits, or certain macroeconomic forecast assumptions may result in volatility. It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one economic factor might affect the overall allowance because a wide variety of factors and inputs are considered in the allowance estimate. Changes in the factors and inputs may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all product types. Additionally, changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others. However, to consider the impact of a hypothetical stressed forecast, we estimated the allowance using forecast inputs that were severely unfavorable to the expected scenario for each macroeconomic variable. This unfavorable scenario resulted in an allowance that is approximately 8.0 million higher than the allowance using the expected scenario.

 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates/prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. Interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the Company. Other types of market risk do not arise in the normal course of our business activities. The responsibility for interest rate risk management oversight is the function of the Bank s Asset and Liability Committee ALCO ), chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and composed of various members of senior management. ALCO meets regularly to review balance sheet structure, formulate strategies in light of current and expected economic conditions, adjust product prices as necessary, implement policy, monitor liquidity, and review performance against guidelines established to control exposure to the various types of inherent risk. Interest Rate Risk: Interest rate risk can be defined as an exposure to movement in interest rates that could have an adverse impact on the net interest income. Interest rate risk arises from the imbalance in the re-pricing, maturity and/or cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities. Management s objectives are to measure, monitor and develop strategies in response to the interest rate risk profile inherent in the Bank s balance sheet. The objectives in managing the balance sheet are to preserve the sensitivity of net interest income to actual or potential changes in interest rates, and to enhance profitability through strategies that promote sufficient reward for understood and controlled risk. The interest rate risk measurement and management techniques incorporate the re-pricing and cash flow attributes of balance sheet and off-balance sheet instruments as each relate to current and potential changes in interest rates. The level of interest rate risk, measured in terms of the potential future effect on net interest income, is determined through the use of modeling and other techniques under multiple interest rate scenarios. Interest rate risk is evaluated in depth on a quarterly basis and reviewed by ALCO and the Board of Directors. The Asset Liability Management Policy, approved annually by the Bank s Board of Directors, establishes interest rate risk limits in terms of variability of net interest income under rising, flat, and decreasing rate scenarios. It is the role of the ALCO to evaluate the overall risk profile and to determine actions to maintain and achieve a posture consistent with policy guidelines. Interest Rate Sensitivity Modeling: An interest rate risk model widely recognized in the financial industry is used to monitor and measure interest rate risk. The model simulates the behavior of interest income and expense for all balance sheet and off-balance sheet instruments, under different interest rate scenarios together with a dynamic future balance sheet. Interest rate risk is measured in terms of potential changes in net interest income based upon shifts in the yield curve. The interest rate risk sensitivity model requires that assets and liabilities be broken down into components as to fixed, variable, and adjustable interest rates, as well as other homogeneous groupings, which are segregated as to maturity and type of instrument. The model includes assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to evolve through time and in different interest rate environments. The model uses contractual re-pricing dates for variable products, contractual maturities for fixed rate products, and product-specific assumptions for deposit accounts, such as money market accounts, that are subject to re-pricing based on current market conditions. Re-pricing margins are also determined for adjustable rate assets and incorporated in the model. Investment securities and borrowings with option provisions are examined on an individual basis in each rate environment to estimate the likelihood of exercise. Prepayment assumptions for mortgage loans are calibrated using specific Bank experience while mortgage-backed securities are developed from industry standard models of prepayment speeds, based upon similar coupon ranges and degree of seasoning. Cash flows and maturities are then determined, and for certain assets, prepayment assumptions are estimated under different interest rate scenarios. Interest income and interest expense are then simulated under several hypothetical interest rate conditions. The simulation models a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a 12-month period. Using this approach, we are able to produce simulation results that illustrate the effect that both a gradual rate ramp and a rate shock have on earnings expectations. Our net interest income sensitivity analysis reflects changes to net interest income assuming no balance sheet

 growth and a parallel shift in interest rates. All rate changes were ramped over the first 12-month period and then maintained at those levels over the remainder of the simulation horizon. Changes in net interest income based upon these simulations are measured against the flat interest rate scenario. As of December 31, 2022, interest rate sensitivity modeling results indicate that the balance sheet was asset sensitive over the one- and two-year horizons. The following table presents the changes in sensitivities on net interest income for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: 

Change in Interest Rates-Basis Points (Rate Ramp) 1 - 12 Months 13 - 24 Months (in thousands, except ratios) Change Change Change Change At December 31, 2022 -200 (6,183) (4.3) (19,692) (12.8) -100 (2,261) (1.6) (7,954) (5.2) +100 1,704 1.2 5,583 3.6 +200 3,253 2.3 10,627 6.9 At December 31, 2021 -100 (1,939) (2.0) (5,945) (6.4) +100 4,545 4.8 11,492 12.4 +200 9,413 9.9 22,220 23.9 Assuming short-term and long-term interest rates decline 100 to 200 basis points from current levels (i.e., a parallel yield curve shift) and the Bank s balance sheet structure and size remain at current levels, management believes net interest income will deteriorate over the one year horizon while deteriorating further from that level over the two-year horizon. Assuming the Bank s balance sheet structure and size remain at current levels and the Federal Reserve increases short-term interest rates by 100 to 200 basis points with the balance of the yield curve shifting in parallel with these increases, management believes net interest income will improve over both the one and two-year horizons. As compared to December 31, 2021, sensitivity to rate movements has decreased as the bank has incrementally shifted to a less asset sensitive position. The preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results. These hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including: the nature and timing of interest rate levels and yield curve shape, prepayment speeds on loans and securities, deposit rates, pricing decisions on loans and deposits, reinvestment or replacement of asset and liability cash flows, and renegotiated loan terms with borrowers. While assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions, we cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change. As market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis, actual results may also differ due to: prepayment and refinancing levels deviating from those assumed; the impact of interest rate changes, caps or floors on adjustable rate assets; the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans; depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes; and other such variables. The sensitivity analysis also does not reflect additional actions that the Bank s senior executive team and Board of Directors might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates, and the anticipated impact on the Bank s net interest income.

 ITEM 8. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Bar Harbor Bankshares and Subsidiaries Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Bar Harbor Bankshares and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013, and our report dated March 14, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans As described in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the allowance for credit losses on loans is established through a provision for credit losses and represents an amount which, in management s judgment, will be adequate to absorb losses on existing loans. The Company s consolidated allowance for credit losses on loan balances was 25.9 million at December 31, 2022. The allowance for credit losses on loans is comprised of reserves measured on a collective (pool) basis based on a lifetime loss-rate model when similar risk characteristics exist. Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis, generally larger non-accruing commercial loans and troubled debt restructurings.

 The Company uses the discounted cash flow method to estimate expected credit losses for all loan portfolio segments measured on a pool basis wherein payment expectations are adjusted for estimated prepayment speeds, probability of default (PD), and loss given default (LGD). The Company uses regression analysis of historical internal and peer data to determine suitable loss drivers to utilize when modeling lifetime PD. This analysis also determines how expected PD and LGD will react to forecasted levels of the loss drivers. Management utilizes various economic indicators such as changes in unemployment rates, gross domestic product (GDP), property values and other relevant factors as loss drivers and has determined that, due to historical volatility in economic data, two quarters currently represents a reasonable and supportable forecast period, followed by a six-period reversion to historical mean levels for each of the various economic indicators. The allowance evaluation also considers various qualitative factors, such as: (i) changes to lending policies, underwriting standards and/or management personnel performing such functions, (ii) delinquency and other credit quality trends, (iii) credit risk concentrations, if any, (iv) changes to the nature of the Company s business impacting the loan portfolio, (v) and other external factors, that may include, but are not limited to, results of internal loan reviews, stress testing, examinations by bank regulatory agencies, or other events such as a natural disaster. The development of the loan loss allocation for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics requires a significant amount of judgment by management and the assumptions utilized are subject to changing economic conditions . We identified the Company s allowance for credit losses on loans as a critical audit matter, specifically the economic forecasts and qualitative factors, because they involved complex auditor judgment in the evaluation of the Company s assumptions. Additionally, complex auditor judgment was required to examine the methodology that underpins the allowance for credit losses on pools of loans with similar risk characteristics. This includes modeling of PD, LGD, economic forecasts, and qualitative factors. Our audit procedures related to this critical audit matter included the following, among others: We obtained an understanding of the relevant controls related to the allowance for credit losses on loans and tested such controls for design and operating effectiveness, including those over model approval, validation and approval of key data inputs such as economic forecasts and qualitative factors. We tested the completeness and accuracy of data used by management in determining inputs to the PD and LGD, by agreeing those inputs to internal or external information sources. We evaluated management s judgments used in the identification of peer banks for PD and LGD calculations. We evaluated management s forecasts of future economic indicators for reasonableness, which included unemployment, housing price index, retail sales, and national GDP growth, among others, by comparing these forecasts to external and internal information sources. We evaluated management s judgments and assumptions used in the development of the qualitative factors for reasonableness, and tested the reliability of the underlying data on which these factors are based, by comparing information to source documents and external information sources. /s/ RSM US LLP We have served as the Company s auditor since 2015.

Credit ratings express opinions about the credit quality of a security and are utilized us to make informed decisions. Securities are triggered for further review in the quarter if the security has significant fluctuations in ratings, drops below investment grade, or significant pricing changes. For securities without credit ratings, we utilize other financial information indicating the financial health of the underlying municipality, agency, or organization associated with the underlying security. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we carried allowance on available for sale debt securities in accordance with ASC 326, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The amortized cost and estimated fair value of available for sale securities segregated by contractual maturity at December 31, 2022 are presented below.

 We expect to recover the amortized cost basis on all securities in our AFS portfolio. Furthermore, we do not intend to sell nor do we anticipate that we will be required to sell any securities in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2022, prior to this recovery. Our ability and intent to hold these securities until recovery is supported by our capital and liquidity positions as well as historically low portfolio turnover. The following summarizes, by investment security type, the impact of securities in an unrealized loss position for greater than 12 months at December 31, 2022: US Government-sponsored enterprises out of the total securities in our portfolios of AFS US Government-sponsored enterprises were in unrealized loss positions. Aggregate unrealized losses represented of the amortized cost of securities in unrealized loss positions. The FNMA and FHLMC guarantee the contractual cash flows of all of our US Government- sponsored enterprises. The securities are investment grade rated and there were no material underlying credit downgrades during the year. All securities are performing. US Government agencies out of the total securities in our portfolios of AFS US Government agency securities were in unrealized loss positions. Aggregate unrealized losses represented of the amortized cost of securities in unrealized loss positions. The Government National Mortgage Association GNMA guarantees the contractual cash flows of all of our US government agency securities. The securities are rated investment grade and there were no material underlying credit downgrades during the year. All securities are performing. Private-label of the total securities in our portfolio of AFS private-label mortgage-backed securities were in unrealized loss positions. Aggregate unrealized losses represented of the amortized cost of securities in unrealized loss positions. Based upon the foregoing considerations, and the expectation that our will receive all of the future contractual cash flows related to the amortized cost on these securities, we do not consider there to be any additional other-than-temporary impairment with respect to these securities. Obligations of states and political subdivisions thereof of the total securities in our portfolio of AFS municipal bonds and obligations were in unrealized loss positions. Aggregate unrealized losses represented of the amortized cost of securities in unrealized loss positions. We continually monitor the municipal bond sector of the market carefully and periodically evaluate the appropriate level of exposure to the market. At this time, we believe the bonds in this portfolio carry minimal risk of default and we are appropriately compensated for that risk. There were no material underlying credit downgrades during the year. All securities are performing. Corporate bonds of the total securities in our portfolio of AFS corporate bonds were in an unrealized loss position. The aggregate unrealized loss represents of the amortized cost of securities in unrealized loss positions. We review the financial strength of all of these bonds and have concluded that the amortized cost remains supported by the expected future cash flows of these securities.

As of December 31, 2022, we had remaining PPP loans and as of December 31, 2021, we had PPP loans outstanding, with an outstanding principal balance of million. PPP loans are included in the commercial and industrial portfolio segment. Characteristics of each loan portfolio segment are as follows: Commercial construction - Loans in this segment primarily include raw land, land development and construction of commercial and multifamily residential properties. Collateral values are determined based upon appraisals and evaluations of the completed structure in accordance with established policy guidelines. Maximum loan-to-value ratios at origination are governed by established policy guidelines that are more restrictive than on stabilized commercial real estate transactions. Construction loans are primarily paid by the cash flow generated from the completed structure, such as operating leases, rents, or other operating cash flows from the borrower. Commercial real estate owner occupied and non-owner occupied - Loans in these segments are primarily owner-occupied or income-producing properties. Loans to Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and unsecured loans to developers that closely correlate to the inherent risk in commercial real estate markets are also included. Commercial real estate loans are typically written with amortizing payment structures. Collateral values are determined based upon appraisals and evaluations in accordance with established policy guidelines. Maximum loan-to-value ratios at origination are governed by established policy and regulatory guidelines.

 Impact of ASC 326 Provision for credit losses Ending Balance Loan Origination/Risk Management: We have certain lending policies and procedures in place designed to maximize loan income within an acceptable level of risk. Our Board of Directors review and approve these policies and procedures on a regular basis. A reporting system supplements the review process by providing management and the Board of Directors with frequent reports related to loan production, loan quality, and concentration of credit, loan delinquencies, non-performing loans and potential problem loans. We seek to diversify the loan portfolio as a means of managing risk associated with fluctuations in economic conditions. Credit Quality Indicators: In monitoring the credit quality of the portfolio, management applies a credit quality indicator and uses an internal risk rating system to categorize commercial loans. These credit quality indicators range from one through nine, with a higher number correlating to increasing risk of loss. Consistent with regulatory guidelines, the Company provides for the classification of loans which are considered to be of lesser quality as special mention, substandard, doubtful, or loss (i.e. risk-rated 6, 7, 8 and 9, respectively). The following are the definitions of our credit quality indicators: Pass: Loans we consider in the commercial portfolio segments that are not adversely rated, are contractually current as to principal and interest, and are otherwise in compliance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Management believes there is a low risk of loss related to these loans considered pass-rated. Special Mention: Loans considered having some potential weaknesses, but are deemed to not carry levels of risk inherent in one of the subsequent categories, are designated as special mention. A special mention loan has potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the institution s credit position at some future date. This might include loans that may require a higher level of supervision or internal reporting because of: (i) declining industry trends; (ii) increasing reliance on secondary sources of repayment; (iii) the poor condition of or lack of control over collateral; or (iv) failure to obtain proper documentation or any other deviations from prudent lending practices. Economic or market conditions which may, in the future, affect the obligor may warrant special mention of the asset. Loans for which an adverse trend in the borrower s operations or an imbalanced position in the balance sheet which has not reached a point where the liquidation is jeopardized may be included in this classification. Special mention loans are not adversely classified and do not expose us to sufficient risks to warrant classification. Substandard: Loans we consider as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard loans have a well-defined weakness that jeopardizes liquidation of the debt. Substandard loans include those loans where there is the distinct possibility of some loss of principal, if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful: Loans we consider as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those loans that are classified as substandard. These loans have the added characteristic of a well-defined weakness which is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any, and calls into question the collectability of the full balance of the loan. The possibility of loss is high but because of certain important and reasonably

A summary of maturities of FHLB advances as of December 31, 2022 is as follows: 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Total FHLB advances We executed a Subordinated Note Purchase Agreement with an aggregate of million of subordinated notes (the Notes to accredited investors on November 26, 2019. The Notes have a maturity date of December 1, 2029 and bear a fixed interest rate of through December 1, 2024 payable semi-annually in arrears. From December 1, 2024 and thereafter the interest rate shall be reset quarterly to an interest rate per annum equal to the then current three-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus . We have the option beginning with the interest payment date of December 1, 2024, and on any scheduled payment date thereafter, to redeem the Notes, in whole or in part upon prior approval of the Federal Reserve. The transaction included debt issuance costs of thousand and thousand net of amortization as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 respectively, which are netted against the subordinated debt. We also have million in floating Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures Debentures issued by NHTB Capital Trust II Trust II and NHTB Capital Trust III Trust III ), which are both Connecticut statutory trusts. The Debentures were issued on March 30, 2004, carry a variable interest rate of three-month LIBOR plus , and mature in 2034. The debt is callable by the Company at the time when any interest payment is made. Trust II and Trust III are considered variable interest entities for which we are not the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, Trust II and Trust III are not consolidated into our financial statements. Repurchase Agreements We can raise additional liquidity by entering into repurchase agreements at our discretion. In a security repurchase agreement transaction, we will generally sell a security, agreeing to repurchase either the same or substantially identical security on a specified later date, at a greater price than the original sales price. The difference between the sale price and purchase price is the cost of the proceeds, which is recorded as interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. The securities underlying the agreements are delivered to counterparties as security for the repurchase obligations. Since the securities are treated as collateral and the agreement does not qualify for a full transfer of effective control, the transactions do not meet the criteria to be classified as sales, and are therefore considered secured borrowing transactions for accounting purposes. Payments on such borrowings are interest only until the scheduled repurchase date. In a repurchase agreement, we are subject to the risk that the purchaser may default at maturity and not return the securities underlying the agreements. In order to minimize this potential risk, we either deal with established firms when entering into these transactions or with customers whose agreements stipulate that the securities underlying the agreement are not delivered to the customer and instead are held in segregated safekeeping accounts by our safekeeping agents.

The amount expected to be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic pension cost over the next fiscal year is . The principal actuarial assumptions used at December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows: Net periodic pension cost Discount rate Long-term rate of return on plan assets The discount rate that is used in the measurement of the pension obligation is determined by comparing the expected future retirement payment cash flows of the plan to the Citigroup Above Median Double-A Curve as of the measurement date. The expected long-term rate of return on Plan assets reflects expectations of future returns as applied to the plan s target allocation of asset classes. In estimating that rate, appropriate consideration was given to historical returns earned by equities and fixed income securities. Our overall investment strategy with respect to the Plan s assets is to maintain assets at a level that will sufficiently cover future beneficiary obligations while achieving long term growth in assets. The Plan s targeted asset allocation is equity securities and fixed-income securities primarily consisting of long-term products. The fair values for investment securities are determined by quoted prices in active markets, if available (Level 1). For securities where quoted prices are not available, fair values are calculated based on market prices of similar securities (Level 2). For securities where quoted prices or market prices of similar securities are not available, fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows or other market indicators (Level 3).

Under the plan, we make a matching contribution of a portion of the amount contributed by each participating employee, up to a percentage of the employee s annual salary. The plan allows for supplementary profit sharing contributions by Bar Harbor, at its discretion, for the benefit of participating employees. The total expense for this plan in 2022, 2021, and 2020 was million.

We designated the Swaps as a cash flow hedge. Interest rate swap on variable rate loans In March 2021, we entered into a contract with a counterparty to manage interest rate risk associated with its variable rate loans. The instrument is specifically designed to hedge the risk of changes in its cash flows from interest receipts attributable to changes in a contractually specified interest rate, on an amount of our variable rate loan assets equal to million. The interest rate swap will effectively fix our interest rate on million of one month USD-LIBOR-BBA (or LIBOR less two days) based loan assets at plus the credit spread on the loans that reprices on weighted average basis.

 swap transactions with a notional amount of million designated as fair value hedges. These derivatives are intended to protect against the effects of changing interest rates on the fair values of fixed rate securities. The fixed rates on the transactions have a weighted average of . Economic hedges Forward sale commitments We utilize forward sale commitments on residential mortgage loans to hedge interest rate risk and the associated effects on the fair value of interest rate lock commitments and loans originated for sale. The forward sale commitments are accounted for as derivatives. We typically use a combination of best efforts and mandatory delivery contracts. The contracts are loan sale agreements where we commit to deliver a certain principal amount of mortgage loans to an investor at a specified price on or before a specified date. Generally, we enter into contracts just prior to the loan closing with a customer. Customer loan derivatives We enter into customer loan derivatives to facilitate the risk management strategies for commercial banking customers. We mitigate this risk by entering into equal and offsetting loan swap agreements with highly rated third-party financial institutions. The loan swap agreements are free standing derivatives and are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet. We are party to master netting arrangements with our financial institutional counterparties; however, we do not offset assets and liabilities under these arrangements for financial statement presentation purposes. The master netting arrangements provide for a single net settlement of all loan swap agreements, as well as collateral or cash funds, in the event of default on, or termination of, any one contract. Collateral is provided by cash or securities received or posted by the counterparty with net liability positions, respectively, in accordance with contract thresholds. The below table describes the potential effect of master netting arrangements on the consolidated balance sheet and the financial collateral pledged for these arrangements: RPA counterparty Total ) Non-hedging derivatives Interest rate lock commitments We enter into interest rate lock commitments IRLCs for residential mortgage loans, which commit us to lend funds to a potential borrower at a specific interest rate and within a specified period of time. IRLCs relate to the origination of residential mortgage loans that are held for sale and are considered derivative financial instruments under applicable accounting guidance. Outstanding IRLCs expose us to the risk that the price of the mortgage loans underlying the commitments may decline due to increases in mortgage interest rates from inception of the rate lock to the funding of the loan. The IRLCs are free standing derivatives, which are carried at fair value with changes recorded in non-interest income

For these securities, we obtain fair value measurements from independent pricing providers. The fair value measurements used by the pricing providers consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market maker quotes and live trading systems. If quoted prices are not readily available, fair values are determined using matrix pricing models, or other model-based valuation techniques requiring observable inputs other than quoted prices such as market pricing spreads, credit information, callable features, cash flows, the US Treasury yield curve, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, default rates, and the securities terms and conditions, among other things. Loans Held for Sale: The valuation of our loans held for sale are determined on an individual basis using quoted secondary market prices and are classified as Level 2 measurements.

 Financial services fees Interchange fees Customer deposit fees Other customer service fees Total Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2022 2021 Timing of Revenue Recognition Products and services transferred at a point in time Products and services transferred over time Total Trust Management Fees The trust management business generates revenue through a range of fiduciary services including trust and estate administration, financial advice, and investment management to individuals, businesses, not-for-profit organizations, and municipalities. These fees are primarily earned over time as we charge our customers on a monthly or quarterly basis in accordance with investment advisory agreements. Fees are generally assessed based on a tiered scale of the market value of assets under management at month end. Certain fees, such as bill paying fees, distribution fees, real estate sale fees, and supplemental tax service fees, are recorded as revenue at a point in time upon the completion of the service. Financial Services Fees Bar Harbor Financial Services is a branch office of Infinex, an independent registered broker dealer offering securities and insurance products not affiliated with the Company or its subsidiaries. We have a revenue sharing agreement with Infinex for any financial service fee income generated. Financial services fees are recognized at a point in time upon the completion of service requirements. Interchange Fees We earn interchange fees from transaction fees that merchants pay whenever a customer uses a debit card to make a purchase from their store. The fees are paid to the card-issuing bank to cover handling costs, fraud, bad debt costs and the risk involved in approving the payment. Interchange fees are generally recognized as revenue at a point in time upon the completion of a debit card transaction. Customer Deposit Fees The customer deposit business offers a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates, fee schedules and other terms, which are designed to meet the customer s financial needs. Additional depositor-related services provided to customers include ATM, bank-by-phone, internet banking, internet bill pay, mobile banking, and other cash management services which include remote deposit capture, ACH origination, and wire transfers. These customer deposit fees are generally recognized at a point in time upon the completion of the service.

 Other Liabilities The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in contract assets or receivables and contract liabilities or deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets. For most customer contracts, fees are deducted directly from customer accounts and, therefore, there is no associated impact on the accounts receivable balance. For certain types of service contracts, we have an unconditional right to consideration under the service contract and an accounts receivable balance is recorded for services completed. When consideration is received, or such consideration is unconditionally due, from a customer prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of a contract, a contract liability is recorded. Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue after control of the products or services is transferred to the customer and all revenue recognition criteria have been met. Costs to Obtain and Fulfill a Contract We currently expense contract costs for processing and administrative fees for debit card transactions. We also expense custody fees and transactional costs associated with securities transactions as well as third party tax preparation fees. We have elected the practical expedient in ASC 340-40-25-4, whereby we recognize the incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets we otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. Lease Liabilities Operating lease liabilities Other liabilities The calculated amount of the ROU assets and lease liabilities in the table above are impacted by the length of the lease term and the discount rate used for the present value of the minimum lease payments. The lease agreements often include one or more options to renew at our discretion. If at lease inception, we consider the exercising of a renewal option to be reasonably certain, we will include the extended term in the calculation of the ROU asset and lease liability.

Internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company s Board of Directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.

This audit report appears within Item 8 of this Annual Report. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting: No change in the internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the last fiscal year that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Bar Harbor Bankshares and Subsidiaries: Opinion on the Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Bar Harbor Bankshares and Subsidiaries (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated March 14, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion. Basis for Opinion The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ March 14, 2023

Exhibit 10.8 2022- 2024 Long Term Executive Incentive Program Guidelines This document summarizes the elements and features of Bar Harbor Bankshares BHB 2022-2024 Long Term Executive Incentive Program LTEIP ). Awards under the LTEIP are granted under the Bar Harbor Bankshares 2019 Equity Plan (the Plan and are subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and any applicable Award Agreement entered into thereunder. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed in the Plan. Individually and collectively, BHB believes the executive team has the ability to influence and drive BHB s success. The LTEIP is designed to reward executives for driving BHB s success. The objectives of the LTEIP are to: Align the interests of our executives with shareholder interests; Increase executive stock ownership/holdings; Ensure sound risk management by providing a balanced view of performance and aligning rewards with the time horizon of risk; Position BHB s total compensation to be competitive with market for meeting performance goals; Motivate and reward long-term sustained performance; and Enable BHB to attract and retain talent needed to drive BHB s success. Eligibility Eligibility to participate in the LTEIP is limited to named executive officers and selected Senior Executive Team SET members nominated by the CEO and approved by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors (the Committee ). Participants must be an active employee as of the vesting date to receive an award unless otherwise approved by the Committee. Program Components and Opportunity Grants under the LTEIP will consist of a combination of time-vesting Restricted Stock and performance-vesting Restricted Stock Units. Time-vested Restricted Stock TRS supports executive ownership and retention objectives. TRS grants will vest in equal installments over three years on April 23, 2023, April 23, 2024 and April 23, 2025 (e.g. 1/3 per year). Performance-vested Restricted Stock Units PRSUs promote pay for performance since the awards only vest when predefined performance goals are met. PRSU grants will vest, if at all, after three year performance period ends, on April 23, 2025, if the performance measures established by the Committee are met. In general, LTEIP awards will be granted for the participants in the target amounts presented in the table below; however, the amount actually granted to a participant may vary from the target (e.g., +/-20 ), as determined by the Committee, as necessary, to reflect BHB s performance, business environment, affordability and individual performance and contribution. Once the Committee determines the grant amounts, the awards will be allocated among TRS and PRSUs based on the LTEIP mix presented in the table below. 

 Participants Total LTEIP Target of Salary) LTEIP Mix of LTEIP Target) TRS PRSUs CEO/President 65 38.5 61.5 EVP CFO 40 50 50 All other members of SET 35 50 50 
 The ultimate value of the TRSs will reflect the stock price appreciation between the date of grant and the vesting date (e.g., April 23 rd of 2023, 2024 and 2025). On the other hand, the ultimate value of PRSUs will reflect the Company s future performance (i.e., 3-years) based on defined performance goals as well as stock price appreciation between the date of grant and the vesting date (e.g., April 23, 2025). The amount of PRSUs that vest can vary between 0 if goals not met or 50 and 150 of the number of PRSUs granted based on whether threshold or stretch performance goals are met. Actual vesting amounts are interpolated between threshold and stretch and will vary from the number of shares granted in each year. Award Agreements will be provided to each participant upon grant and will specify the terms and conditions of the grant. Performance Measures for PRSUs The performance goal(s) are reviewed and approved by the Committee and targets and ranges are set consistent with business plans and expectations. The performance metrics for the PRSUs for the 2022-2024 performance cycle will be set forth in the applicable Award Agreements. For the 2022-2024 performance cycle, Relative Core Return on Assets Core ROA and Relative Core Return on Equity Core ROE (each, as defined in the applicable Award Agreements), split equally, have been selected as the performance measures considering BHB s strategic plan, growth strategy, as well as alignment with shareholder interests. The performance measures will be assessed on a relative basis compared to companies in an index defined at the start of the performance period. Appendix A sets forth the Custom Industry Index of component banks for the 2022 - 2024 performance cycle. The Custom Industry Index includes exchange-traded banks and thrifts with Assets between 1.9B and 10B and headquarters in Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, excluding Puerto Rico. If any banks on the Custom Industry Index are de-registered or acquired as of the end of the performance period, they will be removed for the entire performance period and will not be replaced. The table below reflects how the performance measures will be applied to the PRSUs for the 2022-2024 performance cycle. For this purpose, Core ROA and Core ROE measures will be calculated using percentile rank of 3-year average Core ROA and Core ROE. Performance Measure Wt. Below Threshold Threshold Target Stretch 3-year average Core ROA - relative to Custom Industry Index 50 25 th percentile 50 th percentile 75 th percentile and above 3-year average Core ROE - relative to Custom Industry Index 50 25 th percentile 50 th percentile 75 th percentile and above Payout Grant Awarded) 0 50 100 150

Exhibit 10.9 2023 - 2025 Long Term Executive Incentive Program Guidelines This document summarizes the elements and features of Bar Harbor Bankshares BHB 2023-2025 Long Term Executive Incentive Program LTEIP ). Awards under the LTEIP are granted under the Bar Harbor Bankshares 2019 Equity Plan (the Plan and are subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and any applicable Award Agreement entered into thereunder. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed in the Plan. Individually and collectively, BHB believes the executive team has the ability to influence and drive BHB s success. The LTEIP is designed to reward executives for driving BHB s success. The objectives of the LTEIP are to: Align the interests of our executives with shareholder interests; Increase executive stock ownership/holdings; Ensure sound risk management by providing a balanced view of performance and aligning rewards with the time horizon of risk; Position BHB s total compensation to be competitive with market for meeting performance goals; Motivate and reward long-term sustained performance; and Enable BHB to attract and retain talent needed to drive BHB s success. Eligibility Eligibility to participate in the LTEIP is limited to named executive officers and selected Senior Executive Team SET members nominated by the CEO and approved by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors (the Committee ). Participants must be an active employee as of the vesting date to receive an award unless otherwise approved by the Committee. Program Components and Opportunity Grants under the LTEIP will consist of a combination of time-vesting Restricted Stock and performance-vesting Restricted Stock Units. Time-vested Restricted Stock TRS supports executive ownership and retention objectives. TRS grants will vest in equal installments over three years on April 23, 2024, April 23, 2025 and April 23, 2026 (e.g. 1/3 per year). Performance-vested Restricted Stock Units PRSUs promote pay for performance since the awards only vest when predefined performance goals are met. PRSU grants will vest, if at all, after three year performance period ends, on April 23, 2026, if the performance measures established by the Committee are met. In general, LTEIP awards will be granted for the participants in the target amounts presented in the table below; however, the amount actually granted to a participant may vary from the target (e.g., +/-20 ), as determined by the Committee, as necessary, to reflect BHB s performance, business environment, affordability and individual performance and contribution. Once the Committee determines the grant amounts, the awards will be allocated among TRS and PRSUs based on the LTEIP mix presented in the table below. 

 Participants Total LTEIP Target of Salary) LTEIP Mix of LTEIP Target) TRS PRSUs CEO/President 65 38.5 61.5 EVP CFO 40 50 50 All other members of SET 35 50 50 
 The ultimate value of the TRSs will reflect the stock price appreciation between the date of grant and the vesting date (e.g., April 23 rd of 2024, 2025 and 2026). On the other hand, the ultimate value of PRSUs will reflect the Company s future performance (i.e., 3-years) based on defined performance goals as well as stock price appreciation between the date of grant and the vesting date (e.g., April 23, 2026). The amount of PRSUs that vest can vary between 0 if goals not met or 50 and 150 of the number of PRSUs granted based on whether threshold or stretch performance goals are met. Actual vesting amounts are interpolated between threshold and stretch and will vary from the number of shares granted in each year. Award Agreements will be provided to each participant upon grant and will specify the terms and conditions of the grant. Performance Measures for PRSUs The performance goal(s) are reviewed and approved by the Committee and targets and ranges are set consistent with business plans and expectations. The performance metrics for the PRSUs for the 2023-2025 performance cycle will be set forth in the applicable Award Agreements. For the 2023-2025 performance cycle, Relative Core Return on Assets Core ROA and Relative Core Return on Equity Core ROE (each, as defined in the applicable Award Agreements), split equally, have been selected as the performance measures considering BHB s strategic plan, growth strategy, as well as alignment with shareholder interests. The performance measures will be assessed on a relative basis compared to companies in an index defined at the start of the performance period. Appendix A sets forth the Custom Industry Index of component banks for the 2023 - 2025 performance cycle. The Custom Industry Index includes exchange-traded banks and thrifts with Assets between 1.9B and 10B and headquarters in Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, excluding Puerto Rico. If any banks on the Custom Industry Index are de-registered or acquired as of the end of the performance period, they will be removed for the entire performance period and will not be replaced. The table below reflects how the performance measures will be applied to the PRSUs for the 2023-2025 performance cycle. For this purpose, Core ROA and Core ROE measures will be calculated using percentile rank of 3-year average Core ROA and Core ROE. Performance Measure Wt. Below Threshold Threshold Target Stretch 3-year average Core ROA - relative to Custom Industry Index 50 25 th percentile 50 th percentile 75 th percentile and above 3-year average Core ROE - relative to Custom Industry Index 50 25 th percentile 50 th percentile 75 th percentile and above Payout Grant Awarded) 0 50 100 150

 7 

 Awards. In the event that the Company determines that any federal, state, or local tax or withholding payment is required relating to the Incentive Awards, in addition to the Company s right to withhold any compensation paid to you by the Company, you may also satisfy the withholding obligations by (i) tendering a cash payment or (ii) delivering owned and unencumbered shares of Stock to the Company. Section 83(b) Election Under Section 83 of the Code, the difference between the purchase price paid for the shares of Restricted Stock and their Fair Market Value on the date any forfeiture restrictions applicable to such shares lapse will be reportable as ordinary income at that time. For this purpose, forfeiture restrictions include the forfeiture as to unvested Restricted Stock described herein. You may elect to be taxed at the time the shares of Restricted Stock are acquired, rather than when such shares cease to be subject to such forfeiture restrictions, by filing an election under Section 83(b) of the Code with the Internal Revenue Service within thirty (30) days after the Grant Date. You will have to make a tax payment to the extent the purchase price is less than the Fair Market Value of the shares on the Grant Date. No tax payment will have to be made to the extent the purchase price is at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the shares on the Grant Date.

Adjustments In the event of a stock split, stock dividend, extraordinary cash dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination or exchange of shares, or a similar change in the Stock, the number of shares covered by the Incentive Awards will be adjusted by the Committee (and rounded down to the nearest whole number) in accordance with the terms of the Plan. The Committee s determinations with respect to any such adjustments will be final, binding, and conclusive.

 Affiliate, any material Company or Affiliate policy or procedure, any other agreement, or any other obligation to the Company or any Affiliate, the Company has the right to cause an immediate forfeiture of your rights to the Incentive Awards (and any corresponding Dividend Equivalents), and the Incentive Awards shall immediately and automatically expire. In addition, if you have been issued shares of Stock in settlement of any portion of the Incentive Awards during the two (2)-year period prior to your actions, you will owe the Company a cash payment (or forfeiture of shares of Stock) in an amount determined as follows: (i) for any shares of Stock that you have sold prior to receiving notice from the Company, the amount will be the proceeds received from the sale(s), and (ii) for any shares of Stock that you still own, the amount will be the number of shares of Stock owned times the Fair Market Value of the shares of Stock on the date you receive notice from the Company (provided, that the Company may require you to satisfy your payment obligations hereunder either by forfeiting and returning to the Company the shares or any other shares of Stock or making a cash payment or a combination of these methods as determined by the Company in its sole discretion). Clawback The Incentive Awards are subject to mandatory repayment by you to the Company to the extent you are or in the future become subject to (i) any Company clawback or recoupment policy or (ii) any law, rule, or regulation that requires the repayment by you to the Company of compensation paid by the Company to you in the event that you fail to comply with, or violate, the terms or requirements of such policy or law, rule, or regulation. If the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company, as a result of misconduct, with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws and you knowingly engaged in the misconduct, were grossly negligent in engaging in the misconduct, knowingly failed to prevent the misconduct, or were grossly negligent in failing to prevent the misconduct, you will reimburse the Company the amount of any payment in settlement of the Incentive Awards earned or accrued during the twelve (12)-month period following the first public issuance or filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (whichever first occurred) of the financial document that contained such material noncompliance.

 Code Section 409A The Incentive Awards are intended to comply with Code Section 409A Section 409A ). To the extent required to avoid accelerated taxation and tax penalties under Section 409A, amounts that would otherwise be payable and benefits that would otherwise be provided during the six (6)-month period immediately following your separation from service (within the meaning of Section 409A) will instead be paid on the first payroll date after the six (6)-month anniversary of your separation from service (or death, if earlier). For purposes of the Incentive Awards, a termination of continuous Service only occurs upon an event that would be a Separation from Service within the meaning of Section 409A. Neither the Company, any Affiliate, the Board, nor the Committee will have any obligation to take any action to prevent the assessment of any excise tax or penalty on you under Section 409A, and neither the Company, any Affiliate, the Board, nor the Committee will have any liability to you or other person for such tax or penalty.

 BAR HARBOR BANKSHARES 2019 EQUITY PLAN RESTRICTED STOCK AND PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT EXHIBIT A VESTING OF PERFORMANCE UNITS The Performance Units are subject to the performance-based vesting requirements set forth below. Performance-Based Vesting Requirements : Vesting of the Performance Units are determined based on the achievement of two equally weighted performance factors, Relative Core Return on Assets Relative Core ROA and Relative Core Return on Equity Relative Core ROE (each as defined below). The Company must meet or exceed the applicable threshold performance goal listed below for any portion of the Performance Units to be earned, and the Participant must be continuously employed by the Company until the vesting date unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement. The applicable number of the Performance Units that will become vested will be determined by comparing the Company s Core ROA and Core ROE to an industry index comprised of 1.9B to 10B U.S. exchange-traded banks and thrifts, headquarters in Northeast and Mid-Atlantic excluding Puerto Rico for the Performance Period (January 1, 2022 December 31, 2024) as set forth in Appendix B (the Custom Industry Index ). If Custom Industry Index constituents are deregistered or acquired as of the end of the Performance Period and their GAAP financial data is not available for the entire Performance Period, they will be removed for the entire Performance Period and will not be replaced. The performance of each metric will be measured independently. Performance results falling between Threshold, Target, and Stretch will be interpolated. The number of Performance Units earned and vested for the performance period shall be equal to the product of (a) and (b), where (a) is equal to the Target Number of Performance Units subject to Award on the cover sheet and (b) is performance factor determined based on the table below. (Target # of Performance Units x 50 x Core ROA performance factor) + (Target # of Performance Units x 50 x Core ROE performance factor) = Total # of Performance Units Earned 

Performance Measure WWt. Below Threshold Threshold Target Stretch 3-year Average Core ROA Relative to Custom Index 50 th percentile 25 th percentile 50 th percentile 75 th percentile and above 3 year Average Core ROE Relative to Custom Index 50 th percentile 25 th percentile 50 th percentile 75 th percentile and above Performance Factor of Target) 0 50 100 150 
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or this Exhibit A , no Performance Units will vest if threshold performance for both Core ROA and Core ROE are not attained. 

Additionally, in no event may you earn more than the number of shares underlying the Maximum Award of Performance Units as set forth on the cover sheet of this Agreement. For purposes of this Appendix: Core Income shall mean net income after taxes and before extraordinary items, less net income attributable to non-controlling interest, gain on the sale of held to maturity and available for sale securities, amortization of intangibles, goodwill and nonrecurring items. Core ROA shall mean Core Income as a percent of average assets. Core ROE shall mean Core Income return on average equity, excluding non-controlling interests. Core ROA and Core ROE will be determined after making adjustments to exclude the following: (a) the effect of changes in tax laws, accounting principles, or other laws or provisions affecting reported results; (b) any reorganization and restructuring programs; and (c) acquisitions or divestitures and related expenses. Relative Core ROA and Relative Core ROE shall mean the percentile performance of the Company s based on the 3-year average Core ROA and 3-year average Core ROE of the Company relative to the 3-year average Core ROA and 3-year average Core ROE for the companies on the Custom Industry Index as determined by the Committee for the Performance Period. The percentile performance of the Company will be calculated using the PERCENTRANK function in MS Excel, and including the Company in the list. The results are rounded to the nearest whole percentile. The calculation can be replicated by arranging the 3-year average Core ROA and 3-year average Core ROE from the highest and the lowest for all companies on the Custom Industry Index and the Company. A percentile ranking is calculated for each data point, assuming the 100 th percentile for the highest data point, the 0 th percentile for the lowest data point, and the corresponding percentile for every data point with an equal difference in percentile ranking for each data point.
