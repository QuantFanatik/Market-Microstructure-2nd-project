 Item l. Business. 
 General 
 We are an internally managed real estate investment trust, also known as a REIT, that owns, operates, and to a lesser extent, holds interests in joint ventures that own and operate multi-family properties. At December 31, 2022, we (i) wholly-own 21 multi-family properties with an aggregate of 5,420 units and a carrying value of 649.7 million; (ii) have ownership interests, through unconsolidated entities, in eight multi-family properties with an aggregate of 2,781 units for which the carrying value of our net equity investment therein is 39.1 million; and (iii) own other assets, through consolidated and unconsolidated subsidiaries, with a carrying value of 5.4 million. The 29 multi-family properties are located in 11 states; most of these properties are located in the Southeast United States and Texas. 
 Our website can be accessed at www.brtapartments.com , where copies of our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, can be obtained free of charge. 
 
 2022 and Recent Developments. 
 
 During 2022: 
 Partner Buyouts 
 We purchased the interests of our joint venture partners in ventures that owned 11 multi-family properties for an aggregate purchase price of 105.9 million (the "2022 Partner Buyouts"). As a result, these properties are wholly-owned and the accounts (including the mortgage debt on these properties) and results of operations of these properties are included directly in our consolidated financial statements as of the applicable date of purchase. In 2022, (i) since the applicable Partner Buyout, these properties contributed in the aggregate 23.4 million in rental revenues, 10.2 million in operating expenses, 6.6 million in interest expense and 11.2 million in depreciation, and (ii) prior to the applicable Partner Buyout, contributed an aggregate of 1.2 million of equity in earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures. In 2023, we anticipate that these 11 properties will generate approximately 41.8 million in rental revenues, 18.0 million of real estate operating expense, 11.9 million in interest expense and 16.6 million in depreciation. These estimates for 2023 assume that rental income and real estate operating expense will remain at the same level in 2023 as in 2022 (although we anticipate that real estate operating expense will be higher in 2023 due to the master insurance program), and assumes an anticipated increases in 2023 from 2022 in interest expense due to a mortgage refinance that occured in May 2022 and depreciation as a result of the additional investments i.e., the purchase price paid for the remaining interest) made in such properties. Since August 2021, we completed the purchase of the remaining interests of our joint venture partners in 14 joint ventures including three partner buyouts completed in 2021 (the "2021 Partner Buyouts"; and together with the 2022 Partner Buyouts, the "Partner Buyouts"). 
 Sales 
 
 We recorded an aggregate gain of 64.5 million from the sale by unconsolidated subsidiaries, in four separate transactions, of four multi-family properties, and our share of the related aggregate loss on extinguishment of debt was 1.9 million. During 2022 and 2021 (through the applicable sales dates), these properties contributed a loss of 1.6 million (including our share of the early extinguishment of debt charge related to these sales) and income of 201,000 respectively, of equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated joint ventures. 
 
 Financing; Other 
 
 We: 
 
 entered into an amendment (the "Amendment") to our amended and restated credit facility (the "Facility") with VNB New York, LLC, an affiliate of Valley National Bank VNB ). Among other things, the Amendment (i) increased the amount we are permitted to borrow from 35 million to an aggregate of 60 million, subject to compliance with borrowing base requirements and other conditions, (ii) increased from 15 million to 25 million the amount that may be used for working capital (including dividend payments) and operating expenses, (iii) extended the term of the facility from November 2024 to September 2025, (iv) reduced the interest rate to the prime rate (subject to a floor of 3.5 by eliminating the 25 basis point spread over the prime rate, (v) increased the number and value of the unencumbered properties we are required to maintain from two properties with a value of at least 50 million to three properties with a value of at least 75 million and (vi) requires that we maintain a tangible net worth of a least 140 million.

 raised approximately 9.9 million of equity from the sale of 447,815 shares of our common stock pursuant to our at-the-market equity offering program. 
 implemented, effective with the dividend declared in June 2022, an 8.7 per share increase in our quarterly cash dividend from the immediately preceding dividend payment, and declared dividends of an aggregate of 0.98 per share. 
 implemented a dividend reinvestment plan which allows our stockholders to purchase our common stock at a discount (currently 3.0 to the trading price) and which reduced our cash outlay for dividends paid in 2022 by 1.3 million. 
 maintained an average occupancy rate of 95.9 across our portfolio of multi-family properties. 
 began participating in a master insurance program, which we refer to as the Insurance Program, which covers 17 wholly-owned properties comprising 4,316 units located in ten states. Generally, the coverage limit is 100 million 50 million for named hurricanes) per occurrence with a deductible of 100,000 for all other perils, and varying deductibles for, among other things, wind, flood, and earthquake damage. 
 used our available cash to pay-off 14.5 million of 4.29 mortgage debt of Avalon Apartments - Pensacola, FL, a wholly owned property. 
 used our credit facility in October 2022 to pay off 14.9 million of maturing mortgage debt at our Silvana Oaks-North Charleston, SC property. 
 In February 2023, we obtained mortgage debt of 21.2 million on our Silvana Oaks - North Charleston, SC multi-family property; such mortgage debt matures in March 2033, bears an interest rate of 4.45 and is interest only for the term of the mortgage. We used the proceeds of such mortgage debt to fully pay down our credit facility. 
 On March 13, 2023, the unconsolidated joint venture that owns Chatham Court and Reflections, a 494 unit multi-family property located in Dallas, TX, and in which we have a 50 interest, entered into a contract to sell such property. We estimate that our share of the gain from this sale will be approximately 14.3 million and that our share of the related early extinguishment of debt charge will be 167,000. In 2022, this property accounted for 753,000 of equity in earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures. We anticipate that the closing of this transaction, which is subject to customary closing conditions, will be completed in the quarter ending June 30,2023, although we can provide no assurance that this transaction will be completed. 
 In March 2023, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire a 238-unit multifamily property constructed in 2019 and located in Richmond, VA, for a purchase price of approximately 62.5 million. The purchase price includes the assumption of approximately 32 million of mortgage debt bearing an interest rate of 3.34 and maturing in 2061. The purchase is subject to the satisfaction of various conditions, including the completion, to BRT s satisfaction, of its due diligence investigation, as well as the approval by the mortgage lender of the Company s assumption of the mortgage debt. BRT anticipates that this transaction will be completed in the fourth quarter of 2023, although we can provide no assurance that this transaction will be completed.

 Our Multi-Family Properties 
 Generally, our multi-family properties are garden apartment, mid-rise or town home style properties that provide residents with amenities, such as a clubhouse, swimming pool, laundry facilities and cable television access. Residential leases are typically for a one-year term and may require security deposits equal to one month's rent. Substantially all of the units at these properties are leased at market rates. Set forth below is selected information regarding the multi-family properties in which we have an interest, as of December 31, 2022; the properties in which we have a less than 100 ownership interest are owned by unconsolidated joint ventures:

Our Acquisition Approach 
 Historically, we acquired multi-family properties with joint venture partners whom we believed had knowledge and experience in owning and operating multi-family properties in the target market. Although we will pursue the acquisition of multi-family properties with joint venture partners in appropriate situations, we are also working to acquire multi-family properties directly (i.e., without joint venture partners) - we anticipate that acquiring these properties directly will allow the possibility for greater returns on our investment and allow the accounts and operations of such properties to be presented directly in our consolidated financial statements. 
 We emphasize acquiring the following types of multi-family properties: 
 Class B or better properties with strong and stable cash flows in markets where we believe there exists opportunity for rental growth and further value creation; 
 Class B or better properties that offer significant potential for capital appreciation through repositioning or rehabilitating the asset to drive rental growth; and 
 properties available at opportunistic prices providing an opportunity for a significant appreciation in value. 
 9 

Table of Contents 

 We seek properties that provide stable risk adjusted total returns i.e., operating income plus capital appreciation), including value-add opportunities i.e. , properties that can be repositioned or improved allowing us to generate higher rents or improved occupancy) and emphasize acquiring properties in the Southeast United States and Texas. We have been opportunistic in pursuing multi-family property acquisitions and have not mandated any specific acquisition criteria, although we take the following, among other things, into account in evaluating an acquisition opportunity: location, demographics, size of the target market, property quality, availability and terms and conditions of long-term fixed-rate mortgage debt, potential for capital appreciation or recurring income, extent and nature of contemplated capital improvements and property age. 
 A key consideration in our acquisition process is the availability of mortgage debt to finance the acquisition (or the ability to assume the mortgage debt on the property) and the terms and conditions e.g ., interest rate, amortization and maturity) of such debt. Generally, approximately 35 to 50 of the purchase price has been paid in cash (all or a portion of our share of which may be funded by borrowing from our credit facility) and the balance is financed with mortgage debt. We believe that the use of leverage allows us the ability to earn a greater return on our investment than we would otherwise earn. Generally, the mortgage debt obtained in connection with an acquisition matures in five to ten years, is interest only for one to five years, and provides for a fixed interest rate and for the amortization of the principal of such debt over 30 years. 
 Potential acquisitions are reviewed and approved by our investment committee. Approval requires the assent of not less than five of the eight members of this committee, all of whom are our executive officers. Board of director approval is required for any single multi-family property acquisition in which our equity investment exceeds 40 million. 
 From time-to-time we have pursued development opportunities with joint venture partners when we believe the potential higher returns justify the additional risks. The factors considered in pursuing these opportunities generally include the factors considered in evaluating a standard acquisition opportunity, and we place additional emphasis on our joint venture partner's ability to execute a development project. In 2022, we acquired, for 3.5 million, a 17.45 interest in a planned 240-unit development property located in Johns Island, SC. We anticipate that this project, which is our only development project, will be completed in the first quarter of 2024. We do not anticipate development properties will constitute a significant part of our portfolio. 
 It is our policy, and the policy of our affiliated entities (as described below), that any investment opportunity presented to us or to any of our affiliated entities that involves the acquisition of a multi-family property with more than 100 units, will first be offered to us and may not be pursued by any of our affiliated entities unless we decline the opportunity. Our affiliated entities include Gould Investors L.P., a master limited partnership involved primarily in the ownership and operation of a diversified portfolio of real estate assets, One Liberty Properties, Inc.., a NYSE listed net lease commercial REIT, and Majestic Property Management Corp., a property management company, which is wholly owned by Fredric H. Gould, our vice chairman. Gould Investors has purchased multifamily properties in the Southeast United States.; all of such properties have less than 100 units. We have not been interested in any of the properties purchased by Gould Investors.

 (4) Includes a supplemental mortgage of 1,056 which was paid off immediately following the buyout. 
 
 Property and Joint Venture Dispositions 
 We monitor our portfolio to identify properties that should be sold. Factors considered in deciding whether to sell a property generally include our evaluation of the current market price of such property compared to its projected economics (including the age of the property and anticipated maintenance costs), changes in the factors considered by us in acquiring such property, the ability to reinvest net proceeds from a sale into a more favorable acquisition opportunity or other productive purpose e.g ., repayment of debt), our liquidity requirements and, with respect to properties that are owned by unconsolidated joint ventures, our partners' desires with respect thereto. If our partners deem it in their own economic interest to dispose of a property at an earlier date than we would otherwise dispose of a property, we may accommodate such request and agree to sell the property to a third party or attempt to purchase our partner's interest.

Joint Venture Arrangements 
 The arrangements with our multi-family property joint venture partners are deal-specific and vary from transaction-to- transaction. Generally, these arrangements provide for us and our joint venture partner to receive net cash flow available for distribution and/or profits in the following order of priority: (i) a preferred return o f 8 to 10 on each party's unreturned capital contributions, until such preferred return has been paid in full; and (ii) the return in full of each party's capital contribution (and together with the preferred return, the "Mandatory Return"). Thereafter, distributions to, and profit sharing between, joint venture partners, is determined pursuant to the applicable agreement governing the relationship between the parties. The allocation and distribution of cash and profits to BRT after the Mandatory Return is generally less than that implied by BRT's percentage equity interest in the venture/property as a result of allocation/distribution provisions of our joint venture operating agreements. 
 
 Although as noted above each joint venture operating agreement contains different terms, such agreements may limit our right to vote and receive dividends and distributions. Further, such agreements generally provide for a buy-sell procedure under specified circumstances, including, (i) if the partners are unable to agree on major decisions or (ii) upon a change in control of our subsidiary owning the interest in the joint venture. Further, these arrangements may also allow us, and in some cases, our joint venture partner, to force the sale of the property after it has been owned by the joint venture for a specified period e.g ., four to five years after the acquisition). 
 
 Property Management 
 The day-to-day management of our multi-family properties is overseen by property management companies operating in the market in which the property is located. (Five of our eight joint venture properties are managed by management companies that are owned by a joint venture partner or its affiliates.) The property management companies that manage our properties are paid fees ranging from 2 to 4 of revenues generated by the applicable property. Generally, we can terminate these management companies upon specified notice or for cause, subject to the approval of the mortgage lender and, in some cases, our joint venture partner. We believe satisfactory replacements for property managers are available, if required. 
 Mortgage Debt and Other Real Estate Financings 
 In acquiring properties, we use fixed rate mortgage debt to pay from 50 to 65 of the purchase price. Although fixed rate mortgage debt is typically more expensive and less flexible than variable rate mortgage debt e.g. , the interest rate is higher at origination and there are typically high prepayment penalties, yield maintenance payments and/or defeasance penalties when refinancing the debt prior to maturity), we prefer using such debt as it caps our exposure to fluctuating interest rates. We also from time to time obtain supplemental mortgage debt on an acquired property which, among other things, allows us to generate additional cash resulting from the appreciation of the value of the property. As of December 31, 2022, 17 of our 21 wholly owned properties are subject to fixed-rate mortgage debt, we have pledged our interests in three wholly-owned properties to our credit facility lender, each of our eight unconsolidated multi-family properties are subject to fixed-rate mortgage debt and our development project is subject to a variable-rate construction loan. As of December 31, 2022, the weighted average annual interest rate of the mortgage and construction debt on these multi-family properties is 3.99 and the weighted average remaining term to maturity of such debt is 7.2 years.

The following table sets forth scheduled principal (including amortization) mortgage payments due for all of our multi-family properties as of December 31, 2022 (dollars in thousands):

 (1) Does not give effect to mortgage fair value adjustments of 2.0 million. 
 (2) Does not give effect to the minority interest's share of such debt. 

The mortgage debt associated with our multi-family properties, including the mortgage debt at our significant subsidiaries generally contain covenants, including covenants that require, (i) the guarantor of the mortgage debt to maintain a certain level of net worth and liquid assets or (ii) in connection with the sale or other transfer of the property, the mortgage debt to be paid off (or assumed by the buyer with the consent of the mortgage lender). The mortgage debt is generally non-recourse to us and the entity that owns the property, subject to standard carve-outs. We, at the parent entity level i.e ., BRT Apartments Corp.), are the standard carve-out guarantor with respect to our wholly owned properties. (The term "standard carve-outs" refers to recourse items to an otherwise non-recourse mortgage and are customary to mortgage financing. While carve-outs vary from lender to lender and transaction to transaction, the carve-outs may include, among other things, a voluntary bankruptcy filing, environmental liabilities, the sale, financing or encumbrance of the property in violation of loan documents, damage to property as a result of intentional misconduct or gross negligence, failure to pay valid taxes and other claims which could create a lien on a property and the conversion of security deposits, insurance proceeds or condemnation awards). At December 31, 2022, the principal amount of mortgage debt outstanding with respect to the properties at which we are the carve-out guarantor is approximately 401.2 million. 
 Corporate Level Financing Arrangements 
 See " Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Corporate Level Financing Arrangements " for information about our corporate level financing arrangements. 
 Insurance 
 The multi-family properties are covered by all risk property insurance covering 100 of the replacement cost for each building and business interruption and rental loss insurance (covering up to twelve months of loss). On a case-by-case basis, based on an assessment of the likelihood of the risk, availability of insurance, cost of insurance and in accordance with standard market practice, we obtain earthquake, windstorm, flood, terrorism and boiler and machinery insurance. We carry comprehensive liability insurance and umbrella policies for each of our properties which generally provide no less than 10 million to 25 million of coverage per incident. We request certain extension of coverage, valuation clauses, and deductibles in accordance with standard market practice and availability. 
 Although we may carry insurance for potential losses associated with our multi-family properties, we may still incur losses due to uninsured risks, deductibles, co-payments or losses in excess of applicable insurance coverage and those losses may be material. In addition, insurance coverage at several properties is provided through blanket policies obtained by our joint venture partners or the property managers for such property. A consequence of obtaining insurance coverage in this manner is that losses on properties in which we have no ownership interest could reduce significantly or eliminate the coverage available on one or more properties in which we have an interest.

 Our Other Real Estate Assets and Activities 
 In addition to our multi-family properties, we own assets, and in particular, real estate assets, with an aggregate carrying value of 1.9 million at December 31, 2022. These assets include cooperative apartment units located in Lawrence and Washington Heights, NY, a leasehold position with two commercial tenants at a property in Yonkers, NY, and a nominal profit participation in an entity that owns several multi-family properties in Newark, NJ. None of these assets generate significant net income or revenue; the leasehold interest generated 1.3 million and 1.1 million of rental income and cash flow from operation in 2022 before giving effect to a non-controlling interest. See notes 2 and 3 to our consolidated financial statements. 
 Competition 
 We compete to acquire multi-family properties with pension and investment funds, real estate developers, private real estate investors and other owners and operators of such properties. Competition to acquire such properties, among other things, is based on price and the ability to secure financing on a timely basis to complete the acquisition. 
 We compete for tenants at our multi-family properties such competition depends upon various factors, including alternative housing options available in the applicable sub-market, rent, amenities provided and proximity to employment and quality of life venues. 
 Many of our competitors possess greater financial and other resources than we possess. To the extent that a potential joint venture partner introduces us to a multi-family acquisition opportunity, we compete with other sources of equity capital to 
 participate in such joint venture based on the financial returns we are willing to offer such potential partner and the other terms and conditions of the joint venture arrangement. 
 Government Regulation 
 Multifamily properties are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas, such as swimming pools, activity centers, and recreational facilities. We believe that each of our properties has the necessary permits and approvals to operate its business. 
 Americans with Disabilities Act 
 Our properties must comply with applicable provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which we refer to as the "ADA". Among other things, the ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. We believe that our properties are in substantial compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to make substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA. However, noncompliance with the ADA could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. Our obligations under the ADA are ongoing and we will continue to assess our properties and make alterations as appropriate. 
 Fair Housing Act 
 The Fair Housing Act, which we refer to as the "FHA", its state law counterparts and the regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and various state agencies, prohibit discrimination in housing on the basis of race or color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status or handicap (disability) and, in some jurisdictions, financial capability or other bases. Our failure to comply with these laws could result in litigation, fines, penalties or other adverse claims, or could result in limitations or restrictions on our ability to operate, any of which could materially and adversely affect us. We believe that we operate our properties in substantial compliance with the FHA. 
 Environmental Matters 
 We are subject to regulation at the federal, state and municipal levels and are exposed to potential liability should our properties or actions result in damage to the environment or to other persons or properties. These conditions include the presence or growth of mold, potential leakage of underground storage tanks, breakage or leaks from sewer lines and risks pertaining to waste handling. The potential costs of compliance, property damage restoration and other costs for which we could be liable or which could occur without regard to our fault or knowledge, are unknown and could potentially be material. There are no material claims made or pending against us with regard to environmental damage, nor are we aware of any potential environmental hazards related to any of our properties which could reasonably be expected to result in a material loss.

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Set forth below is a discussion of certain risks affecting our business. The categorization of risks set forth below is meant to help you better understand the risks facing our business and is not intended to limit your consideration of the possible effects of these risks to the listed categories.Any adverse effects arising from the realization of any of the risks discussed, including our financial condition and results of operation, may, and likely will, adversely affect many aspects of our business. 
 
 Risks Related to Real Estate Investments and Our Operations 
 Unfavorable market and economic conditions could adversely affect rental revenues, occupancy levels and the value of our properties. 
 General economic conditions in the U.S. have fluctuated significantly in recent quarters with the U.S. experiencing negative macroeconomic conditions such as increasing inflationary and labor market concerns. Unfavorable market and economic conditions may significantly affect our occupancy levels, our rental rates and collections, the value of our properties and our ability to acquire or dispose of multifamily properties on economically favorable terms. Our ability to lease our multifamily properties at favorable rates is adversely affected by the increase in supply in the multifamily and other rental markets and is dependent upon the overall level in the economy, which may continue to be adversely affected by, among other things, inflationary conditions, job losses and unemployment levels, personal debt levels, a downturn in the housing market, stock market volatility, and uncertainty about the future. Some of our major expenses generally do not decline when related rents decline. We would expect that declines in our occupancy levels, rental revenues and/or the values of our multi-family properties would cause us to have less cash available to make payments on our debt and to pay dividends, which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market value of our securities. 
 Increasing real estate taxes, utilities and insurance premiums may negatively impact operating results 
 The cost of real estate taxes, utilities and insurance is a significant component of real estate operating expense. These expenses are subject to significant increases and fluctuations, including the impact of inflation, which we may be unable to control. For example, our real estate taxes have increased and will continue to increase as our properties are reassessed by taxing authorities and as property tax rates increase. Further, our real estate taxes have fluctuated and may not be comparable year-over-year because of, among other things, (i) the timing difference as to when we accrue real estate taxes and the results of any tax appeals with respect to such accrued taxes and (ii) determinations, over which we have no control, by governmental authorities to increase tax rates, assessments or procedures. In 2022, we implemented a new insurance program for 17 of our wholly owned properties and we anticipate that our insurance costs will increase because of such program, the casualty losses that we have sustained the past several years and general increases in the cost of insurance coverage for multi-family properties. In addition, our share of the insurance premiums at joint venture properties is determined by our joint venture partner at such properties. If the costs associated with real estate taxes, utilities and insurance premiums should rise, without being offset by a corresponding increase in revenues, our results of operations could be negatively impacted, and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions could be adversely affected.

 Most of our multi-family properties are located in the Southeast and Texas which makes us susceptible to adverse developments in such markets. 
 The operating performance and value of our multi-family properties is impacted by the economic environment and other conditions of the specific markets in which our properties are concentrated. As of December 31, 2022: (i) our wholly-owned properties generated approximately 72 and 11 of our 2022 revenues from properties located in the Southeast and Texas, respectively, and (ii) the properties owned by unconsolidated joint ventures at December 31, 2022, generated 58 and 42 of our 2022 JV Rental and Other Revenues at properties located in Texas and the Southeast, respectively. Accordingly, adverse developments in such markets, including economic developments, pandemics, or natural or man-made disasters, could adversely impact the cash flow and value of these properties. The concentration of our properties in the Southeast United States and Texas exposes us to risks of adverse developments which are greater than the risks of owning properties with a more geographically diverse portfolio. 
 We may be unable to compete to acquire, finance or dispose of our properties or to lease rental units. 
 We compete with many third parties including other REITs, specialty finance companies, public and private investors, investment and pension funds, in acquiring, obtaining financing for, and disposing of multi-family properties. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. Larger and more established competitors enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, enhanced operating efficiencies and more extensive networks providing greater and more favorable access to capital, financing and tax credit allocations and more favorable acquisition opportunities. 
 In attracting and retaining residents to occupy our multi-family properties, we compete with numerous other housing providers. Our multi-family properties compete directly with other rental apartments, as well as condominiums and single-family homes that are available for rent or purchase in the markets in which our properties are located. Principal factors of competition include rent or price charged, attractiveness of the location of multi-family properties, and the quality and breadth of services. The number of competitive properties relative to demand in a particular area has a material effect on our ability to lease our properties and on the rents we charge. 
 The failure of property management companies to properly manage our properties could adversely impact our results of operations. 
 We rely on property management companies to manage our properties. These management companies are responsible for, among other things, leasing and marketing rental units, selecting tenants (including an evaluation of the creditworthiness of tenants), collecting rent, paying operating expenses and maintaining our properties . If these property management companies do not perform their duties properly, or, in the case of unconsolidated properties, we and/or our joint venture partners do not effectively supervise the activities of these managers, the occupancy rates and rental rates at the properties managed by such property managers may decline and the expenses at such properties may increase. At December 31, 2022, one property manager manages eight of our properties, a second property manager manages seven of our properties, and our six other property managers manage five or fewer properties. Five of these properties are managed by a management company owned by or affiliated with a joint venture partner. The loss of our property managers, and in particular, the managers that manage multiple properties, could result in a decrease in occupancy rates, rental rates or both or an increase in expenses. Further, except for our multi-family properties covered by our Insurance Program, property managers are also generally responsible for obtaining insurance coverage with respect to the properties they manage, which coverage is often obtained pursuant to blanket policies covering many properties in which we have no interest. Losses at properties managed by our property managers but in which we have no interest could reduce significantly the insurance coverage available at our properties managed by these property managers. It may be difficult to terminate a non-performing management company, particularly a management company owned or affiliated with a joint venture, because such termination may require the approval of the mortgagee, our joint venture partner or both. If we are unable to terminate an underperforming property manager on a timely basis, our occupancy and rental rates may decrease and our expenses may increase. 
 Our efforts to buy properties directly may involve greater risks than buying properties with joint venture partners. 
 Although historically we have acquired properties with joint venture partners with knowledge of the local markets in which we were acquiring properties, we are working to buy properties directly without joint venture partners. In buying properties directly, we will not have the benefit of a partner s understanding of the target markets nor the equity they would have contributed to the acquisition. We cannot provide any assurance that we will properly evaluate the acquisition opportunities we pursue in buying properties directly.

 Risks involved in conducting real estate activity through joint ventures. 
 Eight of our multi-family properties are owned through joint ventures with other persons or entities. Joint venture investments involve risks not otherwise present when acquiring real estate directly, including the following: 
 our joint venture partners may have economic or business interests or objectives which are or become inconsistent with our business interests or objectives, including differing objectives relating to the sale or refinancing of properties held by the joint venture or the timing of the termination or liquidation of the joint venture; 
 the more successful a joint venture project, the more likely that profits or distributions generated above a negotiated threshold will be allocated disproportionately in favor of our joint venture partner at a rate greater than that implied by our partner's equity interest in the venture; 
 several of our joint venture partners have other competing real estate interests in the markets in which our properties are located that could influence such partners to take actions favoring their properties to the detriment of the jointly owned properties; 
 our joint venture partners obtain blanket property casualty and business interruption insurance insuring properties we own jointly and other properties in which we have no ownership interest and as a result, claims or losses with respect to properties owned by our joint venture partners but in which we have no interest could significantly reduce or eliminate the insurance available to properties in which we have an interest; 
 our joint venture partner might become bankrupt, insolvent or otherwise refuse or be unable to meet their obligations to us or the venture (including their obligation to make capital contributions or property distributions when due); 
 we may incur liabilities as a result of action taken by our joint venture partner; 
 our joint venture partner may not perform its property oversight responsibilities; 
 our joint venture partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests, including actions that may make it more difficult to maintain our qualification as a REIT; 
 our joint venture partner might engage in unlawful or fraudulent conduct with respect to our jointly owned properties or other properties in which they have an ownership interest; 
 changes in personnel managing our joint venture partners have resulted in greater difficulty in working with the new personnel; 
 our joint venture partner may trigger a buy-sell arrangement, which could cause us to sell our interest, or acquire our partner's interest, at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction; 
 disputes between us and our joint venture partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and divert management's attention from operating our business; and 
 disagreements with our joint venture partners with respect to property management (including with respect to whether a property should be sold, refinanced, or improved) could result in an impasse resulting in the inability to operate the property effectively. 
 Joint venture partners have acted without our authorization e.g ., a partner modified a mortgage term without our consent). We also have had, and expect to continue to have, disagreements with joint venture partners over various issues including, among others, as to whether, and the extent to which, value add programs should be implemented at a property, whether a mortgage debt on a property should be refinanced and the terms and conditions of such refinancing, and, because our joint venture structure may incentivize our joint venture partner to sell the property sooner than we would otherwise desire, the timing and terms and conditions of property sales. 
 Our operating results are significantly influenced by demand for multi-family properties generally, and a decrease in such demand will likely have a greater adverse effect on our revenues than if we owned a more diversified real estate portfolio. 
 Our current portfolio is focused on multi-family properties, and we expect that going forward we will continue to focus on the acquisition, disposition and operation of such properties. As a result, we are subject to risks inherent in investments in a single industry, and a decrease in the demand for multi-family properties would likely have a greater adverse effect on our rental revenues than if we owned a more diversified real estate portfolio.

 Our operating results and assets may be negatively affected if our insurance coverage is insufficient to compensate us for casualty events occurring at our properties. 
 Our multi-family properties, including the properties owned by the joint ventures in which we are members, carry all risk property insurance covering the property and improvements thereto for the cost of replacement in the event of a casualty. Though we maintain insurance coverage, such coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for losses sustained as a result of a casualty because, among other things: 
 the amount of insurance coverage maintained for any property may be insufficient to pay the full replacement cost following a casualty event; 
 the rent loss coverage under a policy may not extend for the full period of time that a tenant or tenants may be entitled to a rent abatement that is a result of, or that may be required to complete restoration following, a casualty event; 
 certain types of losses, such as those arising from earthquakes, floods, hurricanes and terrorist attacks, and losses arising out of claims for exemplary or punitive damages, may be uninsurable or may not be economically feasible to insure; 
 changes in zoning, building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors may make it impossible or impracticable, to use insurance proceeds to replace damaged or destroyed improvements at a property; 
 insurance coverage is part of blanket insurance policies in which losses on properties in which we have no ownership interest could reduce significantly or eliminate the coverage available on our properties; and 
 the deductibles applicable to one or more buildings at a property may be greater than the losses sustained at such buildings. 
 If our insurance coverage is insufficient to cover losses sustained as a result of one or more casualty events, our operating results and the value of our portfolio will be adversely affected. 
 We may be adversely effected if we are unable to maintain a satisfactory working relationship with any one or more of our joint venture partners. 
 Two of our joint venture partners or their affiliates own an aggregate of six of the eight properties we own through unconsolidated joint ventures. This concentration of ownership of properties with a limited number of joint venture partners exposes us to risks of adverse developments, and in particular, disputes or disagreements with such joint venture partners, which are greater than the risks of owning properties with a more diverse group of joint venture partners. 
 
 Our value-add activities involve greater risks than more conservative investment approaches. 
 
 From time-to-time, we seek to acquire properties at which we believe our investment of additional capital to enhance such properties will result in increased rental rates and higher resale value. These efforts involve greater risks than more conservative investment approaches. The risks related to these value-add activities include risks related to delays in the repositioning or improvement process, higher than expected capital improvement costs, the additional capital needed to execute our value-add program, the possibility that these value-add activities may not result in the anticipated higher rents and occupancy rates and the loss of revenue while these properties or units are undergoing capital improvements. We may also be unable to complete the improvements of these properties and may be forced to hold or sell these properties at a loss. For these and other reasons, we cannot assure you that we will realize growth in the value of our value-add multifamily properties, and as a result, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected. 
 
 Short-term leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents and we may be unable to renew leases or relet units as leases expire. 
 
 Our multi-family leases are generally for a term of one year or less. The short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce our risk to adverse effects of inflation as our leases allow for adjustments in the rental rate at the time of renewal, which may enable us to seek rent increases. However, since our leases typically permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty, our revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms. If we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the units, or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates, then our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected .

 Risks Related to Our Financing Activities, Indebtedness and Capital Resources 
 
 If we are unable to refinance 118.4 million in balloon payments on mortgage debt maturing through 2026, we may be forced to sell properties on disadvantageous terms. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we have balloon payments of 118.4 million on mortgage debt (including 33.5 million of mortgage debt on properties owned by unconsolidated joint ventures) due in 2025 and 2026 i.e., 15.4 million and 103.1 million due in 2025 and 2026, respectively). The weighted average interest rate of this debt is 4.30 . Our operating cash flow and funds available under our credit facility will likely be insufficient to discharge all of this debt when due. Accordingly, we may seek to refinance this debt or sell the related property prior to the maturity of such debt. Increases in interest rates, or reduced access to credit markets due, among other things, to more stringent lending requirements or our high level of leverage, may make it difficult for us to refinance this mortgage debt on terms as favorable as the current debt. If we are unsuccessful in refinancing such debt, or if the terms of the refinanced debt are less favorable than the current debt, we may be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms or convey properties secured by such mortgages to the mortgagees, which would reduce our income and impair the value of our portfolio. 
 
 Our failure to comply with our obligations under our debt instruments may reduce our stockholders equity, and adversely affect our net income and ability to pay dividends. 
 
 Several of our debt instruments include covenants that require us to maintain certain financial ratios, including various coverage ratios, and comply with other requirements. Failure to meet interest and other payment obligations under our debt instruments or a breach by us of the covenants to comply with certain financial ratios would place us in non-compliance under such instruments. If the lender called a default and required us to repay the full amount outstanding under such instrument, we might be required to rapidly dispose of our properties, including properties securing such debt instruments, which could have an adverse impact on the amounts we receive on such disposition. From time to time we have failed to comply with certain debt covenants. If we are unable to satisfy the covenants of our debt obligations, the lender could exercise remedies available to it under the applicable debt instrument and as otherwise provided by law, including the possible appointment of a receiver to manage the property, application of deposits or reserves maintained under the debt instrument for payment of the debt, or foreclose and/or cause the forced sale of the property or asset securing such debt. A foreclosure or other forced disposition of our assets could result in the disposition of same at below the carrying value of such asset. The disposition of our properties or assets at below our carrying value may adversely affect our net income, reduce our stockholders equity and adversely affect our ability to pay dividends. 
 
 We may not have sufficient funds to make required or desired capital improvements. 
 Our multi-family properties face competition from newer and updated properties. At December 31, 2022 the weighted average age (based on the number of units) of our multi-family properties is approximately 20 years. To remain competitive and increase occupancy at these properties and/or make them attractive to potential tenants or purchasers, we may have to make significant capital improvements and/or incur deferred maintenance costs with respect to these properties. The cost of future improvements and deferred maintenance is uncertain and the amounts earmarked for specific properties may be insufficient to effectuate needed improvements. Our results of operations and financial conditions may be adversely affected if we are required to expend significant funds (other than funds earmarked for such purposes) to repair or improve our properties. 
 Our acquisition, development and value-add activities are limited by the funds available to us. 
 Our ability to acquire additional multi-family properties, develop new properties and improve the properties in our portfolio is limited by the funds available to us (including funds available pursuant to our credit facility) and our ability to obtain, on acceptable terms, mortgage debt. At March 1, 2023, we had approximately 20.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and up to 60.0 million available to us under our credit facility. Our multi-family acquisition and value-add activities are constrained by funds available to us which will limit growth in our revenues and operating results. 
 If we are required to make payments under any bad boy carve out guarantees that we have provided in connection with certain mortgages and related loans, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected. 
 In obtaining certain non-recourse loans, we have provided our lenders with standard carve out guarantees. These guarantees are only applicable if and when the borrower directly, or indirectly through an agreement with an affiliate, joint venture partner or other third party, voluntarily files a bankruptcy or similar liquidation or reorganization action or takes other actions that are fraudulent or improper (commonly referred to as bad boy guarantees). Although we believe that bad boy carve out guarantees are not guarantees of payment in the event of foreclosure or other actions of the foreclosing lender that are beyond the borrower s control, some lenders in the real estate industry have recently sought to make claims for payment under 
 20 

Table of Contents 

 such guarantees. In the event such a claim were made against us under a bad boy carve out guarantee, following foreclosure on mortgages or related loans, and such claim were successful, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected. 
 We could be negatively impacted by changes in our relationship with Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, changes in the condition of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac and by changes in government support for multi-family housing. 
 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been a major source of financing for multi-family real estate in the United States and we have used loan programs sponsored by these agencies to finance most of our acquisitions of multi-family properties. There have been ongoing discussion by the government and other interested parties with regard to the long term structure and viability of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which could result in adjustments to guidelines for their loan products. Should these agencies have their mandates changed or reduced, lose key personnel, be disbanded or reorganized by the government or otherwise discontinue providing liquidity for the multi-family sector, our ability to obtain financing through loan programs sponsored by the agencies could be negatively impacted. In addition, changes in our relationships with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the lenders that participate in these loan programs, with respect to our existing mortgage financing could impact our ability to obtain comparable financing for new acquisitions or refinancing for our existing multi-family real estate investments. Should our access to financing provided through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loan programs be reduced or impaired, it would significantly reduce our access to debt capital and/or increase borrowing costs and could significantly limit our ability to acquire properties on acceptable terms and reduce the values to be realized upon property sales. 
 
 The phasing out of LIBOR may adversely affect our cash flow and financial results. 
 
 At December 31, 2022 we had 37.4 million junior subordinated notes maturing in 2036; these notes bear interest based on three-month LIBOR plus 200 basis points. The authority regulating LIBOR announced that after June 2023 it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR. Although these junior subordinated notes provide for alternative methods of calculating the interest rate when LIBOR becomes unavailable, such alternative rates may be unavailable in which case we may have to negotiate a secondary alternative rate with the counterparties to such debt we can provide no assurance that we and our counterparties will be able to agree to a secondary alternative rate. Our cash flow and financial results may be adversely affected if we are unable to arrange a mutually satisfactory alternative rate to LIBOR for our junior subordinated notes. 
 
 We depend on our subsidiaries for cash flow and will be adversely impacted if these subsidiaries are prohibited from distributing cash to us. 
 
 We conduct, and intend to conduct, substantially all of our business operations through our subsidiaries including our unconsolidated subsidiaries. Accordingly, our only source of cash to fund our operations and pay our obligations are distributions from our subsidiaries. We cannot assure you that our subsidiaries will be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions to us that will enable us to fund our operations. Each of our subsidiaries is or will be a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions( e.g. , restrictions imposed pursuant to mortgage debt on a property), limit our ability to obtain cash from such entities. In addition, because we operate through our subsidiaries, your claims as stockholders will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations of our subsidiaries. Therefore, in the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization, our assets and those of our subsidiaries will be able to satisfy your claims as stockholders only after all our and our subsidiaries' liabilities and obligations have been paid in full. 
 Regulatory and Tax Risks 
 Changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results. 
 
 At any time, the U.S. federal income tax laws governing REITs or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended. We cannot predict when or if any new U.S. federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation, or any amendment to any existing U.S. federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation, will be adopted, promulgated or become effective and any such law, regulation, or interpretation may take effect retroactively. We and our stockholders could be adversely affected by any such change in the U.S. federal income tax laws, regulations or administrative interpretations. 
 Liabilities relating to environmental matters may impact the value of our properties. 
 We may be subject to environmental liabilities arising from the ownership of properties. Under various federal, state and local laws, an owner or operator of real property may become liable for the costs of removal of certain hazardous substances 
 21 

Table of Contents 

 released on its property. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances. 
 The presence of hazardous substances on our properties may adversely affect our ability to finance or sell the property and we may incur substantial remediation costs. The discovery of material environmental liabilities attached to such properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Compliance or failure to comply with the ADA or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs. 
 
 The ADA generally requires that public buildings, including the public areas at our properties, be made accessible to disabled persons. Non-compliance could result in the imposition of fines by governmental authorities or the award of damages to private litigants. From time-to-time claims may be asserted against us with respect to some of our properties under the ADA. If, under the ADA, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. We do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations. 
 
 Risks Associated with the Real Estate Industry and REITs. 
 
 We face numerous risks associated with the real estate industry that could adversely affect our results of operations through decreased revenues or increased costs. 
 
 As a real estate company, we are subject to various changes in real estate conditions, and any negative trends in such real estate conditions may adversely affect our results of operations through decreased revenues or increased costs. These conditions include: 
 changes in national, regional and local economic conditions, which may be negatively impacted by concerns about inflation, deflation, government deficits, unemployment rates and decreased consumer confidence particularly in markets in which we have a high concentration of properties; 
 increases in interest rates, which could adversely affect our ability to obtain financing or to buy or sell properties on favorable terms or at all; 
 the inability of tenants to pay rent; 
 the existence and quality of the competition, such as the attractiveness of our properties as compared to our competitors' properties based on considerations such as convenience of location, rental rates, amenities and safety record; 
 increased operating costs, including increased real property taxes, maintenance, insurance and utility costs (including increased prices for fossil fuels); 
 weather conditions that may increase or decrease energy costs and other weather-related expenses; 
 oversupply of apartments or single-family housing or a reduction in demand for real estate in the markets in which our properties are located; 
 a favorable interest rate environment that may result in a significant number of residents or potential residents of our multi-family properties deciding to purchase homes instead of renting; 
 changes in, or increased costs of compliance with, laws and/or governmental regulations, including those governing usage, zoning, the environment and taxes; and 
 rent control or stabilization laws, or other laws regulating rental housing, which could prevent us from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs. 
 
 Moreover, other factors may adversely affect our results of operations, including potential liability under environmental and other laws and other unforeseen events, many of which are discussed elsewhere in the following risk factors. Any or all of these factors could materially adversely affect our results of operations through decreased revenues or increased costs.

 Compliance with REIT requirements may hinder our ability to maximize profits. 
 We must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, our sources of income, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our common stock, to qualify as a REIT for Federal income tax purposes. We may also be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution. Accordingly, compliance with REIT requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits. 
 To qualify as a REIT, we must also ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least 75 of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities and qualified REIT real estate assets. The remainder of our investment in securities cannot include more than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10 of the total value of the outstanding securities of such issuer. In addition, no more than 5 of the value of our assets can consist of the securities of any one issuer, other than a qualified REIT security. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we must dispose of the portion of our assets in excess of such amounts within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter in order to avoid losing our REIT status and suffering adverse tax consequences. This requirement could cause us to dispose of assets for consideration of less than their true value and could lead to a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Because real estate investments are illiquid, we may not be able to reconfigure our portfolio on a timely basis. 
 Real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly. We may not be able to reconfigure our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions. Further, even if we are able to sell properties, we may be unable to reinvest the proceeds of such sales in opportunities that are as favorable as the properties sold. Our inability to reconfigure our portfolio to profitably reinvest the proceeds of property sales promptly could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 We may incur impairment charges in 2023. 
 We evaluate on a quarterly basis our real estate portfolio for indicators of impairment. Impairment charges reflect management's judgment of the probability and severity of the decline in the value of real estate assets we own. These charges and provisions may be required in the future as a result of factors beyond our control, including, among other things, changes in the economic environment and market conditions affecting the value of real property assets or natural or man-made disasters. In 2021, we incurred a 520,000 impairment charge related to our investment in the joint venture that owned the OPOP Properties. If we are required to take additional impairment charges, our results of operations will be adversely impacted. 
 If we do not continue to pay cash dividends, the price of our common stock may decline . 
 REIT's are generally required to distribute annually at least 90 of their ordinary taxable income to maintain our REIT status under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, which we refer to as the Code. Because we continue to generate operating losses primarily due to the impact of depreciation, we are not currently required, and may not be required in the future, to pay dividends to maintain our REIT status. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will pay dividends in the future. If we do not continue to pay cash dividends, the price of our common stock may decline. 
 Our business and operations are subject to physical and transition risks related to climate change. 
 
 Several of our multi-family properties are located along or near coastal areas that have historically been subject to the risk of extreme weather events. To the extent climate change causes changes in weather patterns, areas where many of our properties are located could experience more frequent and intense extreme weather events and rising sea levels, which may cause significant damage to our properties, disrupt our operations and adversely impact our residents. Over time, such conditions could result in reduced demand for housing in areas where our properties are located and increased costs related to further developing our properties to mitigate the effects of climate change or repairing damage related to the effects of climate change that may or may not be fully covered by insurance. Likewise, such conditions also may negatively impact the types and pricing of insurance we are able to procure. 
 
 Changes in federal, state and local laws and regulations on climate change could result in increased operating costs and/or capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing properties without a corresponding increase in rental revenues. The imposition of such requirements could increase the costs of maintaining or improving our existing properties (for example by requiring retrofits of existing multi-family properties to improve their energy efficiency and/or resistance to inclement weather) without creating corresponding increases in rental revenues, which would have an adverse impact on our operating results.

 Risks Related to BRT's Organization, Structure and Ownership of its Stock 
 Our transactions with affiliated entities involve conflicts of interest ; certain of our affiliated entities have purchased multi-family properties in the Southeast United States . 
 
 Entities affiliated with us and with certain of our executive officers provide services to us and on our behalf. Among other things, we retain certain executive officers and others to provide the Services. The aggregate fees to be paid for the Services in 2023, and paid in 2022 and 2021, are 1.54 million, 1.47 million and 1.40 million, respectively. We obtain certain executive, administrative, legal, accounting and clerical personnel and the use of certain facilities pursuant to the shared services agreement. During 2022 and 2021, we reimbursed Gould Investors 739,000 and 641,000, respectively, for the personnel and facilities provided pursuant to the shared services agreement. We also obtain certain insurance in conjunction with Gould Investors and reimbursed Gould Investors 67,000 and 61,000, in 2022 and 2021, respectively, for our share of the insurance cost. These transactions may not be on terms as favorable as those that we would receive if the transactions were entered into with unaffiliated entities and persons. 
 
 Gould Investors from time-to time buys multi-family properties, including properties located in the Southeast United States. Such properties are generally much smaller than the properties in which we are interested. See "Item 1 - Business - Our Acquisition Approach" 
 
 Senior management and other key personnel are critical to our business and our future success may depend on our ability to retain them. 
 We depend on the services of Jeffrey A. Gould, our president and chief executive officer, and other members of senior management to carry out our business and investment strategies. Although Jeffrey A. Gould devotes substantially all of his business time to our affairs, he devotes a portion of his business time to entities affiliated with us. In addition to Jeffrey A. Gould, only three other executive officers, Mitchell Gould, our executive vice president, Ryan Baltimore, chief operating officer, and George Zweier, vice president and chief financial officer, devote all or substantially all of their business time to us. Many of our executives (i) also provide the Services (see " Item 1. Business-Human Capital Resources ") and (ii) provide their services on a part-time basis pursuant to the shared services agreement. We rely on part-time executive officers to provide certain services to us, including legal and certain accounting services, since we do not employ full-time executive officers to handle all of these services. If the shared services agreement is terminated or the executives performing Services are unwilling to continue to do so, we will have to obtain such services from other sources or hire employees to perform them. We may not be able to replace these services or hire such employees in a timely manner or on terms, including cost and level of expertise, that are equivalent to or better than those we receive pursuant to the Services and the shared services agreement. 
 In addition, in the future we may need to attract and retain qualified senior management and other key personnel, both on a full-time and part-time basis. The loss of the services of any of our senior management or other key personnel or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could impair our ability to carry out our business and our investment strategies. 
 We do not carry key man life insurance on members of our senior management. 
 Certain provisions of our Articles of Incorporation, our Bylaws and Maryland law may inhibit a change in control that stockholders consider favorable and could also limit the market price of our common stock 
 
 Certain provisions of our Articles of Incorporation (the "Charter"), our Bylaws and Maryland law may impede, or prevent, a third party from acquiring control of us without the approval of our board of directors. These provisions: 
 provide for a staggered board of directors consisting of three classes, with one class of directors being elected each year and each class being elected for three-year terms and until their successors are duly elected and qualify; 
 impose restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock (such provisions being intended to, among other purposes, facilitate our compliance with certain requirements under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), relating to our qualification as a REIT under the Code); 
 prevent our stockholders from amending the Bylaws; 
 limit who may call special meetings of stockholders; 
 24 

Table of Contents 

 establish advance notice and informational requirements and time limitations on any director nomination or proposal that a stockholder wishes to make at a meeting of stockholders; 
 provide that directors may be removed only for cause and only by the vote of at least two-thirds of all votes generally entitled to be cast in the election of directors; 
 do not permit cumulative voting in the election of our board of directors, which would otherwise permit holders of less than a majority of outstanding shares to elect one or more directors; and 
 authorize our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to amend the Charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of our stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we have authority to issue and classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common or preferred stock and set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares. 
 Certain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law (the MGCL may impede a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or inhibit a change of control under circumstances that otherwise could be in the best interest of holders of shares of our common stock, including: 
 business combination provisions that, subject to certain exceptions and limitations, prohibit certain business combinations between us and an interested stockholder (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10 or more of the voting power of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate or associate of BRT who, at any time within the two-year period immediately prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10 or more of the voting power of our then outstanding voting stock) or an affiliate thereof for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, and thereafter impose two super-majority stockholder voting requirements on these combinations; 
 control share provisions that provide that, subject to certain exceptions, holders of control shares of BRT (defined as voting shares which, when aggregated with other shares controlled by the stockholder, entitle the holder to exercise voting power in the election of directors within one of three increasing ranges) acquired in a control share acquisition (defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of issued and outstanding control shares, subject to certain exceptions) have no voting rights with respect to the control shares except to the extent approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding all interested shares; and 
 additionally, Title 3, Subtitle 8 of the MGCL permits our board of directors, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in the Charter or the Bylaws, to implement certain corporate governance provisions. 
 We have (1) exempted all business combinations between us and any other person, provided that each such business combination is first approved by our board of directors (including a majority of directors who are not affiliates or associates of such other person), from the Maryland Business Combination Act and (2) opted out of the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act. 
 
 Ownership of less than 6.0 of our outstanding shares or less than 6.0 of the aggregate outstanding shares of all classes and series of our stock could violate the restrictions on ownership and transfer in our Charter, which would result in the transfer of the shares owned or acquired in violation of such restrictions to a trust for the benefit of a charitable beneficiary and loss of the right to receive dividends and other distributions on, and the economic benefit of any appreciation of, such shares, and you may not have sufficient information to determine at any particular time whether an acquisition of our shares will result in the loss of the economic benefit of such shares. 
 
 In order for us to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Code, no more than 50 of the value of the outstanding shares of our stock may be owned, directly or indirectly or through application of certain attribution rules, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code) at any time during the last half of a taxable year. To facilitate our qualification as a REIT under the Code, among other purposes, the Charter generally prohibits any person from actually or constructively owning more than 6.0 , in value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of our outstanding shares of common stock, or more 
 25 

Table of Contents 

 than 6.0 in value of the aggregate outstanding shares of all classes and series of our stock, which we refer to as the ownership limits, unless our board of directors exempts the person from such ownership limit. In addition, the Charter prohibits any person from beneficially or constructively owning shares of our stock that would result in more than 50 of the value of the outstanding shares of our stock to be beneficially owned by five or fewer individuals, regardless of whether such ownership is during the last half of any taxable year, which we refer to as the Five or Fewer Limit. Shares owned or acquired in violation of either of these restrictions will be transferred automatically to a trust for the benefit of a charitable beneficiary selected by us. The person that owned or acquired our stock in violation of the restrictions in the Charter will not be entitled to any dividends or distributions paid after the date of the transfer to the trust and, upon a sale of such shares by the trust, will generally be entitled to receive only the lesser of the market value on the date of the event that resulted in the transfer to the trust or the net proceeds of the sale by the trust to a person who could own the shares without violating the ownership limits. 
 
 Our board of directors has exempted Gould Investors, Fredric H. Gould, Matthew J. Gould and Jeffrey A. Gould from the ownership limits and has not established a limitation on ownership for such persons. Based on information supplied to us, as of December 31, 2022, Gould Investors owns approximately 17.2 of the outstanding shares of common stock and, by virtue of the applicable attribution rules under the Code, one individual currently beneficially owns 22.3 of outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, the acquisition by each of four other individuals of 6.0 of our outstanding common stock, when combined with the ownership of our common stock of Gould Investors, Fredric H. Gould, Matthew J. Gould and Jeffrey A. Gould, generally would not result in a violation of the Five or Fewer Limit. 
 
 However, there is no limitation on Gould Investors, Fredric H. Gould, Matthew J. Gould or Jeffrey A. Gould acquiring additional shares of our common stock or otherwise increasing their percentage of ownership of our common stock, meaning that the amount of our stock that other persons or entities may acquire without violating the Five or Fewer Limit could be reduced in the future and without notice. To the extent that Gould Investors, Fredric H. Gould, Matthew J. Gould and Jeffrey A. Gould, or their affiliates, acquire additional shares or our stock, or any other event occurs (including a repurchase of shares of our stock), that results in an individual beneficially or constructively owning 26.0 or more of the outstanding shares of our stock within the meaning of the Charter, the acquisition by four other individuals of 6.0 or less of our outstanding stock would violate the Five or Fewer Limit and, therefore, could cause the stock acquired by one or more of these other individuals to be transferred to the charitable trust, despite their compliance with the 6.0 ownership limits. If any of the foregoing occurs, compliance with the 6.0 ownership limit will not ensure that your ownership of our stock does not cause a violation of the Five or Fewer Limit or that your shares of our stock are not transferred to the charitable trust. 
 
 Gould Investors, Fredric H. Gould, Matthew J. Gould and Jeffrey A. Gould will be required by the Exchange Act and regulations promulgated thereunder to report, with certain exceptions, their acquisition of additional shares of our stock within two days of such acquisitions, and all holders of our stock will be required to file reports of their acquisition of beneficial ownership (as defined in the Exchange Act) of more than 5 of our outstanding stock. However, beneficial ownership for purposes of the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act is calculated differently than beneficial ownership for purposes of determining compliance with the Five or Fewer Limit. Further, to the extent that any one or more of Gould Investors, Fredric H. Gould, Matthew J. Gould or Jeffrey A. Gould acquires 30 or more of our outstanding stock, ownership of five percent or less of our outstanding stock could still result in a violation of the Five or Fewer Limit and, therefore, cause newly-acquired stock in our company to be transferred to the charitable trust. As a result, you may not have enough information currently available to you at any time to determine the percentage of ownership of our stock that you can acquire without violating the Five or Fewer Limit and losing the economic benefit of the ownership of such newly-acquired shares. 
 
 The stock market is volatile, and fluctuations in our operating results, removal from various indices and other factors could cause our stock price to decline. 
 
 The stock market has experienced, and may continue to experience, fluctuations that significantly impact the market prices of securities issued by many companies. Market fluctuations could adversely affect our stock price. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations, as well as general economic, systemic, political and market conditions, such as pandemics, recessions, loss of investor confidence, interest rate changes, government shutdowns, or trade wars, may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. Moreover, our operating results may fluctuate and vary from period to period due to the risk factors set forth herein. 
 
 Although our common stock is quoted on the New York Stock Exchange, the volume of trades on any given day has been limited historically, as a result of which stockholders might not have been able to sell or purchase our common stock at the volume, price or time desired. In June 2018, our common stock was added to the Russell 3000 Index. If our common stock is removed from the Russell 3000 Index because it does not meet the criteria for continued inclusion in such index, index funds, 
 26 

Table of Contents 

 institutional investors, or other holders attempting to track the composition of that index may be required to sell our common stock, which would adversely impact the price and frequency at which it trades. 
 
 General Business Risks 
 
 Breaches of information technology systems could materially harm our business and reputation. 
 
 We, our joint venture partners and the property managers managing our properties, collect and retain, through information technology systems, financial, personal and other sensitive information provided by third parties, including tenants, vendors and employees. Such persons also rely on information technology systems for the collection and distribution of funds. Our information technology systems have been breached though, to our knowledge, none of our properties nor tenants have suffered any material damages therefrom. There can be no assurance that we, our joint venture partners or property managers will be able to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information or the unauthorized distribution of funds. Any loss of this information or unauthorized distribution of funds as a result of a breach of information technology systems may result in loss of funds to which we are entitled, legal liability and costs (including damages and penalties), as well as damage to our reputation, that could materially and adversely affect our business and financial performance.

The complaint seeks compensatory damages in an unspecified amount in excess of 1 million and an unspecified amount of exemplary damages. Our primary insurance carrier is defending the claim; we believe we have sufficient primary and umbrella insurance to cover the claim for compensatory damages. Insurance generally does not cover claims for exemplary damages.

 Overview 
 We are an internally managed real estate investment trust, also known as a REIT, that is focused on the ownership, operation and, to a lesser extent, development of multi-family properties. These properties may be wholly owned or owned by unconsolidated joint ventures in which we generally have contributed a significant portion of the equity. At December 31, 2022, we: (i) wholly-own 21 multi-family properties with an aggregate of 5,420 units and a carrying value of 649.7 million, (ii) have ownership interests, through unconsolidated entities, in eight multi-family properties with an aggregate of 2,781 units, for which the carrying value of our net equity investment therein is 39.1 million and (iii) own other assets, through consolidated and unconsolidated entities, with a carrying value of 5.4 million. The 29 multi-family properties are located in eleven states; most of these properties are located in the Southeast United States and Texas. 
 2022 and Recent Developments. 
 During 2022: 
 
 Partner Buyouts 
 
 We purchased the interests of our joint venture partners in ventures that owned 11 multi-family properties for an aggregate purchase price of 105.9 million (the "2022 Partner Buyouts"). As a result, these properties are wholly-owned and the accounts (including mortgage debt of approximately 236.6 million) and results of operations of these properties are included directly in our consolidated financial statements as of the applicable date of purchase. In 2022, (i) since the applicable Partner Buyout, these properties contributed in the aggregate 23.4 million in rental revenues, 10.2 million in operating expenses, 6.6 million in interest expense and 11.2 million in depreciation, and (ii) prior to the applicable Partner Buyout contributed an aggregate of 1.2 million in income from unconsolidated joint ventures. In 2023, we anticipate that these 11 properties will generate approximately 41.8 million in rental revenues, 18.0 million of real estate operating expense, 11.9 million in interest expense and 16.6 million in depreciation. These estimates for 2023 assume that rental income and real estate operating expense will remain at the same level in 2023 as in 2022 (although we anticipate that real estate operating expense will be higher in 2023 due to the master insurance program), and assumes an anticipated increases in 2023 from 2022 in interest expense due to a mortgage refinance that occured in May 2022 and depreciation as a result of the additional investments i.e. , the purchase price paid for the remaining interest) made in such properties . Since August, 2021, we completed the purchase of the remaining interests of our joint venture partners in 14 joint ventures including three partner buyouts completed in 2021 (the "2021 Partner Buyouts"; and together with the 2022 Partner Buyouts, the "Partner Buyouts"). 
 Sales 
 We recorded an aggregate gain of 64.5 million from the sale by unconsolidated subsidiaries, in four separate transactions, of four multi-family properties, and our share of the related aggregate loss on extinguishment of debt was 1.9 million. During 2022 (through the applicable sales dates) and 2021, these properties contributed a loss of 1.6 million (including our share of the early extinguishment of debt charge related to these sales) and income of 201,000 respectively, of equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated joint ventures. 
 Financing; Other 
 
 We: 
 
 entered into the Amendment to our Facility. Among other things, the Amendment (i) increased the amount we are permitted to borrow from 35 million to an aggregate of 60 million, subject to compliance with borrowing base requirements and other conditions, (ii) increased from 15 million to 25 million the amount that may be used for working capital (including dividend payments) and operating expenses, (iii) extended the term of the facility from November 2024 to September 2025, (iv) reduced the interest rate to the prime rate (subject to a floor of 3.5 by eliminating the 25 basis point spread over the prime rate, (v) increased the number and value of the unencumbered properties we are required to maintain from two properties with a value of at least 50 million to three properties with a value of at least 75 million and (vi) requires that we maintain a tangible net worth of a least 140 million. 
 raised approximately 9.9 million of equity from the sale of 447,815 shares of our common stock pursuant to our at-the-market equity offering program. 
 implemented, effective with the dividend declared in June 2022, an 8.7 per share increase in our quarterly cash dividends from the immediately preceding dividend payment, and declared dividends of an aggregate of 0.98 per share.

Table of Contents 

 implemented a dividend reinvestment plan which allows our stockholders to purchase our common stock at a discount (currently 3.0 to the trading price) and which reduced our cash outlay for dividends paid in 2022 by 1.3 million. 
 maintained an average occupancy rate of 95.9 across our portfolio of multi-family properties. 
 began participating in a master insurance program which covers 17 wholly-owned properties comprising 4,316 units located in 10 states. Generally, the coverage limit is 100 million 50 million for named hurricanes) per occurrence with a deductible of 100,000 for all other perils, and varying deductibles for, among other things, wind, flood, and earthquake damage. We also obtained, on a per occurrence per property basis, general liability and umbrella coverage of 1 million and 25 million, respectively. 
 used our available cash to pay-off 14.5 million of 4.29 mortgage debt of Avalon Apartments - Pensacola, FL, a wholly owned property. 
 used our credit facility in October 2022 to pay off 14.9 million of maturing mortgage debt at our Silvana Oaks-North Charleston, SC property. 
 In February 2023, we obtained mortgage debt of 21.2 million on our Silvana Oaks - North Charleston, SC multi-family property; such mortgage debt matures in March 2033, bears an interest rate of 4.45 and is interest only for the term of the mortgage. We used the net proceeds of such mortgage debt to fully pay down our credit facility. 
 On March 13, 2023, the unconsolidated joint venture that owns Chatham Court and Reflections, a 494 unit multi-family property located in Dallas, TX, and in which we have a 50 interest, entered into a contract to sell such property. We estimate that our share of the gain from this sale will be approximately 14.3 million and that our share of the related early extinguishment of debt charge will be 167,000. In 2022, this property accounted for 753,000 of equity in earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures. We anticipate that the closing of this transaction, which is subject to customary closing conditions, will be completed in the quarter ending June 30,2023, although we can provide no assurance that this transaction will be completed. 
 In March 2023, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire a 238-unit multifamily property constructed in 2019 and located in Richmond, VA, for a purchase price of approximately 62.5 million. The purchase price includes the assumption of approximately 32 million of mortgage debt bearing an interest rate of 3.34 and maturing in 2061.The purchase is subject to the satisfaction of various conditions, including the completion, to BRT s satisfaction, of its due diligence investigation, as well as the approval by the mortgage lender of the Company s assumption of the mortgage debt. BRT anticipates that this transaction will be completed in the fourth quarter of 2023, although we can provide no assurance that this transaction will be completed. 
 
 UPREIT Structure 
 
 We are evaluating whether to establish an UPREIT structure to enhance our ability to acquire multi-family properties. There is no timetable for the completion of such evaluation or implementation of such structure and we can provide no assurance that we will implement an UPREIT structure and that if implemented, that it will be beneficial to us and our stockholders. 

Results of Operations 
 Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 
 The term "same store properties" refers to seven multi-family properties with an aggregate of 1,608 units that were owned for all of 2022 and 2021. The term "unconsolidated same store properties" with an aggregate of 2,781 units refers to eight properties that were owned for all of 2022 and 2021. 
 Revenues 
 The following table compares our revenues for the years indicated: 
 30 

Table of Contents 

 (Dollars in thousands): 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) Change Rental and other revenue from real estate properties 70,515 32,041 38,474 120.1 Other income 12 16 (4) (25.0) Total revenues 70,527 32,057 38,470 120.0 
 
 Rental and other revenue from real estate properties. The components of the increase include: 
 37.1 million due to the revenues from the Partner Buyouts, including 13.7 million from the inclusion, for all of 2022, of the revenues from the 2021 Partner Buyouts; and 
 2.6 million from same store properties, substantially all of which is due to higher rental rates. 
 Offsetting the increase is a 1.2 million decrease due to the sale of the Kendall Manor Property - Houston, TX (the "Kendall Sale") in 2021 and a 191,000 decrease due to lower occupancy at same store properties. 
 Expenses 
 
 The following table compares our expenses for the periods indicated: (Dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) Change Real estate operating expenses 30,558 14,202 16,356 115.2 Interest expense 15,514 6,757 8,757 129.6 General and administrative 14,654 12,621 2,033 16.1 Impairment charge 520 (520) (100.0) Depreciation 24,812 8,025 16,787 209.2 Total expenses 85,538 42,125 43,413 103.1 
 
 Real estate operating expenses. The components of the increase include: 
 16.2 million from the Partner Buyouts, of which 6.0 million is from the inclusion, for all of 2022, of the expenses from the properties included in the 2021 Partner Buyouts; and 
 1.0 million from same store properties, including increases of 440,000 in repairs and maintenance and replacement costs, which includes turnover costs, 160,000 in payroll costs, 132,000 in insurance costs and 106,000 in utility expense. 
 
 The increase was offset by a 828,000 decrease due to the Kendall Sale. 
 
 We anticipate that these expenses will increase in 2023 because of our implementation of the Insurance Program, industry-wide increases in the cost of property insurance coverage and the impact of inflation. 
 Interest expense 
 The change is due to a: 
 9.6 million increase due to the Partner Buyouts, including 2.9 million from the inclusion, for all of 2022, of such expense from the properties included in the 2021 Partner Buyouts; 
 612,000 increase in interest expense on our credit facility, due to a 7.9 million increase in the average outstanding balance during 2022; and 
 592,000 due to the increase in the interest rate on our floating rate junior subordinated notes. 
 
 The increase was offset by a (i) 1.8 million decrease due to the payoff of 61.3 million of mortgage debt since August 2021 31.9 million in 2021 and 29.5 million in 2022) and (ii) 271,000 decrease due to the Kendall Sale.

 General and administrative. 
 
 The increase is due to a 1.5 million increase in non-cash compensation expense, including increases of: 
 
 890,000 due to increased amortization expense from RSUs, of which increases of (i) 510,000 reflects amortization expense related to RSU's granted in June 2022 and (ii) 380,000 reflects net amortization expense primarily related to the RSUs granted in 2021; 
 400,000 due to the amortization expense related to the restricted stock granted in January 2022 (as a result of the higher fair value of the shares granted in 2022 in comparison to the restricted stock granted in 2017); and 
 254,000 due to the inclusion, for all of 2022, of the amortization expense related to the restricted stock granted in June 2021. 
 
 Also contributing to the increase was a 461,000 increase due to higher levels of cash compensation. 
 
 The increase was offset by the inclusion, in 2021, of 114,000 of professional fees related primarily to a terminated stock offering. 
 
 Impairment charges 
 In 2021, we recorded an impairment charge of 520,000 representing the excess of the book value of our investment in the Opop Tower and Loft properties, St Louis, MO, over the anticipated selling price of the investment. There was no comparable charge in 2022. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization 
 
 The increase is due 16.9 million of such expense from the Partner Buyouts, including 5.7 million from the inclusion, for all of 2022, of such expense from the properties included in the 2021 Partner Buyouts. 
 Gain on sale of real estate 
 
 In 2022, we recognized a gain of 6,000 on the sale of a vacant parcel of land in South Daytona Beach, FL. In 2021, we recognized a 7.3 million gain on the Kendall Sale and a 414,000 gain from the sale of a cooperative apartment unit in New York, NY. 
 
 Casualty loss / Insurance recovery of casualty loss 
 
 In 2022, we settled a personal injury lawsuit for 850,000. Our insurance carrier reimbursed us for this loss. 

Gain on sale of partnership interest 
 
 In 2021, we sold our interest in a joint venture that owned Anatole Apartments - Daytona, Beach, FL and OPOP Towers and Lofts - St. Louis, MO (collectively, the Anatole/OPOP Sale) and recognized an aggregate gain of 2.6 million. There was no comparable gain in 2022. 
 
 Loss on extinguishment of debt 
 
 In 2022, we incurred 563,000 of loss on extinguishment of debt related to the mortgage refinancing that took place with the buyout of our joint venture partner's interest in Brixworth at Bridge Street - Huntsville, AL. In 2021, we incurred 1.6 million of prepayment charges and deferred loan fee write-offs on the payoff of three first mortgage loans and three supplemental loans with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of 31.9 million and the refinance of a mortgage loan in connection with the purchase of the interests of our joint venture partners in Crestmont at Thornblade - Greenville, SC. 
 
 Income tax provision 
 
 In 2022, income tax provision increased to 821,000 from 206,000 in 2021 due to an increase in state level taxes accrued. The increase is the result of income generated by property sales in 2022 and the unavailability of net operating loss carryforwards available in certain states to offset such income.

 Funds from Operations; Adjusted Funds from Operations; Net Operating Income. 
 In view of our multi-family property activities, we disclose funds from operations ("FFO") ,adjusted funds from operations ("AFFO") and net operating income ("NOI") because we believe that such metrics are a widely recognized and appropriate measure of the performance of a multi-family REIT. 
 We compute FFO in accordance with the "White Paper on Funds From Operations" issued by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") and NAREIT's related guidance. FFO is defined in the White Paper as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate, gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities where the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. In computing FFO, we do not add back to net income the amortization of costs in connection with our financing activities or depreciation of non-real estate assets. 
 
 We compute AFFO by adjusting FFO for loss on extinguishment of debt, our straight-line rent accruals, restricted stock and RSU compensation expense, fair value adjustment of mortgage debt, gain on insurance recovery, insurance recovery from casualty loss and deferred mortgage and debt costs (including, in each case as applicable, from our share from our unconsolidated joint ventures). Since the NAREIT White Paper does not provide guidelines for computing AFFO, the computation of AFFO may vary from one REIT to another. 
 We believe that FFO and AFFO are useful and standard supplemental measures of the operating performance for equity REITs and are used frequently by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating equity REITs, many of which present FFO and AFFO when reporting their operating results. FFO and AFFO are intended to exclude GAAP historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, which assures that the value of real estate assets diminish predictability over time. In fact, real estate values have historically risen and fallen with market conditions. As a result, we believe that FFO and AFFO provide a performance measure that, when compared year-over-year, should reflect the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, interest costs and other matters without the inclusion of depreciation and amortization, providing a perspective that may not be necessarily apparent from net income. We also consider FFO and AFFO to be useful to us in evaluating potential property acquisitions. 
 FFO and AFFO do not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by GAAP. FFO and AFFO should not be considered to be an alternative to net income as a reliable measure of our operating performance; nor should FFO and AFFO be considered an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities (as defined by GAAP) as measures of liquidity. 
 FFO and AFFO do not measure whether cash flow is sufficient to fund all of our cash needs, including principal amortization and capital improvements. FFO and AFFO do not represent cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as defined by GAAP. 
 Management recognizes that there are limitations in the use of FFO and AFFO. In evaluating our performance, management is careful to examine GAAP measures such as net income (loss) and cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. Management also reviews the reconciliation of net income (loss) to FFO and AFFO.

 FFO for 2022 increased 5.8 million, or 33 , to 23.2 million from 17.4 million in 2021. Contributing to the improvement were: 
 an 8.2 million increase in our incremental share of the operating income due to the Partner Buyouts (the "Incremental Impact"), including 3.4 million from the inclusion, for all of 2022, of the Incremented Impact from the 2021 Partner Buyouts; 
 a 3.7 million decrease in loss on extinguishment of debt; 
 a 3.1 million increase due to improved operating margins across our portfolio; 
 a 1.7 million decrease in interest expense; and 
 an 850,000 increase in an insurance recovery from a casualty loss. 
 
 The increase was offset by: 
 a 7.6 million decrease from the sale of properties (including interests in properties), in 2022 and 2021; 
 a 2.0 million increase in General and administrative expense (including 1.5 million of non-cash compensation expense); 
 a 701,000 decrease in insurance recoveries and gains from insurance proceeds; and 
 an 615,000 increase in income tax provision. 
 
 AFFO increased 4.5 million, or 19 , to 28.4 million in 2022 from 23.8 million in 2021, due to factors contributing to the improvement in FFO, excluding the 3.7 million loss on extinguishment of debt, 1.5 million in non-cash compensation expense, and a net 701,000 relating to insurance recoveries and gains. 
 
 See Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 for further information regarding these changes. 
 
 Diluted per share FFO and AFFO were impacted in the year ended December 31, 2022 by an 846,000 increase in the weighted averages shares of common stock outstanding primarily due to stock issuances pursuant to our at-the-market offering and equity incentive programs. 
 
 NOI is a non-GAAP measure of performance. NOI is used by our management and many investors to evaluate and compare the performance of our properties to other comparable properties, to determine trends at our properties and to determine the estimated fair value of our properties. The usefulness of NOI may be limited in that it does not take into account, among other things, general and administrative expense, interest expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, casualty losses, insurance recoveries and gains or losses as determined by GAAP. NOI is a property specific performance metric and does not measure our performance as a whole. Same store NOI reflects the operations of seven of our ten wholly-owned properties. 
 
 We compute NOI by adjusting net income (loss) to (a) add back (1) interest expense, (2) general and administrative expenses, (3) depreciation expense, (4) impairment charges, (5) provision for taxes, (6) loss on extinguishment of debt, (7) equity in loss of unconsolidated joint ventures, (8) casualty loss and (9) the impact of non-controlling interests, and (b) deduct (1) other income, (2) gain on sale of real estate (3) gain on sale of partnership interest, (4) equity in earnings from sale of consolidated joint venture properties, (5) insurance recovery of casualty loss and (6) gain on insurance recoveries. Other REIT s may use different methodologies for calculating NOI, and accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to other REIT s. We believe NOI provides an operating perspective not immediately apparent from GAAP operating income or net income (loss). NOI is one of the measures we use to evaluate our performance because it (i) measures the core operations of property performance by excluding corporate level expenses and other items unrelated to property operating performance and (ii) captures trends in rental housing and property operating expenses. However, NOI should only be used as an alternative measure of our financial performance.

In 2022, NOI increased by 22.1 million from 2021 primarily due to a 38.5 million increase in rental revenues resulting from the Partner Buyouts. The increase was offset by a 16.4 million increase, primarily due to the Partner Buyouts, in real estate operating expenses. Same store NOI increased in 2022 by 1.6 million from 2021 due to a 2.6 million increase in rental revenues (and in particular, the increase in average rental rates) offset by a 1.0 million increase in real estate operating expenses. See "-Results of Operations - Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2021" for a discussion of these changes. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We require funds to pay operating expenses and debt service obligations, acquire properties, make capital and other improvements, fund capital contributions and pay dividends. Generally, in 2022, our primary sources of capital and liquidity were the operations of our multi-family properties (including distributions of 10.9 million from the operations of our unconsolidated joint ventures and 80.2 million of distributions from sale transactions), 4.4 million from property sales owned by consolidated entities, net mortgage proceeds of 19.0 million from the refinancing of mortgage debt in connection with the 2022 Partner Buyouts, 9.9 million from the sale of our common stock through our at-the-market equity offering program, and our available cash. Excluding funds held at our unconsolidated subsidiaries, at December 31, 2022 and March 1, 2023, our available liquidity was approximately 61.3 million and 75.3 million, respectively, including 20.3 million and 15.3 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents, and subject to compliance with borrowing base and other requirements, up to 41.0 million and 60.0 million, respectively, available under our credit facility. 
 
 We anticipate that for the four years beginning January 1, 2023, our operating expenses, 133.9 million of mortgage amortization and interest expense (including 55.4 million from unconsolidated joint ventures) and 118.4 million of balloon payments due with respect to mortgages maturing through 2026, estimated capital expenditures for 2023 only) of 11.1 
 38 

Table of Contents 

 million (including an estimated 3.6 million for our value add program), estimated cash dividend payments of at least 76.4 million (assuming (i) the current quarterly dividend rate of 0.25 per share and (ii) 19.1 million shares outstanding) will be funded from cash generated from operations (including distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures), mortgage financings and re-financings, sales of properties, the issuance of additional equity and, if available as noted below, our 60 million credit facility. Our operating cash flow and available cash is insufficient to fully fund the 118.4 million of balloon payments, and if we are unable to refinance such debt on acceptable terms, we may need to issue additional equity or dispose of properties, in each case on potentially unfavorable terms. 
 
 Our ability to acquire additional multi-family properties and implement value-add projects is limited by our available cash and our ability to (i) draw on our credit facility, (ii) obtain, on acceptable terms, mortgage debt from lenders, and (iii) raise capital from the sale of our common stock. Further, if and to the extent we generate ordinary taxable income, we will be required to make distributions to stockholders to maintain our REIT status and as a result, will be limited in our ability to use gains, if any, from property sales, as a source of funds for operating expenses, debt service and property acquisitions.

 notes), are redeemable at our option and bear an interest rate, which resets and is payable quarterly, of three-month LIBOR plus 200 basis points. Although these notes provide for an alternate method of calculating interest when LIBOR becomes unavailable in June 2023, such alternative rate may not be available in which case we may have to negotiate a secondary alternative rate with the counterparties to such debt. If we and the counterparties to this debt are unable to agree to a satisfactory secondary alternate rate, our cash flow and operating results may be adversely affected. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the interest rate on these notes was 6.41 and 2.13 , respectively.

 Our credit facility with VNB New York, LLC, an affiliate of Valley National Bank (collectively, "VNB"), allows us to borrow, subject to compliance with borrowing base requirements and other conditions, up to 60 million, (i) for the acquisition of, and investment in, multi-family properties, (ii) to repay mortgage debt secured by multi-family properties and (iii) for Operating Expenses i.e. , working capital (including dividend payments) and operating expenses); provided, that not more than 25 million may be used for Operating Expenses. The credit facility is secured by cash accounts maintained by us at VNB (and we are required to maintain substantially all of our bank accounts at VNB), and the pledge of our interests in the entities that own the unencumbered multi-family properties used in calculating the borrowing base. The credit facility bears an annual interest rate, which resets daily, equal to the prime rate, with a floor of 3.50 . The interest rate at December 31, 2022 and March 1, 2023, was 7.50 and 7.75 respectively. There is an annual fee of 0.25 on the total amount committed by VNB and unused by us. The credit facility matures in September 2025. As of March 1, 2023, there was no balance outstanding and up to 60 million was available to be borrowed thereunder. 
 The terms of the credit facility include certain restrictions and covenants which, among other things, limit the incurrence of liens, require that we maintain and include in the collateral securing the facility at least three unencumbered properties with an aggregate value(as calculated pursuant to the facility) of at least 75 million, and require compliance with financial ratios relating to, among other things maintaining a minimum tangible net worth of 140 million, the minimum amount of debt service coverage with respect to the properties (and amounts drawn on the credit facility) used in calculating the borrowing base. Net proceeds received from the sale, financing or refinancing of wholly-owned properties are generally required to be used to repay amounts outstanding under the credit facility. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance in all material respects with the requirements of the facility. 
 
 Other Financing Sources and Arrangements 
 
 At December 31, 2022, we are joint venture partners in unconsolidated joint ventures which own eight multi-family properties. The distributions from the properties owned by these ventures, 6.5 million in 2022 are a meaningful source of our liquidity and cash flow. Further, we may be required to make capital contributions with respect to these properties. At December 31, 2022, our investment in these joint venture properties have a net equity carrying value of 39.1 million and are subject to mortgage debt, which is not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet, of 256.7 million. Although BRT Apartments Corp. is not the obligor with respect to such mortgage debt, the loss of any of these properties due to mortgage foreclosure or similar proceedings would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Prior to the 2022 Partner Buyouts, these joint venture arrangements were material to our liquidity and capital resource position. After giving affect to the 2022 Partner Buyouts, these arrangements will have a meaningful impact on our liquidity and capital resources. See note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. 
 See Item 1. " Business-Mortgage Debt " for information regarding our mortgage debt at consolidated and unconsolidated subsidiaries. 
 Inflation 
 Substantially all of our multi-family property leases are for periods of one-year or less. The short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce our risk to adverse effects of inflation on our revenue. During 2022, we experienced inflationary pressures that drove higher operating expenses, primarily in personnel, repairs and maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes; such increases may continue in 2023 and thereafter, which will adversely affect our operating results. 
 
 Inflation affects the overall cost of our debt. We mitigate the risks presented by inflation through the use of long-term fixed interest rate debt and interest rate hedges and by paying down, when we deem appropriate, our credit facility debt. However, increasing interest rates, which generally correlates to increasing inflation, may make it less attractive to obtain mortgage debt or use our credit facility in connection with acquisition, refinancing and value add activities.

 Cash Distribution Policy 
 
 We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Accordingly, to qualify as a REIT, we must, among other things, meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute currently at least 90 of our ordinary taxable income to our stockholders. It is our current intention to comply with these requirements and maintain our REIT status. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to corporate federal, state or local income taxes on taxable income we distribute currently (in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code and applicable regulations) to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal, state and local income taxes at regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent tax years. Even if we qualify for federal taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and to federal income taxes on our undistributed taxable income i.e. , taxable income not distributed in the amounts and in the time frames prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code and applicable regulations thereunder) and are subject to Federal excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income. 
 
 It is our intention to pay to our stockholders within the time periods prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code no less than 90 , and, if possible, 100 of our annual taxable income, including taxable gains from the sale of real estate. It will continue to be our policy to make sufficient distributions to stockholders in order for us to maintain our REIT status under the Internal Revenue Code. 
 
 Our board of directors will continue to evaluate, on a quarterly basis, the amount of dividend payments based on its assessment of, among other things, our short and long-term cash and liquidity requirements, prospects, debt maturities, net income, funds from operations, and adjusted funds from operations. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. The preparation of financial statements and related disclosure in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make certain judgments and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to understand our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgments and estimates by our management; as a result they are subject to a degree of uncertainty. These significant accounting policies include the following: 
 Equity method investments 
 We report our investments in unconsolidated entities, over whose operating and financial policies we have the ability to exercise significant influence but not control, under the equity method of accounting. Under this method of accounting, our pro rata share of the applicable entity's earnings or losses is included in our consolidated statements of operations. We initially record our investments based on either the carrying value for properties contributed or the cash invested. 
 We evaluate our equity-method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our investments may exceed the fair value. If it is determined that a decline in the fair value of our investments is not temporary, and if such reduced fair value is below its carrying value, an impairment is recorded. Determining fair value involves significant judgment. Our estimates consider available evidence including the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates, general economic conditions and other relevant factors. In 2021, we recorded an impairment related to our equity investment in the OPOP Properties. We sold our interests in these properties in November 2021. 
 Carrying Value of Real Estate Portfolio 
 We conduct a quarterly review of each real estate asset owned by us and through our joint ventures. This review is conducted in order to determine if indicators of impairment are present on the real estate. 
 In reviewing the value of the real estate assets owned, if there is an indicator of impairment and the carrying value of the real estate asset is determined to be unrecoverable, we seek to arrive at the fair value of each real estate asset by using one or more valuation techniques, such as comparable sales, discounted cash flow analysis or replacement cost analysis. A real estate asset is considered to be unrecoverable when an analysis suggests that the undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the property will be insufficient to recover our investment. Any impairment taken with respect to our real estate assets reduces our net income, assets and stockholders' equity to the extent of the amount of the allowance, but it will not affect our cash flow until such time as the property is sold.

Table of Contents 

 Purchase Price Allocations 
 We allocate the purchase price of properties, including acquisition costs and assumed debt, when appropriate, to the tangible and identified intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their relative fair values. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we use a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property, our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data. We also consider information obtained about each property as a result of its pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired. 

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 All of our mortgage debt bears interest at fixed rates. Our junior subordinated notes bear interest at the rate of three-month LIBOR plus 200 basis points. At December 31, 2022, the interest rate on these notes was 6.41 . Our credit facility bears interest at the prime rate. A 100 basis point increase in the rate would result in an increase in interest expense in 2023 of 564,000 (of which 374,000 would be due to the change in rate on the junior subordinated notes) and a 100 basis point decrease in the rate would result in a 564,000 decrease (of which 374,000 would be due to the change in rate on the junior subordinated notes) in interest expense in 2023.

 Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 A review and evaluation was performed by our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on that review and evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as designed and implemented as of December 31, 2022, were effective. 
 Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, a company's principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by a company's board, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: 
 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of a company; 
 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of a company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the board of directors of a company; and 
 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial transactions. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of BRT Apartments Corp. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BRT Apartments Corp. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosures to which it relates.

Purchase Price Allocation Joint Venture Consolidation Assessment 
 Description of the matter 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company bought out eleven of the remaining interests of joint venture partners for an aggregate purchase price of 377.4 million, making them wholly owned and consolidated. The transactions were accounted for as asset acquisitions and the purchase prices were allocated based on the relative fair values of the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. As more fully described in Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements, the estimates used in determining the relative fair values may be based on comparable transactions, replacement costs of assets, and other market data, which are unobservable inputs. Auditing management s purchase price allocations was complex due to the judgement required in developing the fair value of the acquired tangible and intangible assets. In particular, the estimate was sensitive to unobservable significant assumptions, including comparable transactions and replacement costs of assets. How we addressed the matter in our audit 
 Our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the appropriateness of the methodology and model applied to determine the fair value of the acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities used in the purchase price allocation and recalculating the models results. With the assistance of our real estate valuation specialists, we compared the significant assumptions used by management, including comparable transactions and replacement costs of assets, to current market data. We also tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in management s models. In addition, we utilized third-party data to test management s estimate and identify potential sources of corroborative or contrary information.
