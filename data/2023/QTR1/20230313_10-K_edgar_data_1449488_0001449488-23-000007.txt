 Reduced demand for or production levels of oil and gas adversely affect the demand for and prices we charge for our services, which could cause our revenue and cash available for distribution to our unitholders to decrease. 
 
 Our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could continue to be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
 (ii) 

Our substantial leverage. 
 
 We may be unable to repurchase or refinance our senior secured notes in the event of a change of control as required by their respective indentures. 
 
 The loss of any of our most significant customers would result in a decline in our revenue and cash available to pay distributions to our common unitholders. 
 
 Our ability to manage and grow our business effectively and provide quality services to our customers may be adversely affected if our general partner loses its management or we are unable to retain trained personnel. 
 
 Pressure from competitors may result in price reductions and periods of reduced demand for our products. 
 
 Our operations in non-U.S. markets expose us to legal, political and economic risks that could have a material impact on our business. 
 
 Regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells that may reduce demand for our services. 
 
 A cyberattack or other failure or security breach of our information technology infrastructure, or the theft, loss or misuse of personal data, could adversely affect our business and operations. 
 
 The market price of our common units has been and may continue to be volatile. 
 
 Spartan has conflicts of interest, which may permit it to favor its own interests to our unitholders detriment. 
 
 Our partnership agreement limits our general partner s fiduciary duties to our common unitholders and restricts the remedies available to our common unitholders for actions taken by our general partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty. 
 
 Our common unitholders have limited voting rights and are not entitled to elect our general partner or its directors. 
 
 We are exempt from certain corporate governance requirements that provide additional protection to stockholders of other public companies. 
 
 Our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. Our cash available for distribution to unitholders may be substantially reduced if we become subject to entity-level taxation as a result of the Internal Revenue Service IRS treating us as a corporation or legislative, judicial or administrative changes, and may also be reduced by any audit adjustments if imposed directly on the Partnership. 
 
 Even if unitholders do not receive any cash distributions from us, unitholders will be required to pay taxes on their share of our taxable income. A unitholder s share of our taxable income may be increased as a result of the IRS successfully contesting any of the federal income tax positions we take. 
 
 Tax-exempt entities and non-U.S. unitholders face unique tax issues from owning our common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them.

 About CSI Compressco LP 
 
 We are a provider of contract services related to the exploration and production of oil and natural gas, including natural gas compression services and treating services. Natural gas compression is used for oil and natural gas production, gathering, artificial lift, transmission, processing, and storage. Treating services include removal of contaminants from a natural gas stream and cooling to reduce the temperature of produced gas and liquids. We also sell used standard compressor packages and provide aftermarket services and compressor package parts and components manufactured by third-party suppliers. We provide contract compression and treating services and compressor parts and component sales to a broad base of natural gas and oil exploration and production, midstream, transmission, and storage companies operating throughout many of the onshore producing regions of the United States, as well as in a number of international locations, including the countries of Mexico, Canada, Argentina, Egypt and Chile. 
 
 We are one of the largest service providers of natural gas compression services in the United States, using our fleet of compressor packages that employ a full spectrum of low-, medium-, and high-horsepower engines. Low-horsepower compressor packages enhance production for dry gas wells and liquids-loaded gas wells by deliquefying the wells, lowering wellhead pressure, and increasing gas velocity. These packages are also used in connection with oil and liquids production and in vapor recovery and casing gas system applications. Low- to medium-horsepower compressor packages are typically selected for wellhead and natural gas gathering systems, artificial lift systems, and other applications primarily in connection with natural gas and oil production. Our high-horsepower compressor package offerings are typically deployed in natural gas production, natural gas gathering, centralized gas lift, centralized compression facilities, and midstream applications. 
 
 Our aftermarket business provides a wide range of services and compressor package parts and components manufactured by third-party suppliers to support the needs of customers who own compression equipment. These services include operations, maintenance, overhaul, and reconfiguration services and may be provided under turnkey engineering, procurement and construction contracts. Our aftermarket services are provided by our factory- and internally-trained technicians in most of the major oil and natural gas producing basins in the United States and Mexico. 
 
 Our long-term growth strategy includes expanding our existing businesses through organic growth and accretive acquisitions, both in the U.S. and internationally. 
 
 Our operations are organized into a single business segment. See Note 15 - Segments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for further information. For financial information regarding our revenues and total assets, see Note 16 - Geographic Information contained in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.

Contribution of Spartan entities 
 
 On November 10, 2021, the Partnership entered into a Contribution Agreement (the Contribution Agreement by and among the Partnership, CSI Compressco GP, Spartan, and CSI Compressco Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation Compressco Sub ). Pursuant to the terms of the Contribution Agreement, Spartan contributed to the Partnership 100 of the limited liability company interest in Treating Holdco, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company Treating Holdco ), 100 of the common stock in Spartan Terminals Operating, Inc., a Delaware corporation Spartan Terminals ), and 99 of the limited liability company interests in Spartan Operating Company LLC, a Delaware limited liability company Spartan Operating and together with Treating Holdco and Spartan Terminals, Spartan Treating (such interests in Spartan Treating, the Contributed Interests and the Partnership, CSI Compressco GP and Spartan agreed to cancel the incentive distribution rights (the IDRs in the Partnership in exchange for the issuance of 48.4 million common units. We refer to the acquisition of the Contributed Interests as the Spartan Acquisition. As the Partnership and Spartan Treating were under common control at the time of the Spartan Acquisition, the results of operations have been combined for the Partnership and Spartan Treating from the date of common control which was January 29, 2021. 
 
 Certain of our U.S. services are performed by our wholly owned subsidiary CSI Compressco Operating LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (our Operating LLC ), pursuant to contracts that our outside legal counsel has concluded generate qualifying income under Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), or qualifying income. We do not pay U.S. federal income taxes on the portion of our business conducted by Operating LLC. Compressco Sub, which is also a wholly owned subsidiary of ours, conducts substantially all of our operations that our outside legal counsel has not concluded generate qualifying income, and we pay U.S. federal income tax with respect to such operations. We strive to ensure that all new U.S. compression contracts are entered into by our Operating LLC and generate qualifying income. We also pay state and local income taxes in certain states, and we incur income taxes related to our foreign operations. 
 
 As a limited partnership, we are managed and controlled by our general partner. On January 29, 2021, Spartan acquired from TETRA our general partner, our IDRs and 10.95 million of our common units in the Partnership (the GP Sale ). As of March 9, 2023, common units held by the public represented approximately a 54.7 ownership interest, which is exclusive of Spartan s 44.9 limited partner interest and 0.5 general partner interest. In connection with the GP Sale, on January 29, 2021, TETRA entered into a Transition Services Agreement (the Transition Services Agreement with the Partnership, pursuant to which TETRA provided certain accounting, information technology and back-office support services to the Partnership for a period of one year following closing. The Transition Services Agreement with TETRA expired on January 31, 2022. 
 
 Through Spartan s wholly owned subsidiary and our general partner, CSI Compressco GP LLC, Spartan manages and controls us. We rely on our general partner s board of directors and executive officers to manage our operations and make decisions on our behalf. Our general partner is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Spartan. Unlike shareholders in a publicly traded corporation, our unitholders are not entitled to elect our general partner or its directors. Following the GP Sale, all of our general partner s directors are elected by Spartan. Our general partner does not receive any management fee in connection with its management of our business. However, our general partner is reimbursed for certain expenses, including compensation expenses, incurred on our behalf. In addition, our general partner receives distributions based on its limited and general partner interests. 
 
 Products and Services 
 
 We are a provider of contract services including natural gas compression services and treating services. Natural gas compression is a mechanical process in which the pressure of a given volume of natural gas is increased to a higher pressure. It is essential to the production and movement of natural gas. Compression is typically required numerous times in the natural gas production and sales cycle, including (i) at the wellheads, (ii) throughout gathering and distribution systems, (iii) into and out of processing and storage facilities, and (iv) in natural gas pipelines. Compression is also utilized for gas lift, an artificial lift technique for producing oil that has insufficient reservoir pressure. Natural gas treating encompasses several processes used to remove contaminants and improve the marketability of gas. We also provide aftermarket compression services and compressor package parts and components manufactured by third-party suppliers. 
 
 Contract Services 
 
 We use our fleet of compressor packages to provide a variety of compression services to our customers to meet their specific requirements. Our fleet includes approximately 4,600 compressor packages that provide 
 2 

approximately 1.2 million in aggregate horsepower, employing a wide spectrum of low-, medium-, and high-horsepower engines. The horsepower of our natural gas compressor package fleet as of December 31, 2022 is summarized in the following table: 
 Range of Horsepower Per Package Number of Packages Aggregate Horsepower of Aggregate Horsepower Low-horsepower (0-100) 2,693 127,289 11 Medium-horsepower (101-1,000) 1,426 407,428 34 High-horsepower (1,001 and over) 459 652,640 55 Total 4,578 1,187,357 100 
 
 Low-Horsepower (0-100 Horsepower) Compression Services. Our natural gas-powered, low-horsepower compressor packages include our GasJack compressor packages that are relatively compact and easy to transport to our customer s well site. We utilize our electric powered, low-horsepower VJack compressor packages to provide production enhancement services on wells where electric power is available. Our low-horsepower packages allow us to perform wellhead compression, fluids separation, and optional gas metering services all from one skid, thereby providing services that otherwise would generally require the use of multiple, more costly pieces of equipment. We utilize our low-horsepower compressor packages to provide production enhancement for dry gas wells and liquid-loaded gas wells and backside auto injection systems BAIS ). BAIS monitors tubing pressure to redirect gas flow into the casing annulus as needed to help gas wells unload liquids that hinder production. We also utilize our low-horsepower compressor packages to collect hydrocarbon vapors that are a by-product of oil production and storage vapor recovery and to reduce casing pressure of pumping oil wells to enhance oil production casing gas systems ). 
 
 Medium-horsepower (101-1,000 Horsepower) Compression Services . O ur medium-horsepower compressor packages are primarily utilized to move natural gas from the wellhead through the field gathering system by boosting the pressure of the natural gas flowing through the system. Additionally, these compressor packages are used to reinject natural gas into producing vertical and horizontal oil wells that have insufficient reservoir pressure, to help lift liquids to the surface gas lift operations ). Typically, these applications require medium-horsepower compressor packages located at or near the wellhead. These compressor packages are also used to increase the efficiency of low-capacity natural gas fields by providing a central compression point from which the natural gas can be further processed and transported. These compressor packages feature primarily two- and three-stage compressors powered by natural gas engines ranging from 101 to 1,000 horsepower and equipped with interstage cooling. 
 
 High-Horsepower (Over 1,000 Horsepower) Compression Services . Our high-horsepower compressor packages are primarily utilized in midstream applications including natural gas gathering, gas lift, and centralized compression facilities. They boost the pressure of natural gas flowing from individual wells or a group of wells into a gathering pipeline that leads to various types of processing facilities. A significant number of these compressor packages in midstream applications also serve the dual purpose of gas lift operations by injecting a percentage of the compressed natural gas into producing oil wells. Our high-horsepower compressor packages are also used in connection with the transmission of natural gas from gathering systems to storage facilities or end users. These compressor packages feature primarily two- and three-stage compressors powered by natural gas engines. 
 
 Gas Treating . We provide a variety of natural gas treating services for natural gas producers and midstream companies, such as providing equipment for lease or sale, equipment installation services and the operation of equipment which Spartan Treating refers to as contract services. Spartan Treating s two primary gas treating services provided for customers are the removal of contaminants from the customer s gas stream and natural gas cooling to reduce the gas temperature. Spartan Treating maintains a fleet of amine plants ranging in size used to treat varying customer gas flow volumes by removing hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide to meet required pipeline specifications. Additionally, Spartan Treating s equipment fleet includes natural gas cooling units used to reduce the temperature of natural gas so that it can be further treated, processed or compressed. 
 
 Other Related Services . In Mexico, we provide well monitoring and sand separation services in connection with our compression services. Well monitoring services include a variety of services that monitor and optimize production from oil and gas wells. We utilize automated sand separators, which are high-pressure vessels with automated valve operation functions, at the well to remove solids that would otherwise cause abrasive wear damage to compression and other equipment that is installed downstream and inhibit production from the well. 
 3 

Contract Services Contract Terms . Our contract services are primarily performed under service contracts using our low-, medium-, and high-horsepower compressor packages and our treating assets. A significant portion of these compression services are provided under services contracts that our outside legal counsel has concluded generate qualifying income. Under these services contracts, we are responsible for providing our services in accordance with the particular specifications of a job. As owner and operator, we are responsible for operating and maintaining the equipment we utilize to provide our services. Our low horsepower compression service contracts typically have an initial term of one month and, unless terminated by us or our customers with 30-days notice, continue on a month-to-month basis thereafter. Our medium- and high- horsepower compression service and treating contracts typically have an initial term of twelve months, but range from six months to thirty-six months. After the initial terms on our medium- and high-horsepower compression service and treating contracts, customers typically continue on a month-to-month basis or renew for additional extensions. We charge our customers a fixed monthly fee for the services provided under the services contracts. Aside from factors beyond our control, if the level of services we provide falls below certain contractually specified percentages, our customers are generally entitled to request limited credits against our service fees. To date, these credits have been insignificant as a percentage of revenue. 
 
 We generally own the equipment we use to provide services to our customers, and we bear the risk of loss to this equipment to the extent not caused by (i) a breach of certain obligations of the customer, primarily involving the service site and the fuel gas being supplied to us, or (ii) an uncontrolled well condition. Utilizing our proprietary, telemetry-based reporting system, we remotely monitor, in real time, whether our services are being continuously provided at our U.S. customer well sites. 
 
 As owner of the equipment, we are obligated to pay ad valorem taxes levied on the equipment and related insurance expenses, and we typically do not seek reimbursement for such taxes and expenses from our service agreement customers. 
 
 Aftermarket Services 
 
 Through our aftermarket operations, we provide a wide range of services to support the needs of customers who own compression equipment. The services provided are primarily operation, maintenance, overhaul and reconfiguration services, which may be provided under turnkey contracts. We also sell engine parts, compressor package parts and other parts manufactured by third parties that are utilized in natural gas compressor packages. We have factory- and internally-trained technicians in most of the major oil and natural gas producing basins in the United States to perform these services. 
 
 Market Overview and Competition 
 
 During the first half of 2021, our financial results were affected by the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Reduced spending by oil and gas operators led to a decline in our compression fleet utilization which impacted revenues and pricing. Oil and natural gas commodity prices gained strength throughout 2021 and increased significantly during 2022. This increase in commodity prices, coupled with the waning impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy, resulted in an increase in the demand for our contract services, aftermarket services and equipment rentals. In addition, as a result of the increased customer demand, we were able to implement price increases on many of our compression contracts in the second half of 2021 and throughout 2022. Along with price increases we were able to increase our fleet utilization. Revenue from contract services increased each quarter in 2021 and this trend continued during 2022. We secured orders from key customers for high-horsepower and electric compressors that started generating revenues in the fourth quarter of 2021 and continued to be deployed throughout 2022. Our customers remain focused on capital discipline; however, the levels of quote activity and awards remain strong. The strengthening market environment has increased competition for field and corporate employees. Supply chain issues, increased commodity prices, and inflationary pressures have increased costs and impacted availability of our parts and supplies. External factors including Russia s invasion of Ukraine, and Federal Reserve interest rate increases, could adversely affect our results of operations, impair our ability to raise capital, or otherwise adversely impact our ability to realize certain business strategies. We continue to monitor these risks and take the necessary actions to mitigate them. We have and will continue to evaluate the sale of non-core assets, including our low-horsepower compression fleet.

Customers 
 
 We provide services to a broad base of natural gas and oil exploration and production, midstream, pipeline transmission, and storage companies operating throughout many of the onshore producing regions of the United States. We also have operations in Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Egypt and Chile. While most of our services in the U.S. are performed throughout Texas (with a concentration in the Permian Basin), the Haynesville shale, the San Juan Basin, the Rocky Mountain region, and the Mid-Continent region, we also have a presence in the Marcellus / Utica and other producing regions. We continue to evaluate opportunities to further expand our operations into other regions in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world. 
 
 Following the expiration of the primary term, the parties may elect to renew or extend the term, or our service contracts will continue month to month until terminated upon thirty days notice. Our low-horsepower compression fleet is generally deployed on short-term contracts while our medium-horsepower is generally deployed on 12 month terms or greater and high-horsepower fleet is generally deployed with an initial term of 24 months or greater. Although we enter into short-term contracts on our lower horsepower units, the average duration a typical unit stays deployed with the same customer is greater than 30 months. Our significant customers for the year ended December 31, 2022 include various major integrated oil companies, public and private independent exploration and production companies and midstream companies, one of which individually accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022. The loss of any of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. 
 
 Competition 
 
 The natural gas compression services business is highly competitive. We experience competition from companies that may be able to more quickly adapt to changes within our industry and changes in economic conditions as a whole, more readily take advantage of available opportunities and technologies, and adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Primary competition for our low-horsepower compression services business comes from smaller local and regional companies that utilize packages consisting of a screw or reciprocating compressor with a separate engine driver. These local and regional competitors tend to compete on the basis of price and availability, as opposed to our focus of adding value to the customer. Competition for our medium- and high-horsepower compression services business comes primarily from large companies that may have greater financial resources than we do. Such competitors include Archrock Compression Services, Kodiak Gas Services, USA Compression Partners and Natural Gas Compression Systems, Inc. Competitors for natural gas treating contract services include USA Compression Partners and Kinder Morgan. 
 
 Many of our competitors compete on the basis of price. We believe our pricing has proven to be competitive because of the significant increase in value that results from use of our services, our customer service, trained field personnel, and the quality of the compressor packages we use to provide our services. 
 
 Other Business Matters 
 
 Marketing 
 
 We use various marketing strategies to promote our services and compressor package products. Our account managers work to build close working relationships with our existing and potential future customers, educating them about our services and products by scheduling personal visits, hosting and attending workshops, tradeshows and conferences, and participating in industry organizations. We sponsor and make presentations at industry events that are targeted to production managers, compression specialists and other decision makers. Our marketing representatives also use these marketing opportunities to promote our value-added service initiatives, such as the use of our proprietary telemetry-based system, our wellsite optimization program and our fleet reliability center. 
 
 Human Capital Management 
 
 We collaborate as a team to execute for each other, our customers, and our unitholders. On December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 792 people worldwide. Our U.S. employees and our employees in Canada and Egypt are not subject to collective bargaining agreements. Our employees in Argentina and Mexico are subject to 
 5 

collective bargaining agreements. We believe that the various employers of these employees have good relations with these employees and we have not experienced work stoppages in the past. 
 
 Diversity and Inclusion 
 
 The diversity of our global workforce stimulates creativity and innovation as we use our collective talents to develop unique solutions to address the world's energy challenges. We seek to attract, retain, develop, and reward a high-performing and diverse workforce. 
 
 Career Development 
 
 Our executive team evaluates executive development and succession planning to prepare us for future success. The succession planning process covers all senior management positions and certain other key positions. This review of executive talent determines readiness to take on additional leadership roles and identifies developmental opportunities needed to prepare our executives for greater responsibilities. Our short and long-term business strategy is considered when evaluating candidates and their skills. 
 
 Compensation and Benefits 
 
 Our compensation programs are designed to incentivize performance, maximize returns, and build unitholder value. We work with consultants to benchmark our compensation and benefits programs to help us offer competitive compensation packages to attract and retain high-performing talent. We also offer competitive benefits to attract and retain exceptional talent. 
 
 Safety 
 
 Recognizing that safety, service quality, and environmental protection are conditions of employment, all employees and contractors are responsible for their safety, the safety of those around them, the quality of their work, and protection of the environment. As part of our safety-focused culture, it is customary that each meeting starts with an employee-led safety moment. 
 
 To ensure our work remains safe and of the highest quality, we have a comprehensive HSEQ Management System and program designed to improve the capacity of the organization by controlling worksite risks, developing proper work practices and procedures, and empowering employees with stop-work authority if they observe unsafe conditions, omissions, errors, or actions that could result in safety or environmental incidents, or product and service quality issues. If an incident takes place, we investigate all serious occurrences to root causes and implement corrective actions to ensure we expand our capacity to operate safely. 
 
 Driving is one of the highest exposure activities that we undertake in our day-to-day operations. We maintain a fleet of DOT and non-DOT vehicles and provide positive, real-time behavior feedback to our drivers via real-time monitors. Coupled with vehicle selection guidelines, and driver training, we have a comprehensive approach to reducing our driving exposure and incidents. 
 
 Proprietary Technology and Trademarks 
 
 It is our practice to enter into confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, and third parties to whom we disclose our confidential and proprietary information. There can be no assurance, however, that these measures will prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our trade secrets and expertise or that others may not independently develop similar trade secrets or expertise. Our management believes, however, that it would require a substantial period of time and substantial resources to independently develop similar know-how or technology. 
 
 We sell various services and products under a variety of trademarks and service marks, some of which are registered in the United States. 
 
 Health, Safety, and Environmental Affairs Regulations 
 
 Our service and sales operations are subject to stringent and complex U.S. and foreign health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations, and, although we are committed to conducting all of our operations under the highest standards of safety and respect for the environment, risks of substantial costs and liabilities pursuant to laws and regulations are inherent in certain of our operations. Because of these risks, there can be no assurance that 
 6 

significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred now or in the future. Changes in health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations could subject us to more rigorous standards and could affect demand for our customer s product which in turn would impact demand for our products. We cannot predict the extent to which our operations may be affected by any changes to existing laws, regulations, and enforcement policies, new interpretations of existing laws, regulations, and policies, or any new laws, regulations, or policies promulgated in the future. 
 
 We are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of human health and the environment. The primary environmental laws that impact our operations in the U.S. include: 
 
 the Clean Air Act CAA and comparable state laws and regulations thereunder, which regulate air emissions; 
 the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (the Clean Water Act and comparable state laws, and regulations thereunder, which regulate the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters, including industrial wastewater discharges and storm water runoff; 
 the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act RCRA and comparable state laws and regulations thereunder, which regulate the management and disposal of solid and hazardous waste; and 
 the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act CERCLA or Superfund and comparable state laws, and regulations thereunder, which impose liability for the cleanup of releases of hazardous substances in the environment. 
 
 Our operations in the U.S. are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act OSHA and comparable state laws, and regulations thereunder, which regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. 
 
 The CAA and implementing regulations, and comparable state laws and regulations, regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources and impose various monitoring and reporting requirements, including requirements related to emissions from certain stationary engines, including our compressor packages. These laws and regulations impose limits on the levels of various substances that may be emitted into the atmosphere from our compressor packages and require us to meet stringent air emission standards and install new emission control equipment on all of our engines built after July 1, 2008. In addition, regulations under the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants NESHAP provisions of the CAA require control of hazardous air pollutants from new and existing stationary reciprocal internal combustion engines. Our equipment is also subject to prescribed maintenance practices and catalyst installation may also be required. Furthermore, in June 2016, the Environmental Protection Agency EPA finalized rules that establish new air emission controls under the EPA s New Source Performance Standards NSPS and NESHAP for natural gas and natural gas liquids production, processing and transportation activities. These rules establish specific requirements associated with volatile organic compounds and methane emissions from compressor packages and controllers at natural gas gathering and boosting stations. While the EPA under the Trump Administration finalized rules to rescind or modify certain of these requirements in September 2020, including removing sources in the transmission and storage segment from the source category and rescinding the methane-specific requirements applicable to sources in the production and processing segments of the oil and gas industry, various states and industry and environmental groups are separately challenging the EPA s June 2016 standards and its September 2020 final rule. However, the U.S. Congress passed, and President Biden signed into law, a revocation of the 2020 rulemaking effectively reinstating the 2016 standards. Additionally, in November 2021, the EPA issued a proposed rule that, if finalized, would establish OOOOb new source and OOOOc first-time existing source standards of performance for GHG and volatile organic compound VOC emissions for crude oil and natural gas well sites, natural gas gathering and boosting compressor stations, natural gas processing plants, and transmission and storage facilities. Owners or operators of affected emission units or processes would have to comply with specific standards of performance that may include leak detection using optical gas imaging and subsequent repair requirements, reduction of emissions by 95 through capture and control systems, zero-emission requirements, operations and maintenance requirements, and so-called green well completion requirements. The EPA issued a supplemental proposal enhancing this proposed rulemaking in 2022 and anticipates issuing a final rule in 2023. While we are not currently aware of any material impacts to our operations associated with the current regulatory requirements, additional or more stringent regulations could impose new air permitting or pollution control requirements on our equipment that could require us to incur material costs. Additionally, in 2022 the Inflation Reduction Act IRA 2022 was signed into law, which imposes the first ever federal methane fee on excess methane emissions from sources required to report their GHG emissions to the EPA.

The EPA has determined that greenhouse gases GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because, according to the EPA, they contribute to global warming and climate change. As a result, the EPA has begun to regulate certain sources of GHGs, including air emissions associated with oil and gas production particularly as they relate to the hydraulic fracturing of natural gas wells. In addition, the EPA has issued regulations requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from certain sources including onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities and onshore oil and gas processing, transmission, storage, and distribution facilities. Reporting of GHG emissions from such facilities is required on an annual basis. The EPA s rules relating to emissions of GHGs from large stationary sources of emissions have been the subject of a number of legal challenges. While these rules were the subject of EPA s recent deregulatory agenda under the Trump Administration, the EPA under the Biden Administration is expected to reconsider any relaxation of such rules, and potentially impose more stringent GHG emissions requirements from large stationary sources, as President Biden has issued executive orders that commit to substantial action on climate change and the reduction of GHG emissions, calling for, among other things, the increased use of zero-emissions vehicles by the federal government, the elimination of subsidies provided to the fossil fuel industry, and an increased emphasis on climate-related risk across government agencies and economic sectors. Further, Congress has considered, and almost one-half of the states have adopted, legislation that seeks to control or reduce emissions of GHGs from a wide range of sources. 
 
 The Clean Water Act and implementing regulations, and comparable state laws and regulations, prohibit the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters without a permit and establish limits on the levels of pollutants contained in these discharges. In addition, the Clean Water Act and other comparable laws and regulations regulate storm water discharges associated with industrial activities depending on a facility s primary standard industrial classification. 
 
 RCRA and implementing regulations, and comparable state laws and regulations, address the management and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. These laws and regulations govern the generation, storage, treatment, transfer, and disposal of wastes including, but not limited to, used oil, antifreeze, filters, sludges, paint, solvents and sandblast materials. The EPA and various state agencies have limited the approved methods of disposal for these types of wastes. 
 
 CERCLA and comparable state laws and regulations impose strict, joint, and several liabilities without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of a disposal site where a hazardous substance release occurred and any company that transported, disposed of, or arranged for the transport or disposal of such hazardous substances released at a site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be liable for the costs of remediating the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. 
 
 Although we believe that we have properly disposed of all historical waste streams and that we have no outstanding liability regarding any past waste handling or spill activities, there is always the possibility that future spills and releases of petroleum hydrocarbons, wastes, or other regulated substances into the environment could cause us to become subject to remediation costs and liabilities under CERCLA, RCRA, or other environmental laws. The costs and liabilities associated with the future imposition of remedial obligations could have the potential for a material adverse effect on our operations or financial position. 
 
 We are also subject to the requirements of OSHA and comparable state statutes. These laws and regulations strictly govern the protection of the health and safety of employees. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA, and similar state statutes require that we maintain and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations. 
 
 While we do not believe that compliance with existing requirements under applicable U.S. environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, we cannot guarantee that we will not incur substantial costs now or in the future with respect to compliance with or liability under such laws and regulations. 
 
 Our operations outside the U.S. are subject to foreign governmental laws and regulations relating to health, safety, and the environment and other regulated activities. While we do not believe that compliance with existing foreign environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, we cannot guarantee that we will not incur substantial costs now or in the future with respect to compliance with or liability under such foreign laws and regulations.

 For a more comprehensive discussion on agreements we have entered into with related parties, please see Item 13 - Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 Certain Business Risks 
 
 Although it is not possible to identify all of the risks we encounter, we have identified the following significant risk factors that could affect our actual results and cause actual results to differ materially from any such results that might be projected, forecasted, or estimated by us in this Annual Report. 
 
 We depend on demand for and production of oil and natural gas, and a reduction in this demand or production could adversely affect the demand or the prices we charge for our services, which could cause our revenue and cash available for distribution to our unitholders to decrease. 
 
 Our operations are significantly dependent upon the demand for, and production of, oil and natural gas in the various U.S. and international markets in which we operate. Oil and natural gas production rates are volatile and may be affected by, among other factors, prices for such commodities, market uncertainty, weather and availability of alternative energy sources. 
 
 Oil prices steadily rose during the first half of 2022 because of lower inventory related to Russia s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in late February and higher demand resulting from rising economic activity after pandemic-related restrictions eased. From early June through the remainder of 2022, oil prices decreased as concerns about a possible economic recession and severe COVID-19 containment measures in China reduced global demand. West Texas Intermediate oil prices reached a high of 123.64 per barrel in March 2022 and a low of 71.05 per barrel in December 2022. The West Texas Intermediate price averaged 94.84 per barrel during 2022. Over this same period, U.S. natural gas prices have been volatile, with the Henry Hub price ranging from a high of 9.85 per million British thermal units ("MMBtu") in August 2022 due to a record-high summer power burn, to a low of 3.46 per MMBtu in November 2022 as a result of above-normal temperatures. The natural gas price began to increase again in December because of dropping winter temperatures that increased demand for natural gas for heating. The Henry Hub price averaged 6.45 per MMBtu during 2022, the highest annual average since 2008. As of March 6, 2023, the price of West Texas Intermediate oil was 80.39 per barrel and the Henry Hub price for natural gas was 2.46 per MMBtu. The prolonged volatility of oil and natural gas prices and persisting supply and demand imbalances have impacted the levels of exploration, development, and production activity. If oil and natural gas 
 9 

prices decline significantly, and the supply and demand imbalance persists, there would be a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. Should current market conditions worsen for an extended period of time, we may be required to record additional asset impairments. Such potential impairment charges could have a material adverse impact on our operating results. 
 
 Factors affecting the prices of oil and natural gas include: the levels of supply and demand for oil and natural gas, worldwide; governmental regulations, including the policies of governments regarding the exploration for and production and development of their oil and natural gas reserves; weather conditions, natural disasters, and health or similar issues, such as pandemics or epidemics; worldwide political, military, and economic conditions; the ability or willingness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ("OPEC") and non-OPEC countries, such as Russia, to set and maintain oil production levels; the levels of oil production in the U.S. and by other non-OPEC countries; oil refining capacity and shifts in end-customer preferences toward fuel efficiency and the use of natural gas; the cost of producing and delivering oil and natural gas; and acceleration of the development of, and demand for, alternative energy sources. 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic has had, or may in the future have, certain negative impacts on our business, and such impacts have had, or may in the future have, an adverse effect on our business, our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. 
 
 During the first half of 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic impact had a significant negative impact on the oil and gas industry. The deterioration in demand for oil caused by the pandemic, coupled with oil oversupply had an adverse impact on the demand for our services. Although global demand for oil and natural gas began to rebound in 2021, a worsening of the pandemic, and the resulting actions that may be taken in the future by governments, various regulatory agencies, our customers and our suppliers may in the future have certain negative impacts on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. In addition, the impact of COVID-19 in China continues to impact the global demand for oil and gas. 
 Any of the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including those described above, alone or in combination with others, may have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. Any of these negative impacts, alone or in combination with others, could exacerbate many of the risks discussed elsewhere in these Risk Factors. 
 
 Continuing or worsening inflationary issues and associated changes in monetary policy have resulted in and may result in additional increases in the cost of our goods, services and labor, which in turn may cause our capital expenditures and operating costs to rise. 
 
 The U.S. inflation rate increased in 2021, 2022 and into 2023. These inflationary pressures have resulted in and may result in additional increases to the costs of our goods, services and labor, which in turn [has caused and] may cause our capital expenditures and operating costs to rise. Sustained levels of high inflation have likewise caused the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks to increase interest rates multiple times in 2022. The U.S. Federal Reserve has raised and may continue to raise benchmark interest rates in 2023 in an effort to curb inflationary pressure on the costs of goods and services across the U.S., which could have the effects of raising the cost of capital and depressing economic growth, either of which or the combination thereof could negatively impact the financial and operating results of our business. To the extent elevated inflation remains, we may experience additional cost increases for our operations, including services, labor costs and equipment if our operating activity increases. 
 
 Higher oil and natural gas prices may cause the costs of materials and services to continue to rise. We cannot predict any future trends in the rate of inflation and a significant increase in inflation, to the extent we are unable to recover higher costs through higher prices and revenues, would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We may be unable to repurchase our 7.50 First Lien Notes due 2025 and 10.000 /10.750 Second Lien Notes due 2026 in the event of a change of control as required by their respective indentures. 
 
 Holders of our 7.50 First Lien Notes due 2025 (the First Lien Notes and 10.000 /10.750 Second Lien Notes due 2026 (the Second Lien Notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes at a price equal to 101 of the principal amount, in each case, upon the occurrence of any specified change of control event. 
 
 Any change of control also would constitute a default under our Credit Agreement. Therefore, upon the occurrence of a change of control, the lenders under our Credit Agreement would have the right to accelerate the 
 10 

payment obligations with respect to our Credit Agreement, and if so accelerated, we would be required to pay all of our outstanding obligations under our Credit Agreement. We may not be able to repay or repurchase our First Lien Notes and Second Lien Notes at that time because we may not have available funds to repay the debt or pay the repurchase price as applicable. Any requirement to repay or to offer to purchase any outstanding First Lien Notes and Second Lien Notes may result in us having to refinance our outstanding indebtedness, which we may not be able to do. In addition, even if we were able to refinance our outstanding indebtedness, such financing may be on terms unfavorable to us. A change of control under the indentures governing our First Lien Notes and Second Lien Notes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 Our current capital structure, along with current debt and equity market conditions, may continue to limit our ability to obtain financing to pursue business growth opportunities . 
 
 Conditions in the markets for debt and equity securities in the energy sector have increased the difficulty of obtaining debt and equity financing to grow our business. We expect that the stock market volatility, which started in March 2020 and continued throughout 2021 and into 2022, may make it more difficult to obtain debt and equity financing in the near future. As of December 31, 2022, the market price for our common units was 1.33 per common unit, down from the 2022 high of 1.57 per common unit. The closing price of our common units was 1.45 as of March 9, 2023. The issuance of new common units or debt convertible into common units in the future, could be significantly dilutive to current common unitholders. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 634.9 million aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding, including borrowings under our credit agreements, the First Lien Notes and the Second Lien Notes. Obtaining equity or debt financing in the current market environment is particularly difficult for us, given our current levels of long-term debt. 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, our aggregate capital expenditures totaled 52.1 million , which were primarily growth capital expenditures to increase our compression services equipment fleet. The majority of these capital expenditures were funded from our operating cash. As of December 31, 2022, our total cash balance was 8.5 million. We expect capital expenditures in 2023 to range from 43.0 million to 48.0 million. These capital expenditures include approximately 17.0 million to 19.0 million of maintenance capital expenditures, approximately 23.0 million to 25.0 million of capital expenditures primarily associated with the expansion of our contract services fleet, and 3.0 million to 4.0 million of capital expenditures related to investments in technology and facilities. We will continue to monitor such estimates going forward. We expect that the combination of 8.5 million of cash on hand at the beginning of 2023 and operating cash flows expected to be generated during the year will be sufficient to fund these capital expenditures without having to incur additional long-term debt and without having to access the equity markets. While we do not expect to have to incur additional long-term debt, we may elect to enter into capital lease transactions and/or raise additional equity. However, our ability to grow our business through capital expenditures or acquisitions beyond these sources of financing may be significantly limited or curtailed. Without the ability to increase our compression equipment fleet or otherwise grow our operations, our ability to continue to retain customers whose compression services needs are expanding and to increase distributions to our common unitholders in the future may be limited. 
 
 Our long-term debt levels result in a significant amount of our operating cash flows being used to fund debt service requirements. 
 
 The aggregate carrying value of our First Lien Notes and Second Lien Notes as of December 31, 2022 are 400.3 million and 172.5 million, respectively. In addition, we have an aggregate carrying value of 54.9 million and 6.3 million outstanding on our Spartan Credit Agreement and our CSI Credit Agreement, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. The interest expense related to our long-term indebtedness reduces our cash available to fund capital expenditures or for distribution. Our ability to service our indebtedness in the future will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be impacted by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If our operating results are not sufficient to service our current or future indebtedness, we may be forced to consider taking actions such as reducing or delaying our business activities, acquisitions, investments and/or capital expenditures, delaying any desired increase of distributions, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness, or seeking additional equity capital or bankruptcy protection. We may not be able to take any of these courses of action. 
 
 We may not have sufficient cash from operations following the establishment of cash reserves and payment of debt service and other contractual obligations, fees and expenses, including cost reimbursements to our general partner, to enable us to increase cash distributions to our common unitholders . 
 11 

Beginning with the first quarter of 2019, our common unit distributions decreased from 0.75 per unit per year (or 0.1875 per quarter) to 0.04 per unit per year (or 0.01 per quarter). Our Second Lien Notes indenture further restricts our ability to make distributions in respect of our common units in any amount exceeding 0.04 per common unit per year, unless such increased distribution is funded by proceeds from an equity offering. Under the terms of our partnership agreement, the amount of cash otherwise available for distribution is reduced by our operating expenses and the amount of cash reserves that our general partner establishes to provide for future operations, future capital expenditures, future debt service requirements, and future cash distributions to our common unitholders. In order to make cash distributions at this current distribution rate of 0.01 per common unit per quarter, or 0.04 per common unit per year, we will require available cash of approximately 1.4 million per quarter, or 5.7 million per year, based on the number of common units outstanding as of March 9, 2023. We may not have sufficient available cash each quarter to enable us to increase cash distributions or make any distribution at all. To the extent we issue additional partnership units in connection with our growth, the payment of distributions on those additional partnership units may further increase the risk that we will be unable to increase our per-unit distribution. There are no limitations in our partnership agreement or our Loan and Security Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") on our ability to issue additional common units. The amount of cash we can distribute to our common unitholders principally depends upon the amount of cash we generate from our operations, which fluctuates from quarter to quarter based on, among other things, the market conditions described in these Risk Factors. 
 
 Many of our operating expenses have been volatile and may continue to be volatile or increase in the future. To the extent our efforts to contain these costs are not successful, our generation of operating cash flows to fund or increase our quarterly distributions will be negatively impacted. 
 
 Our long-term debt agreements contain covenants and other provisions that restrict our ability to take certain actions and may limit our ability to grow our business in the future. 
 
 Our Credit Agreement includes a maximum credit commitment of 35.0 million, which is available for loans, letters of credit (with a sublimit of 25.0 million), and swingline loans (with a sublimit of 3.5 million), subject to a borrowing base determined by reference to the value of certain of our accounts receivable and inventory. We are required to maintain a 3.5 million reserve with respect to the borrowing base, which results in reduced liquidity. The maximum credit commitment may be increased by 25.0 million, subject to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to take certain actions including, among other things and subject to certain significant exceptions, incurring debt, granting liens, making investments, entering into or amending existing transactions with affiliates, paying dividends, and selling assets. 
 
 In addition, the indentures governing our First Lien Notes and Second Lien Notes contain customary covenants restricting our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to: (i) pay distributions on, purchase, or redeem our common units, make certain investments and other restricted payments, or purchase or redeem any subordinated debt; (ii) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain kinds of preferred equity securities; (iii) create or incur certain liens securing indebtedness; (iv) sell assets, including dispositions of the collateral securing our First Lien Notes and Second Lien Notes; (v) consolidate, merge, or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; (vi) enter into transactions with affiliates; and (vii) enter into agreements that restrict distributions or other payments from our restricted subsidiaries to us. Our Second Lien Notes indenture further restricts our ability to make distributions in respect of our common units in any amount exceeding 0.04 per common unit per year, unless such increased distribution is funded by proceeds from an equity offering. These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions, including certain provisions permitting us, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to transfer assets to certain of our unrestricted subsidiaries. The indentures also contain customary events of default and acceleration provisions relating to events of default, which provide that upon an event of default under the indentures, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25 in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding First Lien Notes and Second Lien Notes may declare all of the First Lien Notes and Second Lien Notes to be due and payable immediately. 
 
 The loss of any of our most significant customers would result in a decline in our revenue and cash available to pay distributions to our common unitholders . 
 
 Our five most significant customers collectively accounted for approximately 28 of our 2022 revenues. Our services and products are provided to these customers pursuant to short-term contract compression services agreements, many of which are cancellable with 30 days notice. The loss of all or even a portion of the services we 
 12 

provide to these customers, as a result of competition or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. 
 
 The credit and risk profile of Spartan could adversely affect our business and our ability to make distributions to our common unitholders . 
 
 The credit and business risk profile of Spartan could adversely affect our ability to incur indebtedness in the future or obtain a credit rating, as credit rating agencies may consider the leverage and credit profile of Spartan and its affiliates in assigning a rating because of Spartan s control of us, their performance of certain administrative functions for us, and our contractual relationships with them. Furthermore, the trading price of our common units may be adversely affected by financial or operational difficulties or excessive debt levels at Spartan. If the pledge of Spartan ownership of our general partner becomes effective in the future, control over our general partner could be transferred to Spartan s lenders in the event of a default by Spartan. 
 
 Our ability to manage and grow our business effectively and provide quality services to our customers may be adversely affected if our general partner loses its management or is unable to retain trained personnel. 
 
 We rely primarily on the executive officers and other senior management of our general partner and Spartan to manage our operations and make decisions on our behalf. Our ability to provide quality compression services depends to a significant extent upon our general partner s and Spartan s ability to hire, train, and retain an adequate number of trained personnel. The departure of any of our general partner s executive officers or other senior management could have a significant negative effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace. In connection with Spartan s acquisition of our general partner, most of our general partner s executive officers and other senior management resigned their positions, and Spartan appointed new officers in their place. Such significant turnover in management of our general partner could have negative impact on our business. We operate in an industry characterized by highly competitive labor markets, and, similar to many of our competitors, we have experienced high employee turnover in certain regions. It is possible that our labor expenses could increase if there is a shortage in the supply of skilled regional service supervisors and other service professionals. Our general partner may be unable to maintain an adequate skilled labor force necessary for us to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy. Failure to do so could impair our ability to operate efficiently and to retain current customers and attract prospective customers, which could cause our business to suffer materially. Additionally, increases in labor expenses may have an adverse impact on our operating results and may reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our common unitholders. 
 
 Further changes in the economic environment, including any future supply disruptions, could result in further significant impairments of certain of our long-lived assets . 
 
 Beginning in 2020 and continuing into 2021, decreased commodity prices had a negative impact on oil and gas drilling and capital expenditure activity, which affected the demand for a portion of our products and services. In the latter half of 2021 and through 2022, the prices of and demand for oil and natural gas began to recover to prior levels. If prices or demand levels begin to decline again, demand for our products and services may significantly decrease, which could impact the expected utilization rates of our compressor package fleet. 
 
 Although equipment used in providing services to our customers is normally readily available, market conditions could trigger constraints in the supply chain of certain equipment, and replacement parts for such equipment, used in providing services to our customers. If we experience future supply chain disruptions, it could also impact the expected utilization rate of our compressor package fleet. 
 
 Under U.S. GAAP, we review the carrying value of our long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable, based on their expected future cash flows. The impact of reduced expected future cash flow could require the write-down of all or a portion of the carrying value for these assets, which would result in impairments, resulting in decreased earnings. 
 
 We do not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities. 
 
 Our assets and operations are subject to inherent risks such as vehicle accidents, equipment defects, malfunctions and failures, as well as other incidents that result in releases or uncontrolled flows of gas or well fluids, fires, or explosions. These risks could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury, death, property damage, pollution, and other environmental damages. On occasion, we have experienced fires that have damaged or destroyed certain units in our compression services fleet, and additional accidents or fires could occur in the future. We do not insure all of our assets and the insurance we do obtain may be inadequate to cover our liabilities. 
 13 

Further, insurance covering the risks we face or in the amounts we desire may not be available in the future, or, if available, the premiums may not be commercially feasible. If we were to incur substantial liability and such damages were not covered by insurance or were in excess of policy limits, or if we were to incur liability at a time when we did not maintain liability insurance, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, our business interruption insurance does not cover all potential losses. Please read Health, Safety, and Environmental Affairs Regulations for a description of how we are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of human health and environment. 
 
 Our sales to and operations in non-U.S. markets exposes us to additional risks and uncertainties, including with respect to U.S. trade and economic sanctions, export control laws, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
 FCPA ), and similar anti-bribery laws. If we are not in compliance with applicable legal requirements, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and other remedial measures that could have a material impact on our business. 
 
 We have operations in Mexico, Canada, Argentina, Chile and Egypt as well as a number of other non-U.S. markets. A portion of our expected future growth could include expansion in these and other non-U.S. markets. Non-U.S. operations carry special risks. Our operations in the countries in which we currently operate and those countries in which we may operate in the future, could be adversely affected by: 
 government controls and actions, such as expropriation of assets and changes in legal and regulatory environments; 
 import and export license requirements; 
 political, social, or economic instability; 
 trade restrictions; 
 changes in tariffs and taxes; 
 currency exposure; 
 restrictions on repatriating foreign profits back to the United States; and 
 the impact of anti-corruption laws. 
 
 Sanctions imposed by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control OFAC prohibit our operations in or sales to customers in certain non-U.S. markets. We are also subject to the FCPA, which prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from bribing overseas officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment, and other similar laws governing our foreign operations. The FCPA s non-U.S. counterparts, including the UK Bribery Act, contain similar prohibitions, although varying in both scope and jurisdiction. We operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption in the past. 
 
 We have policies and procedures to maintain our compliance with the FCPA, OFAC sanctions, export controls, and similar laws and regulations. The implementation of such policies and procedures may be time consuming and expensive and could result in the discovery of issues or violations with respect to the foregoing by us or our employees, independent contractors, subcontractors, or agents of which we were previously unaware. If we violate any of these regulations, significant administrative, civil, and criminal penalties could be assessed on us. In addition, foreign governments and agencies often establish permit and regulatory standards different from those in the U.S. If we cannot obtain foreign regulatory approvals or cannot obtain them in a timely manner, our growth and profitability from international operations could be adversely affected. 
 
 Security disruptions in regions of Mexico served by us could adversely affect our Mexican operations, and, as a result, the levels of revenue and operating cash flow from our Mexican operations could be reduced . 
 
 In recent years, incidents of security disruptions throughout many regions of Mexico have increased. Drug-related gang activity has grown in Mexico. Certain incidents of violence have occurred in regions in which we operate and have resulted in the interruption of our operations, and these interruptions could increase in the future. To the extent that such security disruptions increase, the levels of revenue and operating cash flow from our Mexican operations could be reduced. 
 
 14 

Our operations in Argentina, Chile and Egypt expose us to the changing economic, legal, and political environment in those countries, including changing regulations governing the repatriation of cash generated from our operations in Argentina. 
 
 The current economic, legal, and political environment in Argentina and the recent devaluations of the Argentinian peso have created increased instability for foreign investment in Argentina. The Argentinian government is currently attempting to address the current high rate of inflation and the continuing currency devaluation pressure. Fiscal and monetary expansion in Argentina has led to devaluations of the Argentinian peso. Additional devaluation may be necessary to help boost the current Argentina economy, and they may be accompanied by fiscal and monetary tightening, including additional restrictions on the transfer of U.S. dollars out of Argentina. On June 30, 2018, we determined the economy in Argentina to be highly inflationary. As a result of this determination and in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), on July 1, 2018, the functional currency of our operations in Argentina was changed from the Argentine peso to the U.S. dollar. The remeasurement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
 
 As a result of our operations in Argentina, consolidated revenues and operating cash flow generated in Argentina have experienced growth over the past five years. The process of repatriating this cash to the U.S. is subject to increasingly complex regulations. There can be no assurances that our growing Argentinian operations will not expose us to the loss of liquidity, foreign exchange losses, and other potential financial impacts. 
 
 The Chilean government is currently attempting to address the current high rate of inflation and the continuing currency devaluation pressure. The government has raised borrowing costs, higher commodity prices are keeping consumer prices under pressure and the central bank has begun to withdraw monetary stimulus by raising the benchmark interest rate. 
 
 Operations in Egypt can be a challenge due to the country s complex regulatory and operating environment. In addition, tight government control of political discourse, increasing poverty and rising costs of living, could increase the risk of social unrest and political instability. The military s role in the economy has continued to expand in recent years, which has dampened private sector business confidence. 
 
 The employees conducting our operations in Mexico and Argentina are party to collective labor agreements, and a prolonged work stoppage of our operations in Mexico or Argentina could adversely impact our revenues, cash flows and net income . 
 
 The personnel conducting our operations in Mexico are currently subject to collective labor agreements. These collective labor agreements consist of evergreen contracts that have no expiration date and whose terms remain in full force and effect from year-to-year, unless the parties agree to negotiate new terms. The employees subject to these evergreen agreements may, however, request a renegotiation of their employee compensation terms on an annual basis or a renegotiation of the entire agreement on a biannual basis, although we are not required to honor any such request. The personnel conducting operations in Argentina are also subject to collective labor agreements. We have not experienced work stoppages in Mexico or Argentina in the past but cannot guarantee that we will not experience work stoppages in the future. A prolonged work stoppage could adversely impact our revenues, cash flows, and net income. Mexico s Federal Labor Law was reformed effective August 1, 2021, in relation to labor subcontracting which resulted in an increase in Statutory Profit Sharing (PTU). 
 
 A terrorist attack, armed conflict or political or civil unrest could harm our business. 
 
 Terrorist activities, anti terrorist efforts, war and other armed conflicts and political or civil unrest could adversely affect the U.S. and global economies and could prevent us from meeting financial and other obligations. We could experience loss of business, delays or defaults in payments from payors or disruptions of fuel supplies and markets if pipelines, production facilities, processing plants, refineries or transportation facilities are direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terror or war. Such activities could reduce the overall demand for oil and natural gas, which, in turn, could also reduce the demand for our services. War and other armed conflicts, including conflict related to Russia s invasion of Ukraine, and any resulting economic downturn could adversely affect our results of operations, impair our ability to raise capital or otherwise adversely impact our ability to realize certain business strategies. In addition, sanctions imposed on foreign countries by the U.S. or other foreign governments could adversely affect our results of operations, impair our ability to raise capital or otherwise adversely impact our ability to realize certain business strategies. 
 15 

Our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations may result in fluctuations in our cash flows and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations . 
 
 Because we have operations in Mexico, Canada, Argentina, Chile and Egypt, and in certain other non-U.S. jurisdictions, a portion of our business is conducted in foreign currencies. As a result, we are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. If a foreign currency weakened significantly, we would be required to convert more of that foreign currency to U.S. dollars to satisfy our obligations, which would cause us to have less cash available for distribution. A significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar could result in an increase in our financing expenses and could materially affect our financial results under U.S. GAAP. Because we report our operating results in U.S. dollars, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar also result in fluctuations in our reported revenues and earnings. Most of our billings under the contracts with PEMEX and other clients in Mexico are in U.S. dollars; however, a large portion of our expenses and costs under those contracts are incurred in Mexican pesos. In addition, future contract awards with PEMEX may require us to bill a larger portion of our revenues in Mexican pesos, which would expose us to additional foreign currency exchange rate risks. 
 
 As a result of the above, we are exposed to fluctuations in the values of the Mexican peso, Argentinian peso, Chilean peso, and the Egyptian pound against the U.S. dollar. A material increase in the values of these foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would adversely affect our cash flows and net income. On June 30, 2018, we determined the economy in Argentina to be highly inflationary. As a result of this determination and in accordance with U.S. GAAP, on July 1, 2018, the functional currency of our operations in Argentina was changed from the Argentine peso to the U.S. dollar. In addition, for our operations in Canada, where the Canadian dollar is the functional currency under U.S. GAAP, all U.S. dollar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities, such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, restricted cash, accounts payable, long-term debt and capital lease obligations, are revalued and reported based on the prevailing exchange rate at the end of the reporting period. This revaluation may cause us to report significant foreign currency exchange gains and losses in certain periods. 
 
 Environmental and Technology Risks 
 
 We are subject to environmental regulations, and changes in these regulations could increase our costs or liabilities . 
 
 We are subject to federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulatory standards, including laws and regulations regarding the discharge of materials into the environment, emission controls, and other environmental protection and occupational health and safety concerns. Environmental laws and regulations may, in certain circumstances, impose strict and joint and several liability for environmental contamination, rendering us liable for remediation costs, natural resource damages, and other damages resulting from our ownership of property or conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior owners or operators or other third parties. In addition, where contamination may be present, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury, property damage, and recovery of response costs. Remediation costs and other damages arising as a result of environmental laws and regulations, and costs associated with new information, changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations could be substantial and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, failure to comply with these environmental laws and regulations may result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, and the issuance of injunctions delaying or prohibiting operations. 
 
 We routinely deal with natural gas, oil, and other petroleum products. Hydrocarbons or other hazardous wastes may have been released during our operations or by third parties on wellhead sites where we provide services or store our equipment or on or under other locations where wastes have been taken for disposal. These properties may be subject to investigatory, remediation, and monitoring requirements under foreign, federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. 
 
 The modification or interpretation of existing environmental laws or regulations, the more vigorous enforcement of existing environmental laws or regulations, or the adoption of new environmental laws or regulations may also adversely affect oil and natural gas exploration and production, which in turn could have an adverse effect on us. 
 16 

Climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of GHGs could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas our customers produce, while the physical effects of climate change could disrupt production and cause us to incur costs in preparing for or responding to those effects . 
 
 The EPA has adopted regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA. Such EPA rules regulate GHG emissions under the CAA and require a reduction in emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles and from certain large stationary sources. For example, the EPA published final rules in June 2016 that require the reduction of volatile organic compounds and methane emissions from certain hydraulically fractured natural gas wells and further require that most wells use so-called green completions at certain hydraulically fractured natural gas wells. These regulations also established new requirements regarding emissions from production-related wet seal and reciprocating compressors, and from pneumatic controllers and storage vessels. Certain of our compressor packages are subject to these requirements and additional control equipment and maintenance operations are required. While the EPA under the Trump Administration finalized rules to rescind or modify certain of these requirements in September 2020, including rescission of the methane-specific requirements applicable to sources in the production and processing segments of the oil and gas industry, various states and industry and environmental groups are separately challenging the EPA s 2016 standards and its September 2020 final rule. However, the U.S. Congress passed, and President Biden signed into law, a revocation of the 2020 rulemaking effectively reinstating the 2016 standards. Additionally, in November 2021, the EPA issued a proposed rule that, if finalized, would establish OOOOb new source and OOOOc first-time existing source standards of performance for GHG and volatile organic compound VOC emissions for the crude oil and natural gas well sites, natural gas gathering and boosting compressor stations, natural gas processing plants, and transmission and storage facilities. Owners or operators of affected emission units or processes would have to comply with specific standards of performance that may include leak detection using optical gas imaging and subsequent repair requirements, reduction of emissions by 95 through capture and control systems, zero-emission requirements, operations and maintenance requirements, and so-called green well completion requirements. The EPA issued a supplemental proposal enhancing this proposed rulemaking in 2022, which, among other items, sets forth specific revisions strengthening the first nationwide emissions guidelines for states to limit methane emissions from existing oil and natural gas facilities. The proposal also revises requirements for fugitive emissions monitoring and repair as well as equipment leaks and the frequency of monitoring surveys, establishes a super-emitter response program to timely mitigate emissions events, and provides additional options for the use of advanced monitoring to encourage the deployment of innovative technologies to detect and reduce methane emissions. The proposal is currently subject to public comment and is expected to be finalized in 2023; however, it is likely that these requirements will be subject to legal challenges. While we do not believe that compliance with current regulatory requirements will have a material adverse effect on our business, additional or more stringent regulations could impose new air permitting or pollution control requirements on our equipment that could require us to incur material costs. In addition, the EPA requires the annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources in the U.S., including petroleum refineries, as well as from certain oil and gas production facilities. 
 
 In addition, in December 2015, over 190 countries, including the U.S., reached an agreement to reduce global GHG emissions (the Paris Agreement ). The Paris Agreement entered into force in November 2016 after more than 170 nations, including the U.S., ratified or otherwise indicated their intent to be bound by the Paris Agreement. Although the U.S. withdrew from the Paris Agreement in November 2020, President Biden recommitted the United States in February 2021, and, in April 2021, announced a new, more rigorous nationally determined emissions reduction level of 50-52 reduction from 2005 levels in economy-wide net GHG emissions by 2030. The international community gathered in Glasgow in November 2021 at the 26th Conference to the Parties COP26 during which multiple announcements were made, including a call for parties to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies, amongst other measures. Relatedly, the United States and European Union jointly announced at COP26 the launch of the Global Methane Pledge, an initiative committing to a collective goal of reducing global methane emissions by at least 30 from 2020 levels by 2030, including all feasible reductions in the energy sector. These goals were reaffirmed at COP27 in November 2022, and countries were called upon to accelerate efforts to phase out inefficient fuel subsidies, though no firm commitments or timelines were made. The full impact of these actions is uncertain at this time, and it is unclear what additional initiatives may be adopted or implemented that may have adverse effects on us and our customers operations. 
 
 There are also increasing financial risks for fossil fuel producers as stockholders currently invested in fossil-fuel energy companies may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into non-fossil fuel related sectors. Institutional lenders who provide financing to fossil fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainable lending practices and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. For example, at COP26, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero GFANZ announced that commitments from over 450 firms across 45 countries had resulted in over 130 trillion in capital committed to net zero goals. The various sub-alliances of GFANZ generally require participants to set short-term, sector-specific 
 17 

targets to transition their financing, investing, and/or underwriting activities to net zero emissions by 2050. There is also a risk that financial institutions will be required to adopt policies that have the effect of reducing the funding provided to the fossil fuel sector. In late 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that it had joined Network for Greening the Financial System NGFS ), a consortium of financial regulators focused on addressing climate-related risks in the financial sector. Subsequently, in November 2021, the Federal Reserve issued a statement in support of the efforts of the NGFS to identify key issues and potential solutions for the climate-related challenges most relevant to central banks and supervisory authorities. The Federal Reserve has since announced that six of the largest banks in the United States will take part in a pilot climate scenario analysis, which is expected to conclude at the end of 2023. Although we cannot predict the effect of these actions, such limitation of investments in and financing for fossil fuel energy companies could adversely impact our customers and, therefore, our operations. Additionally, the SEC published a proposed rule that would require climate disclosures from registrants, include data on Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions and, in some cases, Scope 3. Although the final form and substance of these requirements is not yet known, this may result in additional costs to comply with any such disclosure requirements. Additionally, we cannot predict how financial institutions and investors might consider information disclosed under any final rule, and it is possible that as a result we could face increases with respect to the costs of, or restrictions imposed on, our access to capital. 
 
 President Biden has also issued executive orders that commit to substantial action on climate change, calling for, among other things, the increased use of zero-emissions vehicles by the federal government, the elimination of subsidies provided to the fossil fuel industry, and an increased emphasis on climate-related risk across government agencies and economic sectors. The adoption and implementation of any regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our facilities and operations could require us to incur costs. Further, Congress has considered and almost one-half of the states have adopted legislation that seeks to control or reduce emissions of GHGs from a wide range of sources, and has passed laws such as the IRA 2022 that advance numerous climate-related activities. Any such legislation could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas our customers produce and, in turn, demand for our products and services. Litigation risks are also increasing as a number of parties have sought to bring suit against certain oil and natural gas companies in state or federal court, alleging among other things, that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to climate change or alleging that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time, but defrauded their investors or customers by failing to adequately disclose those impacts. 
 
 Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as the increased frequency or intensity of extreme weather events or changes in meteorological and hydrological patterns, that could adversely impact our operations. Such physical risks may result in damage to our customers facilities and otherwise adversely impact their operations, such as if they become subject to water use curtailments in response to drought, or demand for their products, such as to the extent warmer winters reduce the demand for energy for heating purposes. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our operations and cause us to incur costs in preparing for or responding to those effects. 
 
 Regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing in the countries where we and our customers operate could result in operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells that may reduce demand for our services. 
 
 Although we do not directly engage in hydraulic fracturing, our operations support many of our exploration and production customers in such activities. The practice continues to be controversial in certain parts of the country, resulting in increased scrutiny and regulation of the hydraulic fracturing process, including by federal and state agencies and local municipalitie s. 
 
 Hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and gas commissions or similar state agencies, but several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA asserted regulatory authority pursuant to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, Underground Injection Control program over hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel and issued guidance covering such activities; published final rules under the CAA in 2012 and published additional final regulations in June 2016 governing methane and volatile organic compound performance standards, including standards for the capture of air emissions released by the oil and natural gas hydraulic fracturing industry; published in June 2016 an effluent limitations guidelines final rule prohibiting the discharge of waste water from shale natural-gas extraction operations to a treatment plant; and in 2014 published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. Also, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management ("BLM") published a final rule in 2016 that established new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. BLM under the Trump Administration 
 18 

issued a final rule in late 2018 rescinding the 2016 action; however, a California federal court vacated the 2018 final rule in July 2020, and a Wyoming federal court subsequently vacated the 2016 final rule in October 2020. Accordingly, the 2016 final rule is no longer in effect, but the Wyoming decision is expected to be appealed. Moreover, the Biden Administration is expected to pursue regulatory initiatives that regulate hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands as well as other actions to more stringently regulate certain aspects of oil and gas development such as air emissions and water discharges. In 2021, the Biden Administration took multiple actions to pause new oil and gas leases and drilling permits on non-Indian federal lands and waters for a period of 60 days. In addition, President Biden issued an executive order on January 27, 2021, that suspends new leasing activities for oil and gas exploration and production on non-Indian federal lands and offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices that take into consideration potential climate and other impacts associated with oil and gas activities on such lands and waters. The suspension of these federal leasing activities prompted legal action by several states against the Biden Administration resulting in the issuance of a nationwide permanent injunction by a federal district judge in Louisiana effectively halting implementation of the leasing suspension. Relatedly, the Department of the Interior released its report on federal gas leasing and permitting practices in November 2021, referencing a number of recommendations and an overarching intent to modernize the federal oil and gas leasing program, including by adjusting royalty and bonding rates, prioritizing leasing in areas with known resource potential, and avoiding leasing that conflicts with recreation, wildlife habitat, conservation, and historical and cultural resources. Additionally, the Bureau of Land Management proposed a rule in November 2022 that would limit flaring from well sites on federal lands, as well as allow the delay or denial of permits if the Bureau finds that an operator s methane waste minimization plan is insufficient. Implementation of many of the recommendations in the report will require Congressional action and provisions of the reforms have been subject to litigation. We cannot predict the extent to which the recommendations may be implemented now or in the future, but restrictions on federal oil and gas activities have the potential to result in increased costs on our customers, decreased demand for our services on federal lands, and an adverse impact on our business. 
 
 The U.S. Congress Congress has from time to time considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. At the state level, some states, including Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico have adopted, and other states are considering adopting legal requirements that could impose new or more stringent permitting, public disclosure, or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. States could elect to prohibit high volume hydraulic fracturing altogether, following the approach taken by the State of New York in 2015. Local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. If new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted, our customers could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells. 
 
 Increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs for our customers in the production of oil and gas, including from the developing shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of additional regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and an associated decrease in demand for our services and increased compliance costs and time, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. 
 
 Increased attention to Environmental, Social, and Governance ESG matters and conservation measures may adversely impact our business. 
 
 Increasing attention to, and societal expectations on companies to address, climate change and other environmental and social impacts, investor and societal expectations regarding voluntary ESG disclosures, and consumer demand for alternative forms of energy may result in increased costs, reduced demand for fossil fuels and, consequently, demand for our services, reduced profits, increased risk of investigation and litigation, and negative impacts on the value of our services and access to capital. Increasing attention to climate change and environmental conservation, for example, may result in demand shifts for oil and natural gas products and additional governmental investigations and private litigation against our customers or us. To the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to our causation or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors. While we may in the future participate in various voluntary frameworks and certification programs to improve the ESG profile of our operations 
 19 

and services, we cannot guarantee that such participation or certification will have the intended results on our ESG profile. 
 
 Moreover, while we may create and publish voluntary disclosures regarding ESG matters from time to time, many of the statements in those voluntary disclosures will be based on hypothetical expectations and assumptions that may or may not be representative of current or actual risks or events or forecasts of expected risks or events, including the costs associated therewith. Such expectations and assumptions are necessarily uncertain and may be prone to error or subject to misinterpretation given the long timelines involved and the lack of an established single approach to identifying, measuring, and reporting on many ESG matters. Additionally, while we may also announce various voluntary ESG targets in the future, such targets are aspirational. We may not be able to meet such targets in the manner or on such a timeline as initially contemplated, including, but not limited to as a result of unforeseen costs or technical difficulties associated with achieving such results. To the extent that we do meet such targets, it may be achieved through various contractual arrangements, including the purchase of various credits or offsets that may be deemed to mitigate our ESG impact instead of actual changes in our ESG performance. Also, despite these aspirational goals, we may receive pressure from investors, lenders, or other groups to adopt more aggressive climate or other ESG-related goals, but we cannot guarantee that we will be able to implement such goals because of potential costs or technical or operational obstacles. 
 
 In addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Unfavorable ESG ratings and recent activism directed at shifting funding away from companies with energy-related assets could lead to increased negative investor sentiment toward us and our industry and to the diversion of investment to other industries, which could have a negative impact on our access to and costs of capital. Additionally, to the extent ESG matters negatively impact our reputation, we may not be able to compete as effectively to recruit or retain employees, which may adversely affect our operations. Such ESG matters may also impact our customers, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
 
 The Inflation Reduction Act of 2021 could accelerate the transition to a low carbon economy and could impose new costs on our customers operations. 
 
 In August 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2021 (the IRA 2022 into law. The IRA 2022 contains hundreds of billions in incentives for the development of renewable energy, clean hydrogen, clean fuels, electric vehicles and supporting infrastructure and carbon capture and sequestration, among other provisions. In addition, the IRA 2022 imposes the first ever federal fee on the emission of greenhouses gases through a methane emissions charge. The IRA 2022 amends the federal CAA to impose a fee on the emission of methane from sources required to report their GHG emissions to the EPA, including those sources in the onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering and boosting source categories. The methane emissions charge would start in calendar year 2024 at 900.00 per ton of methane, increase to 1,200.00 in 2025, and be set at 1,500.00 for 2026 and each year after. Calculation of the fee is based on certain thresholds established in the IRA 2022. The methane charge imposed on our oil and gas customers could further accelerate the transition of the economy away from the use of fossil fuels towards lower- or zero-carbon emissions alternatives. This could decrease demand for oil and gas and consequently adversely affect the business of our customers, thereby reducing demand for our services. 
 
 Our operations and reputation may be impaired if certain information technology systems fail to perform adequately or if we are the subject of a data breach or cyberattack. 
 
 Our information technology systems (including the information technology systems of TETRA, provided through January 31, 2022 under the Transition Services Agreement), are critically important to operating our business efficiently. We rely on these information technology systems to manage business data, communications, supply chain, customer invoicing, employee information, and other business processes. We outsource certain business process functions to third-party providers and we rely on these third-parties to maintain and store confidential information on their systems. The failure of these information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers, causing our business and results of operations to suffer. 
 
 Although we allocate significant resources to protect these information technology systems, we have experienced within the past year varying degrees of cyber-incidents in the normal conduct of our business, including viruses, worms, other destructive software, process breakdowns, phishing and other malicious activities. On January 6, 2020, the Department of Homeland Security issued a public warning that indicated companies in the 
 20 

energy industry might be specific targets of cybersecurity threats. Such breaches have in the past and could again in the future result in unauthorized access to information including customer, supplier, employee, or other company confidential data. We are investing in security technology and designing business processes to attempt to mitigate the risk of such breaches. While we believe these measures are generally effective, there can be no assurance that security breaches will not occur. Moreover, the development and maintenance of these measures requires continuous monitoring as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures evolve. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience, cybersecurity threats and incidents, none of which has been material to us to date. However, a successful breach or attack could have a material negative impact on our operations or business reputation and subject us to consequences such as litigation and direct costs associated with incident response. 
 
 Risks Inherent in an Investment in Us 
 
 The market price of our common units has been and may continue to be volatile. 
 
 The market price of our common units has fluctuated in the past and is subject to significant fluctuations in response to many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following: 
 
 our operational performance; 
 supply, demand, and prices of oil and natural gas; 
 the activity levels of our customers; 
 deviations in our earnings from publicly disclosed forward-looking guidance or analysts projections; 
 recommendations by research analysts that cover us and other companies in our industry; 
 risks related to acquisitions and our growth strategy; 
 uncertainty about current global economic conditions; and 
 other general economic conditions. 
 
 During 2022, the market price for our common units ranged from a high of 1.57 per common unit to a low of 1.12 per common unit. In recent years, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price for many companies in industries similar to ours. Some of these fluctuations have been unrelated to operating performance and are attributable, in part, to outside factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the world economy. The volatility of our common units may make it difficult for investors to resell our common units at attractive prices. 
 
 If we cannot meet the continued listing requirements of the NASDAQ Exchange (the NASDAQ ), the NASDAQ may delist our common units. 
 
 The Partnership has been notified by the NASDAQ in the past from time to time that the closing price of the Partnership s common units over the prior 30 consecutive trading day period was below 1.00 per unit, which is the minimum closing price per unit required to maintain listing on the NASDAQ under Rule 5450 Rule 5450 ). While the Partnership is currently in compliance with Rule 5450, there can be no assurance that the Partnership will maintain compliance with such rule or the NASDAQ s other listing rules in the future. On March 9, 2023, the trading price of our common units closed at 1.45 per unit. 
 
 Upon receipt of notice of noncompliance from NASDAQ, the Partnership has a period of six months to regain compliance with Rule 5450, during which time our common units continue to be listed and traded on the NASDAQ, subject to our compliance with other continued listing standards. If we fail to regain compliance with Rule 5450 by the end of the cure period, the common units will be subject to the NASDAQ s suspension and delisting procedures. If necessary, to regain compliance with NASDAQ listing standards, we may, subject to approval of the board of directors of our general partner, implement a reverse split of our common units. A delisting of our common units from the NASDAQ could negatively impact us by, among other things, reducing the liquidity and market price of our common units, reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common units, limiting our ability to issue securities or obtain financing in the future, and limiting our ability to use a registration statement to offer and sell freely tradable securities, thereby restricting our ability to access the public capital markets. 
 
 Our partnership agreement requires us to distribute all of the available cash that we generate each quarter after paying expenses and establishing prudent operating reserves, which could limit our ability to grow. 
 
 Our partnership agreement requires us to distribute all of the available cash we generate each quarter. Under the terms of our partnership agreement, the amount of cash otherwise available for distribution will be 
 21 

reduced by our operating expenses and the amount of cash reserves that our general partner establishes to provide for future operations, future capital expenditures, future debt service requirements and future cash distributions to our common unitholders. As a result, our general partner relies primarily upon external financing sources, including existing debt arrangements and the issuance of additional debt and equity securities, as well as cash flows from operations to a certain extent, to fund our expansion capital expenditures. To the extent that we are unable to finance growth externally, this requirement significantly impairs our ability to grow. In addition, also as a result of this requirement, our growth may not be as fast as that of businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations. To the extent that we issue additional units in connection with any expansion of capital expenditures, the payment of distributions on those additional units may decrease the amount we distribute on each outstanding unit. Our Second Lien Notes indenture further restricts our ability to make distributions in respect of our common units in any amount exceeding 0.04 per common unit per year, unless such increased distribution is funded by proceeds from an equity offering. See also We may not have sufficient cash from operations following the establishment of cash reserves and payment of debt service and other contractual obligations, fees and expenses, including cost reimbursements to our general partner, to enable us to increase cash distributions to our common unitholders. 
 
 Spartan controls our general partner, which has sole responsibility for conducting our business and managing our operations, and thereby controls us. Spartan has conflicts of interest, which may permit it to favor its own interests to our unitholders detriment. 
 
 Spartan controls our general partner, and through the general partner controls us. Some of our general partner s directors are directors or officers of Spartan or its affiliates that own our general partner. Therefore, conflicts of interest may arise between Spartan and its affiliates, including our general partner, on the one hand, and us and our common unitholders, on the other hand. In resolving these conflicts of interest, our general partner may favor its own interests and the interests of Spartan and its affiliates over the interests of our common unitholders. These conflicts include, among others, the following situations: 
 
 neither our partnership agreement nor any other agreement requires Spartan to pursue a business strategy that favors us. The directors and officers of Spartan and its affiliates have a fiduciary duty to make these decisions in the best interests of Spartan, which may be contrary to our interests; 
 our general partner controls the interpretation and enforcement of contractual obligations between us and our affiliates, on the one hand, and Spartan, on the other hand, including provisions governing administrative services, acquisitions, and non-competition provisions; 
 our general partner is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than us, including Spartan and its affiliates, in resolving conflicts of interest; 
 our general partner has limited its liability and reduced its fiduciary duties to our common unitholders and us, and has also restricted the remedies available to our common unitholders for actions that, without the limitations, might constitute breaches of fiduciary duty; 
 our general partner will determine the amount and timing of asset purchases and sales, capital expenditures, borrowings, repayment of indebtedness, and issuances of additional partnership interests, each of which can affect the amount of cash that is available for distribution to our common unitholders; 
 our general partner determines the amount and timing of any capital expenditures which can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to our common unitholders; 
 our general partner may cause us to borrow funds in order to permit the payment of cash distributions; 
 our general partner determines which costs incurred by it and its affiliates are reimbursable by us and Spartan will determine the allocation of shared overhead expenses; 
 our partnership agreement does not restrict our general partner from causing us to pay it or its affiliates for any services rendered to us or entering into additional contractual arrangements with any of these entities on our behalf; 
 our general partner intends to limit its liability regarding our contractual and other obligations and, in some circumstances, is entitled to be indemnified by us; 
 our general partner decides whether to retain separate counsel, accountants, or others to perform services for us; and 
 our general partner determines the amount and timing of distributions to our unitholders. 
 
 22 

Our partnership agreement limits our general partner s fiduciary duties to our common unitholders and restricts the remedies available to our common unitholders for actions taken by our general partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty. 
 
 Our partnership agreement contains provisions that reduce the fiduciary standards to which our general partner would otherwise be held by state fiduciary duty laws. For example, our partnership agreement: 
 permits our general partner to make a number of decisions in its individual capacity, as opposed to in its capacity as our general partner. This entitles our general partner to consider only the interests and factors that it desires, and it has no duty or obligation to consider any interest of, or factors affecting, us, our affiliates or any limited partner. Examples include the exercise of its limited call right, the exercise of its rights to transfer or vote the partnership units it owns, the exercise of its registration rights and its determination whether or not to consent to any merger or consolidation of the partnership or amendment to the partnership agreement; 
 provides that our general partner will not have any liability to us or our common unitholders for decisions made in its capacity as a general partner so long as it acted in good faith, meaning it believed the decision was in the best interests of our partnership; 
 generally provides that affiliated transactions and resolutions of conflicts of interest not approved by the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our general partner acting in good faith and not involving a vote of our common unitholders must be on terms no less favorable to us than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties or must be fair and reasonable to us, as determined by our general partner in good faith and that, in determining whether a transaction or resolution is fair and reasonable, our general partner may consider the totality of the relationships between the parties involved, including other transactions that may be particularly advantageous or beneficial to us; 
 provides that our general partner and its executive officers and directors will not be liable for monetary damages to us, our limited partners or assignees for any acts or omissions unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that our general partner or those other persons acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct or, in the case of a criminal matter, acted with knowledge that the conduct was criminal; and 
 provides that in resolving conflicts of interest, it will be presumed that in making its decision our general partner acted in good faith, and in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of any limited partner or us, the person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden of overcoming such presumption. 
 
 Our common unitholders have limited voting rights and are not entitled to elect our general partner or its directors. 
 
 Unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation, our unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business and, therefore, limited ability to influence management s decisions regarding our business. Unitholders will have no right to elect our general partner or its board of directors. The board of directors of our general partner will be chosen indirectly by Spartan through its subsidiary that is the sole shareholder of our general partner. Furthermore, if our unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our general partner, they will have little ability to remove our general partner. The vote of the holders of at least 66.7 of all outstanding common units is required to remove our general partner. As of March 9, 2023, our general partner and its affiliates own 44.9 of our aggregate outstanding common units. Due to these limitations, the price at which the common units will trade could be diminished because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price. 
 
 We can issue an unlimited number of partnership units in the future, including units that are senior in right of distributions, liquidation and voting to the common units, without the approval of our common unitholders and without the approval of the conflicts committee of our general partner, which would dilute our common unitholders existing ownership interests. 
 
 Our partnership agreement does not limit the number of additional partnership units that we may issue at any time without the approval of our common unitholders. In addition, we may issue an unlimited number of partnership units that are senior to the common units in right of distribution, liquidation, or voting. 
 
 The issuance by us of additional common units or other equity securities of equal or senior rank will have the following effects: 
 our previously existing common unitholders proportionate ownership interests in us will decrease; 
 the amount of cash available for distribution on each common unit may decrease; 
 23 

the ratio of taxable income to distributions may increase; 
 the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding common unitholders may be diminished; and 
 the market price of the common units may decline. 
 
 Control of our general partner has been and may be transferred to a third party without common unitholder consent. 
 
 On January 29, 2021, control of our general partner was transferred from TETRA to Spartan. Our general partner may transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of our unitholders. Furthermore, our partnership agreement does not restrict the ability of Spartan or its subsidiaries from transferring all or a portion of its indirect ownership interest in our general partner to a third party. The new owners of our general partner would then be in a position to replace the board of directors and executive officers of our general partner with its own choices and thereby influence the decisions taken by the board of directors and executive officers. 
 
 Our partnership agreement restricts the voting rights of unitholders owning 20 or more of our common units, other than our general partner and its affiliates, including Spartan. Accordingly, such unitholders voting rights may be limited. 
 
 Unitholders voting rights are further restricted by the partnership agreement provision providing that any partnership units held by a person that owns 20 or more of any class of partnership units then outstanding, other than our general partner, its affiliates, including Spartan, its transferees and persons who acquired such partnership units with the prior approval of the board of directors of our general partner, cannot vote on any matter. Our partnership agreement also contains provisions limiting the ability of our common unitholders to call meetings or to acquire information about our operations, as well as other provisions. 
 
 Our general partner has a limited call right that may require our unitholders to sell common units at an undesirable time or price. 
 
 If at any time our general partner and its affiliates own more than 90 of the common units, our general partner will have the right, but not the obligation, which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to us, to acquire all, but not less than all, of the common units held by unaffiliated persons at a price not less than the then-current market price. As a result, our unitholders may be required to sell common units at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return on their investment. Our unitholders may also incur a tax liability upon a sale of common units. As of March 9, 2023, our general partner and its affiliates own an aggregate of 44.9 of our common units. 
 
 Our common unitholders liability may not be limited if a court finds that common unitholder action constitutes control of our business. 
 
 A general partner of a partnership generally has unlimited liability for the obligations of the partnership, except for those contractual obligations of the partnership that are expressly made without recourse to our general partner. Our partnership is organized under Delaware law, and we conduct business in a number of other states. The limitations on the liability of holders of limited partner interests for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established in some of the other states in which we do business. Our common unitholders could be liable for any and all of our obligations as if they were a general partner if: 
 a court or government agency determined that we were conducting business in a state but had not complied with that particular state s partnership statute; or 
 our common unitholders right to act with other unitholders to remove or replace our general partner, to approve some amendments to our partnership agreement, or to take other actions under our partnership agreement constitutes control of our business. 
 
 Our common unitholders may have liability to repay distributions that were wrongfully distributed to them. 
 
 Under certain circumstances, our common unitholders may have to repay amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to them. Under Section 17-607 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, we may not make a distribution to our common unitholders if the distribution would cause our liabilities to exceed the fair value of our assets. Delaware law provides that for a period of three years from the date of the impermissible distribution, limited partners who received the distribution and who knew at the time of the distribution that it violated Delaware law will be liable to the limited partnership for the distribution amount. Substituted limited partners are liable for the 
 24 

obligations of the assignor to make contributions to the partnership that are known to the substituted limited partner at the time it became a limited partner and for unknown obligations if the liabilities could be determined from the partnership agreement. Liabilities to partners because of their partnership interest and liabilities that are non-recourse to the partnership are not counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is permitted. 
 
 While our partnership agreement requires us to distribute all of our available cash, our partnership agreement, including provisions requiring us to make cash distributions contained therein, may be amended. 
 
 While our partnership agreement requires us to distribute all of our available cash, our partnership agreement, including provisions requiring us to make cash distributions contained therein, may be amended. Our partnership agreement can be amended with the consent of our general partner and the approval of a majority of the outstanding common units (including common units held by affiliates of Spartan). As of March 9, 2023, our general partner and its affiliates own an aggregate of 44.9 of our common units. 

We are exempt from certain corporate governance requirements that provide additional protection to stockholders of other public companies. 
 
 Companies listed on the NASDAQ are required to meet the high standards of corporate governance, as set forth in the NASDAQ Listing Rules. These requirements generally do not apply to limited partnerships or to a controlled company, within the meaning of the NASDAQ rules. We are a limited partnership and a controlled company, within the meaning of the NASDAQ rules, and, as a result, we rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that provide protection to stockholders of other public companies. 
 
 Tax Risks to Common Unitholders 
 
 Our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the IRS were to treat us as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then our cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced. 
 
 The anticipated after-tax economic benefit of an investment in our common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Despite the fact that we are a limited partnership under Delaware law, we will be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless we satisfy a "qualifying income" requirement. Based upon our current operations and current Treasury Regulations, we believe that we satisfy the qualifying income requirement. However, no ruling has been or will be requested regarding our treatment as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Failing to meet the qualifying income requirement or a change in current law could cause us to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to taxation as an entity. 
 
 If we were treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would pay U.S. federal income tax on all of our taxable income at the corporate tax rate and would likely pay additional state and local income tax at varying rates. Distributions to our unitholders would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions, and no income, gains, losses, deductions or credits would flow through to our unitholders. Because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced. Therefore, treatment of us as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to our unitholders, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our common units. 
 
 We have subsidiaries that are treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes and are subject to corporate-level income taxes. 
 
 We conduct a portion of our operations through subsidiaries that are organized as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We may elect to conduct additional operations through these corporate subsidiaries in the future. These corporate subsidiaries are subject to U.S. corporate-level tax, which reduces the cash available for distribution to us and, in turn, to our unitholders. If the IRS were to successfully assert that these corporations have more tax liability than we anticipate or legislation were enacted that increases the corporate tax rate, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be further reduced. Distributions from any such corporate subsidiary will generally be treated as dividend income to the extent of the current and accumulated earnings and profits of such corporate subsidiary. An individual unitholder's share of dividend income from any 
 25 

corporate subsidiary would constitute portfolio income that could not be offset by the unitholder's share of our other losses or deductions. 
 
 The tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or an investment in our common units could be subject to potential legislative, judicial, or administrative changes and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis. 
 
 The present U.S. federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, including us, or an investment in our common units may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial changes or differing interpretations at any time. From time to time, members of the U.S. Congress have proposed and considered substantive changes to the existing U.S. federal income tax laws that would affect publicly traded partnerships, including proposals that would eliminate our ability to qualify for partnership tax treatment. Recent proposals have provided for the expansion of the qualifying income exception for publicly traded partnerships in certain circumstances, and other proposals have provided for the total elimination of the qualifying income exception upon which we rely for our partnership tax treatment. 
 
 In addition, the Treasury Department has issued, and in the future may issue, regulations interpreting those laws that affect publicly traded partnerships. There can be no assurance that there will not be further changes to U.S. federal income tax laws or the Treasury Department s interpretation of the qualifying income rules in a manner that could impact our ability to qualify as a partnership in the future. 
 
 Any modification to the U.S. federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof may or may not be applied retroactively and could make it more difficult or impossible for us to meet the exception for certain publicly traded partnerships to be treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We are unable to predict whether any of these changes or other proposals will ultimately be enacted. Any similar or future legislative changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in our common units. You are urged to consult with your own tax advisor with respect to the status of regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on your investment in our common units. 
 
 If we were subjected to a material amount of additional entity-level taxation by individual states, it would reduce our cash available for distribution to our unitholders. 
 
 Changes in current state law may subject us to additional entity-level taxation by individual states. Because of state budget deficits and other reasons, several states have been evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity-level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise, and other forms of taxation. For example, we are subject to an entity-level Texas franchise tax. Imposition of any such taxes may substantially reduce the cash available for distribution to our unitholders. 
 
 Although we are not subject to U.S. federal income tax other than with respect to our operating U.S. subsidiaries that are treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes, certain of our foreign operations are subject to certain non-U.S. taxes. If a taxing authority were to successfully assert that we have more tax liability than we anticipate or legislation were enacted that increased the taxes to which we are subject, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders could be further reduced. 
 
 Approximately 12.2 of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022, were generated in non-U.S. jurisdictions, primarily Mexico, Canada, Argentina, Chile and Egypt. Our non-U.S. operations and subsidiaries are generally subject to income, withholding, and other taxes in the non-U.S. jurisdictions in which they are organized or from which they receive income, reducing the amount of cash available for distribution. In computing our tax obligation in these non-U.S. jurisdictions, we are required to take various tax accounting and reporting positions on matters that are not entirely free from doubt and for which we have not received rulings from the governing tax authorities, such as whether withholding taxes will be reduced by the application of certain tax treaties. Upon review of these positions the applicable authorities may not agree with our positions. A successful challenge by a tax authority could result in additional taxes being imposed on us, reducing the cash available for distribution to our unitholders. In addition, changes in our operations or ownership could result in higher than anticipated taxes being imposed in jurisdictions in which we are organized or from which we receive income and further reduce the cash available for distribution. Although these taxes may be properly characterized as foreign income taxes, our unitholders may not be able to credit them against the liability for U.S. federal income taxes on the unitholders share of our earnings. In addition, our operations in countries in which we operate now or in the future may involve risks associated with the legal structure used and the taxation on assets transferred into a particular country. Tax laws of non-U.S. jurisdictions are subject to potential legislative, judicial, or administrative 
 26 

changes and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis. Any such changes may result in additional taxes above the amounts we currently anticipate and further reduce our cash available for distribution to our unitholders. 
 
 If the IRS contests the U.S. federal income tax positions we take, the market for our common units may be adversely impacted, and the cost of any IRS contest will reduce our cash available for distribution to our unitholders. 
 
 We have not requested a ruling from the IRS with respect to our treatment as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The IRS may adopt positions that differ from the positions we take, and the IRS s positions may ultimately be sustained. It may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of the positions we take. A court may not agree with some or all of the positions we take. Any contest with the IRS may materially and adversely impact the market for our common units and the price at which they trade. In addition, our costs of any contest with the IRS will be borne indirectly by our unitholders and our general partner, because the costs will reduce our cash available for distribution. 
 
 If the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, it (and some states) may assess and collect any taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) resulting from such audit adjustments directly from us, in which case our cash available for distribution to our unitholders may be substantially reduced. 
 
 Legislation applicable to partnership tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 alters the procedures for auditing large partnerships and for assessing and collecting taxes due (including penalties and interest) as a result of a partnership-level U.S. federal income tax audit. Under this legislation, unless we are eligible to (and do) elect to issue revised information statements to our unitholders and former unitholders with respect to an audited and adjusted partnership tax return, the IRS (and some states) may assess and collect taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) directly from us in the year in which the audit is completed. If we are required to pay taxes, penalties and interest as a result of audit adjustments, cash available for distribution to our unitholders may be substantially reduced. In addition, because payment would be due for the taxable year in which the audit is completed, unitholders during that taxable year would bear the expense of the adjustment even if they were not unitholders during the audited tax year. These rules are not applicable for tax years beginning on or prior to December 31, 2017. 
 
 Our unitholders are required to pay taxes on their share of our income, even if they do not receive any cash distributions from us. 
 
 Our unitholders are required to pay any U.S. federal income taxes, and, in some cases, state and local income taxes on their share of our taxable income, even if they do not receive cash distributions from us. Unitholders with a greater than 10 interest in us may also be required to include their pro rata share of any global intangible low-taxed income attributable to our foreign corporate subsidiaries in the year in which such income is earned, even if the unitholder receives no cash distributions from us. Unitholders may not receive cash distributions from us equal to their share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability that results from that income. 
 
 In response to current market conditions, we may engage in transactions to delever the Partnership and manage our liquidity that may result in income and gain to our unitholders without a corresponding cash distribution. For example, if we sell assets and use the proceeds to repay existing debt or fund capital expenditures, you may be allocated taxable income and gain resulting from the sale without receiving a cash distribution. Further, taking advantage of opportunities to reduce our existing debt, such as debt exchanges, debt repurchases, or modifications of our existing debt, could result in cancellation of indebtedness income (also referred to as COD income being allocated to our unitholders as taxable income. Unitholders may be allocated COD income, and income tax liabilities arising therefrom may exceed cash distributions. The ultimate effect of any such allocations will depend on the unitholder s individual tax position with respect to its units. Unitholders are encouraged to consult their tax advisors with respect to the consequences to them of COD income. 
 
 Tax gain or loss on the disposition of our common units could be more or less than expected. 
 
 If our unitholders sell common units, they will recognize a gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between the amount realized and their tax basis in those common units. Because distributions in excess of their allocable share of our net taxable income decrease the tax basis in their common 
 27 

units, the amount, if any, of such prior excess distributions with respect to the units our unitholders sell will, in effect, become taxable income to our unitholders if they sell such units at a price greater than their tax basis in those units, even if the price they receive is less than their original cost. In addition, because the amount realized includes a unitholder s share of our nonrecourse liabilities, if our unitholders sell their units, they may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash the unitholders receive from the sale. 
 
 A substantial portion of the amount realized from a unitholder s sale of our units, whether or not representing gain, may be taxed as ordinary income to such unitholder due to potential recapture items, including depreciation recapture. Thus, a unitholder may recognize both ordinary income and capital loss from the sale of units if the amount realized on a sale of such units is less than such unitholder s adjusted basis in the units. Net capital loss may only offset capital gains and, in the case of individuals, up to 3,000 of ordinary income per year. In the taxable period in which a unitholder sells its units, such unitholder may recognize ordinary income from our allocations of income and gain to such unitholder prior to the sale and from recapture items that generally cannot be offset by any capital loss recognized upon the sale of units. 
 
 Unitholders may be subject to limitation on their ability to deduct interest expense incurred by us. 
 
 In general, we are entitled to a deduction for interest paid or accrued on indebtedness properly allocable to our trade or business during our taxable year. However, under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, our deduction for business interest is limited to the sum of our business interest income and 30 of our adjusted taxable income. For the purposes of this limitation, our adjusted taxable income is computed without regard to any business interest expense or business interest income, and in the case of taxable years beginning before January 1, 2022, any deduction allowable for depreciation, amortization, or depletion to the extent such depreciation, amortization, or depletion is not capitalized into cost of goods sold with respect to inventory. 
 
 If our business interest is subject to limitation under these rules, our unitholders will be limited in their ability to deduct their share of any interest expense that has been allocated to them. As a result, unitholders may be subject to limitation on their ability to deduct interest expense incurred by us. 
 
 Tax-exempt entities face unique tax issues from owning our common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them. 
 
 Investment in our common units by tax-exempt entities, such as employee benefit plans and individual retirement accounts (known as IRAs), raises issues unique to them. For example, virtually all of our income allocated to organizations that are exempt from U.S. federal income tax, including IRAs and other retirement plans, will be unrelated business taxable income and will be taxable to them. Tax-exempt entities should consult a tax advisor before investing in our common units. 
 
 Non-U.S. Unitholders will be subject to U.S. taxes and withholding with respect to their income and gain from owning our units. 
 
 Non-U.S. unitholders are generally taxed and subject to income tax filing requirements by the U.S. on income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business effectively connected income ). Income allocated to our unitholders and any gain from the sale of our units will generally be considered to be effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. As a result, distributions to a Non-U.S. unitholder will be subject to withholding at the highest applicable effective tax rate and a Non-U.S. unitholder who sells or otherwise disposes of a unit will also be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the gain realized from the sale or disposition of that unit. 
 
 Moreover, the transferee of an interest in a partnership that is engaged in a U.S. trade or business is generally required to withhold 10 of the amount realized by the transferor unless the transferor certifies that it is not a foreign person. While the determination of a partner s amount realized generally includes any decrease of a partner s share of the partnership s liabilities, the Treasury regulations provide that the amount realized on a transfer of an interest in a publicly traded partnership, such as our units, will generally be the amount of gross proceeds paid to the broker effecting the applicable transfer on behalf of the transferor, and thus will be determined without regard to any decrease in that partner s share of a publicly traded partnership s liabilities. The Treasury regulations and other guidance from the IRS provide that withholding on a transfer of an interest in a publicly traded partnership will not be imposed on a transfer that occurs prior to January 1, 2023. Thereafter, the obligation to withhold on a transfer of interests in a publicly traded partnership that is effected through a broker is imposed on the 
 28 

transferor s broker. Current and prospective Non-U.S. unitholders should consult their tax advisors regarding the impact of these rules on an investment in our common units. 
 
 We will treat each purchaser of our common units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the actual common units purchased. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of the common units. 
 
 Due to a number of factors, including our inability to match transferors and transferees of common units, we have adopted depreciation and amortization positions that may not conform to all aspects of existing Treasury Regulations. A successful IRS challenge to those positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to our unitholders. It also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain from the sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audit adjustments to our unitholders tax returns. 
 
 We prorate our items of income, gain, loss, and deduction for U.S. federal income tax purposes between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred. The IRS may challenge aspects of our proration method and could change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss, and deduction among our unitholders. 
 
 We prorate our items of income, gain, loss, and deduction for U.S. federal income tax purposes between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month (the Allocation Date ), instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred. Similarly, we generally allocate (i) certain deductions for depreciation of capital additions, (ii) gain or loss realized on a sale or other disposition of our assets, and (iii) in the discretion of the general partner, any other extraordinary item of income, gain, loss or deduction based upon ownership on the Allocation Date. Although final Treasury Regulations allow publicly traded partnerships to use a similar monthly simplifying convention to allocate tax items among transferor and transferee unitholders, these regulations do not specifically authorize all aspects of the proration method we have adopted. If the IRS were to successfully challenge our proration method, we may be required to change our allocation of items of income, gain, loss, and deduction among our unitholders. 
 
 Taxable income from our non-U.S. businesses is not eligible for the 20 deduction for qualified publicly traded partnership income. 
 
 For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and ending on or before December 31, 2025, a unitholder is generally allowed a deduction equal to 20 of our qualified publicly traded partnership income that is allocated to such unitholder. For purposes of the deduction, the term qualified publicly traded partnership income includes the net amount of such unitholder s allocable share of our income that is effectively connected to our U.S. trade or business activities. Because our non-U.S. business operations earn income that is not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business, unitholders may not apply the 20 deduction for qualified publicly traded partnership income to that portion of our income. 
 
 A unitholder whose units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale of units may be considered as having disposed of those units. If so, the unitholder would no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition. 
 
 Because there are no specific rules governing the U.S. federal income tax consequence of loaning a partnership interest, a unitholder whose units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale of units may be considered as having disposed of the loaned units. In that case, the unitholder may no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan to the short seller, and the unitholder may recognize gain or loss from such disposition. Moreover, during the period of the loan to the short seller, any of our income, gain, loss, or deduction with respect to those units may not be reportable by the unitholder, and any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those units could be fully taxable as ordinary income. Unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a loan to a short seller are urged to consult a tax advisor to discuss whether it is advisable to modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from borrowing their units. 
 
 29 

We have adopted certain valuation methodologies in determining a unitholder s allocations of income, gain, loss and deduction. The IRS may challenge these methodologies or the resulting allocations, and such a challenge could adversely affect the value of our common units. 
 
 In determining the items of income, gain, loss and deduction allocable to our unitholders, we must routinely determine the fair market value of our assets. Although we may from time to time consult with professional appraisers regarding valuation matters, we make many fair market value estimates ourselves using a methodology based on the market value of our common units as a means to determine the fair market value of our assets. The IRS may challenge these valuation methods and the resulting allocations of income, gain, loss and deduction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 
 A successful IRS challenge to these methods or allocations could adversely affect the timing or amount of taxable income or loss being allocated to our unitholders. It also could affect the amount of gain from our unitholders sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of the common units or result in audit adjustments to our unitholders tax returns without the benefit of additional deductions. 
 
 Unitholders will likely be subject to non-U.S., state and local taxes, and return filing requirements in jurisdictions where they do not live as a result of investing in our common units. 
 
 In addition to U.S. federal income taxes, unitholders will likely be subject to other taxes, including non-U.S., state and local taxes, unincorporated business taxes and estate, inheritance, or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we do business or control property now or in the future, even if they do not live in any of those jurisdictions. Unitholders will likely be required to file non-U.S., state, and local income tax returns and pay non-U.S., state and local income taxes in some or all of these various jurisdictions. Further, unitholders may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements. In the United States, we own assets and conduct business in many states, most of which currently impose a personal income tax on individuals and an income tax on corporations and other entities. As we make acquisitions or expand our business, we may own or control assets or conduct business in additional jurisdictions that impose a personal income tax. It is our unitholders responsibility to file all U.S. federal, non-U.S., state and local tax returns and pay any taxes due in these jurisdictions. Unitholders should consult with their own tax advisors regarding the filing of such tax returns, the payment of such taxes, and the deductibility of any taxes paid. 
 
 Unitholders may be subject to tax in one or more non-U.S. jurisdictions, including Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Egypt and Chile as a result of owning our common units if, under the laws of any such jurisdiction, we are considered to be carrying on business there. If unitholders are subject to tax in any such jurisdiction, they may be required to file a tax return with, and pay taxes to, that jurisdiction based on their allocable share of our income. We may be required to reduce distributions to unitholders on account of any withholding obligations imposed upon us by that jurisdiction in respect of such allocation to the unitholders. In addition, the U.S. may not allow a tax credit for any foreign income taxes that unitholders directly or indirectly incur.

 Item 2. Properties. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we owned four service facilities in North Dakota and Texas. We lease 22 additional service facilities in Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas and West Virginia. We also lease service facilities and administrative offices in Argentina, Canada, Egypt and Mexico. We also lease a number of storage facilities located across the geographic markets we serve. As of January 2022, we are leasing our own office space in The Woodlands, Texas for our headquarters. We moved out of the TETRA s headquarters in The Woodlands, Texas as of January 2022. Our primary assets include our fleet of compression and other equipment. See Item 1 Business - Products and Services - Contract Services, for a discussion and description of our compression fleet. All obligations under our First Lien Notes and our Second Lien Notes are secured by security interests in substantially all of our compression assets but excluding other real property assets.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings. 
 
 From time to time, we may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business. While the outcome of lawsuits against us cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not consider it reasonably possible that a loss resulting from such lawsuits in excess of any amounts accrued has been incurred that is expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

 Market Information 
 
 Our common units are traded on NASDAQ under the symbol CCLP. As of March 9, 2023, there were 55 holders of record of the common units. The actual number of common unitholders is greater than this number of record holders and includes common unitholders who are beneficial owners but whose shares are held in street name by banks, brokers and other nominees. 
 
 Distribution Policy 
 
 Our partnership agreement requires us to distribute, no later than 45 days after the end of each quarter, all of our available cash, as defined below, at the end of each quarter. There is no guarantee that we will pay any specific distribution in any quarter. 
 
 Definition of Available Cash . We define Available Cash in the partnership agreement, and it means, for any quarter, all cash on hand at the end of that quarter: 
 
 less the amount of cash reserves established by our general partner to: 
 provide for the proper conduct of our business after the end of the quarter; 
 comply with applicable law, any of our future debt instruments or other agreements; or 
 provide funds for future distributions; 
 plus, if our general partner so determines, all or any portion of any additional cash and cash equivalents on hand on the date of determination of Available Cash for the quarter resulting from working capital borrowings made after the end of the quarter. 

Working capital borrowings are borrowings that are made under a credit agreement, commercial paper facility, or similar financing arrangement, and in all cases are used solely for working capital purposes or to pay distributions to partners and with the intent of the borrower to repay such borrowings within twelve months from sources other than additional working capital borrowings. 
 
 Common Units . We pay quarterly distributions to the holders of common units to the extent we have sufficient cash from our operations after establishment of cash reserves and payment of debt service and other contractual obligations, fees and expenses. Beginning with the distribution for the fourth quarter of 2018, we have paid a distribution of 0.01 per common unit, or 0.04 on an annualized basis. There is no guarantee that we will continue to pay the reduced current quarterly distribution on the common units or be able to increase it in the future. Our Second Lien Notes indenture further restricts our ability to make distributions in respect of our common units in any amount exceeding 0.04 per common unit per year, unless such increased distribution is funded by proceeds from an equity offering. Even if our cash distribution policy is not modified or revoked, the amount of distributions paid under our policy and the decision to make any distribution is determined by our general partner, taking into consideration the terms of our partnership agreement. Distributions attributable to the year ended 2022 totaled 0.04 per common unit. See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources - Cash Flows - Financing Activities for a discussion of restrictions on our ability to make distributions. 
 
 General Partner Interest . Initially, our general partner was entitled to approximately 2.0 of all distributions that we make prior to our liquidation. Our general partner has the right, but not the obligation, to contribute a proportionate amount of capital to us to maintain its initial 2.0 general partner interest. Our general partner s initial 2.0 interest in our distributions has been decreased to approximately 0.5 and may be reduced further if we issue additional limited partner units in the future and our general partner does not contribute a proportionate amount of capital to us to maintain its current general partner interest.

Risk Factors, for additional discussion of these factors and risks. 
 
 On January 29, 2021, Spartan acquired from TETRA the Partnership s general partner, IDRs and 10.95 million common units in the Partnership in the GP Sale. In connection with the GP Sale, on January 29, 2021, TETRA entered into the Transition Services Agreement with the Partnership, pursuant to which TETRA provided certain accounting, information technology and back-office support services to the Partnership for a period of up to one year following closing. The Transition Services Agreement with TETRA expired on January 31, 2022. 
 
 On November 10, 2021, the Partnership entered into the Contribution Agreement with CSI Compressco GP, Spartan and Compressco Sub. Pursuant to the terms of the Contribution Agreement, Spartan contributed Spartan Treating to the Partnership. As the Partnership and Spartan Treating were under common control at the time of the Spartan Acquisition, the results of operations have been combined for the Partnership and Spartan Treating from the date common control began, January 29, 2021. See Note 4 - Common Control Acquisition in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for further information. 
 
 Business Overview 
 
 We are a provider of contract services related to the exploration and production of oil and natural gas, including natural gas compression services and treating services. Natural gas compression equipment is used for natural gas and oil production, gathering, artificial lift, production enhancement, transmission, processing, and storage. We also provide a variety of natural gas treating services. Our compression business includes a fleet of approximately 4,600 compressor packages providing approximately 1.2 million in aggregate horsepower, utilizing a full spectrum of low-, medium-, and high-horsepower engines. Our treating fleet includes amine units, gas coolers, and related equipment. Our aftermarket business provides compressor package overhaul, repair, engineering and design, reconfiguration and maintenance services, as well as the sale of compressor package parts and components manufactured by third-party suppliers. Our customers operate throughout many of the onshore producing regions of the United States, as well as in a number of international locations, including Mexico, Canada, Argentina, Egypt and Chile. 
 
 Demand for our services is directly driven by the production of crude oil and associated natural gas from unconventional shale plays, production of natural gas from conventional plays and the transmission of natural gas to and within sales pipelines. Our fleet of compressors, ranging from 20 to 2,500 horsepower per unit, allows us to service our customers compression needs at the wellhead through high-horsepower compression needs at centralized gathering and gas lift facilities. 
 
 During 2021, our financial results were affected by the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Reduced spending by oil and gas operators led to a decline in our compression fleet utilization which impacted revenues and pricing. Oil and natural gas commodity prices gained strength throughout 2021 and increased significantly during 2022. West Texas Intermediate oil prices reached an average of 83 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2022. This increase in commodity prices, coupled with the waning impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy, resulted in an increase in the demand for our contract services, aftermarket services, and equipment rentals. Our compression fleet utilization increased to 86.8 as of December 31, 2022, compared to 80.8 as of December 31, 2021. In addition, as a result of increased customer demand, we were able to implement price increases on many of our compression contracts in the second half of 2021 and throughout 2022. Revenue from contract services increased each quarter in 2022. We secured orders from key customers for high-horsepower and electric compressors that started generating revenues in the fourth quarter of 2022 and continue to be deployed in 2023. Our customers remain focused on capital discipline; however, the levels of quote activity and awards remain strong. The strengthening market environment has increased, competition for field and corporate employees. Supply chain issues, increased commodity prices, and inflationary pressures have increased costs and impacted the availability of our parts and supplies. In December 2022, an international contract expired through its natural course, as of December 31, 2022 the contract has not renewed. Management is having ongoing conversations over a renewal or extension. External factors including Russia s invasion of Ukraine, inflationary pressures and related monetary policy, such as Federal Reserve rate increases, could adversely affect our results of operations, impair our ability to raise capital, or otherwise adversely impact our ability to realize certain business strategies. We continue to monitor these risks and take the necessary actions to mitigate them. We have and will continue to 
 34 

evaluate the sale of non-core assets, including our low-horsepower compression fleet. We can provide no assurance that we will consummate a future sale of our low-horsepower compression fleet. 
 
 With the rapidly changing market environment, we will continue to proactively manage our capital allocation strategies, our liquidity requirements and monitor our expenses and financial performance. In addition, continued capital discipline throughout the energy sector may limit production growth even as the economy recovers from these external factors. Despite challenging and changing market conditions, we will continue to maintain our commitment to safety and service quality for our customers. 
 35 

Results of Operations 
 
 The following data should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the associated Notes contained elsewhere in this document. On November 10, 2021, Spartan contributed Spartan Treating to the Partnership. As the Partnership and Spartan Treating were under common control at the time of the Spartan Acquisition, the results of operations have been combined for the Partnership and Spartan Treating from the date common control began which was January 29, 2021. See Note 4 - Common Control Acquisition in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for further information. Previously, our equipment sales business included our new unit sales business that consisted of the fabrication and sale of new standard and custom-designed, engineered compressor packages fabricated primarily at our facility in Midland, Texas. We sold the Midland facility in July 2020. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we fully exited the new unit sales business and we have reflected these operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Note 9 - Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for further information. Used equipment sales revenue continues to be included in equipment sales revenue.

 Revenues 
 
 Contract services revenues increased by 28.2 million, or 12.0 , during 2022 compared to the prior year. The increase in revenues is due to an increase in activity levels resulting from strong oil and gas commodity prices and the economic recovery as the impact of the pandemic diminishes. Compression fleet horsepower utilization and operating horsepower both increased in 2022 compared to the prior year. In addition, due to the improved market conditions, we implemented price increases resulting in an increase in revenues. Operating horsepower increased 
 36 

compared to the prior year period due to the deployment of new compressor units in 2022 and the redeployment of idle compressor units in late 2021 and throughout 2022. 
 
 Aftermarket services revenues increased 19.4 million, or 36.2 , during 2022 compared to the prior year due to increased demand for compression parts and services resulting from an increase in activity levels by our customers. With the improvement in market conditions and the strong oil and gas commodity prices, customers have increased production of oil and gas which, in turn, increased the demand for parts and services needed to maintain their compression fleet. 
 
 Equipment rentals revenues increased 2.0 million, or 15.2 , during 2021 due to the addition of Spartan Treating revenues in the consolidated financial statements of the Partnership effective January 29, 2021. The prior year period only includes approximately 11 months of revenues from Spartan Treating compared to 12 months in the current year period. Additionally, the number of revenue-generating gas coolers increased in 2022 due to an increase in customer demand and higher activity levels. 
 
 Equipment sales revenues decreased 0.4 million, or 13.6 , during 2022 compared to the prior year due to a decrease in used unit sales. 
 
 Cost of revenues 
 
 Cost of contract services increased 16.9 million compared to the prior year due to an increase in revenues and higher activity levels. Cost of contract services as a percentage of contract services revenues increased from 50.5 in 2021 to 51.5 in 2022. This increase was partially due to the effect of inflation resulting in increased costs in certain operating cost categories in 2022 including parts, field labor, and fluids costs. 
 
 Cost of aftermarket services increased 12.6 million in 2022 compared to 2021 consistent with the increase 
 in revenues. The cost of aftermarket services was also impacted by inflation in 2022. 
 
 Cost of equipment rentals increased 1.3 million compared to 2021 due to the increase in corresponding revenues. Cost of equipment rentals as a percentage of equipment rental revenue increased from 8.3 in 2021 to 15.8 in 2022. This was driven by increased use of outside service providers required to meet customer demand in a high utilization environment. 
 
 Cost of equipment sales decreased 2.0 million during the current year as a result of selling aged units with decreased market value. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense consists primarily of the depreciation of compressor packages in our service fleet. In addition, it includes the depreciation of other operating equipment and facilities and the amortization of intangibles. Depreciation and amortization expense remained relatively consistent compared to the prior year. 
 
 Impairments and other charges 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, a certain engine in inventory was written off due to an engine being sold at a loss, resulting in a charge of 0.1 million. There were no impairments or other charges recorded in 2022. 
 
 Selling, general, and administrative expense 
 
 Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased 0.7 million during 2022 compared to 2021 largely due to decreased employment expenses, including wages, incentives, benefits, and other employee-related expenses of 6.2 million primarily due to the transition of headcount from TETRA shared services model to in-house functions and decreased bad debt expenses and other expenses of 0.9 million. These decreases were offset by increased general expenses such as office, tax, and insurance expenses of 5.3 million and increased professional services fees of 1.1 million. 
 37 

Interest expense, net 
 
 Interest expense, net decreased to 50.5 million during 2022 compared to 54.8 million in 2021 due to the redemption of our 7.25 Senior Notes in 2021. 
 
 Other (income) expense, net 
 
 Other (income) expense, net, was 1.9 million of expense during 2022 compared to 3.9 million of expense in 2021. This decrease in expense is primarily due to increased income associated with the disposal of assets offset increased foreign currency losses, primarily from our operations in Mexico and Argentina. 
 
 Provision for income taxes 
 
 As a partnership, we are generally not subject to income taxes at the entity level, and our partners are separately taxed on their share of our taxable income. However, a portion of our business is conducted through taxable U.S. corporate subsidiaries. Accordingly, a U.S. federal and state income tax provision has been reflected in the accompanying statements of operations. Certain of our operations are located outside of the United States and the Partnership, through its foreign subsidiaries, is responsible for income taxes in these countries. 
 
 Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022, was negative 27.4 primarily due to taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions and Texas gross margin taxes combined with losses generated in entities for which no related tax benefit has been recorded. Included in our deferred tax assets are net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits that are available to offset future income tax liabilities in the U.S. as well as in certain foreign jurisdictions. 
 
 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax 
 
 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax increased from a 0.6 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2021, to a 0.2 million income for the year ended December 31, 2022. The prior year loss includes 0.2 million of new unit sales revenues offset by 0.5 million of cost of sales, and 0.4 million of selling, general, and administrative expenses. The 2022 gain is related to the expiration of the remaining warranty reserve not utilized. 
 
 How We Evaluate Our Operations 
 
 Operating Expenses. We use operating expenses as a performance measure for our business. We track our operating expenses using month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter, year-to-date, and year-to-year comparisons and as compared to budget. This analysis is useful in identifying adverse cost trends and allows management to investigate the cause of these trends and put corrective measures in place where possible. The most significant portions of our operating expenses are for our field labor, repair and maintenance of our equipment, and fluids cost. The costs of other materials consumed while performing our services, other labor costs, vehicle leases and maintenance cost, rent on facilities, and insurance expenses comprise the significant remainder of our operating expenses. Our operating expenses generally fluctuate with our level of activity. 
 
 Our labor costs consist primarily of wages and benefits for our field personnel, as well as expenses related to their training and safety. Additional information regarding our operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022, is provided within the Results of Operations sections above. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA . We view Adjusted EBITDA as one of our primary management tools, and we track it on a monthly basis, both in dollars and as a percentage of revenues (typically compared to the prior month, prior year period, and to budget). We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and before certain charges, including impairments, bad debt expense attributable to bankruptcy of customers, equity compensation, non-cash costs of compressors sold, gain on extinguishment of debt, write-off of unamortized financing costs, and excluding severance and other non-recurring or unusual expenses or charges. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by our management to: 
 
 assess our ability to generate available cash sufficient to make distributions to our common unitholders and general partner; 
 38 

evaluate the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure, or historical cost basis; 
 measure operating performance and return on capital as compared to those of our competitors; and 
 determine our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures. 
 
 The following table reconciles net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated: 
 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 (In Thousands) Net loss (22,095) (50,272) Provision for income taxes 4,786 4,952 Depreciation and amortization 78,231 78,234 Impairments and other charges 135 Interest expense, net 50,503 54,791 Equity compensation 1,622 1,954 Transaction costs 210 2,146 ERP Write Off 4,635 Reorganization costs 754 Severance 432 114 Non-cash cost of compressors sold 1,382 3,368 Prior year sales tax accrual adjustment 367 Manufacturing engine order cancellation charge 300 (Benefit) provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization and impairments attributed to discontinued operations (173) 256 Other 440 (137) Adjusted EBITDA 115,473 101,462 
 
 Free Cash Flow . We define Free Cash Flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures, net of sales proceeds. Management primarily uses this metric to assess our ability to retire debt, evaluate our capacity to further invest and grow, and measure our performance as compared to our peers. The following table reconciles cash provided by operations, net, to Free Cash Flow for the periods indicated: 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 (In Thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities 35,544 27,156 Capital expenditures, net of sales proceeds (43,939) (42,098) Free cash flow (8,395) (14,942) 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021, includes 57.0 million of revenues in excess of cash expenses partially offset by 21.5 million in working capital changes. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are financial measures that are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to net income, operating income, cash from operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These measures may not be comparable to similarly titled financial metrics of other entities, as other entities may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA or Free Cash Flow in the same manner as we do. Management compensates for the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable U.S. GAAP measures, understanding the differences between the measures, and incorporating this knowledge into management s decision-making processes. Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow should not be viewed as indicative of the actual amount of cash 
 39 

we have available for distributions or that we plan to distribute for a given period, nor should it be equated with available cash as defined in our partnership agreement. 
 
 Horsepower Utilization Rate of our Compressor Packages . We measure the horsepower utilization rate across our fleet of compressor packages as the amount of horsepower of compressor packages used to provide services as of a particular date, divided by the amount of horsepower of compressor packages in our services fleet as of such date. Management primarily uses this metric to determine our future need for additional compressor packages for our service fleet and to measure marketing effectiveness. 
 
 The following table sets forth the total horsepower in our compression fleet, our total horsepower in service and our horsepower utilization rate by each horsepower class of our compression fleet as of the dates shown. 
 December 31, 2022 2021 Horsepower 
 Total horsepower in fleet 
 1,187,357 1,196,842 Total horsepower in service 
 1,030,571 967,085 Total horsepower utilization rate 
 86.8 80.8 
 
 The following table sets forth our horsepower utilization rates by each horsepower class of our compression fleet as of the dates shown. 
 December 31, 2022 2021 Horsepower utilization rate by class 
 Low-horsepower (0-100) 62.4 57.3 Medium-horsepower (101-1,000) 84.4 80.4 High-horsepower (1,001 and over) 93.1 86.1 Total Horsepower utilization rate 86.8 80.8 
 
 The total horsepower utilization rate increased in 2022 compared to 2021 due to an increase in customer activity levels. This was driven by a high commodity price environment for oil and gas and the continued recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and energy sector. Market conditions improved in the current year resulting in an increase in total utilization of 6 compared to the utilization rate as of December 31, 2021, with meaningful gains in utilization in all horsepower categories. Operating horsepower increased by approximately 63,500 horsepower which includes the redeployment of previously idle horsepower and new high-horsepower compressors placed in service resulting from our growth capital investments. 
 
 Net Increases/Decreases in Compression Fleet Horsepower . We measure the net increase (or decrease) in our compression fleet horsepower during a given period by taking the difference between the aggregate horsepower of compressor packages added to the fleet during the period, less the aggregate horsepower of compressor packages removed from the fleet during the period. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our primary cash requirements are for distributions, working capital requirements, debt service, normal operating expenses, and capital expenditures. Our potential sources of funds are our existing cash balances, cash generated from our operations, asset sales, and long-term and short-term borrowings, which we believe will be sufficient to meet our working capital and growth capital requirements during 2023. We have secured orders from key customers for high-horsepower and electric compressors which will drive our investment in growth capital and consume liquidity in 2023. 
 
 During 2022, oil and gas commodity prices remained strong resulting in an increase in activity levels by our customers and higher demand for our products and services. Although uncertainty remains, the outlook for the energy sector continues to be favorable. Despite these uncertainties, we remain committed to a long-term growth strategy. Our near-term focus is to reduce our leverage, preserve and enhance liquidity, and grow our profitability 
 40 

through strategic operating and financial measures. We periodically evaluate engaging in strategic transactions and may consider divesting assets where our evaluation suggests such transactions are in the best interests of our business. We are subject to business and operational risks that could materially and adversely affect our cash flows and, when coupled with risks associated with current debt and equity market conditions, our ability or desire to issue securities. Please read Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 In November of 2021, in connection with the Spartan Acquisition, we closed a private placement of common units to certain investors for gross proceeds of 52.7 million (the Private Placement and issued 10 million in aggregate principal amount of our 10.000 /10.750 Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2026 (the New Second Lien Notes pursuant to a securities purchase agreement (the Second Lien Notes Sale ). The proceeds of the Private Placement and Second Lien Notes Sale were used for general Partnership purposes, including the redemption of all 80.7 million of our senior unsecured notes in December 2021. These and other transactions completed in the fourth quarter of 2021 improved our overall financial condition and liquidity position. 
 
 Following the redeployment of our idle assets, meeting increased demand for our contract services will require ongoing capital expenditure investment, which could be significant. We will determine appropriate funding of future capital expenditures, along with potential acquisitions, on a case-by-case basis. Funding sources may include existing cash balances, cash flow generated from our operations, borrowing against our Credit Facilities, finance leases with third parties, and issuance of equity. 
 
 The level of future growth capital expenditures depends on demand for our contract services, the level of cash available to fund these expenditures and our decisions whether to utilize available cash to fund increases in our quarterly common unit distribution, retire debt, or make capital expenditures. We expect capital expenditures in 2023 will range from 43.0 million to 48.0 million. These capital expenditures include approximately 17.0 million to 19.0 million of maintenance capital expenditures, approximately 23.0 million to 25.0 million of capital expenditures primarily associated with the expansion of our contract services fleet and 3.0 million to 4.0 million of capital expenditures related to investments in technology and facilities. We expect cash on hand and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet cash needs throughout 2023. 
 
 On January 20, 2023, our general partner declared a cash distribution attributable to the quarter ended December 31, 2022, of 0.01 per common unit. This distribution equates to a distribution of 0.04 per outstanding common unit on an annualized basis. This quarterly distribution was paid on February 14, 2023, to each of the holders of common units of record as of the close of business on January 31, 2023. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 A summary of our sources and uses of cash during the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is as follows: 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 (In Thousands) Operating activities 35,544 27,156 Investing activities (43,939) (40,509) Financing activities 10,270 3,377 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased by 8.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, to 35.5 million compared to 27.2 million provided by operating activities in 2021. Our cash provided from operating activities was primarily generated from the provision of contract compression and treating services. 
 
 Cash provided from our foreign operations is subject to various uncertainties, including the volatility associated with interruptions caused by customer budgetary decisions, uncertainties regarding the renewal of our existing customer contracts, and other changes in contract arrangements, the timing of collection of our receivables, and the repatriation of cash generated by our international operations. 
 
 41 

Investing Activities 
 
 Capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2022, increased by 8.7 million compared to 2021 driven by an increase in investments in growth capital. Maintenance capital expenditures increased compared to the prior year. Total capital expenditures during 2022 were 53.7 million, offset by 1.4 million from compression units sold. Total capital expenditures for 2022 include 18.0 million of maintenance capital expenditures. 
 
 The level of growth capital expenditures depends on our ability to redeploy existing fleet equipment and demand for compression services. Improved market conditions have provided opportunities with our customer base to provide new compression horsepower, resulting in increased demand for growth capital. If the demand for compression services increases or decreases, the amount of planned expenditures on growth and expansion will be adjusted. We continue to review all capital expenditure plans carefully in an effort to conserve cash and fund our liquidity needs. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Distributions 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we distributed 5.7 million of cash distributions to our common unitholders and general partner . 
 
 Credit Agreement 
 
 On January 29, 2021, the Partnership amended the Loan and Security Agreement dated June 29, 2018 (as amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement provides for maximum revolving credit commitments of 35.0 million and includes a 3.5 million reserve, which results in reduced borrowing availability. 
 
 The maturity date of the Credit Agreement is June 29, 2025. As of December 31, 2022, we had an outstanding balance of 6.7 million and had 1.4 million in letters of credit against our Credit Agreement, leaving availability under the Credit Agreement of 23.4 million, subject to compliance with the covenants, borrowing base, and other provisions of the agreements that may limit borrowings under the Credit Agreement. As of March 9, 2023, we had 5.1 million balance outstanding under our Credit Agreement and 1.4 million in letters of credit, leaving availability under the Credit Agreement of 25.0 million, subject to compliance with the covenants, borrowing base, and other provisions of the agreements that may limit borrowings under the Credit Agreement. The amounts the Partnership may borrow under the Credit Agreement are based on the amounts of the Partnership s accounts receivable and the value of certain inventory. Decreases in the amount of the Partnership s accounts receivable and the value of its inventory would result in reduced borrowing availability under the Credit Agreement. 
 
 Spartan Credit Agreement 
 
 On November 10, 2021, certain unrestricted subsidiaries of the Partnership, Spartan Energy Services LLC, as borrower, and Treating Holdco, as new guarantor, entered into the First Amendment to Loan, Security and Guaranty Agreement (the Spartan Amendment amending the Loan, Security and Guaranty Agreement dated January 29, 2021 (as amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the Spartan Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., in its capacity as agent, and the other lenders and loan parties party thereto. As of December 31, 2022, and subject to compliance with the covenants, borrowing base, and other provisions of the agreements that may limit borrowings under the Spartan Credit Agreement, we had availability of 14.5 million. 
 
 The maturity date of the Spartan Credit Agreement is October 17, 2025. As of December 31, 2022, we had a 55.5 million outstanding balance. As of March 9, 2023, we have 55.0 million balance outstanding under our Credit Agreement and no letters of credit, leaving availability under the Spartan Credit Agreement of 12.0 million, subject to compliance with the covenants, borrowing base, and other provisions of the agreement that may limit borrowings under the Credit Agreement. The amounts that may be borrowed under the agreement are based on the amounts of accounts receivable, the value of certain inventory, and appraised value of fixed assets, and fixed asset net book value. Decreases in the amount of accounts receivable and the value of its inventory and fixed assets would result in reduced borrowing availability under the Spartan Credit Agreement. 
 
 42 

Notes 
 
 We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase certain amounts of our outstanding senior notes through cash purchases, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. 
 
 7.50 First Lien Notes due 2025 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, our 7.50 First Lien Notes due 2025 (the First Lien Notes had 400.3 million outstanding net of unamortized discounts, unamortized deferred financing costs and deferred restructuring gains.

Our Second Lien Notes indenture further restricts our ability to make distributions in respect of our common units in any amount exceeding 0.04 per common unit per year, unless such increased distribution is funded by proceeds from an equity offering. These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions, including certain provisions permitting us, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to transfer assets to certain of our unrestricted subsidiaries. The indentures also contain customary events of default and acceleration provisions relating to events of default, which provide that upon an event of default under the indentures, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25 in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding First Lien Notes and Second Lien Notes may declare all of the First Lien Notes and Second Lien Notes to be due and payable immediately. We are in compliance with all covenants of the First Lien Notes and Second Lien Notes indentures as of December 31, 2022.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements. We prepared these financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, estimates, and judgments that affect the 
 45 

reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. We base these estimates on historical experience, available information, and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We periodically evaluate these estimates and judgments, which may change as new events occur, as new information is acquired, and with changes in our operating environment. Actual results are likely to differ from current estimates, and those differences may be material. The following critical accounting policy reflects the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. 
 
 Business Combinations 
 
 When we acquire a business from an entity under common control, whereby the companies are ultimately controlled by the same party both before and after the transaction, it is treated similar to the pooling of interests method of accounting, where the assets and liabilities are recorded at the transferring entity s historical cost instead of reflecting the fair market value of assets and liabilities. 
 
 Commitments and Contingencies 
 
 From time to time, we are involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business. While the outcome of these lawsuits or other proceedings against us cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not consider it reasonably possible that a loss resulting from such lawsuits or proceedings in excess of any amounts accrued has been incurred that is expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

 Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer of our general partner, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on this evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer of our general partner concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Management of our general partner is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control over 
 46 

financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of management of our general partner, including the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer of our general partner, an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 was conducted based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) COSO ). Based on this assessment, management of our general partner has determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

Board of Directors of CSI Compressco GP Inc. and the Unitholders of CSI Compressco LP 
 
 Opinion on internal control over financial reporting 
 We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of CSI Compressco LP (a Delaware limited partnership) and subsidiaries (the Partnership as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by COSO. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, and our report dated March 13, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. 
 
 Basis for opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 Audit Committee. During 2022, the Audit Committee was composed of Mr. Larson, as Chairman, Mr. Gill and Ms. Essenberg. The purposes of the Audit Committee are to (i) oversee the financial and reporting processes of the Partnership and the general partner, and the audit of the Partnership s financial statements, (ii) assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with regard to the integrity of the Partnership s financial statements, the Partnership s and the general partners compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, the qualifications, independence and performance of the Partnership s independent registered public accounting firm, and the effectiveness and performance of the Partnership s and the general partner s internal audit function, and (iii) perform such other functions as the Board may assign from time to time. The Audit Committee has sole authority to retain and terminate our independent registered public accounting firm, approve all auditing services and related fees and terms, and approve any non-audit service to be performed by our independent registered public accounting firm. To promote the independence of its audit, the Audit Committee consults separately and jointly with the independent registered public accounting firm, our internal auditor, and management. 
 
 As required by NASDAQ and SEC rules regarding audit committees, the Board has reviewed the qualifications of the Audit Committee and has determined that no current committee member has a relationship with us that might interfere with the exercise of his independence from us or our affiliates.

 Item 11. Executive Compensation.

 (1) Compensation for Messrs. Jackson, Byers and Price for fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, reflects compensation from the date of the GP Sale to fiscal year end (i.e., January 29, 2021, to December 31, 2021). 
 (2) The amounts included in the Unit Awards column reflect the aggregate grant date fair value of phantom unit awards granted during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, as applicable, in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. The phantom unit awards were granted under the LTIP on February 19, 2021, relate to our common units, and were valued at 1.96 per common unit in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, for a discussion of other assumptions used in determining the grant date value of these awards. We did not grant equity-based awards during the 2022 year to our NEOs. 
 (3) Amounts shown in the Non-Equity Incentive Compensation Plan column are the earned portions of awards granted under CSI Compressco s Cash Incentive Compensation Plan (the CICP for the annual performance period ending December 31, 2021, and the annual performance period ending December 31, 2022. Such awards are payable, to the extent earned, based on financial and operational performance measures. Amounts earned as of December 31, 2022, are expected to be paid by April 2023. 
 (4) As previously disclosed in the Information Statement on Schedule 14C filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 7, 2023 (the Information Statement ), we estimated that John E. Jackson, Jonathan W. Byers, and Robert W. Price would each receive 2022 awards pursuant to the CICP in the amounts of 600,000, 300,000, and 300,000 respectively. Based on the Board s assessment of 2022 performance, the awards for each of the Principal Executive Officer and each NEO are as reflected. 
 (5) The amounts reflected represent (i) matching contributions under the Spartan 401(k) Retirement Plan from January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2021, and the CSI Compressco 401(k) Retirement Plan from January 1, 2022, thru December 31, 2022, and (ii) the value of distribution equivalent rights settled in connection with the vesting of phantom unit awards that relate to CSI Compressco s common units which was 6,123.04 for Mr. Jackson, Mr. Byers, and Mr. Price in fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. 
 (6) As noted above, the formula that determines the compensation costs allocated to us pursuant to the Management Services Agreement does not divide the costs between specific compensation elements, therefore out of an abundance of caution we have chosen to report the total compensation provided to each of the applicable Named Executive Officers for fiscal years 2021 and 2022 within this column. However, pursuant to the Management Services Agreement, we only reimbursed Spartan for the following amounts in fiscal year 2021 for compensation paid to the NEOs: Mr. Jackson, 0.4 million; Mr. Byers, 0.4 million; and Mr. Price, 0.4 million. 
 
 Salary and Bonus Compensation 
 
 None of the NEOs are a party to an employment agreement or other individual service agreement. Base salary amounts were determined by the Board of Directors. As noted above, each NEO participated in the CICP during the 2022 year. The CICP budget pool for the 2022 awards under the CICP is based on EBITDA and pays out in accordance with the following table: 
 
 Threshold Target Maximum EBITDA 105M 113M 121M Payout 30 100 150 
 
 Individual bonus payouts may be increased or decreased by 0-200 of the CICP target based on individual performance at the discretion of the Board of Directors. The 2022 CICP target for John Jackson was 120 and 75 for Jonathan Byers and Robert Price, respectively. 
 
 Retirement, Health and Welfare Benefits 
 
 Our employees are eligible to participate in a variety of health and welfare and retirement programs sponsored by the Partnership. Our NEOs are generally eligible for the same benefit programs on the same basis as the remainder of our employees. Our health and welfare programs are intended to protect employees against 
 54 

catastrophic loss and to encourage a healthy lifestyle. These health and welfare programs include medical, wellness, pharmacy, dental, life insurance, short-term and long-term disability insurance, and insurance against accidental death and disability. 
 
 401(k) Plan 
 
 The NEOs became eligible to participate in the CSI Compressco 401(k) Retirement plan (the CSI Compressco 401(k) Plan effective January 1, 2022. The CSI Compressco 401(k) Plan is intended to supplement a participant s personal savings and social security. Under this plan, the NEOs may contribute on a pre-tax basis up to 70 of their compensation, subject to an annual maximum established under the Internal Revenue Code (the Code ). The Partnership makes a matching contribution under these plans equal to 50 of the first 8 of the NEOs annual compensation that is contributed to the plan. Such matching contribution was suspended in April 2020 and reinstated in December 2021. All employees (other than nonresident aliens) who have reached the age of eighteen are eligible to participate in the CSI Compressco 401(k) Plan beginning on the first day of the month following their completion of thirty (30) days of service with us. 
 
 The Named Executive Officers were eligible to participate in Spartan s 401(k) retirement plan (the Spartan Plan through December 31, 2021. Effective January 1, 2022, the Spartan Plan was eliminated and the Named Executive Officers transitioned to the CSI Compressco 401(k) Retirement Plan. Under the Spartan Plan, the Named Executive Officers were eligible to contribute to the plan on a pretax basis subject to an annual maximum established under the Code. Spartan made a matching contribution of 100 on the first 3 of a participant s annual compensation that was contributed to the Spartan Plan. All employees (other than nonresident aliens) who have reached the age of twenty-one (21) were eligible to participate. 
 
 Perquisites 
 
 Perquisites perks are not a material component of our compensation. In general, NEOs do not receive reimbursements for meals, airline and travel costs other than those costs allowed for all employees, or for tickets to sporting events or entertainment events, unless such tickets are used for business purposes. During 2022, no NEO received an allowance from us for any of the above or a reimbursement for any expense incurred for non-business purposes. 
 
 55 

Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year End 
 
 The Partnership continued to maintain our LTIP following the GP Sale, and each of Messrs. Jackson, Byers and Price were eligible to receive a grant of phantom unit awards during fiscal year 2021. Each phantom unit award granted on February 19, 2021, was granted in tandem with distribution equivalent rights DERs that entitle the award holder to receive an additional number of units equal in value to any distributions we pay during the period the award is outstanding times the number of units subject to the award. The awards are intended to cover equity-based incentive awards for these NEOs for a period of three years and no new equity-based awards are currently planned for Messrs. Jackson, Byers and Price until 2024. 
 
 The following table discloses the number and value of unvested phantom unit awards granted under the CSI Compressco LP Second Amended and Restated 2011 Long Term Incentive Plan as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year End Table 
 
 Unit Awards Name Number of Units that Have Not Vested (1) 
 Market Value of Units that Have Not Vested (2) 
 (#) ) John E. Jackson 306,123 407,144 Jonathan W. Byers 306,123 407,144 Robert W. Price 306,123 407,144 
 
 (1) One-third of the unvested phantom unit awards granted on February 19, 2021, vested on February 19, 2022, and one-third will vest on each of February 19, 2023, and February 19, 2024. 
 (2) All outstanding unit awards relate to our common units. Market value is determined by multiplying the number of units that have not vested by 1.33, the closing price of our common units on December 30, 2022. 
 
 Potential Payments upon a Change of Control or Termination 
 
 We do not have a severance plan for, or any agreement with, any Named Executive Officer that would require us to make any termination payments. 
 
 Under the LTIP, our general partner s Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may accelerate the vesting of restricted units, phantom units, and performance phantom units held by our Named Executive Officers upon termination of their employment. Solely for purposes of these disclosures, we have assumed that all outstanding unit awards would be accelerated if the Named Executive Officer s employment was terminated without cause in connection with a change of control, or upon the death, disability, or retirement of such officer, although such an acceleration is not a guaranteed benefit. The amounts that each NEO that was providing services to us as of December 31, 2022, could receive in connection with the potential acceleration of their outstanding equity awards would have been 407,144. 
 
 Director Compensation 
 
 Each director who is not an employee of our general partner or any of its subsidiaries, receives non-cash compensation of 60,000 per year for attending regularly scheduled board meetings. The non-cash compensation is paid for the upcoming service year in the form of phantom unit awards that have an intended grant date value of 60,000, prorated for any newly elected director to such director s date of election and that vest over the service year as set forth below. All such awards of phantom units are granted under our LTIP. Each phantom unit award granted to the directors on February 7, 2022, was granted in tandem with distribution equivalent rights DERs that entitle the award holder to receive an additional number of units equal in value to any distributions we pay during the period the award is outstanding times the number of units subject to the award. Directors are reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with their service as directors. In addition, each non-employee director is paid an annual cash retainer of 60,000 per year, paid in quarterly cash installments. Directors who are appointed as chairmen of the Audit Committee receive an additional cash retainer of 10,000 per year paid in quarterly installments. 
 Directors who are also our officers or employees, or officers or employees of our general partner or any of its subsidiaries, did not receive any compensation for duties performed as our directors. Consequently, none of Mr. 
 56 

Jackson (our current Chief Executive Officer), Mr. Byers (our current Chief Financial Officer) or Mr. Price (our current Chief Operating Officer) was compensated for their respective service to us as a director during 2022. 
 
 The following table discloses the cash, equity awards, and other compensation earned, paid, or awarded, as the case may be, to each of our non-employee directors during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence. 
 
 Certain Transactions 
 
 Review, Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons 
 
 The related person transactions in which we engaged in 2022 were typically of a recurring, ordinary course nature, were previously made known to the Board of our general partner, and generally were of the sort contemplated by the Omnibus Agreement and our Partnership Agreement. We do not have formal, specified policies for the review, approval or ratification of transactions required to be reported under paragraph (a) of Regulation S-K Item 404. However, because related person transactions may result in potential conflicts of interest among management and board-level decision makers, our Partnership Agreement does set forth procedures that the general partner may utilize in connection with resolutions of potential conflicts of interest, including the referral of such matters to an independent conflicts committee for its review and approval or disapproval of such matters. 
 
 Transactions with our General Partner and its Affiliates 
 
 As of March 9, 2023, Spartan and certain of its subsidiaries, including our general partner, owned 63,824,877 common units, which constitutes a 45.1 limited partner interest in us, and an approximate 0.5 general partner interest in us. Spartan is, therefore, a related person to us as such term is defined by the SEC. In connection with the GP Sale, on January 29, 2021, TETRA entered into the Transition Services Agreement with the Partnership, pursuant to which TETRA provided certain accounting, information technology and back-office support services to the Partnership for a period of one year following closing. The Transition Services Agreement with TETRA expired on January 31, 2022. 
 
 Distributions and Payments to the General Partner and its Affiliates 
 
 We will generally make cash distributions 99.5 to unitholders on a pro rata basis, including our general partner, as the holders of 63,824,877 common units and approximately 0.5 to our general partner. 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, we paid aggregate cash distributions of approximately 5.6 million on our common units, and approximately 27,000 on our general partner interest. On February 14, 2023, we paid quarterly distributions with respect to the period from October 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022, including approximately 0.8 million aggregate cash distribution on our common units and 6,746 on our general partner interest, including approximately 0.6 million of such cash distribution paid to Spartan and its affiliates. 
 
 59 

Management Services Agreement 
 
 In connection with the Contribution Agreement, the Partnership entered into the Management Services Agreement with the general partner, Contributor, Spartan Energy Partners GP LLC, Spartan GP, and Spartan Operating. Under the terms of the Management Services Agreement, the general partner, Spartan Operating and Spartan GP will provide certain services reasonably necessary for the operation of the businesses of the Partnership and its subsidiaries, Spartan, Spartan GP and Spartan Treating, including certain corporate and general and administrative services. Pursuant to the Management Services Agreement, the general partner and Spartan GP will allocate any costs and expenses incurred on a reasonable basis, and the parties will reimburse such other parties for costs and expenses allocated to them.

 Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Non-Audit Services

This policy provides that all audit and non-audit services to be performed by the Audit Firm must be specifically pre-approved on a case-by-case basis by the Audit Committee.

The member to whom such authority is delegated must report, for informational purposes only, any pre-approval decisions to the entire Audit Committee at or before its next scheduled meeting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

Board of Directors of CSI Compressco GP Inc. and the Unitholders of CSI Compressco LP 
 
 Opinion on the financial statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CSI Compressco LP (a Delaware limited partnership) and subsidiaries (the Partnership as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), partners capital, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Partnership as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Partnership s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Partnership s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Partnership in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Partnership is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical audit matters 
 Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgements. We determined that there are no critical audit matters. 

/s/ 
 
 We have served as the Partnership s auditor since 2020.

With the exception of the initial terms of our compression services contracts of our medium- and high-horsepower compressor packages, our customer contracts are generally for terms of one year or less. Since the period between when we deliver products or services and when the customer pays for products or services is not to exceed one year, we have elected not to calculate or disclose a financing component for our customer contracts. 
 
 Depending on the terms of the arrangement, we may also defer the recognition of revenue for a portion of the consideration received because we have to satisfy a future performance obligation. 
 
 For revenue associated with mobilization of service equipment as part of a service contract arrangement, such revenue, if significant, is deferred and amortized over the estimated service period.

 million common units in the Partnership to Spartan. As the Partnership and Spartan Treating were under common control at the time of the Spartan Acquisition, the acquisition was deemed to be a transaction under common control under ASC 805, Business Combinations.

 The Partnership s consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2021 include the assets and liabilities of Spartan Treating, including intercompany eliminations. As the results of operations for Spartan Treating were consolidated as of January 29, 2021, the date common control began, the Partnership s balances for Partners capital as of January 29, 2021 were adjusted to include Spartan Treating s equity balances as of that date. On November 10, 2021, Partners capital associated with Spartan Treating was million. In consolidation, Partners capital associated with Spartan Treating is eliminated. 
 
 The consideration for the Spartan Treating acquisition was the issuance to Spartan of million common units. The value of the common units was approximately million. As the acquisition is accounted for as a transaction under common control and the transfer of assets and liabilities occurs at historical cost, the value of the common units has no impact on Partners capital. The difference between the consideration and the net assets acquired of million is recognized as a deemed distribution as the book value of net assets as of November 10, 2021 was less than the consideration. As the Spartan Treating acquisition was accounted for retrospectively to the date of common control, the Partnership s Consolidated Statement of Operations includes Spartan Treating s net income of million corresponding to the period from January 29, 2021 to November 10, 2021.

 Lessor Accounting 
 
 Our leased equipment primarily consists of amine plants, cooling units and other production equipment. Certain of our agreements with our customers for rental equipment contain an operating lease component under ASC 842 because (i) there are identified assets, (ii) the customer has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the identified asset throughout the period of use and (iii) the customer directs the use of the identified assets throughout the period of use. We have elected to apply the practical expedient provided to lessors to combine the lease and non-lease component of a contract where the revenue recognition pattern is the same and where the lease component, when accounted for separately, would be considered an operating lease. The practical expedient also allows a lessor to account for the combined lease and non-lease components under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, when the non-lease component is the predominant element of the combined component. 
 
 Our lease agreements generally have contract terms based on monthly rates. Lease revenue is recognized straight-line based on these monthly rates. We do not provide an option for the lessee to purchase the rented assets at the end of the lease and the lessees do not provide residual value guarantees on the rented assets.

The individual indemnification agreements provide each such director or officer with the right to receive his or her costs of defense if he or she is made a party or witness to any proceeding other than a proceeding brought by or in the right of us, provided that such director or officer has not acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud with respect to the action that gave rise to his or her participation in the proceeding. 
 
 Other Sources of Financing 
 
 In February 2019, we entered into a transaction with TETRA whereby TETRA agreed to fund the construction of and purchase from us up to million of new compression services equipment and to subsequently lease the equipment back to us in exchange for a monthly rental fee. In December 2020, TETRA sold these compressors and assigned the corresponding leases to Spartan Energy Partners LP Spartan ). In January 2021, TETRA sold the general partner, IDRs and a majority of its common units in the Partnership to Spartan who assumed the financing obligation. On November 10, 2021, the Partnership completed the Spartan Acquisition. See Acquisition of Spartan entities for further description above. This resulted in the reassessment of the lease as an operating lease, thus the Partnership derecognized the assets and the related liabilities as of November 10, 2021. Additionally, all revenue and expenses were eliminated in consolidation.

Each of the phantom unit and performance phantom unit awards includes distribution equivalent rights that enable the recipient to receive additional units equal in value to the accumulated cash distributions made on the units subject to the award from the date of grant. Accumulated distributions associated with each underlying unit are payable upon settlement of the related phantom unit award (and are forfeited if the related award is forfeited). Phantom units are notional units that entitle the grantee to receive a common unit upon the vesting of the award. 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we granted to certain officers and employees an aggregate of phantom unit and performance phantom unit awards, having an average market value (equal to the closing price of the common units on the dates of grant) of per unit, or an aggregate market value of million. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we granted to certain officers and employees phantom unit and performance phantom unit awards, having an average market value (equal to the closing price of the common units on the dates of grant) of per unit, or an aggregate market value of million. The fair value of awards vesting during 2022 and 2021 was approximately million and million, respectively. The fair value of awards is amortized straight-line over the vesting period. Adjustments to the amortized expense related to performance phantom units may be recognized prior to vesting depending on the expected achievement of the performance target.

 Under a program designed to mitigate the currency exchange rate risk exposure on selected transactions of certain foreign subsidiaries, we may enter into similar derivative contracts from time to time. Although contracts pursuant to this program will serve as economic hedges of the cash flow of our currency exchange risk exposure, they will not be formally designated as hedge contracts or qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Accordingly, any change in the fair value of these derivative instruments during a period will be included in the determination of earnings for that period. 
 
 The fair values of our foreign currency derivative contracts are based on quoted market values (a Level 2 fair value measurement). None of our foreign currency derivative instruments contains credit risk related contingent features that would require us to post assets or collateral for contracts that are classified as liabilities. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized approximately million and million of net losses, respectively, associated with our foreign currency derivatives programs. These amounts are included in other (income) expense, net, in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

 We file U.S. federal, state, and foreign income tax returns on behalf of all of our consolidated subsidiaries. With few exceptions, we are not subject to U.S. federal, state, local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2015. We file tax returns in the U.S. and in various state, local and non-U.S. jurisdictions. 

We use the liability method for reporting income taxes, under which current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates. Under this method, at the end of each period, the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered. We establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. While we consider taxable income in prior carryback years, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to realize all of our deferred tax assets.

At December 31, 2022, we have federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards/carrybacks equal to approximately million, million, and million, respectively. In those foreign jurisdictions and states in which net operating losses are subject to an expiration period, our loss carryforwards, if not utilized, will expire from 2022 to 2040. Utilization of the net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be subject to a significant annual limitation due to ownership changes that have occurred previously or could occur in the future provided by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. 

The valuation allowance increased million during the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to the increase in deferred tax assets as a result of losses generated by our U.S. corporate subsidiaries. The valuation allowance decreased million during the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to the acquisition of Spartan Treating and the associated deferred tax attributes. We believe that it is more likely than not we will not realize all the tax benefits of the deferred tax assets within the allowable carryforward period. Therefore, an appropriate valuation allowance has been provided. 
 
 ASC 740, Income Taxes provides guidance on measurement and recognition in accounting for income tax uncertainties and provides related guidance on derecognition, classification, disclosure, interest, and penalties. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Partnership had no material unrecognized tax benefits (as defined in ASC 740-10). We do not expect to incur interest charges or penalties related to our tax positions, but if such charges or penalties are incurred, our policy is to account for interest charges as interest expense and penalties as tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

Diluted earnings per unit are computed using the treasury stock method which considers the potential future issuance of limited partner common units.

Based on this, our general partner has concluded that we operate in reportable segment.
