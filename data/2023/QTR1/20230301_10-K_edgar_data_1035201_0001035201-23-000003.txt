 Overview 
 California Water Service Group is a holding company with seven operating subsidiaries: California Water Service Company (Cal Water), New Mexico Water Service Company (New Mexico Water), Washington Water Service Company (Washington Water), Hawaii Water Service Company, Inc. (Hawaii Water), TWSC, Inc. (Texas Water), and CWS Utility Services and HWS Utility Services LLC (CWS Utility Services and HWS Utility Services LLC being referred to collectively in this annual report as Utility Services). Cal Water, New Mexico Water, Washington Water, and Hawaii Water are regulated public utilities. Texas Water holds regulated and contracted wastewater utilities. 
 The regulated utility entities also provide some non-regulated services. Utility Services holds non-utility property and provides non-regulated services to private companies and municipalities outside of California (see Non-Regulated Activities below for more details). Cal Water was the original operating company and began operations in 1926. 
 Our business is conducted through our operating subsidiaries and we provide utility services to approximately two million people. The bulk of the business consists of the production, purchase, storage, treatment, testing, distribution and sale of water for domestic, industrial, public and irrigation uses, and the provision of domestic and municipal fire protection services. In some areas, we provide wastewater collection and treatment services, including treatment which allows water recycling. We also provide non-regulated water-related services under agreements with municipalities and other private companies. The non-regulated services include full water system operation, billing and meter reading services. Non-regulated operations also include the lease of communication antenna sites, lab services and promotion of other non-regulated services. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, there were no significant changes in the kind of products produced or services rendered by our operating subsidiaries, or in the markets or methods of distribution.

 Regulated Business 
 California water operations are conducted by Cal Water, which provides service to approximately 496,400 customer connections in approximately 100 California communities through 21 separate districts, which are subject to regulation by the CPUC. California water operations accounted for approximately 89.8 of our total customer connections and 91.6 of our total consolidated operating revenue. 
 We operate the City of Hawthorne and the City of Commerce water systems under lease agreements. In accordance with the lease agreements, we receive all revenues from operating the systems and are responsible for paying the operating costs. The City of Hawthorne and the City of Commerce lease revenues are governed through their respective city councils and are considered non-regulated because they are outside of the CPUC's jurisdiction. We report revenue and expenses for the City of Hawthorne and City of Commerce leases in operating revenue and operating expenses because we are entitled to retain all customer billings and are responsible for all operating expenses. These leases are considered "nontariffed products and services" (NTPS) by the CPUC and require a 10 revenue sharing with regulated customers. 
 In October of 2011, an agreement was negotiated with the City of Hawthorne to lease and operate its water system. The system, which is located near the Hermosa Redondo district, serves about half of Hawthorne's population. The capital lease agreement required an up-front 8.1 million lease deposit to the city that is being amortized over the lease term. Additionally, annual lease payments are contracted to be adjusted based on changes in rates charged to customers. Under the lease, we are responsible for all aspects of system operation and capital improvements, although title to the system and system improvements reside with the city. Capital improvements are recorded as depreciable plant and equipment and depreciated per the asset lives set forth in the agreement. In exchange, we receive all revenue from the water system, which was 12.5 million, 11.4 million, and 10.5 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. At the end of the lease, the city is required to reimburse us for the unamortized value of capital improvements made during the term of the lease. The City of Hawthorne capital lease is a 15-year lease and expires in 2026. 
 In April of 2018, a renewal agreement was negotiated with the City of Commerce for us to continue to lease and to operate its water system for 15 years. Under the agreement, the operating lease requires us to pay 0.8 million per year in monthly installments. We have operated the City of Commerce water system since 1985 and are responsible for all operations, maintenance, water quality assurance, customer service programs, and financing capital improvements to provide a reliable supply of water that meets federal and state standards to customers served by the City of Commerce system. The City of Commerce retains title to the system and system improvements and remains responsible for setting its customers water rates. We bear the risks of operation and collection of amounts billed to customers. In exchange, we receive all revenue from the water system, which was 4.2 million, 3.4 million, and 2.9 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The agreement allows us to request a rate change annually in order to recover costs. 
 Hawaii Water provides service to approximately 6,200 water and wastewater customer connections on the islands of Maui, Oahu, and Hawaii, including several large resorts and condominium complexes. Hawaii Water's regulated customer connections are subject to the jurisdiction of the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission (HPUC). Hawaii Water accounts for 1.1 of our total customer connections and approximately 4.9 of our total consolidated operating revenue. 
 Washington Water provides domestic water service to approximately 37,500 customer connections in the Tacoma, Olympia, Graham, Spanaway, Puyallup, Rainier, Yelm, and Gig Harbor areas. Washington Water's utility operations are regulated by the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission. Washington Water accounts for approximately 6.8 of our total customer connections and approximately 2.6 of our total consolidated operating revenue.

Table of Contents 

 New Mexico Water provides service to approximately 10,700 water and wastewater customer connections in the Belen, Farmington, Los Lunas, Indian Hills, and Elephant Butte areas in New Mexico. New Mexico's regulated operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission (NMPRC). New Mexico Water accounts for approximately 1.9 of our total customer connections and 0.7 of our total consolidated operating revenue. 
 In May of 2021, Texas Water became the majority owner of BVRT Utility Holding Company (BVRT), a Texas-based utility development company owning and operating four wastewater utilities serving growing communities outside of Austin and San Antonio. Texas Water initially invested funds to enable BVRT to continue to build wastewater infrastructure and converted its investment to equity. BVRT s five wastewater utilities currently serve or are under contract to serve over 2,200 customer connections. On August 16, 2022, BVRT entered into a long-term water supply agreement with the Guadalupe Blanco River Authority (GBRA) that enables BVRT to receive up to 2,419 acre-feet of potable water annually (see Note 14 for more details). Texas Water accounts for approximately 0.4 of our total customer connections and 0.2 of our total consolidated operating revenue. 
 The state regulatory bodies governing our regulated operations are referred to as the Commissions in this annual report. Rates and operations for regulated customers are subject to the jurisdiction of the respective state's regulatory Commission. The Commissions require that water and wastewater rates for each regulated district are independently determined based on the cost of service. The Commissions are expected to authorize rates sufficient to recover normal operating expenses and allow the utility to earn a fair and reasonable return on invested capital. 
 We distribute and treat water and treat wastewater in accordance with accepted water utility methods. Where applicable, we hold franchises and permits in the cities and communities where we operate. The franchises and permits allow us to operate and maintain facilities in public streets and rights-of-way as necessary. 
 
 Non-Regulated Activities 
 Non-regulated revenue and expenses consist primarily of the operation of water systems that are owned by other entities under lease agreements, leasing of communication antenna sites on our properties, billing of optional third-party insurance programs to our residential customers, and unrealized gains or losses on benefit plan investments. 
 Fees for non-regulated activities are based on contracts negotiated between the parties. Under our non-regulated contract arrangements, we operate municipally owned water systems and privately owned water and recycled water distribution systems, but are not responsible for all operating costs. Non-regulated revenue received from non-leased water system operations is generally determined on a fee-per-customer basis. 
 In California, nearly all non-regulated activities are considered NTPS. The prescribed accounting for these NTPS is incremental cost allocation plus revenue sharing with regulated customers. Non-regulated services determined to be "active activities" require a 10 revenue sharing, and "passive activities" require a 30 revenue sharing. The amount of non-regulated revenues subject to revenue sharing is the total billed revenues less any authorized pass-through costs. Some examples of CPUC authorized pass-through costs are purchased water, purchased power, and pump taxes. All of our non-regulated services, except for leasing communication antenna sites on our properties, are "active activities" subject to a 10 revenue sharing. Leasing communication antenna sites on our properties are "passive activities" subject to a 30 revenue sharing. Cal Water's annual revenue sharing with regulated customers was 2.7 million, 3.1 million, and 2.5 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. 
 
 Operating Segment 
 We operate in one reportable segment, the supply and distribution of water and providing water-related utility services. For information about revenue from external customers, net income attributable to California Water Service Group and total assets, see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." 
 
 Growth 
 We intend to continue exploring opportunities to expand our regulated and non-regulated water and wastewater activities, particularly in the western United States. The opportunities could include system acquisitions, lease arrangements similar to the City of Hawthorne and City of Commerce contracts, utility development investments similar to the BVRT investment, full service system operation and maintenance agreements, meter reading, billing contracts and other utility-related services.

 Rates and Regulation 
 The Commissions have plenary powers setting both rates and operating standards. As such, the Commissions' decisions significantly impact the Company's revenues, earnings, and cash flows. The amounts discussed herein are generally annual amounts, unless otherwise stated, and the financial impact to recorded revenue is expected to occur over a 12-month period from the effective date of the decision. In California, water utilities are required to make several different types of filings. Certain filings, such as General Rate Case (GRC) filings, escalation rate increase filings, and offset filings, may result in rate changes that generally remain in place until the next GRC. As explained below, surcharges and surcredits to recover balancing and memorandum accounts as well as GRC interim rate relief are temporary rate changes, having specific time frames for recovery. 
 The CPUC follows a rate case plan which requires Cal Water to file a GRC for each of its regulated operating districts (except Grand Oaks) every three years. In a GRC proceeding the CPUC not only considers the utility's rate setting requests, but may also consider other issues that affect the utility's rates and operations. The CPUC is generally required to issue its GRC decision prior to the first day of the test year or authorize interim rates and an Interim Rates Memorandum Account (IRMA) or just an IRMA. In accordance with the rate case plan, Cal Water filed its most recent GRC filing in July of 2021 (2021 GRC Filing) requesting rate changes effective January 1, 2023. For additional information on our 2021 GRC Filing, see "Regulatory Activity - California". 
 Between GRC filings, Cal Water may file escalation rate increases, which allow Cal Water to recover cost increases, primarily from inflation and incremental investments, generally during the second and third years of the rate case cycle. However, escalation rate increases are district specific and subject to an earnings test. The CPUC may reduce a district s escalation rate increase if, in the most recent 13-month period, the earnings test reflects earnings in excess of what was authorized for that district. 
 In addition, California water utilities are entitled to make offset requests via advice letter. Offsets may be requested to adjust revenues for construction projects authorized in GRCs or recycled water projects when those capital projects go into service (these filings are referred to as "rate base offsets"), or for rate changes charged to Cal Water for purchased water, purchased power, and pump taxes (which are referred to as "expense offsets"). Rate changes approved in offset requests remain in effect until the next GRC is approved. 
 In pursuit of the State of California's water conservation goals, the CPUC decoupled Cal Water's revenue requirement from customer consumption levels in 2008 by authorizing a Water Revenue Adjustment Mechanism (WRAM) and Modified Cost Balancing Account (MCBA) for each district. The WRAM and MCBA were designed to ensure that Cal Water recovers revenues authorized by the CPUC regardless of customer consumption. This removed the historical disincentive against promoting lower water usage among customers. Through an annual advice letter filing, Cal Water can seek to recover any under-collected metered revenue amounts authorized, or refunds over-collected metered revenues, via surcharges and surcredits. The advice letters generally have been filed in April of each year and addressed the net WRAM and MCBA balances recorded for the previous calendar year. The majority of WRAM and MCBA balances have been collected or refunded through surcharges/surcredits over 12 and 18 months. The WRAM and MCBA amounts have been cumulative, so if they were not amortized in a given calendar year, the balance was carried forward and included with the following year balance. Cal Water also had a Sales Reconciliation Mechanism (SRM) in place for 2021 and 2022 (the second and third years of its 2018 GRC), that allowed the company to adjust its adopted sales forecast if actual sales vary from adopted sales by more than 5.0 in the prior year in a district. The SRM moderates the growth of the net WRAM and MCBA balances until the next GRC. 
 The CPUC issued a decision effective August 27, 2020 requiring that Class A companies submitting GRC filings after the effective date be (i) precluded from proposing the use of a full decoupling WRAM in their next GRCs and (ii) allowed the use of Monterey-Style Water Revenue Adjustment Mechanisms (MWRAM). In addition, the CPUC's decision allowed for Incremental Cost Balancing Accounts (ICBAs), which are authorized by state statute, to replace the MCBA. The MWRAM tracks the difference between the revenue received for actual metered sales through the tiered volumetric rate and the revenue that would have been received with the same actual metered sales if a uniform rate had been in effect. The ICBA tracks differences between the authorized per-unit prices of water production costs and actual per-unit prices of water production costs. Cal Water complied with this decision in its 2021 GRC Filing and expects these replacement mechanisms to be in effect for 2023.

 In September 2020, Cal Water filed an Application for Rehearing at the CPUC seeking to reverse the August 27, 2020 CPUC decision. While a decision was pending on the Application for Rehearing, Cal Water along with four other Class A California water utilities filed Petitions for a Writ of Review with the California Supreme Court (Court) on or about October 27, 2021. In September 2021, the CPUC denied the Application for Rehearing. On May 18, 2022, the Court issued writs granting review and ordered the CPUC and other filing parties to submit additional pleadings to the Court. The final pleadings were submitted on January 13, 2023. Cal Water anticipates that the Court will schedule an oral argument before it begins deliberations and issues its decision. 
 Regulatory Activity - California 
 2021 GRC Filing and Interim Rates Memorandum Account (IRMA) 
 On July 2, 2021, Cal Water filed its 2021 GRC requesting water infrastructure improvements of 1.0 billion in accordance with the rate case plan for all of its regulated operating districts (except Grand Oaks) for the years 2022, 2023, and 2024. The CPUC continues to evaluate the water infrastructure improvements along with operating budgets to establish water rates that reflect the actual cost of service. The CPUC also continues to evaluate Cal Water's proposed rate design changes that would improve revenue stability and provide a discounted unit rate to the first six units of water per month for residential customers. In the proposal, this block of usage would be charged at 25 of the second tier rate. The CPUC has recognized this six-unit block as essential for basic needs. As part of the rate design changes, Cal Water has proposed the use of a MWRAM and ICBA. The required filing was the start of an approximately 18-month review process, with any changes in customer rates scheduled to become effective on January 1, 2023. Cal Water proposed to the CPUC to increase revenues by 80.5 million, or 11.1 , in 2023; 43.6 million, or 5.4 , in 2024; and 43.2 million, or 5.1 , in 2025 to support these investments. If approved as filed, we expect that the average residential customer bill would increase less than 5 per month across all of Cal Water s service areas. 
 California Public Advocates Office, an independent consumer advocate at the CPUC, reviewed Cal Water's 2021 GRC Filing and submitted its report in February 2022. Cal Water reviewed California Public Advocates Office recommendations, evaluated the validity of the underlying data, and composed and filed rebuttal testimony with the CPUC in April 2022. Settlement negotiations with the California Public Advocates Office and intervenors began in the second quarter of 2022 and evidentiary hearings were held in the second quarter of 2022. A partial settlement with the California Public Advocates Office primarily addressing non-revenue matters was submitted on September 2, 2022. One intervenor submitted comments on the settlement on September 30, 2022, to which Cal Water filed a response. The CPUC continues to evaluate the proposal along with proposals of other parties. A final decision on the case was previously expected to be issued in late 2022 in accordance with the CPUC's Rates Case Plan, with new rates going into effect on January 1, 2023; however, due to unspecified delays at the CPUC, the timing of a final decision is uncertain. In January 2023, the CPUC issued a decision extending its statutory deadline until July 3, 2023. Normally, the CPUC is subject to a requirement to process applications within 18 months of filing. In our experience, it is the CPUC's practice to extend its statutory deadline, in some cases multiple times, as needed. If the partial settlement is not approved or is approved on terms less favorable to us, such approval or decision could have a material adverse impact on our revenue, operating results and earnings per share. Even if the partial settlement is approved on its current terms, there could be a material adverse impact on our revenue, operating results, and earnings per share on an interim basis if the case is materially delayed. However, we would expect this to be reversed at the time of a final decision through recognition of interim rate recovery. 
 In June of 2022, Cal Water filed a motion requesting authority to increase rates by inflation on January 1, 2023 and for the establishment of an IRMA in the event the CPUC does not issue a final decision for the 2021 GRC Filing in time for new rates to be implemented on January 1, 2023. In November of 2022, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) assigned to evaluate the motion granted Cal Water s request for the IRMA but did not authorize the inflation rate increase. Accordingly, on December 27, 2022, Cal Water requested that the IRMA, which was approved by the CPUC, track the difference between the current rates that continue to be billed starting January 1, 2023 (considered to be interim rates), and the rates that will eventually be approved pursuant to the CPUC's decision concerning Cal Water's 2021 GRC Filing plus any additional revenue changes approved since July 1, 2021 (final rates). After the CPUC's decision is issued and final rates are implemented, then we would expect the balance in the IRMA to be reviewed, and customer bills to be adjusted to account for the difference between interim rates and final rates back to January 1, 2023. 
 In January of 2023, Cal Water filed a motion requesting a modification to the November 2022 ruling on inflationary rate increases. In the motion, Cal Water requested inflationary rate increases of 1.5 in Marysville and 4 for all other ratemaking areas besides Selma, Travis Air Force Base, and Visalia for whom a rate increase was not requested. In February of 2023, the ALJ assigned to evaluate the motion granted Cal Water's request. Cal Water is expecting to implement the new rates April 15, 2023 and the new rates are expected to be considered interim rates as of the effective date of the implementation.

 Escalation Increase Requests 
 As a part of the decision on the 2018 GRC, Cal Water was authorized to request annual escalation rate increases for 2021 and 2022 for those districts that passed the earnings test. In November of 2021, Cal Water requested 2022 escalation rate increases for 19 of its regulated districts. The increase in annual adopted gross revenue associated with the November 2021 filing was 21.7 million. The new rates were implemented on January 1, 2022. 
 Expense Offset Requests 
 Expense offsets are dollar-for-dollar increases in revenue to match increased expenses, and therefore do not affect net operating income. In December of 2021, Cal Water submitted an advice letter to request offsets for increases in purchased water costs and pump taxes in seven of its regulated districts totaling 5.2 million. The new rates were implemented on January 1, 2022. 
 In June of 2022, Cal Water submitted an advice letter to request offsets for increases in purchased water costs and pump taxes in four of its regulated districts totaling 12.7 million. The new rates were implemented on August 1, 2022. 
 In December of 2022, Cal Water submitted an advice letter to request offsets for increases in purchased water costs and pump taxes in five of its regulated districts totaling 5.1 million. The new rates were implemented on January 1, 2023. 
 Rate Base Offset Requests 
 For construction projects authorized in GRCs as advice letter projects, Cal Water is allowed to request rate base offsets to increase revenues after the project goes into service. In November of 2021, Cal Water submitted an advice letter to recover 0.2 million of annual revenue increase for a rate base offset in one of its regulated districts. The new rates were implemented on January 1, 2022. 
 In March of 2022, Cal Water submitted an advice letter to recover 0.1 million of annual revenue increase for a rate base offset in one of its regulated districts. The new rates were implemented on April 15, 2022. 
 WRAM/MCBA Filings 
 In April of 2022, Cal Water submitted an advice letter to true up the revenue under-collections for the 2021 annual WRAMs/MCBAs of its regulated districts. A net under-collection of 54.1 million is being recovered/refunded from/to customers in the form of 12, 18, and greater-than-18-month surcharges and 12 month surcredits. The new rates incorporate net WRAM/MCBA balances that were previously approved for recovery and were implemented on April 15, 2022. 
 Cost of Capital Application 
 On May 3, 2021, after an approved extension from a 2020 due date, Cal Water filed its required application with the CPUC to review its cost of capital for 2022 through 2024. Cal Water currently has an approved return on equity of 9.2 , a cost of debt of 5.51 , and a capital structure of 53.4 equity to 46.6 debt ratio. Cal Water requested a return on equity of 10.35 , a cost of debt of 4.23 , and a capital structure of 53.4 equity to 46.6 debt ratio. The California Public Advocates Office recommended a return on equity of 7.81 , a cost of debt of 4.23 , and a capital structure of 49.4 equity to 50.6 debt ratio. Evidentiary hearings were held in May 2022 and the case was submitted to the CPUC at the end of the second quarter of 2022. We believe the CPUC will evaluate the proposal along with proposals of other parties, and, in accordance with its standard process, is currently expected to issue a decision no earlier than the second quarter of 2023. In the event that the CPUC adopts the cost of capital components retroactively to January 1, 2022, we estimate the reduced cost of debt, if adopted at our proposed equity capital structure, would reduce annual revenue by approximately 11.0 million. We have not reserved for any potential outcome of the proceeding as we have determined that it is not probable that the proceeding will be approved retroactively to January 1, 2022. 
 California Drought Memorandum Account (DRMA) 
 In June of 2021, Cal Water submitted advice letters to request a DRMA to track, for potential future recovery, the incremental operational and administrative costs incurred to further implement updated Rule 14.1 for voluntary conservation measures and Schedule 14.1 for implementation of our Water Shortage Contingency Plan, which includes activities related to enhanced conservation efforts, staffing, and capital expenditures to ensure a safe, reliable supply of water. The DRMA was approved by the CPUC with an effective date of June 14, 2021. The DRMA also tracks monies paid by customers for fines, penalties, or other compliance measures associated with water use violations; and penalties paid by Cal Water to its water wholesalers. Cal Water has incurred 1.3 million of DRMA related costs in 2022 as compared to 0.6 million in 2021.

 California's Governor has issued a drought declaration for all California counties through a series of State of Emergency Proclamations with the most recent on March 28, 2022. Given these drought proclamations and current water usage levels in all of its service areas, Cal Water has activated Stage 2 of the Water Use Restrictions of its Water Shortage Contingency Plan (WSCP) of Schedule 14.1 in all of its service areas; as a result, Cal Water has seen increase in DRMA related costs in 2022. 
 In Stage 1, irrigating ornamental landscape with potable water is prohibited during the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. For Stage 2, irrigating ornamental landscapes with potable water is limited to no more than three days per week as well as prohibited during the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. In addition this stage states that new connections may not install single-pass cooling systems for air conditioning or other cooling system applications unless required for health or safety reasons. 
 Drought Response Memorandum Account (DREMA) 
 In December of 2022, Cal Water received approval for a DREMA to track lost revenues, for potential future recovery, associated with reduced sales as a result of the activation of Rule 14.1 and Schedule 14.1 of its WSCP in all of its service territories. The request is consistent with the CPUC's drought procedures which allow companies without full decoupling mechanisms to track lost revenues, subject to a 20 basis points return on equity adjustment, associated with the reduced sales as a result of the activation of either Rule 14.1 or Schedule 14.1. As Cal Water's full decoupling mechanisms ended on December 31, 2022, the DREMA became effective as of January 1, 2023. 
 Palos Verdes Peninsula Water Reliability Project (Project) 
 In 2002, Cal Water commissioned a Water System Master Plan (Master Plan) for the Palos Verdes water system. The Master Plan identified the high-priority need to augment the existing potable water system with new transmission mains and a new pump station to improve the capacity and reliability of the water system. This resulted in the development of a capital project known as the Project. Before the Project, a single pipeline that is over 60 years old delivered potable water to approximately 90 percent of the Peninsula, and a second pipeline of the same age delivered water to the remaining 10 percent. Both of these pipelines were approaching the end of their useful lives. 
 The CPUC authorized Cal Water to recover revenue associated with costs up to a cap of 96.1 million after the Project is in service, subject to the CPUC s reasonableness review. In 2020, the Project was completed and an Advice Letter 2387 asking for authority to increase rates reflecting the Project costs up to the cap, with an effective date of August 27, 2020 was filed. The advice letter was approved on January 29, 2021. New rates were implemented on February 1, 2021, with the revenue requirement being effective as of August 27, 2020. 
 Due to the complexity of the project, total project costs exceeded the advice letter cap of 96.1 million. Total project costs incurred as of the end of 2022 were 117.2 million. Amongst other things, the 2021 GRC Filing requested an additional 6.4 million of capital costs to be included in base rates plus authority to open a memorandum account allowing Cal Water to track incremental capital-related costs associated with this project. The remaining 14.7 million of capital costs not in base rates will be tracked in the memorandum account for possible future recovery. 
 Regulatory Activity - Other States 
 Kona Water Service Company GRC (Hawaii Water) 
 In May of 2021, Hawaii Water submitted a request for a private letter ruling (PLR) to the IRS on the treatment of deferred taxes because of the Tax Cuts Jobs Act (TCJA). A favorable decision on the PLR was received on November 18, 2021. The Consumer Advocacy, a division within the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs of the State of Hawaii that is responsible for matters related to regulated utilities, and Hawaii Water submitted a joint stipulation to the Hawaii Public Utility Commission (HPUC) incorporating the PLR into revised water rates on March 2, 2022. Hawaii Water received approval on December 15, 2022 from the HPUC. 
 HOH Utilities Company (Hawaii Water) 
 In June of 2021, Hawaii Water signed an agreement to acquire the assets of HOH Utilities Company, a wastewater utility located in the growing Poipu/Koloa area of Kauai County on the island of Kauai. 
 Hawaii Water will own and manage the wastewater utility, which currently serves almost 1,800 residential, commercial, and resort customer equivalent units in Poipu and Koloa, including three hotels, condominiums, multi-family housing, a golf course, and single-family homes. 
 Hawaii Water received HPUC approval for the acquisition in June of 2022 and is expecting the acquisition to close by the second quarter of 2023. The acquisition is subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.

 Keauhou Community Services, Inc. (Hawaii Water) 
 In December 2020, Hawaii Water entered into an asset purchase agreement with Keauhou Community Services, Inc. (KCSI). KCSI is a utility that provides wastewater service in the Keauhou area of North Kona on the island of Hawaii. An application for approval of the transaction was submitted to the HPUC in October of 2021 and was approved in December of 2022. Accordingly, the transaction closed and Hawaii Water took control over the system on December 15, 2022. 
 Hawaii Water has operated the system under an operations and maintenance agreement since 2018. Hawaii Water now owns and operates the utility, which consists of residential, commercial, and resort customers. 
 Kalaeloa Water Company GRC (Hawaii Water) 
 In August of 2021, a GRC application requesting an increase of revenues for Kalaeloa was submitted with the HPUC. In June of 2022, Hawaii Water and the Consumer Advocacy submitted a full settlement agreement to the HPUC for approval. The HPUC issued a decision approving the settlement agreement in September of 2022. The approval increased authorized revenue for Kalaeloa by 0.15 million or 4.9 . 
 2021 Washington Water GRC (Washington Water) 
 On July 15, 2021, Washington Water filed a GRC application with the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (WUTC) requesting a phased-in consolidation of its East Pierce Water System with its legacy Washington Water system. The requested annual revenue increase was 3.1 million and was proposed to be implemented over 3 years. After working with the WUTC and Public Counsel, a unit of the Washington Attorney General's Office that represents customers of state-regulated, investor-owned utility companies in certain matters, Washington Water updated its application on February 2, 2022 with a revised annual revenue increase of 1.0 million and eliminated the 3-year rate increase proposal. The WUTC approved the GRC application on February 10, 2022 with an effective date of February 15, 2022. 
 Animas Valley Land and Water Co., LLC (New Mexico Water) 
 In October of 2020, New Mexico Water signed a purchase agreement with Animas Valley Land and Water Co., LLC (AV Water) and court-appointed receiver C. Randel Lewis to acquire the Morning Star Water System assets of AV Water and provide regulated water utility service to its approximately 2,000 customer connections in northwest New Mexico. 
 In April of 2022, New Mexico Water closed its purchase of the Morningstar Water system. In February of 2022, the NMPRC approved of the transaction. New Mexico water closed the purchase and commenced operation of the water system as of April 14, 2022. 
 Lake Section Water Company (New Mexico Water) 
 In January of 2023, New Mexico Water signed an agreement to purchase the assets of Lake Section Water Company (Lake Section), a utility located in Chapparal, N.M. The acquisition is subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions and approval by the NMPRC. As part of the purchase, New Mexico Water has agreed to own and operate the Lake Section water system, which serves approximately 5,000 customer connections about 110 miles south of New Mexico Water s Elephant Butte system in the greater El Paso, Texas, metropolitan area. 
 
 Water Supply 
 Our source of supply varies among our operating districts. Certain districts obtain all of their supply from wells; some districts purchase all of their supply from wholesale suppliers; and other districts obtain supply from a combination of wells and wholesale suppliers. A small portion of supply comes from surface sources and is processed through Company-owned water treatment plants. To the best of management's knowledge, we are meeting water quality, environmental, and other regulatory standards for all Company-owned systems. 
 Historically, approximately half of our annual water supply is pumped from wells. State groundwater management agencies operate differently in each state. Some of our wells extract ground water from water basins under state ordinances. These are adjudicated groundwater basins, in which a court has settled the dispute between landowners, or other parties over how much annual groundwater can be extracted by each party. All of our adjudicated groundwater basins are located in the State of California. Our annual groundwater extraction from adjudicated groundwater basins approximates 5.7 billion gallons or 10.8 of our total annual water supply pumped from wells. Historically, we have extracted less than 100 of our annual adjudicated groundwater rights and have the right to carry forward up to 20 of the unused amount to the next annual period. All of our remaining wells extract ground water from managed or unmanaged water basins. There are no set limits for the ground water extracted from these water basins. Our annual groundwater extraction from managed groundwater basins approximates 31.5 billion gallons or 59.9 of our total annual water supply pumped from wells. Our annual groundwater 
 13 

Table of Contents 

 extraction from unmanaged groundwater basins approximates 15.4 billion gallons or 29.3 of our total annual water supply pumped from wells. Most of the managed groundwater basins we extract water from have groundwater recharge facilities. We are required to financially support these groundwater recharge facilities by paying well pump taxes. Our well pump taxes for 2022, 2021, and 2020 were 16.2 million, 15.3 million, and 12.6 million, respectively. In 2014, the State of California enacted the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act of 2014 (SGM Act). The law and its implementing regulations required most basins to select a sustainability agency by 2017, develop a sustainability plan by the end of 2022, and show progress toward sustainability by 2027. We expect that after the SGM Act's provisions are fully implemented, substantially all the Company's California groundwater will be produced from sustainably managed and adjudicated basins. 
 California's normal weather pattern yields little precipitation between mid-spring and mid-fall. The Washington Water service areas receive precipitation in all seasons, with the heaviest amounts during the winter. New Mexico Water's rainfall is heaviest in the summer monsoon season. Hawaii Water receives precipitation throughout the year, with the largest amounts in the winter months. Typically water usage in all service areas is highest during the warm and dry summers and declines in the cool winter months. Rain and snow during the winter months in California replenish underground water aquifers and fill reservoirs, providing the water supply for subsequent delivery to customers. As of February 10, 2023, the State of California snowpack water content during the 2022-2023 water year was 165 of long-term averages (per the California Department of Water Resources, Northern Sierra Precipitation Accumulation report). The northern Sierra region is the most important for the state s urban water supplies. The central and southern portions of the Sierras have recorded 197 and 230 , respectively, of long-term averages. Management believes that supply pumped from underground aquifers and purchased from wholesale suppliers will be adequate to meet customer demand during 2023 and thereafter. Long-term water supply plans are developed for each of our districts to help assure an adequate water supply under various operating and supply conditions. Some districts have unique challenges in meeting water quality standards, but management believes that supplies will meet current standards using currently available treatment processes. 
 On May 31, 2018, California's Governor signed two bills (Assembly Bill 1668 and Senate Bill 606) into law that were intended to establish long-term standards for water use efficiency. The bills revise and expand the existing urban water management plan requirements to include five-year drought risk assessments, water shortage contingency plans, and annual water supply/demand assessments. The California State Water Resources Control Board, in conjunction with the California Department of Water Resources, is expected to establish long-term water use standards for indoor residential use, outdoor residential use, water losses, and other uses. Cal Water will also be required to calculate and report on urban water use target by November 1, 2023 and each November 1 thereafter, that compares actual urban water use to the target. Management believes that Cal Water is well positioned to comply with all such regulations.

 The Bear Gulch district obtains a portion of its water supply from surface runoff from the local watershed. The Oroville district in the Sacramento Valley, the Bakersfield district in the San Joaquin Valley, and the Kern River Valley district in the Los Angeles Area purchase water from a surface supply. Surface sources are processed through our water treatment plants before being delivered to the distribution system. The Bakersfield district also purchases treated water as a component of its water supply. 
 The Chico, Marysville, Dixon, and Willows districts in the Sacramento Valley, the Salinas Valley Region district in the Salinas Valley, the Selma and Visalia districts in the San Joaquin Valley, and the Travis Air Force Base in Solano County obtain their entire supply from wells. 
 Purchases for the Los Altos, Livermore, Oroville, Redwood Valley, Stockton, and Bakersfield districts are pursuant to long-term contracts expiring on various dates after 2022. The water supplies purchased for the Dominguez, East Los Angeles, Hermosa Redondo, Palos Verdes, and Westlake districts as well as the Hawthorne and Commerce systems are provided by public agencies pursuant to a statutory obligation of continued non-preferential service to purveyors within the agencies' boundaries. Purchases for the Bayshore and Bear Gulch districts are in accordance with long-term contracts with the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) until June 30, 2034.

 Seasonal Fluctuations 
 In California, our customers' consumption pattern of water varies with the weather, in terms of rainfall and temperature. When setting customer rates, the CPUC considers the historical pattern in determining the adopted sales and production costs. With a majority of our sales expected to be subject to the MWRAM and per-unit variations in production costs being covered by the ICBA, fluctuations in financial results are expected to be moderated once the MWRAM and ICBA mechanisms are approved by the CPUC. However, cash flows from operations and short-term borrowings on our credit facilities can be significantly impacted by seasonal fluctuations including recovery of the MWRAM and ICBA. 
 Our water business is seasonal in nature. Weather conditions can have a material effect on customer usage. Customer demand for water generally is lower during the cooler and rainy winter months. Demand increases in the spring when warmer weather returns and the rains end, and customers use more water for outdoor purposes such as landscape irrigation. Warm temperatures during the generally dry summer months result in increased demand. Water usage declines during the late fall as temperatures decrease and the rainy season begins. During years in which precipitation is especially heavy or extends beyond the spring into the early summer, customer demand can decrease from historic normal levels, generally due to reduced outdoor water usage. Likewise, an early start to the rainy season during the fall can cause a decline in customer usage. As a result, seasonality of water usage has a significant impact on our cash flows from operations and borrowing on our short-term facilities.

 We have continually extended, enlarged, and replaced our facilities as required to meet increasing demands and to maintain the water systems. We obtain construction financing using funds from operations, long-term financing, advances for construction and contributions in aid of construction that are funded by developers. Advances for construction are cash deposits from developers for construction of water facilities or water facilities deeded from developers. These advances are generally refundable without interest over a period of 40 years in equal annual payment amounts and developer-installed facilities are exempt from corporate income taxes. Contributions in aid of construction consist of nonrefundable cash deposits or facilities transferred from developers, primarily for fire protection and relocation projects. We cannot control the amounts received from developers. This amount fluctuates from year-to-year as the level of construction activity carried on by developers varies. This activity is impacted by the demand for housing, commercial development, and general business conditions, including interest rates. 
 See Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources" for additional information. 
 
 Energy Reliability 
 We continue to seek to use power efficiently to minimize the power expenses passed on to our customers, and maintain backup power systems to continue water service to our customers if the power companies' supplies are interrupted. If future legislation limits emissions from the power generation process, our cost of power may increase. Any increase in the per-unit cost of power would be expected to be passed along to our California customers through the ICBA or included in our cost of service paid by our customers as requested in our GRC filings. Many of our well sites are equipped with emergency electric generators designed to produce electricity to keep the wells operating during power outages. Storage tanks also provide customers with water during blackout periods. 
 During 2022, 2021, and 2020 we leased additional emergency generators to respond to potential PSPSs, an electric utility operating paradigm approved by the CPUC. 
 
 Security at Company Facilities 
 Due to terrorism and other risks, we have heightened security at our facilities and have taken added precautions to protect our employees and the water delivered to customers. In 2002, federal legislation was enacted that resulted in new regulations concerning security of water facilities, including submitting vulnerability assessment studies to the federal government. We have complied with regulations issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pursuant to federal legislation concerning vulnerability assessments and have made filings to the EPA as required. In addition, communication plans have been developed as a component of our procedures. While we do not make public comments on our security programs, we have been in contact with federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to coordinate and improve our water delivery systems' security.

 In accordance with the 2018 America s Water Infrastructure Act (AWIA), we are required to conduct additional risk and resilience assessments and develop emergency response plans for each of our water systems. These assessments and plans include natural hazards as well as malevolent acts. The first such assessments were filed in 2020. They are scheduled to be reviewed and resubmitted every five years. 
 While we do not make public comments on our security programs, we have been in contact with federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to coordinate and improve our water delivery systems' security 
 
 Competition and Condemnation 
 Our principal operations are regulated by the Commission of each state. Under state laws, no privately owned public utility may compete within any service territory that we already serve without first obtaining a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the applicable Commission. Issuance of such a certificate would only be made upon finding that our service is deficient. To management's knowledge, no application to provide service to an area served by us has been made. 
 State law in California provides that whenever a public agency constructs facilities to extend a utility system into the service area of a privately owned public utility, such an act constitutes the taking of property and requires reimbursement to the utility for its loss. State law in Washington and other states recognize chartered service areas but do not have specific statutes. State statutes allow municipalities, water districts and other public agencies to own and operate water systems. These agencies are empowered to condemn properties already operated by privately owned public utilities. The agencies are also authorized to issue bonds, including revenue bonds, for the purpose of acquiring or constructing water systems. However, if a public agency were to acquire utility property by eminent domain action, the utility would be entitled to just compensation for its loss. In Washington, annexation was approved in February 2008 for property served by us on Orcas Island; however, we continue to serve the customers in the annexed area and do not expect the annexation to affect our operations. To management's knowledge, other than the Orcas Island property, no municipality, water district, or other public agency is contemplating or has any action pending to acquire or condemn any of our systems. 
 
 Government Regulations 
 Our water and wastewater services are governed by various federal and state environmental protection, health and safety laws, and regulations. These provisions establish criteria for drinking water and for discharges of water, wastewater, and airborne substances. The EPA, state water quality regulators, and other state regulatory authorities promulgate numerous nationally and locally applicable standards, including maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for drinking water. We believe we are currently in compliance with all of the MCLs promulgated to date. 
 Environmental Matters 
 Our operations are subject to environmental regulation by various governmental authorities. Environmental health and safety programs have been designed to provide compliance with water discharge regulations, underground and above-ground fuel storage tank regulations, hazardous materials management plans, hazardous waste regulations, air quality permitting requirements, wastewater discharge limitations, and employee safety issues related to hazardous materials. In addition, we actively investigate alternative technologies for meeting environmental regulations and continue the traditional practices of meeting environmental regulations. 
 For a description of the material effects that compliance with environmental regulations may have on us, see Item 1A. "Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Regulatory Environment." We expect environmental regulation to increase, resulting in higher operating costs in the future, and there can be no assurance that the Commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs. 
 Quality of Water Supply 
 Our operating practices are designed to produce potable water in accordance with accepted water utility practices. Water entering the distribution systems from surface sources is treated in compliance with federal and state Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) standards. Most well supplies are chlorinated or chloraminated for disinfection. Water samples from each water system are analyzed on a regular, scheduled basis in compliance with regulatory requirements. We operate a state-certified water quality laboratory at the San Jose Customer Support Services Office that provides testing for most of our California operations. Certain tests in California are contracted with independent certified labs qualified under the Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program. Local independent state certified labs provide water sample testing for the Washington, New Mexico and Hawaii operations.

Table of Contents 

 In recent years, federal and state water quality regulations have resulted in increased water sampling requirements. The SDWA continues to be used to monitor and regulate additional potential contaminants to address public health concerns. The State of California has continued to adopt new water quality regulations, which may be in addition to those adopted by the EPA. We monitor water quality standard changes and upgrade our treatment capabilities to maintain compliance with the various regulations. 
 Impact of Climate Change Legislation and Regulation 
 Our operations depend on power provided by other public utilities and, in emergencies, power generated by our portable and fixed generators. If future legislation limits emissions from the power generation process, our cost of power may increase. Any increase in the cost of power would be expected to be passed along to our California customers through the ICBA or included in our cost of service paid by our customers as requested in our GRC filings. 
 We maintain a fleet of vehicles to provide service to our customers, including a number of heavy-duty diesel vehicles that were retrofitted to meet California emission standards. If future legislation further affects the cost to operate the fleet or the fleet acquisition cost in order to meet certain emission standards, it would increase our cost of service and our rate base. Any increase in fleet operating costs associated with meeting emission standards would be expected to be included in our cost of service paid by our customers as requested in our GRC filings. While recovery of these costs is not guaranteed, we would expect recovery in the regulatory process. 
 Under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), all capital projects of a certain type (primarily wells, tanks, major pipelines, and treatment facilities) require mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. The cost to prepare the CEQA documentation and permit are expected to be included in our capital cost and added to our rate base, which is expected to be requested to be paid for by our customers. Any increase in the operating cost of the facilities would also be expected to be included in our cost of service paid by our customers as requested in our GRC filings. While recovery of these costs is not guaranteed, we would expect recovery in the regulatory process. 
 Cap and trade regulations were implemented in 2012 with the goal of reducing emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2020. These regulations have not affected water utilities at this time. In the future, if we are required to comply with these regulations, any increase in operating costs associated with meeting these standards will be included in our cost of service paid by our customers as requested in our GRC filings. While recovery of these costs is not guaranteed, we would expect recovery in the regulatory process. 
 
 Human Capital Resources 
 We believe our employees are our most important resources and are critical to our continued success. We focus significant attention on attracting and retaining talented and experienced individuals to manage and support our operations. We offer our employees a broad range of company-paid benefits, and we believe our compensation package and benefits are competitive with others in our industry. Additional information about our employee benefit plans is included in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 We are committed to hiring, developing and supporting a diverse and inclusive workplace. Our employees are expected to exhibit and promote honest, ethical, and respectful conduct in the workplace. All of our employees must adhere to a code of conduct that sets standards for appropriate behavior and includes required internal training on preventing, identifying, reporting and stopping any type of discrimination. 
 Employee health and safety in the workplace is one of the Company s core values. Safety efforts are led by the Corporate Safety Committee and supported by safety committees that operate at the local level. Hazards in the workplace are actively identified and management tracks incidents so remedial actions can be taken to improve workplace safety. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored for us the importance of keeping our employees safe and healthy. In response to the pandemic, the Company has taken actions aligned with the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to protect its workforce so they can more safely and effectively perform their work. 
 Our management team supports a culture of developing future leaders from our existing workforce, enabling us to promote from within for many leadership positions. We believe this provides long-term focus and continuity to our operations while also providing opportunities for the growth and advancement of our employees. Our focus on retention is evident in the length of service of our management team. The average tenure of our management team is over 15 years.

 Employee levels are managed to align with the pace of business and management believes it has sufficient human capital to operate its business successfully. Management believes that the Company's employee relations are favorable. At December 31, 2022, we had 1,225 employees, including 1,077 at Cal Water, 80 at Washington Water, 49 at Hawaii Water, 19 at New Mexico Water, and no employees at Texas Water. In California, the Utility Workers Union of America (UWUA), AFL-CIO represents our non-exempt field, customer service, and non-confidential clerical employees and the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE), AFL-CIO represents our professional and technical engineering and water quality laboratory employees. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 659 employees represented by the UWUA and 85 employees represented by the IFPTE. In 2021, we reached a six-year agreement with both unions on a new contract that runs from May 14, 2021 (UWUA) and October 4, 2021 (IFPTE) through February 28, 2027. We believe this agreement continues to provide our employees with a market competitive pay and benefits package. 
 Employees at Hawaii Water, Washington Water, and New Mexico Water are not represented by a labor union.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 In evaluating our business, you should carefully consider the following discussion of material risks, events and uncertainties that make an investment in us speculative or risky in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A manifestation of any of the following risks and uncertainties could, in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, materially and adversely affect our business, growth, reputation, prospects, operating and financial results, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity, and stock price. We note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors; our operations could also be affected by factors, events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. Therefore, you should not consider the following risks to be a complete statement of all the potential risks or uncertainties that we face.

 Risks Related to Our Regulatory Environment 
 Our business is heavily regulated by state and federal regulatory agencies and our financial viability depends upon our ability to recover costs from our customers through rates that must be approved by state public utility commissions. 
 California Water Service Company, New Mexico Water Service Company, Washington Water Service Company, and Hawaii Water Service Company, Inc. are regulated public utilities, which provide water and water-related service to our customers. Additionally, Hawaii Water Service Company, Inc. and TWSC, Inc. own in whole or in part other companies which are regulated public utilities. The rates that we charge our water customers are subject to the jurisdiction of the regulatory Commissions in the states in which we operate. These Commissions may set water and water-related rates for each operating district independently because the systems are not interconnected. The Commissions authorize us to charge rates that they consider sufficient to recover normal operating expenses, to provide funds for adding new or replacing water infrastructure, and to allow us to earn what the Commissions consider to be a fair and reasonable return on invested capital. 
 Our revenues and consequently our ability to meet our financial objectives are dependent upon the rates we are authorized to charge our customers by the Commissions and our ability to recover our costs in these rates. Our management uses forecasts, models and estimates in order to set rates that we believe will provide a fair and reasonable return on our invested capital. While our rates must be approved by the Commissions, no assurance can be given that our forecasts, models and estimates will be correct or that the Commissions will agree with our forecasts, models and estimates. If our rates are set too low, our revenues may be insufficient to cover our operating expenses, capital expenditure requirements and desired dividend levels. 
 We periodically file rate increase applications with the Commissions. The ensuing administrative and hearing process may be lengthy and costly. The decisions of the Commissions are beyond our control and we can provide no assurances that our rate increase requests will be granted by the Commissions. Even if approved, there is no guarantee that approval will be given in a timely manner or at a sufficient level to cover our expenses and provide a reasonable return on our investment. If the rate increase decisions are delayed, our earnings may be adversely affected. For example, the CPUC did not issue its decision on our 2018 GRC until December 2020, approximately one year later than expected, which caused some financial and operating uncertainty for the Company until that time. 
 Our evaluation of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets is subject to adjustment by regulatory agencies and any such adjustment could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Regulatory decisions may affect prospective revenues and earnings, affect the timing of the recognition of revenues and expenses and may overturn past decisions used in determining our revenues and expenses. While, our management continually evaluates the anticipated recovery of regulatory assets and revenues subject to refund and provides for allowances and/or reserves as deemed necessary, no assurance can be given that any such allowances and/or reserves will be adequate to cover any loss or adjustment due to the absence of our limited recovery of regulatory assets and revenues as a result of regulatory decisions. Current accounting procedures allow us to defer certain costs if we believe it is probable that we will be allowed to recover those costs through future rate increases. If the Commissions determined that a portion of our assets were not recoverable in customer rates, we may suffer an asset impairment, which would require a write down in such asset's valuation that would be recorded through operations. 
 If our assessment as to the probability of recovery through the ratemaking process is later determined to be incorrect, the associated regulatory asset would be adjusted to reflect the change in our assessment or any regulatory disallowances. A change in our evaluation of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets or a regulatory disallowance of all or a portion of our cost could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. 
 Regulatory agencies may disagree with our valuation and characterization of certain of our assets. 
 If we determine that assets are no longer used or useful for utility operations, we may remove them from our rate base and subsequently sell those assets with any gain on sales accruing to the stockholders, subject to certain conditions. If the Commissions disagree with our characterization, there is a risk that the Commissions could determine that realized appreciation in property value should be awarded to customers rather than our stockholders.

 Changes in laws, rules, and policies of our regulators or operating jurisdictions can significantly affect our business. 
 Regulatory agencies may change their rules and policies for various reasons, including changes in the local political environment. Regulators are elected by popular vote or are appointed by elected officials, and the election of a new administration or the appointment of new officials due to the results of elections may result in dramatic change to the long-established rules and policies of an agency. For example, in 2020 regulation regarding full decoupling WRAMs changed in California. Since 2008, the CPUC allowed full decoupling WRAMs. However, in 2020, the CPUC precluded companies from proposing full decoupling WRAMs in their next GRC filings. The decision by the CPUC to change its policy began to affect our business in 2023. 
 We rely on policies and regulations promulgated by the various state commissions in order to recover capital expenditures, maintain favorable treatment on gains from the sale of real property, offset certain production and operating costs, recover the cost of debt, maintain an optimal equity structure without over-leveraging, and have financial and operational flexibility to engage in non-regulated operations. If any of the Commissions with jurisdiction over us implements policies and regulations that do not allow us to accomplish some or all of the items listed above, our future operating results may be adversely affected. 
 In addition, legislatures may repeal, relax or tighten existing laws, or enact new laws that affect the regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over our business or affect our business directly. If changes in existing laws or the implementation of new laws limit our ability to accomplish some of our business objectives, our future operating results may be adversely affected. 
 Finally, local jurisdictions may impose new ordinances, laws, fees, and regulations that could increase costs or limit our operations in ways, which affect future operating results. Cities may impose or amend franchise requirements, impose conditions on underground construction or land use, impose various taxes and fees, or restrict our hours for construction, among other things. In the last decade, more cities have imposed excavation moratoria or paving rules, which has required more costly construction than anticipated. 
 We expect environmental health and safety regulation to increase, resulting in higher operating costs in the future and the potential that the company fails to meet these regulatory standards. 
 Our water and wastewater services are governed by various federal and state environmental protection, health and safety laws, and regulations. Although we have a water quality assurance program in place, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to comply with all standards. If we violate any federal or state regulations or laws governing health and safety, we could be subject to substantial fines or otherwise sanctioned, subject to potential civil liability for damages, and our customers' trust in our operations ability could be eroded. 
 Environmental health and safety laws are complex and change frequently. They have tended to become more stringent over time. As new or stricter standards are introduced, they could increase our operating costs. Although we would likely seek permission to recover these costs through rate increases, we can give no assurance that the Commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs. 
 We are required to test our water quality for certain chemicals and potential contaminants on a regular basis. If the test results indicate that our water exceeds allowable limits, we may be required either to commence treatment to remove the contaminant or to develop an alternate water source. Either of these results may be costly. Although we would likely seek permission to recover these through rate increases, there can be no assurance that the Commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs. 
 Past events in the utility sector, including those in Flint, Michigan and related to Pacific Gas and Electric Company in California, show that failure to meet one or more water quality, environmental, or safety standards can have severe effects on customer trust, reputation, regulatory treatment, or civil and criminal liability. 
 New and/or more stringent water quality regulations could increase our operating costs. 
 We are subject to water quality standards set by federal, state, and local authorities that have the power to issue new regulations. Compliance with new regulations that are more stringent than current regulations could increase our operating costs. 
 In August of 2009, the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment within the California Environmental Protection Agency changed the water quality standard for TCP in our water supply. The standard implemented requires us to have 0.0007 parts per billion or less of TCP in our California water supply. We have incurred costs associated with the compliance of this TCP standard and expect to continue to incur costs in the future. Although we would likely seek permission to recover these additional costs through the GRC process, we can give no assurance that the CPUC would approve the recovery of these additional compliance costs.

 Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are two water contaminants of emerging concern. Although a water quality standard has yet to be set by federal or state regulators, preliminary testing, and guidance from the California Environmental Protection Agency has affected our operations of some wells in California. We expect that a water quality standard will be set in the future and that we will incur costs to comply with the water quality standard. Cal Water has requested and been approved to use a memorandum account to track the incremental compliance costs in the future and we would likely seek permission to recover additional costs of compliance through rate increases; however, we can give no assurance that the CPUC would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs. 
 Legislation and regulation designed to mitigate or adapt to climate change may affect our operations. 
 Future legislation or regulation regarding climate change may restrict our operations or impose new costs on our business. Our operations depend on power provided by other public utilities and, in emergencies, power generated by our portable and fixed generators. If future legislation or regulation limits emissions from the power generation process, our cost of power may increase. Although any increase in the cost of power would be expected to be passed along to our California customers through the ICBA or included in our cost of service paid by our customers as requested in our GRC filings in California, we can give no assurance that such costs would be passed along to our California customers or that the CPUC would approve rate increases to enable us to recover such expenditures or costs. 
 We have been and may in the future be party to environmental and product-related lawsuits, which could result in us paying damages not covered by insurance. 
 We have been and may be in the future, party to water contamination lawsuits, which may not be fully covered by insurance. 
 The number of environmental and product-related lawsuits against other water utilities has increased in frequency in recent years. If we are subject to additional environmental or product-related lawsuits, we might incur significant legal costs and it is uncertain whether we would be able to recover the legal costs from customers or other third parties. In addition, if current California law regarding CPUC's preemptive jurisdiction over regulated public utilities for claims about compliance with California Department of Health Services and United States EPA water quality standards changes, our legal exposure may be significantly increased. 
 Risks Related to Our Business Operations 
 We may be at risk for litigation under the principle of inverse condemnation for activities in the normal course of business, which have a damaging effect on private property. 
 The California constitution may allow compensation to property owners for a public utility taking or damaging private property, even when damage occurs through no fault of the utility and regardless of whether the damage could be foreseen by the utility. As a result, this doctrine, which is known as inverse condemnation and is routinely invoked in California, imposes strict liability for damages, including legal fees, because of the design, construction, and maintenance of utility facilities. In addition to claims that our water or wastewater systems damaged property, Cal Water could be sued under inverse condemnation if its facilities or operations damage private property, or if it is unable to timely deliver sufficient quantities of water for firefighting because of system capacity limitations or water supply disruptions, including as a result of action taken by an electric utility pursuant to a PSPS program or other loss of power. Although the imposition of liability is premised on the assumption that utilities have the ability to recover these costs from their customers, there is no assurance that the CPUC would allow Cal Water to recover any such damage awards from customers. For example, in December 2017, the CPUC denied recovery of costs that San Diego Gas Electric Company incurred because of inverse condemnation, holding that the inverse condemnation principles of strict liability are not relevant to the CPUC s prudent manager standard. 
 The effects of natural disasters, attacks by third parties, pandemics, or poor water quality or contamination to our water supply may result in disruption in our services and litigation, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 We operate in areas that are prone to earthquakes, fires, mudslides and other natural disasters. A significant seismic event or other natural disaster in California where our operations are concentrated could adversely affect our ability to deliver water and adversely affect our costs of operations. A major disaster could damage or destroy substantial capital assets. The CPUC has historically allowed utilities to establish a catastrophic event memorandum account as another possible mechanism to recover costs. However, we can give no assurance that the CPUC or any other commission would allow any such cost recovery mechanism in the future.

 Our water supplies are subject to contamination, including contamination from the development of naturally-occurring compounds, chemicals in groundwater systems, pollution resulting from fabricated sources, such as TCP, seawater incursion and possible third-party attacks, including physical attacks, terrorist attacks, and cyber-attacks. If our water supply is contaminated, we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we are able to substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated water source. In addition, we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our current treatment facilities, or development of new treatment methods. If we are unable to substitute water supply from an uncontaminated water source, or if we are unable to adequately treat the contaminated water source in a cost-effective manner, there may be an adverse effect on our revenues, operating results and financial condition. The costs we incur to decontaminate a water source or an underground water system could be significant and may not be recoverable in rates. We could also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances in our water supplies or other environmental damage. For example, private plaintiffs have the right to bring personal injury or other toxic tort claims arising from the presence of hazardous substances in our drinking water supplies. Our insurance policies may not be sufficient to cover the costs of these claims. 
 We have taken steps to increase security measures at our facilities and heighten employee awareness of threats to our water supply, to protect against third-party attacks, including physical attacks, terrorist attacks, and cyber-attacks. We have also tightened our security measures regarding the delivery and handling of certain chemicals used in our business. We have and will continue to bear increased costs for security precautions to protect our facilities, operations, and supplies. These costs may be significant. Despite these tightened security measures, we may not be able to prevent or deter any third-party attacks or be in a position to control the outcome of third-party attacks should they occur. 
 We depend upon our skilled and trained workforce to ensure water delivery. We can give no assurance that we will be able to maintain sufficient human resources to ensure uninterrupted service in all of the districts that we serve. 
 If any of these catastrophic events were to occur, we can give no assurance that our emergency preparedness plans would be adequate and that we would respond effectively, which could result in public or employee harm or adversely affect our revenues, operating results and financial condition. 
 Failure of critical elements of our infrastructure could result in interruption of service, damage to others, or injuries, and could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 We own physical infrastructure, which was installed over a long period of time, both underground and above-ground. This infrastructure is subject to potential failure due to age, operating conditions, or other unknown factors. Failure of any of our facilities or infrastructure could cause flooding, loss of service to our customers, contamination from chemicals we use in operations, or other damages. 
 We operate a dam. If the dam were to fail for any reason, we would lose a water supply and flooding likely would occur. Whether or not we were responsible for the dam's failure, we could be sued. We can give no assurance that we would be able to defend such a suit successfully. 
 We operate several water and wastewater treatment plants. If a major failure of these facilities were to occur, we would have an interruption in service, potential flooding, and could release potentially harmful material into the environment. 
 We operate over 7,000 miles of underground pipeline. Some failures of underground pipelines could release chemicals into the environment, which have a negative impact on sensitive habitats. 
 We rely on our information technology ("IT") and a number of complex business systems to assist with the management of our business and customer and supplier relationships, and a disruption of these systems could adversely affect our business. 
 Our IT systems are an integral part of our business, and a serious disruption of our IT systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently, which, in turn, could cause our business and competitive position to suffer and adversely affect our results of operations. We depend on our IT systems to bill customers, process orders, provide customer service, manage construction projects, manage our financial records, track assets, remotely monitor certain of our plants and facilities and manage human resources, inventory and accounts receivable collections. Our IT systems also enable us to purchase products from our suppliers and bill customers on a timely basis, maintain cost-effective operations, and provide service to our customers. Some of our mission and business critical IT systems are older, such as our Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition system. The steps we have taken to protect our IT systems may be insufficient to protect them from damage or interruption from: 
 power loss, computer systems failures, including hardware equipment and software applications, and internet, telecommunications or data network failures; 
 operator negligence or improper operation by, or supervision of, employees; 
 25 

Table of Contents 

 physical and electronic loss of customer data due to security breaches, cyber-attacks, misappropriation and similar events; 
 computer viruses; 
 intentional security breaches, hacking, denial of services actions, misappropriation of data, and similar events, including intentional cyber security breaches aimed at disrupting and interfering with water treatment processes; and 
 earthquakes, floods, fires, mudslides and other natural disasters or physical attacks. 
 These events may result in physical and/or electronic loss of customer or financial data, security breaches, misappropriation and other adverse consequences, including liability or regulatory penalties under data privacy laws and regulations. In addition, the lack of redundancy for certain of our IT systems, including billing systems, could exacerbate the impact of any of these events on us. 
 In addition, we may not be successful in developing or acquiring technology that is competitive and responsive to the needs of our business, and we might lack sufficient resources to make the necessary upgrades or replacements of our outdated existing technology to allow us to continue to operate at our current level of efficiency, all of which could adversely impact our business and competitive position. 
 The adequacy of our water supplies depends upon a variety of factors beyond our control. Interruption in the water supply may adversely affect our reputation and earnings. 
 We depend on an adequate water supply to meet the present and future needs of our customers. Whether we have an adequate supply varies depending upon a variety of factors, many of which are partially or completely beyond our control, including: 
 the amount of rainfall; 
 the amount of water stored in reservoirs; 
 underground water supply from which well water is pumped; 
 availability from water wholesalers; 
 changes in the amount of water used by our customers; 
 water quality and availability of appropriate treatment technology; 
 legal limitations on water use such as rationing restrictions during a drought; 
 changes in prevailing weather patterns and climate; and 
 population growth. 
 We purchase our water supply from various governmental agencies and others. Water supply availability may be affected by weather conditions, funding and other political and environmental considerations. In addition, our ability to use surface water is subject to regulations regarding water quality and volume limitations. If new regulations are imposed or existing regulations are changed or given new interpretations, the availability of surface water may be materially reduced. A reduction in surface water could result in the need to procure more costly water from other sources, thereby increasing our water production costs and adversely affecting our operating results if not recovered in rates on a timely basis. 
 We have entered into long-term water supply agreements, which commit us to making certain minimum payments whether or not we purchase any water. Therefore, if demand were insufficient to use our required purchases we would have to pay for water we did not receive. 
 From time to time, we enter into water supply agreements with third parties and our business is dependent upon such agreements in order to meet regional demand. For example, we have entered into a water supply contract with the SFPUC that expires on June 30, 2034. We can give no assurance that the SFPUC, or any of the other parties from whom we purchase water, will renew our contracts upon expiration, or that we will not be subject to significant price increases under any such renewed contracts. 
 The parties from whom we purchase water maintain significant infrastructure and systems to deliver water to us. Maintenance of these facilities is beyond our control. If these facilities are not adequately maintained or if these parties otherwise default on their obligations to supply water to us, we may not have adequate water supplies to meet our customers' needs. 
 26 

Table of Contents 

 If we are unable to access adequate water supplies, we may be unable to satisfy all customer demand, which could result in rationing. Rationing may have an adverse effect on cash flow from operations. We can make no guarantee that we will always have access to an adequate supply of water that will meet all required quality standards. Water shortages may affect us in a variety of ways. For example, shortages could: 
 adversely affect our supply mix by causing us to rely on more expensive purchased water; 
 adversely affect operating costs; 
 increase the risk of contamination to our systems due to our inability to maintain sufficient pressure; and 
 increase capital expenditures for building pipelines to connect to alternative sources of supply, new wells to replace those that are no longer in service or are otherwise inadequate to meet the needs of our customers and reservoirs and other facilities to conserve or reclaim water. 
 We may or may not be able to recover increased operating and construction costs on a timely basis, or at all, for our regulated systems through the ratemaking process. We can give no assurance, as to whether we may be able to recover certain of these costs from third parties that may be responsible, or potentially responsible, for any groundwater contamination. 
 Our water supplies and other aspects of our operations may be affected by climate change. 
 There is strong scientific consensus that human activity including carbon and methane emissions is impacting many planetary systems such as the heat-trapping capacity of the atmosphere; ocean temperature, circulation, acidity, and volume; weather patterns including the severity and frequency of severe weather events; ambient temperatures; and planetary ice cover. Because scientific investigations have been focused globally, there is tremendous uncertainty over the timing, extent, and types of impacts global climate change may have on our service areas and in our water supplies. Moreover, studies of tree ring data show long periods of drought conditions have occurred prior to significant human impacts in California and prior to our operation. Finally, in the last fifty years, California has experienced at least three severe multi-year droughts. We can give no assurance that any of our plans for water reliability and water shortages, including incorporating projected and potential climate change risks into our water supply planning activities, will be adequate or capable of effectively addressing any droughts or longer periods of drought conditions or other conditions affecting water quality and availability. Immediate physical risks could affect our operations and intensify over time as climate change worsens. More frequent flooding, wildfires, sea level rise, rising groundwater, and uneven ground level sinking could damage our assets, including pressurized mains and other pipelines, wells, treatment facilities, and other infrastructure. Wildfires and changes in rainfall may also affect water quality, and both higher temperatures and wildfires can pose risks to employee safety. Farther into the mid-century and late-century horizon, temperature increases may cause declines in snowpack storage, and droughts could decrease surface water supply availability and groundwater recharge while causing increased outdoor demands. 
 Additional climate-related risks may influence our approach as we support the transition to a low-carbon economy. Transition risks include changes in the market and consumer demands, such as differences in generational behaviors, shifts in population locations due to the pandemic and different weather patterns, and variations in water needs and customer groups. Regulatory risks, such as emission trading systems and carbon taxes, may also financially affect our business. Additionally, federal and state regulations present requirements for managing water supplies and limiting impacts on local wildlife, while regional plans and legislation may directly affect how we address water issues. 
 We also periodically review the climate change plans of our wholesalers to determine whether alternative supplies may be necessary in the future. However, we can give no assurance that replacement water supplies will be available at a reasonable cost or a cost acceptable to our customers and Commissions. 
 Natural disasters, climate change, economic conditions and other factors may change the population in our service areas. 
 In the event that some outside factor such as a wildfire, flood, changed climate pattern, actual or threatened public health emergency, or change in the local economy reduces or eliminates our customer base in a service area, or negatively affects the ability of a customer to pay, we could face unrecoverable costs. In those circumstances, the remaining customers might not be able to pay for the operating costs or capital costs of the water system. We may not be able to recover capital costs of property that is no longer used and useful in utility service. We may also encounter an increase in bad debt expense in times of economic difficulty. For example, we experienced an increase in bad debt expense in 2022, which we believe is due to economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although we would likely seek permission to recover these costs through rate increases on remaining customers or in statewide rates, we can give no assurance that the Commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these costs.

 Wastewater operations entail significant risks. 
 Wastewater collection and treatment involve many risks associated with damage to the environment, and we anticipate that wastewater collection and treatment will become an increasing significant part of our business. If collection or treatment systems fail or do not operate properly, untreated or partially treated wastewater could discharge onto property or into nearby streams and rivers, causing damage or injury to property, aquatic life, or human life. Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by liabilities resulting from such damage. 
 Demand for our water is subject to various factors and is affected by seasonal fluctuations. 
 Demand for our water during the warmer, dry months is generally greater than during cooler or rainy months due primarily to additional requirements for water in connection with irrigation systems, swimming pools, cooling systems and other outside water use. Throughout the year, and particularly during typically warmer months, demand will vary with temperature and rainfall levels. If temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal, or if there is more rainfall than normal, the demand for our water may decrease. Under the MWRAM mechanism, lower water usage in our California operations affects our cash flows in the year of usage, but results in higher cash flows in the following years. 
 In addition, governmental restrictions on water usage during drought conditions may result in a decreased demand for our water, even if our water reserves are sufficient to serve our customers during these drought conditions. The Commissions may not allow surcharges to collect lost revenues caused by customers' conservation during a drought. Regardless of whether we may surcharge our customers during a conservation period, they may use less water even after a drought has passed because of conservation patterns developed during the drought. Furthermore, our customers may wish to use recycled water as a substitute for potable water. If rights are granted to others to serve our customers recycled water, there will likely be a decrease in demand for our water. 
 Finally, changes in prevailing weather patterns due to climate change may affect customer demand. If increased ambient temperatures affect our service areas, water used for irrigation and cooling may increase. If rainfall patterns change, our customers may change their patterns of water use including the amount of outdoor irrigation and the type of landscape they install. Government agencies may also mandate changes to customer irrigation or landscape patterns in response to changes in weather and climate. 
 Changes in water supply costs affect our operations. 
 The cost to obtain water for delivery to our customers varies depending on the sources of supply, wholesale suppliers' prices, the quality of water required to be treated and the quantity of water produced to fulfill customer water demand. Our source of supply varies among our operating districts. Certain districts obtain all of their supply from wells; some districts purchase all of the supply from wholesale suppliers; and other districts obtain the supply from a combination of wells and wholesale suppliers. A small portion of supply comes from surface sources and is processed through Company-owned water treatment plants. On average, slightly more than half of the water we deliver to our customers is pumped from wells or received from a surface supply with the remainder purchased from wholesale suppliers. Water purchased from suppliers usually costs us more than surface supplied or well pumped water. The cost of purchased water for delivery to customers represented 31.2 and 33.9 of our total operating costs in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Water purchased from suppliers will require renewal of our contracts upon expiration and may result in significant price increases under any such renewed contracts. 
 Wholesale water suppliers may increase their prices for water delivered to us based on factors that affect their operating costs. Purchased water rate increases are beyond our control. In California, our ability to recover increases in the cost of purchased water is expected to change with the adoption of the ICBA, which is effective as of January 1, 2023. With this change, actual per-unit purchased water costs are expected to be compared to authorized per-unit purchased water costs, with variances added to or netted against the variances in purchased power and pump taxes being recorded as a cost recovery. The balance in the ICBA is expected to be collected in the future by billing the ICBA accounts receivable balances over future periods, which may have a short-term negative impact on cash flow. 
 Dependency upon adequate supply of electricity, certain chemicals, and third-party suppliers of parts and skilled labor could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Purchased electrical power is required to operate the wells and pumps needed to supply water to our customers. Although there are back-up power generators to operate a number of wells and pumps in emergencies, an extended interruption in power could affect the ability to supply water. In the past, California has been subject to rolling power blackouts due to insufficient power supplies. There is no assurance we will not be subject to power blackouts in the future. Additionally, we require sufficient amounts of certain chemicals in order to treat the water we supply. There are multiple sources for these chemicals but an extended interruption of supply could adversely affect our ability to adequately treat our water. 
 28 

Table of Contents 

 Purchased power is a significant operating expense. During 2022 and 2021, purchased power expense represented 6.2 and 5.6 , respectively, of our total operating costs. These costs are beyond our control and can change unpredictably and substantially as occurred in California during 2001 when rates paid for electricity increased 48 . As with purchased water, purchased power costs are expected to be included in the ICBA. Cash flows between rate filings may be adversely affected until the Commission authorizes a rate change, but earnings will be minimally impacted. Cost of chemicals used in the delivery of water is not an element of the ICBA, and therefore, variances in quantity or cost could affect the results of operations. 
 We rely on outside contractors to supply us with materials and parts critical to the operation of our systems. Should parts and material become unavailable, or should the cost of necessary supplies rise substantially, it could adversely affect our ability to operate or have financial affects that are not recoverable through a regulatory process. 
 We also rely on outside contractors to complete large construction projects and provide emergency maintenance services. In the event these contractors are unavailable or cannot meet the demands imposed on them, we may face significantly lengthy interruptions of service or delays in constructing capital projects. We may face additional costs to acquire more resources to complete these activities. 
 Our business requires significant capital expenditures to replace or improve aging infrastructure that are dependent on our ability to secure appropriate funding. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital or if the rates at which we borrow increase, there would be a negative impact on our results of operations. 
 The water utility business is capital-intensive. We invest significant funds to replace or improve aging infrastructure such as property, plant, and equipment. In addition, water shortages may adversely affect us by causing us to rely on more purchased water. This could cause increases in capital expenditures needed to build pipelines to secure alternative water sources. In addition, we require capital to grow our business through acquisitions. We fund our short-term capital requirements from cash received from operations and funds received from developers. We seek to meet our long-term capital needs by raising equity through common or preferred stock issues or issuing debt obligations. We cannot give any assurance that these sources will continue to be adequate or that the cost of funds will remain at levels permitting us to earn a reasonable rate of return. In the event we are unable to obtain sufficient capital, our expansion efforts could be curtailed, which may affect our growth and may affect our future results of operations. 
 Our ability to access the capital markets is affected by the ratings of certain of our debt securities. Standard Poor's Rating Agency issues a rating on California Water Service Company's ability to repay certain debt obligations. The credit rating agency could downgrade our credit rating based on reviews of our financial performance and projections or upon the occurrence of other events that could affect our business outlook. Lower ratings by the agency could restrict our ability to access equity and debt capital. We can give no assurance that the rating agency will maintain ratings that allow us to borrow under advantageous conditions and at reasonable interest rates. A future downgrade by the agency could also increase our cost of capital by causing potential investors to require a higher interest rate due to a perceived risk related to our ability to repay outstanding debt obligations. 
 While the majority of our debt is long term at fixed rates, we do have interest rate exposure in our short-term borrowings, which have variable interest rates. We are also subject to interest rate risks on new financings. However, if interest rates were to increase on a long-term basis, our management believes that customer rates would increase accordingly, subject to approval by the appropriate commission. We can give no assurance that the Commission would approve such an increase in customer rates. 
 We are obligated to comply with specified debt covenants under certain of our loan and debt agreements. Failure to maintain compliance with these covenants could limit future borrowing, and we could face increased borrowing costs, litigation, acceleration of maturity schedules, and cross default issues. Such actions by our creditors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our inability to access the capital or financial markets could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost and our ability to meet long-term commitments. Changes in economic conditions in our markets could affect our customers' ability to pay for water services. Any of these could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. 
 We rely on our current credit facilities to fund short-term liquidity needs if internal funds are not available from operations. Specifically, given the seasonal fluctuations in demand for our water we commonly draw on our credit facilities to meet our cash requirements at times in the year when demand is relatively low. We also may occasionally use letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facilities. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our ability to draw on our credit facilities. Our access to funds under our credit facilities is dependent on the ability of our banks to meet their funding commitments. 
 29

 Many of our customers and suppliers also have exposure to risks that could affect their ability to meet payment and supply commitments. We operate in geographic areas that may be particularly susceptible to declines in the price of real property, which could result in significant declines in demand for our products and services. In the event that any of our significant customers or suppliers, or a significant number of smaller customers and suppliers, are adversely affected by these risks, we may face disruptions in supply, significant reductions in demand for our products and services, inability of customers to pay invoices when due, and other adverse effects that could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows. 
 Our operations and certain contracts for water distribution and treatment depend on the financial capability of state and local governments, and other municipal entities such as water districts. Major disruptions in the financial strength or operations of such entities, such as liquidity limitations, bankruptcy or insolvency, could have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business and/or enforce our rights under contracts to which such entities are a party. 
 We are a holding company that depends on cash flow from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock. 
 As a holding company, we conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries and our only significant assets are investments in those subsidiaries. 91.6 of our revenues are derived from the operations of California Water Service Company. As a result, we are dependent on cash flow from our subsidiaries, and California Water Service Company in particular, to meet our obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock. 
 Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and generally have no obligation to pay any amounts due on California Water Service Group's debt or to provide California Water Service Group with funds for dividends. Although there are no contractual or regulatory restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us, the reasonableness of our capital structure is one of the factors considered by state and local regulatory agencies in their ratemaking determinations. Therefore, transfer of funds from our subsidiaries to us for the payment of our obligations or dividends may have an adverse effect on ratemaking determinations. Furthermore, our right to receive cash or other assets upon the liquidation or reorganization of a subsidiary is generally subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary. If we are unable to obtain funds from our subsidiaries in a timely manner, we may be unable to meet our obligations or pay dividends. 
 We can make dividend payments only from our surplus (the excess, if any, of our net assets over total paid-in capital) or if there is no surplus, the net profits for the current fiscal year or the fiscal year before which the dividend is declared. In addition, we can pay cash dividends only if after paying those dividends we would be able to pay our liabilities as they become due. Owners of our capital stock cannot force us to pay dividends and dividends will only be paid if and when declared by our board of directors. Our board of directors can elect at any time, and for an indefinite duration, not to declare dividends on our capital stock. 
 An important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water and wastewater systems. Risks associated with potential acquisitions, divestitures or restructurings may adversely affect us. 
 We may seek to acquire or invest in other companies, technologies, services, or products that complement our business. The execution of our growth strategy may expose us to different risks than those associated with our utility operations. We can give no assurance that we will succeed in finding attractive acquisition candidates or investments, or that we would be able to reach mutually agreeable terms with such parties. In addition, as consolidation becomes more prevalent in the water and wastewater industries, the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase to unacceptable levels and limit our ability to grow through acquisitions. If we are unable to find acquisition candidates or investments, our ability to grow may be limited. 
 Acquisition and investment transactions may result in the issuance of our equity securities that could be dilutive if the acquisition or business opportunity does not develop in accordance with our business plan. They may also result in significant write-offs and an increase in our debt. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Any of these transactions could involve numerous additional risks, including one or more of the following: 
 problems integrating the acquired operations, personnel, technologies, physical and cyber security processes, or products with our existing businesses and products; 
 liabilities inherited from the acquired companies' prior business operations; 
 diversion of management time and attention from our core business to the acquired business; 
 failure to retain key technical, management, and other personnel of the acquired business; 
 difficulty in retaining relationships with suppliers and customers of the acquired business; and 
 30 

Table of Contents 

 difficulty in obtaining required regulatory approvals. 
 In addition, the businesses and other assets we acquire may not achieve the sales and profitability expected. The occurrence of one or more of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in overcoming these or any other significant risks encountered. 
 We may not be able to increase or sustain our recent growth rate, and we may not be able to manage our future growth effectively. 
 We may be unable to continue to expand our business or manage future growth. To successfully manage our growth and handle the responsibilities of being a public company, we must effectively: 
 hire, train, integrate and manage additional qualified engineers for engineering design and construction activities, new business personnel, and financial and information technology personnel; 
 retain key management, augment our management team, and retain qualified and certified water and wastewater system operators; 
 implement and improve additional and existing administrative, financial and operations systems, procedures and controls; 
 expand our technological capabilities; and 
 manage multiple relationships with our customers, regulators, suppliers and other third parties. 
 If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities, satisfy customer requirements, execute our business plan, or respond to competitive pressures. 
 We have a number of large-volume commercial and industrial customers and a significant decrease in consumption by one or more of these customers could have an adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows. 
 Our billed revenues and cash flows from operations will decrease if a significant business or industrial customer terminates or materially reduces its use of our water. Approximately 180.2 million, or 23.3 , of our 2022 water utility revenues was derived from business and industrial customers. In Hawaii, we serve a number of large resorts, which if their water usage was reduced or ceased could have a material impact to our Hawaii operation. The delay between such date and the effective date of the rate relief may be significant and could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows. 
 Our operating cost and costs of providing services may rise faster than our revenues. 
 Our ability to increase rates over time is dependent upon approval of such rate increases by the Commissions, or in the case of the City of Hawthorne and the City of Commerce, the City Council, which may be inclined, for political or other reasons, to limit rate increases. However, our costs, which are subject to market conditions and other factors, may increase significantly. The second largest component of our operating costs after water production is made up of salaries and wages. These costs are affected by the local supply and demand for qualified labor. Other large components of our costs are general insurance, workers compensation insurance, employee benefits and health insurance costs. These costs may increase disproportionately to rate increases authorized by the Commissions and may have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations. 
 Demand for our stock may fluctuate due to circumstances beyond our control. 
 We believe that stockholders invest in public utility stocks, in part, because they seek reliable dividend payments. If there is an over-supply of stock of public utilities in the market relative to demand by such investors, the trading price of our securities could decrease. Additionally, if interest rates rise above the dividend yield offered by our equity securities, demand for our stock, and consequently its market price, may decrease. A decline in demand for our stock may have a negative impact on our ability to finance capital projects.

 Adverse investment returns and other factors may increase our pension liability and pension funding requirements. 
 A substantial number of our employees are covered by a defined benefit pension plan. At present, the pension plan is underfunded because our projected pension benefit obligation exceeds the aggregate fair value of plan assets. Under applicable law, we are required to make cash contributions to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding levels imposed by regulatory requirements. The amount of such required cash contribution is based on an actuarial valuation of the plan. The funded status of the plan can be affected by investment returns on plan assets, discount rates, mortality rates of plan participants, pension reform legislation and a number of other factors. There can be no assurance that the value of our pension plan assets will be sufficient to cover future liabilities. Although we contributed to our pension plan in recent years, it is possible that we could incur a pension liability adjustment, or could be required to make additional cash contributions to our pension plan, which would reduce the cash available for business and other needs. 
 Labor relations matters could adversely affect our operating results. 
 At December 31, 2022, 744 of our 1,225 total employees were union employees. Most of our unionized employees are represented by the Utility Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO, except certain engineering and laboratory employees who are represented by the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, AFL-CIO. 
 We believe our labor relations are good, but in light of rising costs for health care and pensions, our current contract negotiations and those in the future may be difficult. Furthermore, changes in applicable law or regulations could have an adverse effect on management's negotiating position with respect to our currently unionized employees and/or employees that decide to unionize in the future. We are subject to a risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters as we negotiate with the unions to address these issues, which could affect our results of operations and financial condition. We can give no assurance that issues with our labor forces will be resolved favorably to us in the future or that we will not experience work stoppages. 
 Our operations are geographically concentrated in California and this lack of diversification may negatively affect our operations. 
 Although we own facilities in a number of states, over 91.6 of our operations are located in California. As a result, we are largely subject to weather, political, water supply, labor, energy cost, regulatory, and economic risks affecting California. 
 We are also affected by the real property market in California. In order to grow our business, we may need to acquire additional real estate or rights to use real property owned by third parties, the cost of which tends to be higher and more volatile in California than in other states. The value of our assets in California may decline if there is a decline in the California real estate market that results in a significant decrease in real property values. 
 Municipalities, water districts and other public agencies may condemn our property by eminent domain action. 
 State statutes allow municipalities, water districts and other public agencies to own and operate water systems. These agencies are empowered to condemn water systems or real property owned by privately owned public utilities in certain circumstances and in compliance with California and federal law. Additionally, whenever a public agency constructs facilities to extend its utility system into the service area of a privately owned public utility, such an act may constitute the taking of property and require reimbursement to the public utility for its loss. If a public agency were to file an eminent domain lawsuit against us, we would incur substantial attorney s fees, consultant and expert fees, and other costs in considering a challenge to the right to take our utility property and/or its valuation for just compensation, as well as such fees and costs in any subsequent litigation if necessary. If the public agency prevailed and acquired our utility property, we would be entitled to just compensation for our loss, but we would no longer have access to the condemned property or water system. Neither would we be entitled to any portion of revenue generated from the use of such asset going forward. 
 The Ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic May Adversely Affect Our Operations 
 Although the COVID-19 pandemic did not have a significant impact on our business in 2022, we are unable to accurately predict the full impact that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity due to numerous uncertainties, including the duration and severity of the outbreak, potential resurgence and /or mutations of the virus, and the development, distribution and public acceptance of treatments and vaccines. As an essential business during times of emergencies pursuant to the U.S. Critical Infrastructures Protection Act of 2001, we are working to continue to provide water and wastewater services to our two million customers. If we close any of our facilities due to a COVID-19 outbreak or if a critical number of our employees become too ill to work, our business operations could be materially adversely affected in a rapid manner.

 General Risk Factors 
 We depend significantly on the services of the members of our management team, and the departure of any of those persons could cause our operating results to suffer. 
 Our success depends significantly on the continued individual and collective contributions of our management team. The loss of the services of any member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business as our management team has knowledge of our industry and customers and would be difficult to replace. 
 We retain certain risks not covered by our insurance policies. 
 We evaluate our risks and insurance coverage annually or more frequently if circumstances dictate. Our evaluation considers the costs, risks, and benefits of retaining versus insuring various risks as well as the availability of certain types of insurance coverage. Accordingly, we have determined or may determine to self-insure or to not obtain insurance in certain cases, or insurance may not be available at commercially acceptable terms or at all. Furthermore, we are also affected by increases in prices for insurance coverage; in particular, we have been, and will continue to be, affected by rising health insurance costs. Retained risks are associated with deductible limits, partial self-insurance programs, and insurance policy coverage ceilings. If we suffer an uninsured loss, we may be unable to pass all or any portion of the loss on to customers, because our rates are regulated by regulatory commissions. Consequently, uninsured losses may negatively affect our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will not face uninsured losses pertaining to the risks we have retained. 
 Our enterprise risk management processes may not be effective in identifying and mitigating the risks to which we are subject, or in reducing the potential for losses in connection with such risks. 
 Our enterprise risk management processes are designed to minimize or mitigate the risks to which we are subject, as well as any losses stemming from such risks. Although we seek to identify, measure, monitor, report, and control our exposure to such risks, and employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and mitigation techniques in the process, those techniques are inherently limited in their ability to anticipate the existence or development of risks that are currently unknown and unanticipated. The ineffectiveness of our enterprise risk management processes in mitigating the impact of known risks or the emergence of previously unknown or unanticipated risks may result in our incurring losses in the future that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 The accuracy of our judgments and estimates about financial and accounting matters will affect our operating results and financial condition. 
 We make certain estimates and judgments in preparing our financial statements regarding, among others: 
 the useful life of intangible rights; 
 the number of years to depreciate certain assets; 
 amounts to set aside for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory obsolescence and uninsured losses; 
 our legal exposure and the appropriate accrual for claims, including medical claims and workers' compensation claims; 
 future costs and assumptions for pensions and other postretirement benefits; 
 regulatory recovery of regulatory assets; 
 possible tax uncertainties; and 
 projected collections of WRAM and MCBA receivables or receivables under subsequent recovery mechanisms, such as MWRAM and ICBA. 
 The quality and accuracy of those estimates and judgments may have an impact on our operating results and financial condition. 
 In addition, we must estimate unbilled revenues and costs as of the end of each accounting period. If our estimates are not accurate, we would be required to make an adjustment in a future period. Accounting rules permit us to use expense balancing accounts and memorandum accounts that include cost changes to us that are different from amounts incorporated into the rates approved by the Commissions. These accounts result in expenses and revenues being recognized in periods other than in which they occurred.

 We identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, and, if not remediated effectively, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable laws and regulations could be impaired, which could result in loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and materially adversely affect our results of operations and stock price. 
 The accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls. We are required to provide a report from management to our stockholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls. As disclosed in Part II, Item 9A, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2022 due to a material weakness in our internal control over the completeness of our accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities, specifically controls over the identification of regulatory filings by the Company during the period that are then reviewed to determine their potential accounting impact. This material weakness has not yet been remediated and remained at the time of the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022. We can provide no assurance that our remediation plan to address this material weakness, including, but not limited to, revising the design of existing controls and implementing new controls, will be successful. 
 Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including human error, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions, and fraud. Because of these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud. If we are unable to remediate the material weakness in a timely manner, or are otherwise unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, we could suffer harm to our reputation, incur incremental compliance costs, fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis, be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations, or be required to restate our financial statements, which could result in loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, subject us to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and payment of legal and other expenses, and our results of operations and our stock price could be materially adversely affected.

 Overview 
 Net Income Attributable to California Water Service Group 
 In 2022 and 2021, net income attributable to California Water Service Group was 96.0 million and 101.1 million, respectively. Earnings per diluted common share decreased 0.19 from 1.96 to 1.77 or 9.7 in 2022. The 5.1 million decrease in net income attributable to California Water Service Group was driven primarily by an 11.0 million decrease in unrealized gain on non-qualified benefit plan investments and an increase of 1.1 million of financing costs. 
 Additionally, operating expenses increased 54.6 million, driven primarily by increases in water production costs of 7.8 million, administrative and general expenses of 6.0 million, other operations expenses of 29.8 million, maintenance expenses of 2.1 million, depreciation and amortization expense of 5.9 million, income taxes of 0.5 million, and property and other taxes of 2.6 million. These operating expense increases were offset by an increase in operating revenue of 55.5 million, driven primarily by rate increases of 34.5 million, changes in deferred revenue of 16.5 million and an accrued unbilled revenue increase of 1.7 million. Additionally, we had a 2.7 million gain from Company-owned life insurance. 
 We consider changes in unrealized gains on non-qualified benefit plan investments, proceeds from company-owned life insurance, and accrued unbilled revenue as factors outside the company's immediate control. Seasonal weather patterns and the number of unbilled days have typically been the primary influences of accrued unbilled revenue. 
 We continue to seek rate relief to recover our operating cost increases and receive reasonable returns on invested capital. We expect to fund our long-term capital needs through a combination of debt, common stock offerings, and cash flow from operations. 
 COVID-19 
 During 2021, 2022, and through March 1, 2023, the COVID-19 pandemic did not have a significant impact on our business or operations. We have resumed shutoffs for non-payment in all of our regulated utilities, which we had paused from March 2020 through June 2022 in light of the pandemic. 
 If we need to close any of our facilities due to outbreaks of COVID-19 or if a critical number of our employees become too ill to work, our business operations could be materially adversely affected in a rapid manner. Company employees have returned to the office full-time. We seek to be vigilant for employee and customer safety, we seek to encourage and incentivize vaccination, and our employees are required to follow local masking rules as applicable. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is fluid and continues to evolve, and therefore, we cannot predict the extent to which our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity will ultimately be impacted. 
 California Water and Wastewater Arrearages Payment Program 
 The California Water and Wastewater Arrearages Payment Program was created by the California Legislature to be administered by the State Water Resources Control Board (Water Board) in order to provide relief to community water and wastewater systems for unpaid bills (arrearages) related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Legislature allocated 985 million in American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 funds to pay down residential and commercial arrearages accrued between March 4, 2020 and June 14, 2021. In response to the Water Board s survey, Cal Water reported 20.8 million in eligible customer arrearages and program administrative costs. Cal Water received 100 of the requested amount from the program in January 2022. Cal Water applied 17.2 million of these funds to identified past due customer balances during the first quarter of 2022 and returned the remaining balance.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 We maintain our accounting records in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and as directed by the Commissions to which our operations are subject. The process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of management. The estimates used by management are based on historic experience and an understanding of current facts and circumstances. A summary of our significant accounting policies is listed in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The following sections describe those policies where the level of subjectivity, judgment, and variability of estimates could have a material impact on the financial condition, operating performance, and cash flows of the business. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Revenue from contracts with customers 
 The Company principally generates operating revenue from contracts with customers by providing regulated water and wastewater services at tariff-rates authorized by the Commissions in the states in which they operate and non-regulated water and wastewater services at rates authorized by contracts with government agencies. Revenue from contracts with customers reflects amounts billed for the volume of consumption at authorized per unit rates, for a service charge, and for other authorized charges. 
 The Company satisfies its performance obligation to provide water and wastewater services over time as services are rendered. The Company applies the invoice practical expedient and recognizes revenue from contracts with customers in the amount for which the Company has a right to invoice. The Company has a right to invoice for the volume of consumption, for the service charge, and for other authorized charges. The measurement of sales to customers is generally based on the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. 
 Contract terms are generally short-term and at will by customers and, as a result, no separate financing component is recognized for the Company's collections from customers, which generally require payment within 30 days of billing. The Company applies judgment, based principally on historical payment experience, in estimating its customers ability to pay. 
 Certain customers are not billed for volumetric consumption, but are instead billed a flat rate at the beginning of each monthly service period. The amount billed is initially deferred and subsequently recognized over the monthly service period, as the performance obligation is satisfied. The deferred revenue balance or contract liability, which is included in "other accrued liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets, is inconsequential. 
 Regulatory balancing account revenue 
 The Company s ability to recover revenue requirements authorized by the CPUC in its triennial GRC has been decoupled from the volume of the sales through 2022. Regulatory balancing account revenue is revenue related to rate mechanisms authorized in California by the CPUC, which allow the Company to recover the authorized revenue and are not considered contracts with customers. These mechanisms include the following: 
 The Water Revenue Adjustment Mechanism (WRAM) has allowed the Company to recognize the adopted level of volumetric revenues. The variance between adopted volumetric revenues and actual billed volumetric revenues for metered accounts is recorded as regulatory balancing account revenue. 
 Cost-recovery rates, such as the Modified Cost Balancing Account (MCBA), Conservation Balancing Account (CEBA), Pension Cost Balancing Account (PCBA), and Health Cost Balancing Account (HCBA), provide for recovery of the adopted levels of expenses for purchased water, purchased power, pump taxes, water conservation program costs, pension, and health care. Variances between adopted and actual costs are recorded as regulatory balancing account revenue. 
 Each district's WRAM and MCBA regulatory assets and liabilities are allowed to be netted against one another. The Company recognizes regulatory balancing account revenues that have been authorized for rate recovery, are objectively determinable and probable of recovery, and are expected to be collected within 24 months. To the extent that regulatory balancing account revenue is estimated to be collectible beyond 24 months, recognition is deferred. 
 The CPUC issued a decision effective August 27, 2020 requiring that Class A companies submitting GRC filings after the effective date be (i) precluded from proposing the use of a full decoupling WRAM in their next GRCs and (ii) allowed the use of MWRAM. In addition, the CPUC's decision allowed for ICBAs, which are authorized by state statute, to replace the MCBA. The MWRAM tracks the difference between the revenue received for actual metered sales through the tiered volumetric rate and the revenue that would have been received with the same actual metered sales if a uniform rate would have been in effect. The ICBA tracks differences between the authorized per-unit prices of water production costs and actual per-unit prices of 
 38 

Table of Contents 

 water production costs. Cal Water complied with this decision in its 2021 GRC Filing and expects these replacement mechanisms to be in effect for 2023. 
 In September 2020, Cal Water filed an Application for Rehearing at the CPUC seeking to reverse the August 27, 2020 CPUC decision. While a decision was pending on the Application for Rehearing, Cal Water along with four other Class A California water utilities filed Petitions for a Writ of Review with the California Supreme Court (Court) on or about October 27, 2021. In September 2021, the CPUC denied the Application for Rehearing. On May 18, 2022, the Court issued writs granting review and ordered the CPUC and other filing parties to submit additional pleadings to the Court. The final pleadings were submitted on January 13, 2023. Cal Water anticipates that the Court will schedule an oral argument before it begins deliberations and issues its decision. 
 Regulated Utility Accounting 
 Because we operate almost exclusively in a regulated business, we are subject to the accounting standards for regulated utilities. The Commissions in the states in which we operate establish rates that are designed to permit the recovery of the cost of service and a return on investment. We capitalize and record regulatory assets for costs that would otherwise be charged to expense if it is probable that the incurred costs will be recovered in future rates. Regulatory assets are amortized over the future periods that the costs are expected to be recovered. If costs expected to be incurred in the future are currently being recovered through rates, we record those expected future costs as regulatory liabilities. In addition, we record regulatory liabilities when it is probable the Commissions will require a refund to be made to our customers over future periods. 
 Determining probability requires significant judgment by management and includes, but is not limited to, consideration of testimony presented in regulatory hearings, proposed regulatory decisions, final regulatory orders, and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court appeals. 
 If we determine that a portion of our assets used in utility operations is not recoverable in customer rates, we would be required to recognize the loss of the assets disallowed. 
 Income Taxes 
 We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We recognize the effect on the deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate in the period that includes the enactment date. We also assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered in future taxable income and, to the extent recovery is not probable, a valuation allowance would be recorded. 
 We anticipate that future rate actions by the regulatory commissions will reflect revenue requirements for the tax effects of temporary differences recognized, which have previously been passed through to customers. The regulatory commissions have granted the Company permission to reflect the normalization of the tax benefits of the federal accelerated methods and available Investment Tax Credits (ITCs) for all assets placed in service after 1980. ITCs are deferred and amortized over the lives of the related properties for book purposes. The CPUC requires flow through accounting for state deferred taxes. 
 On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted expansive tax legislation commonly referred to as the TCJA. Among other provisions, the TCJA reduces the federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning on January 1, 2018 and eliminated bonus depreciation for utilities. The TCJA required the Company to re-measure all existing deferred income tax assets and liabilities to reflect the reduction in the federal tax rate. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the TCJA refund liability was 108.4 million. We continue working with other state regulators to finalize the refund to confirm compliance with federal normalization rules.

 Pension and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (PBOP) 
 We incur costs associated with our pension and PBOP plans. To measure the expense of these benefits, our management must estimate compensation increases, mortality rates, future health cost increases and discount rates used to value related liabilities and to determine appropriate funding. Different estimates used by our management could result in significant variances in the cost recognized for pension and PBOP plans. The estimates used are based on historical experience, current facts, future expectations, and recommendations from independent advisors and actuaries. We use an investment advisor to provide advice in managing the plan's investments. We anticipate any increases in funding for the pension benefits plans will be recovered in future rate filings, thereby mitigating the financial impact. We believe it is probable that future costs will be recovered in future rates and therefore have recorded a regulatory asset in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Changes to the pension benefits actuarial assumptions can significantly affect pension costs, regulatory assets, and liabilities. 
 The following table reflects the sensitivity of pension amounts reported for the year ended December 31, 2022, to changes in actuarial assumptions: Increase/(Decrease) in Pension Benefits Actuarial Assumption Increase/(Decrease) in 2022 Net Periodic Benefit Cost Increase/(Decrease) in Projected Benefit Obligation as of December 31, 2022 Dollars in thousands Discount rate (0.5) 7,170 58,827 Long-term rate of return on plan assets (0.5) 3,580 Rate of compensation increases (0.5) (3,441) (15,131) Cost of living adjustment (1) (0.25) (2,248) (14,943) Discount rate 0.5 (6,500) (51,972) Long-term rate of return on plan assets 0.5 (3,580) Rate of compensation increases 0.5 3,617 15,843 Cost of living adjustment 0.5 6,947 39,720 ______________________________________________________________________________

 Results of Operations 
 Operating Revenue 
 Operating revenue in 2022 was 846.4 million, an increase of 55.5 million, or 7.0 , over 2021. Operating revenue in 2021 was 790.9 million, a decrease of 3.4 million, or 0.4 , over 2020. The sources of changes in operating revenue were: 
 2022 2021 Dollars in millions Net change due to WRAM, service charges, usage, and other (1) 48.9 29.7 MCBA revenue (2) (11.2) (7.9) Other balancing account revenue (3) 1.3 (13.5) Deferral of revenue (4) 16.5 (11.7) Net change 55.5 (3.4) 
 _______________________________________________________________________________ 
 (1) In 2022, the net change due to WRAM, service charges, usage, and other in the above table was mainly driven by rate increases (the components of which are set forth in the table in Rates and Regulation section below), a 5.8 million increase in Hawaii Water due to an increase in customer usage, a 1.7 million increase in accrued unbilled revenue, and a 1.3 million increase in New Mexico Water due to the acquisition of the Morningstar water system, which added approximately 2000 customer connections. 
 (2) MCBA revenue is the variance between adopted water production costs and actual water production costs. In 2022, we recognized a reduction to MCBA revenue of 7.4 million as compared to an MCBA increase to revenue 3.8 million in 2021. The MCBA revenue decrease of 11.2 million in 2022 as compared to 2021 resulted from a decrease in actual water production costs relative to adopted water production costs due to a 5.9 decrease in purchased water production. Purchased water production decreased due to the drought in California, which reduced customer usage. As required by the MCBA mechanism, the decrease in actual water production costs relative to adopted water production costs in California also decreased operating revenue for the same amount. 
 (3) The other balancing account revenue consists of the pension, conservation, and health care balancing account revenues. Pension and conservation balancing account revenues are the differences between actual expenses and adopted rate recovery. Health care balancing account revenue is 85 of the difference between actual health care expenses and adopted rate recovery. In 2022, we recognized a reduction to revenue of 4.8 million for these balancing accounts as compared to a net 6.1 million of revenue in 2021. The increase in revenue was mainly due to an increase in actual conservation and health care expenses relative to adopted in 2022 as compared to 2021, which was partially offset by a decrease in actual pension expenses relative to adopted in 2022 as compared to 2021. 
 (4) The deferral of revenue consists of amounts that are expected to be collected from customers beyond 24 months following the end of the accounting period in which these revenues were recorded. The deferral decreased in 2022 as compared to 2021 due to a decrease in the balancing account revenue expected to be collected beyond 24 months. 
 Water Production Expenses 
 Water production expenses, which consist of purchased water, purchased power, and pump taxes, comprise the largest segment of total operating expenses. Water production costs accounted for 39.7 and 41.8 , of total operating costs in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The rates charged for wholesale water supplies, electricity, and pump taxes are established by various public agencies. As such, these rates are beyond our control. 
 The table below provides the change in water production expenses during the past 2 years: 
 2022 2021 Amount Change Change Amount Change Change Dollars in millions Purchased water 224.5 (0.5) (0.2) 225.0 (5.1) (2.2) Purchased power 44.6 7.5 20.2 37.1 3.1 9.1 Pump taxes 16.2 0.9 5.9 15.3 2.7 21.4 Total water production expenses 285.3 7.9 2.8 277.4 0.7 4.5 
 41 

Table of Contents 

 The principal factors affecting water production expenses are the quantity, price, and source of the water. Generally, water pumped from wells costs less than water purchased from wholesale suppliers. 
 The table below provides the amounts, percentage change, and source mix for the respective years: 
 2022 2021 MG of Total change from prior year MG of Total change from prior year Millions of gallons (MG) Source: Wells 52,534 49.1 52,520 47.5 6.9 Purchased 50,473 47.2 (5.9) 53,620 48.5 (4.2) Surface 3,938 3.7 (10.1) 4,379 4.0 (22.9) Total 106,945 100.0 (3.2) 110,519 100.0 (0.2) 
 Purchased water expenses are affected by changes in quantities purchased, supplier prices, and cost differences between wholesale suppliers. The MCBA mechanism is designed to recover all incurred purchased water expenses. 
 For 2022, the 0.5 million decrease in purchased water expenses is due to a 5.9 decrease in purchased quantities offset by an overall blended water wholesaler rate increase of 6.0 . 
 Purchased power expenses are affected by the quantity of water pumped from wells and moved through the distribution system, rates charged by electric utility companies, and rate structures applied to usage during peak and non-peak times of the day or season. In 2022, purchased power expenses increased 7.5 million mainly due to an increase in rates from our power providers. 
 Changes in climate change regulations could increase the cost of power that in turn would result in an increase in the rates our power suppliers charge us. Any change in pricing of our purchased power expenses in California would be recovered from our customers through the MCBA mechanism. Any change in power costs in other states would be requested to be recovered by the customers in those states. The impact of such regulations is dependent upon the enacted date, the factors that affect our suppliers' cost structure, and their ability to pass the costs to us in their approved tariffs. These items are not known at this time. 
 Administrative and General Expenses 
 Administrative and general expenses include payroll related to administrative and general functions, all employee benefits charged to expense accounts, insurance expenses, legal fees, expenses associated with being a public company, and general corporate expenses. 
 For 2022, administrative and general expense increased 6.0 million, or 4.8 , as compared to 2021. The increase was mainly due to increases in outside consulting service costs of 1.8 million, employee and retiree medical costs of 1.7 million, travel costs of 1.3 million, legal costs of 1.1 million, and training and seminars costs of 0.7 million. These cost increases were partially offset by a 0.9 million decrease in employee pension benefit costs. Changes in employee pension benefits and employee and retiree medical costs for regulated California operations generally do not affect net income attributable to California Water Service Group, as we have been allowed by the CPUC to record these costs in balancing accounts for future recovery, creating a corresponding change to revenue. 
 Other Operations Expenses 
 The components of other operations expenses include payroll, material and supplies, and contract service costs of operating the regulated water systems, including the costs associated with water transmission and distribution, pumping, water quality, meter reading, billing, operations of district offices, and water conservation programs. 
 For 2022, other operations expense increased 29.8 million, or 34.5 , compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to increases of 13.3 million in expenses associated with the deferral of operating revenue, 5.0 million in conservation program costs, 3.2 million in credit loss, 1.5 million in water and waste water treatment costs, 1.2 million in employee wages, 1.1 million in customer accounts expenses, 1.0 million in waste water system operating costs, 1.0 million in district office maintenance and landscaping costs, 0.6 million in transportation costs, and 0.6 million in property loss. Changes in conservation program costs for regulated California operations generally do not affect net income attributable to California Water Service Group, as we have been allowed by the CPUC to record these costs in balancing accounts for future recovery, creating a corresponding change to revenue.

 Maintenance 
 For 2022, maintenance expenses increased 2.1 million, or 7.2 , as compared to 2021 due to increases in costs for repairs of pumping equipment, labor costs in maintaining the water systems, cost for repairs of reservoirs and tanks, as well as amortization of tank coating projects in accordance with CPUC orders, and transportation costs. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 During 2022, depreciation and amortization increased 5.9 million, or 5.4 , as compared to 2021 primarily due to utility plant placed in service in 2021. 
 Income Taxes 
 During 2022, income taxes increased 0.5 million, or 16.3 , to 3.3 million as compared to 2021. The increase in income tax expense was mostly due to a 5.5 million decrease in customer refunds of excess deferred federal income taxes in 2022 as compared to 2021, which was partially offset by tax benefits from life insurance proceeds. The Company s effective combined income tax rate for 2022 was 6.2 as compared to 3.9 for 2021. 
 Property and Other Taxes 
 For 2022, property and other taxes increased 2.6 million, or 8.0 , as compared to 2021. The increase was mostly due to an increase in our assessed property values for utility plant placed in service during the year. 
 Other Income and Expenses 
 For 2022, net other income and expenses decreased 5.5 million, or 31.4 as compared to 2021. The decrease was due primarily to an 11.0 million decrease in the unrealized gain from non-qualified benefit plan investments due to market conditions and a 1.4 million increase in new business and community outreach program expenses. The decreases were partially offset by a 4.6 million decrease in other components of net periodic benefit costs, a 2.7 million gain on Company-owned life insurance, and a 0.9 million increase in allowance for funds used during construction. Changes in other components of net periodic benefit costs for regulated California operations generally do not affect net income attributable to California Water Service Group, as we have been allowed by the CPUC to record these costs in balancing accounts for future recovery, creating a corresponding change to revenue. 
 Net Interest Expense 
 For 2022, net interest expense increased 1.1 million, or 2.6 , as compared to 2021. The increase was due primarily to the 2021 issuance of 280.0 million in First Mortgage Bonds to finance new infrastructure investment.

 Water Supply 
 Our source of supply varies among our operating districts. Certain districts obtain all of their supply from wells; some districts purchase all of their supply from wholesale suppliers; and other districts obtain supply from a combination of wells and wholesale suppliers. A small portion of supply comes from surface sources and is processed through Company-owned water treatment plants. To the best of management's knowledge, we are meeting water quality, environmental, and other regulatory standards for all Company-owned systems. 
 California's normal weather pattern yields little precipitation between mid-spring and mid-fall. The Washington Water service areas receive precipitation in all seasons, with the heaviest amounts during the winter. New Mexico Water's rainfall is heaviest in the summer monsoon season. Hawaii Water receives precipitation throughout the year, with the largest amounts in the winter months. Water usage in all service areas is highest during the warm and dry summers and declines in the cool winter months. Rain and snow during the winter months replenish underground water aquifers and fill reservoirs, providing the water supply for subsequent delivery to customers. Management believes that supply pumped from underground aquifers and purchased from wholesale suppliers will be adequate to meet customer demand during 2023 and thereafter. However, water rationing may be required in future periods, if declared by the state or local jurisdictions. Long-term water supply plans are developed for each of our districts to help assure an adequate water supply under various operating and supply conditions. Some districts have unique challenges in meeting water quality standards, but management believes that supplies will meet current standards using current treatment processes. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash flow from Operations 
 During 2022, we generated cash flow from operations of 243.8 million, compared to 231.7 million during 2021. The increase in 2022 was primarily due to the net receipt of 17.2 million from the Water Arrearages Payment Program and a decrease in the funding for pension and other post-retirement benefits in 2022. 
 The water business is seasonal. Billed revenue is lower in the cool, wet winter months when less water is used compared to the warm, dry summer months when water use is the highest. This seasonality results in the possible need for short-term borrowings under the bank lines of credit in the event cash is not sufficient to cover operating costs during the winter period. The increase in cash flow during the summer allows for a pay down of short-term borrowings. Customer water usage can be lower than normal in years when more than normal precipitation falls in our service areas or temperatures are lower than normal, especially in the summer months. The reduction in water usage reduces cash flow from operations and increases the need for short-term bank borrowings. Aged accounts receivable past due more than 60 days decreased from 26.2 million as of December 31, 2021 to 17.6 million as of December 31, 2022 mostly due to net receipt of 17.2 million of Water Arrearages Payment Program funds. Additionally, Cal Water has implemented interest and penalty-free payment plans or extensions, subject to certain terms and conditions, to help customers pay water bills after June 15, 2022. 
 Investing Activities 
 During 2022 and 2021 we used 327.8 million and 293.2 million, respectively, of cash for capital expenditures, both Company-funded and developer-funded. Cash used in investing activities fluctuates each year largely due to the availability of construction resources and our ability to obtain construction permits in a timely manner.

 Financing Activities 
 During 2022, we borrowed 150.0 million, and paid down 115.0 million on our unsecured revolving credit facilities for general corporate purposes. We also received 25.8 million of advances and contributions in aid of construction, which was reduced by refunds to developers of 9.5 million. We paid 5.4 million for matured First Mortgage Bonds and other long-term debt obligations. In addition, we issued 106.7 million of Company common stock through our at-the-market equity plan and our employee stock purchase plan. 
 On March 29, 2019, the Company and Cal Water entered into certain syndicated credit agreements, which provide for unsecured revolving credit facilities of up to an initial aggregate amount of 550.0 million for a term of five years. The revolving credit facilities amend, expand, and replace the Company s and its subsidiaries prior credit facilities originally entered into on May 10, 2015. The new credit facilities extended the terms until March 29, 2024, and increased Cal Water s unsecured revolving line of credit. The Company and subsidiaries that it designates may borrow up to 150.0 million under the Company s revolving credit facility. Cal Water may borrow up to 400.0 million under its revolving credit facility. All borrowings must be repaid within 24 months unless a different period is required or authorized by the CPUC. Additionally, the credit facilities may be increased by up to an incremental 150.0 million under the Cal Water facility and 50.0 million under the Company facility, subject in each case to certain conditions. The proceeds from the revolving credit facilities may be used for working capital purposes. Borrowings under the credit facilities typically have maturities varying between one and nine months and will bear interest annually at a rate equal to (i) the base rate or (ii) the Eurodollar rate, plus an applicable margin of 0.650 to 0.875 , depending on the Company and its subsidiaries consolidated total capitalization ratio. 
 The under-collected net WRAM and MCBA receivable balances were 104.7 million and 72.8 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase of 31.9 million from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022 was primarily due to lower than adopted customer usage. The under-collected net WRAM and MCBA receivable balances were primarily financed by Cal Water with short-term and long-term financing arrangements to meet operational cash requirements. Interest on the under-collected net WRAM and MCBA receivable balances, the interest recoverable from customers, is limited to the current 90-day commercial paper rate, which is significantly lower than Cal Water's short and long-term financing rates. 
 At the January 2023 meeting, the Board of Directors declared the quarterly dividend, increasing it for the 56th consecutive year. The quarterly dividend was raised from 0.25 to 0.26 per common share. This represents an indicated annual rate of 1.04 per common share. Dividends have been paid for 77 consecutive years. The annual dividends paid per common share in 2022, 2021, and 2020 were 1.00, 0.92, and 0.85, respectively. Earnings not paid as dividends are reinvested in the business for the benefit of stockholders. The dividend payout ratio was 56.5 in 2022, 46.9 in 2021, and 43.1 in 2020 for an average of 48.8 over the 3-year period. Our long-term targeted dividend payout ratio is 60 . 
 Short-Term Financing 
 Short-term liquidity is provided by the bank lines of credit described above and by internally generated funds. As of December 31, 2022, there were borrowings of 70.0 million outstanding on our unsecured revolving lines of credit, compared to 35.0 million outstanding on our unsecured revolving lines of credit as of December 31, 2021. 
 Given our ability to access our lines of credit on a daily basis, cash balances are managed to levels required for daily cash needs and excess cash is invested in short-term or cash equivalent instruments. Minimal operating levels of cash are maintained for Washington Water, New Mexico Water, Hawaii Water, and Texas Water. 
 The Company and certain designated subsidiaries may borrow up to 150.0 million under its credit facility. Cal Water may borrow up to 400.0 million under its credit facility; however, all borrowings currently need to be repaid within 24 months unless otherwise authorized by the CPUC. 
 Both credit agreements contain affirmative and negative covenants and events of default customary for credit facilities of this type including, among other things, limitations, and prohibitions relating to additional indebtedness, liens, mergers, and asset sales. In addition, these unsecured credit agreements contain financial covenants governing the Company and its subsidiaries' "consolidated total capitalization ratio" not to exceed 66.7 and "interest coverage ratio" of three or more (each as defined in the respective credit agreements). As of December 31, 2022, our consolidated total capitalization ratio was 52.4 and the interest coverage ratio was greater than five. In summary, as of such date, we met all of the covenant requirements and were eligible to use the full amounts of these credit agreements.

 Long-Term Financing 
 Long-term financing is accomplished using both debt and equity. Cal Water was authorized to issue 700.0 million of debt and common stock to finance capital projects and operations by a CPUC decision dated November 5, 2020. In addition, the decision retained approximately 94.0 million of prior financing authority and determined that refinancing long-term debt did not count against the authorization. The CPUC requires that any loans from Cal Water to the Company be at arm s length. This restriction did not materially affect the Company's ability to meet its cash obligations in 2022. Management does not expect this restriction to have a material impact on the Company's ability to meet its cash obligations in 2023 and beyond. 
 On May 11, 2021, Cal Water issued 280.0 million of First Mortgage Bonds (see Note 8) in a private placement. Cal Water used the net proceeds from the sale of the Bonds to refinance existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. Long-term financing, which includes First Mortgage Bonds, senior notes, other debt securities, and common stock, has typically been used to replace short-term borrowings and fund capital expenditures. Internally generated funds, after making dividend payments, provide positive cash flow, but have not been at a level to meet the needs of our capital expenditure requirements. Management expects this trend to continue given our capital expenditures plan for the next five years. Some capital expenditures are funded by payments received from developers for contributions in aid of construction or advances for construction. Funds received for contributions in aid of construction are non-refundable, whereas funds classified as advances in construction are refundable. Management believes long-term financing is available to meet our cash flow needs through issuances in both debt and equity instruments. 
 Additional information regarding the bank borrowings and long-term debt is presented in Notes 7 and 8 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Equity Issuance 
 On April 29, 2022, we entered into an equity distribution agreement to sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to 350.0 million from time to time depending on market conditions through an at-the-market equity program over the next three years. We intend to use the net proceeds from these sales, after deducting commissions on such sales and offering expenses, for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital, construction and acquisition expenditures, investments and repurchases, and redemptions of securities. Additional information regarding this program is presented in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Summarized Financial Information for Guarantors and the Issuer of Guaranteed Securities. 
 On April 17, 2009, Cal Water (Issuer) issued 100.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.500 First Mortgage Bonds due 2040, all of which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company (Guarantor). Certain subsidiaries of the Company do not guarantee the security and are referred to as Non-guarantors. The Guarantor fully, absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees the due and punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration, by notice of prepayment or otherwise, of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the bonds. The bonds rank equally among Cal Water's other first mortgage bonds. 
 The following tables present summarized financial information of the Issuer subsidiary and the Guarantor. The information presented below excludes eliminations necessary to arrive at the information on a consolidated basis. In presenting the summarized financial statements, the equity method of accounting has been applied to the Guarantor interests in the Issuer. The summarized information excludes financial information of the Non-issuers, including earnings from and investments in these entities.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We do not have commitments or obligations, including contingent obligations, arising from arrangements with unconsolidated entities or persons that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, cash requirements, or capital resources even when the arrangement results in no obligation being reported in our consolidated balance sheets. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 The contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under fixed contractual obligations and commitments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions and changes in interest rates, as well as action by third parties and other factors, may cause these estimates to change. Therefore, our actual payments in future periods may vary from those presented in the table below. 
 The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2022. We generally expect to satisfy these commitments with cash on hand and cash provided by operating activities.

 Advances for construction represent annual contract refunds to developers for the cost of water systems paid for by the developers. The contracts are non-interest bearing, and refunds are generally on a straight-line basis over a 40-year period. System and facility leases include obligations associated with leasing water systems and rents for office space. 
 For finance and operating lease obligations, see Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Cal Water has water supply contracts with wholesale suppliers in 13 of its operating districts and for the two leased systems in Hawthorne and Commerce. For each contract, the cost of water is established by the wholesale supplier and is generally beyond our control. The amount paid annually to the wholesale suppliers is charged to purchased water expense on our statements of operations. Most contracts do not require minimum annual payments and vary with the volume of water purchased. For more details related to water supply contracts, see Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Capital Requirements 
 Capital requirements consist primarily of new construction expenditures for expanding and replacing utility plant facilities and the acquisition of water systems. They also include refunds of advances for construction. 
 Company-funded and developer-funded utility plant expenditures were 327.8 million and 293.2 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. A majority of capital expenditures was associated with mains and water treatment equipment. 
 For 2023, our capital program is dependent in part on the timing and nature of regulatory approvals in connection with Cal Water's 2021 GRC Filing. Capital expenditures in California for 2022, excluding developer-funded expenditures, were 277.2 million. Cal Water proposed to the CPUC spending 1.0 billion on water infrastructure investments in 2022-2024. Capital expenditures in California are evaluated in the context of the pending GRC and may change as the case moves forward. We expect our annual capital expenditure to continue to increase during the next five years due to increasing needs to replace and maintain infrastructure. 
 Management expects there will be developer-funded expenditures in 2023 and expects that these expenditures will be financed by developers through refundable advances for construction and non-refundable contributions in aid of construction. Developers are required to deposit the cost of a water construction project with us prior to our commencing construction work, or the developers may construct the facilities themselves and deed the completed facilities to us. Funds are generally received in advance of incurring costs for these projects. Advances are normally refunded over a 40-year period without interest. Future payments for advances received are listed under contractual obligations above. Because non-Company-funded construction activity is solely at the discretion of developers, we cannot predict the level of future activity. The cash flow impact is expected to be minor due to the structure of the arrangements. 
 Capital Structure 
 Total equity was 1,322.4 million at December 31, 2022, compared to 1,171.9 million at December 31, 2021. The Company sold 1,802,063 and 3,286,865 shares of its common stock in 2022 and 2021, respectively through its at-the-market equity program. 
 Total capitalization, including the current portion of long-term debt, was 2,378.2 million at December 31, 2022 and 2,232.9 million at December 31, 2021. Cal Water repaid 5.4 million of other long-term debt obligations in both 2022 and 2021 for matured First Mortgage Bonds and other long-term debt obligations. In future periods, the Company intends to issue common stock and long-term debt to finance our operations. The capitalization ratios will vary depending upon the method we choose to finance our operations. 
 At December 31, capitalization ratios were: 
 2022 2021 Equity 55.6 52.5 Long-term debt 44.4 47.5 
 The return (from both regulated and non-regulated operations) on average equity was 7.7 in 2022 compared to 9.7 in 2021. Cal Water does not include construction work in progress in its regulated rate base; instead, Cal Water was authorized to record AFUDC on construction work in progress, effective January 1, 2017. Construction work in progress for Cal Water was 219.2 million at December 31, 2022 and 200.7 million at December 31, 2021.

 Acquisitions 
 There were no significant acquisitions in 2022, and refer to "Note 15 - Acquisitions" for 2021 acquisition activity. 
 Real Estate Program 
 We own real estate. From time to time, certain parcels are deemed no longer used or useful for water utility operations. Most surplus properties have a low cost basis. We developed a program to realize the value of certain surplus properties through sale or lease of those properties. The program will be ongoing for a period of several years. There were no significant sales in 2022 and 2021. As sales are dependent on real estate market conditions, future sales, if any, may or may not be at prior year levels. 
 
 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 
 We do not participate in hedge arrangements, such as forward contracts, swap agreements, options, or other contractual agreements to mitigate the impact of market fluctuations on our assets, liabilities, production, or contractual commitments. We operate only in the United States and, therefore, are not subject to foreign currency exchange rate risks. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are subject to interest rate risk, although this risk is lessened because we operate in a regulated industry. If interest rates were to increase, management believes customer rates would increase accordingly, subject to Commission approval in future GRC filings. The majority of our debt is long-term at a fixed rate. Interest rate risk does exist on short-term borrowings within our credit facilities, as these interest rates are variable. We also have interest rate risk on new financing, as higher interest cost may occur on new debt if interest rates increase. 
 Over the next 12 months, approximately 3.3 million of the 1,055.8 million of existing long-term debt instruments are expected to mature. Applying a hypothetical 10 percent increase in the rate of interest charged on those borrowings would not have a material effect on our earnings.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of California Water Service Group 
 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of California Water Service Group and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness identified below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 
 Basis for Opinions 
 The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 Material Weakness 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weakness has been identified by management and included in management's assessment: the Company did not design and maintain effective internal controls over the completeness of its accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities, specifically controls over the identification of regulatory filings by the Company during the period that are then reviewed to determine their potential accounting impact. This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, of the Company, and this report does not affect our report on such financial statements. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements Refer to Note 2 and 4 to the financial statements 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 The Company is subject to rate regulation by the California Public Utilities Commission the Commission ), which has jurisdiction with respect to the rates of water and wastewater service companies in California. Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, such as utility plant; regulatory assets and liabilities; operating revenue; operating expenses; and depreciation expense. 
 The Commission establishes rates that are designed to permit the recovery of the cost of service and a return on investment. The Company s rates are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes including a General Rate Case proceeding. The Company capitalizes and records regulatory assets for costs that would otherwise be charged to expense if it is probable that the incurred costs will be recovered in future rates. If costs expected to be incurred in the future are currently being recovered through rates, the Company records those expected future costs as regulatory liabilities. In addition, the Company records a regulatory liability when it is probable the Commission will require a refund to be made to customers over future periods. Determining probability requires significant judgment by management and includes, but is not limited to, consideration of testimony presented in regulatory hearings, proposed regulatory decisions, final regulatory orders, and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court appeals. If the Company determines that a portion of the assets used in utility operations are not recoverable in customer rates, the Company would be required to recognize the loss of the assets disallowed. 
 We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments that underlie the Company s regulatory account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of regulatory decisions on the financial statements. Management judgments include interpreting the intent of the Commission s decisions when appropriately measuring related regulatory assets or liabilities and assessing the probability of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs and (2) the requirement to refund to customers amounts collected prior to costs being incurred or subject to refund. Given that management s accounting judgements are based on assumptions about the outcome of future regulatory decisions and interpretation of new or revised regulatory decisions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and pervasive impact on the financial statements.

 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 Our audit procedures related to the interpretation of new or revised regulatory decisions, and the uncertainty of future regulatory hearings, proposed regulatory decisions, final regulatory orders, and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court appeals included the following, among others: 
 We tested the effectiveness of management s controls over the determination of regulatory assets or liabilities and the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. 
 We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commission for the Company, procedural filings, filings made by interveners, and other publicly available information to evaluate management s interpretation of the accounting impacts of any new or revised regulatory decisions and their impact on measuring related regulatory assets and liabilities. We evaluated the external information and compared it to management s recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness. 
 We obtained supporting documentation (such as letters or memorandums) from management and interpretations from external counsel as appropriate, regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refunds to customers for regulatory liabilities not yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or refund. 
 For regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Company s filings with the Commission and the filings with the Commission by intervenors, if applicable, that may impact the Company s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management s assertions. 
 We evaluated management s assumptions and methodologies used in measuring regulatory assets and liabilities for compliance with the related orders. 
 We evaluated the Company s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.

 owned subsidiary of Texas Water and is consolidated using the voting interest model as the Company owns a majority of the voting interests in the non-wholly owned subsidiary. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated from the consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments that are necessary to provide a fair presentation of the results for the periods covered. 
 The preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the consolidated balance sheet dates and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented. These include, but are not limited to, estimates and assumptions used in determining the Company's regulatory asset and liability balances based upon probability assessments of regulatory recovery, utility plant useful lives, revenues earned but not yet billed, asset retirement obligations, allowance for credit losses, pension and other employee benefit plan liabilities, and income tax-related assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
 interest not owned by Texas Water in a consolidated subsidiary. Texas Water obtained control over the subsidiary on May 1, 2021. Since the Company controls this subsidiary, its financial statements are consolidated with those of the Company, and the noncontrolling owner s share of the subsidiary s net assets and results of operations is deducted and reported as noncontrolling interests on the consolidated balance sheets and as net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the Company s equity. The Company s net income attributable to California Water Service Group excludes a net loss attributable to the noncontrolling interests.

 months. To the extent that regulatory balancing account revenue is estimated to be collectible beyond months, recognition is deferred. 
 The CPUC issued a decision effective August 27, 2020 requiring that Class A companies submitting GRC filings after the effective date be (i) precluded from proposing the use of a full decoupling WRAM in their next GRCs and (ii) allowed the use of Monterey-Style Water Revenue Adjustment Mechanisms (MWRAM). In addition, the CPUC's decision allowed for Incremental Cost Balancing Accounts (ICBAs), which are authorized by state statute, to replace the MCBA. The MWRAM tracks the difference between the revenue received for actual metered sales through the tiered volumetric rate and the revenue that would have been received with the same actual metered sales if a uniform rate had been in effect. The ICBA tracks differences between the authorized per-unit prices of water production costs and actual per-unit prices of water production costs. Cal Water complied with this decision in its 2021 GRC Filing and expects these replacement mechanisms to be in effect for 2023. 
 In September 2020, Cal Water filed an Application for Rehearing at the CPUC seeking to reverse the August 27, 2020 CPUC decision. While a decision was pending on the Application for Rehearing, Cal Water along with four other Class A California water utilities filed Petitions for a Writ of Review with the California Supreme Court (Court) on or about October 27, 2021. In September 2021, the CPUC denied the Application for Rehearing. On May 18, 2022, the Court issued writs granting review and ordered the CPUC and other filing parties to submit additional pleadings to the Court. The final pleadings were submitted on January 13, 2023. Cal Water anticipates that the Court will schedule an oral argument before it begins deliberations and issues its decision.

 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Intangibles and Goodwill 
 The Company's long-lived assets include transmission and distribution plant, equipment, land, buildings, and intangible assets. Long-lived assets, other than land, are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives, and are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances would include items such as a significant decrease in the market value of a long-lived asset, a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or planned to be used or in its physical condition, or a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the uses of the asset. In addition, changes in the expected useful life of these long-lived assets may also be an impairment indicator. When such events or changes occur, the Company estimates the fair value of the asset from future cash flows expected to result from the use and, if applicable, the eventual disposition of the assets, and compare that to the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying value is greater than the fair value, then an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the asset's carrying value exceeds its fair value. The key variables that must be estimated include assumptions regarding sales volume, rates, operating costs, labor and other benefit costs, capital additions, assumed discount rates and other economic factors. These variables require significant management judgment and include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events. A variation in the assumptions used could lead to a different conclusion regarding the realizability of an asset and, thus could have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements.

 The Company's pension and retiree group health regulatory asset represents the unfunded obligation of the Company s pension and postretirement benefit plans which the Company expects to recover from customers in the future for these plans. The pension and retiree group health regulatory liability represents the over funded obligation of the Company s postretirement benefit plans which the Company expects to refund to customers in the future. These plans are discussed in further detail in Note 11. 
 The PCBA regulatory asset and the HCBA regulatory liability represent incurred pension and healthcare costs that exceeded/was below the cost recovery in rates and is recoverable/refundable from/to customers. The other components of net periodic benefit cost regulatory asset are authorized by the Commissions and are probable for rate recovery through the capital program. 
 The property-related temporary differences are primarily due to: (i) the difference between book and federal income tax depreciation on utility plant that was placed in service before the regulatory Commissions adopted normalization for rate making purposes; and (ii) certain (state) deferred taxes for which flow through accounting continues to be applied to originating deferred taxes. The regulatory asset will be recovered in rates in future periods as the tax effects of the temporary differences previously flowed-through to customers reverse.

 On May 11, 2021, Cal Water completed the sale and issuance of million in aggregate principal amount of First Mortgage Bonds (the Bonds) in a private placement. The Bonds consist of million of bonds, series ZZZ, maturing May 11, 2051, and million of bonds, series 1, maturing May 11, 2061. Interest on the bonds accrues semi-annually and is payable in arrears. The Bonds will rank equally with all of Cal Water s other First Mortgage Bonds and will be secured by liens on Cal Water s properties, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens. Cal Water used the net proceeds from the sale of the Bonds to refinance existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. The Bonds were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. 
 On October 4, 2011, Cal Water entered into a finance lease arrangement with the City of Hawthorne to operate the City's water system for a period.

 On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted expansive tax legislation commonly referred to as the TCJA. Among other provisions, the TCJA reduces the federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning on January 1, 2018 and eliminated bonus depreciation for utilities. The TCJA required the Company to re-measure all existing deferred income tax assets and liabilities to reflect the reduction in the federal tax rate. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the TCJA refund liability was million. The Company continues working with other state regulators to finalize the refund to confirm compliance with federal normalization rules.

 Prior to 2010, pension payment obligations were generally funded by the purchase of an annuity from a life insurance company. Beginning in 2010, the pension plan trust pays monthly benefits to retirees, rather than the purchase of an annuity. 
 The Company also maintains an unfunded, non-qualified, supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP). The unfunded SERP accumulated benefit obligations were million and million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Benefit payments under the supplemental executive retirement plan are paid currently. As a non-qualified plan, the SERP has no plan assets, however, the Company has a Rabbi trust designated to provide funding for SERP obligations. The Rabbi trust holds investments in marketable securities and corporate-owned life insurance.

 Benefit Plan Assets 
 The Company actively manages pension and PBOP trust (Plan) assets. The Company's investment objectives are: 
 Maximize the return on the assets, commensurate with the risk that the Company deems appropriate to meet the obligations of the Plans, minimize the volatility of the pension expense, and account for contingencies; 
 Generate a rate of return for the total portfolio that equals or exceeds the actuarial investment rate assumption; 
 Additionally, the rate of return of the total fund is measured periodically against an index comprised of of the Standard Poor's Index, of the Russell 2000 Index, of the MSCI EAFE Index, and of the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index. The index is consistent with the Company's rate of return objective and indicates the Company's long-term asset allocation objective. 
 The Company applies a risk management framework for managing the risks associated with employee benefit plan trust assets. The guiding principles of this risk management framework are the clear articulation of roles and responsibilities, appropriate delegation of authority, and proper accountability and documentation. Trust investment policies and investment manager guidelines include provisions to ensure prudent diversification, manage risk through appropriate use of physical direct asset holdings and derivative securities, and identify permitted and prohibited investments. In 2022, the Company retained an investment manager to be the Company's Outsourced Chief Investment Officer (OCIO) and the OCIO was required to make investment decisions within the parameters of the Company's investment policies and guidelines.

 Valuation Assumptions 
 Discount rate - SERP Discount rate - other benefits Long-term rate of return on plan assets Rate of compensation increases - employee pension plan Rate of compensation increases - SERP Cost of living adjustment 
 The long-term rate of return assumption is the expected rate of return on a balanced portfolio invested roughly in equities and in fixed income securities. Returns on equity investments were estimated based on estimates of dividend yield and real earnings added to a long-term inflation rate. For the pension plans and other benefits, the assumed returns were for domestic equities and for foreign equities. Returns on fixed-income investments were projected based on investment maturities and credit spreads added to a long-term inflation rate. For the pension and other benefit plans, the assumed returns were and , respectively, for fixed income investments. The Company is using a long-term rate of return of for the pension plan and for the other benefit plan.

 shares of common stock. 
 During 2022, the Company granted RSAs of common stock to Officers and to the Board of Directors. An RSA share represents the right to receive a share of the Company's common stock and is valued based on the fair market value of the Company's common stock at the date of grant. RSAs granted to Officers vest over months with the first year cliff vesting. In general, RSAs granted to Board of Directors vest at the end of months. The RSAs are recognized as expense evenly over months for the shares granted to Officers and months for the shares granted to Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2022, there was approximately million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to RSAs. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years. 
 Granted Vested ) Forfeited ) RSAs at December 31, 2022 
 During 2022, the Company granted performance-based RSUs of common stock to Officers. Each award reflects a target number shares of common stock that may be issued to the award recipient. The 2022 awards may be earned upon the completion of a performance period. Whether RSUs are earned at the end of the performance period will be determined based on the achievement of certain performance objectives set by the Board of Directors Compensation Committee in connection with the issuance of the RSUs. The performance objectives are based on the Company's business plan covering the performance period. The performance objectives include achieving the budgeted return on equity, budgeted investment in utility plant, customer service standards, employee safety standards and water quality standards. Depending on the results achieved during the performance period, the actual number of shares that a grant recipient receives at the end of the performance period may range from to of the target shares granted, provided that the grantee is continuously employed by the Company through the vesting date. If prior to the vesting date employment is terminated by reason of death, disability or normal retirement, then a pro rata portion of this award will vest. The RSUs are recognized as expense ratably over the performance period using a fair market value of the Company's common share at the date of grant and an estimated number of RSUs earned during the performance period. As of December 31, 2022, there was approximately million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to RSUs. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years.

 million of commitments to Guadalupe Blanco River Authority (GBRA) in 2023 (details below). 
 The Company has a long-term contract with the Santa Clara Valley Water District that requires the Company to purchase minimum annual water quantities. Purchases are priced at the districts then-current wholesale water rate. The Company operates to purchase sufficient water to equal or exceed the minimum quantities under the contract. The total paid to Santa Clara Valley Water District was million in 2022, million in 2021, and million in 2020. 
 The Company also has a water supply contract with Stockton East Water District (SEWD) that requires a fixed monthly payment. Each year, the fixed monthly payment is adjusted for changes to SEWD's costs. The total paid under the contract was million in 2022, million in 2021, and million in 2020. 
 On September 21, 2005, the Company entered into an agreement with Kern County Water Agency (Agency) to obtain treated water for the Company's operations. The term of the agreement is to January 1, 2035, or until the repayment of the Agency's bonds (described hereafter) occurs. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company is obligated to purchase approximately acre feet of treated water per year. The Company is obligated to pay the Capital Facilities Charge and the Treated Water Charge regardless of whether it can use the water in its operation, and is obligated for these charges even if the Agency cannot produce an adequate amount to supply the acre feet in the year. This agreement supersedes a prior agreement with Kern County Water Agency for the supply of acre feet of water per year. 
 other parties, including the City of Bakersfield, are also obligated to purchase a total of acre feet per year under separate agreements with the Agency. Further, the Agency has the right to proportionally reduce the water supply provided to all of the participants if it cannot produce adequate supplies. If any of the other parties does not use its allocation, that party is obligated to pay its contracted amount. 
 If any of the parties were to default on making payments of the Capital Facilities Charge, then the other parties are obligated to pay for the defaulting party's share on a pro-rata basis. If there is a payment default by a party and the remaining parties have to make payments, they are also entitled to a pro-rata share of the defaulting party's water allocation. 
 The Company expects to use all its entitled water in its operations every year. In addition, if the Company were to pay for and receive additional amounts of water due to a default of another participating party; the Company believes it could use this additional water in its operations without incurring substantial incremental cost increases. If additional treated water is available, all parties have an option to purchase this additional treated water, subject to the Agency's right to allocate the water among the parties.

 million to the Agency. Based on the credit worthiness of the other participants, which are government entities, it is believed to be highly unlikely that the Company would be required to assume any other parties' obligations under the contract due to their default. 
 The Company pays a capital facilities charge and charges related to treated water that together total million annually, which equates to dollars per acre foot. Total treated water charge for 2022 was million. As treated water is being delivered, the Company will also be obligated for the Company's portion of the operating costs; that portion is currently estimated to be dollars per acre foot. The actual amount will vary due to variations from estimates, inflation, and other changes in the cost structure. Our overall estimated cost of dollars per acre foot is less than the estimated cost of procuring untreated water (assuming water rights could be obtained) and then providing treatment. 
 On August 16, 2022, BVRT Utility Holding Company (BVRT), a majority owned subsidiary of Texas Water, entered into a long-term water supply agreement with the Guadalupe Blanco River Authority (GBRA) through its wholly owned subsidiary, Camino Real Utility (Camino Real). The Company has provided a limited guarantee to GBRA for the agreed upon obligations. GBRA is a water conservation and reclamation district established by the Texas Legislature that oversees water resources for 10 counties. Under the terms of the agreement with GBRA, Camino Real is contracted to receive up to 2,419 acre-feet of potable water annually. The GBRA agreement involves four off-takers, including Camino Real, and GBRA plans to extend a potable water pipeline from the City of Lockhart to the City of Mustang Ridge and surrounding areas. Camino Real is contracted to be the utility service provider in this area of the Austin metropolitan region and to provide potable water, recycled water, and wastewater services to portions of the City of Mustang Ridge and surrounding areas. In 2022, Camino Real committed million for its share of the cost of the pipeline project. As of December 31, 2022, this committed cash has not been transferred to GBRA and is classified as part of restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company currently expects this committed cash to be transferred to GBRA in the first half of 2023. In January of 2023, Camino Real committed an additional million for its share of the cost of the pipeline project. 
 Leases 
 The Company has operating and finance leases for water systems, offices, land easements, licenses, equipment, and other facilities. The leases generally have remaining lease terms of year to years, some of which include options to extend the lease for up to years. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company s sole discretion. Most of the Company s lease agreements contain mutual termination options that require prior written notice by either lessee or lessor. The Company s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Certain leases include options to purchase the leased property. The depreciable life of the assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term, unless there is a transfer of title or purchase option that is reasonably certain of exercise. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as the Company applied the short-term lease exception allowed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board guidance. Lease expense for these leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. A subset of the Company s leases contains variable lease payments that depend on changes in the CPI. 
 The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at contract inception. Generally, a lease agreement exists if the Company determines that the arrangement gives the Company control over the use of an identified asset and obtains substantially all of the benefits from the identified asset. 
 The right-of-use (ROU) assets that are recorded represent the Company s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of the Company s operating leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The ROU asset and lease liability may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Variable lease payments that are based on changes in CPI are included in the measurement of ROU asset and lease liability on the basis of the rate at lease commencement. Subsequent changes to the payments as a result of changes to the CPI rate are recognized in the period in which the obligation of these payments is incurred.

 million settlement agreement and release of claims with the PRPs, in California Water Service Company and City of Bakersfield v. The Dow Chemical Company, et al., Civil Case No. CIV-470999 (TCP Action). The TCP Action sought damages and other relief related to the PRPs alleged contamination of drinking water supply and water wells with the chemical TCP. The proceeds from the settlement, after payment of the legal fees, was million and was used to reimburse a portion of the capital costs associated with Cal Water s remediation efforts related to such alleged TCP contamination. As of December 31, 2021, Cal Water used all of the proceeds on remediation efforts related to the alleged TCP contamination. Under the terms of the Agreement, the PRPs are released from all claims regarding of the total claimed wells, and Cal Water agreed to file a dismissal with prejudice of the TCP Action. The PRPs are also released from future claims regarding TCP contamination of any other wells, unless and until Cal Water has installed granular activated carbon filtration systems or other then-approved Sate treatment technology for TCP on, or replaced, wells due to TCP contamination. 
 Other Legal Matters 
 From time to time, the Company is involved in various disputes and litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. The status of each significant matter is reviewed and assessed for potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount of the range of loss can be estimated, a liability is accrued for the estimated loss in accordance with the accounting standards for contingencies. Legal proceedings are subject to uncertainties, and the outcomes are difficult to predict. Because of such uncertainties, accruals are based on the best information available at the time. While the outcome of these disputes and litigation matters cannot be predicted with any certainty, management does not believe when taking into account existing reserves the ultimate resolution of these matters will materially affect the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The Company has recognized a liability of million for all known legal matters as of December 31, 2022 primarily due to potable water main leaks and other work related legal matters. The cost of litigation is expensed as incurred and any settlement is first offset against such costs. Any settlement in excess of the cost to litigate is accounted for on a case by case basis, dependent on the nature of the settlement.

 Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 
 Management's Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022. Based on that evaluation, we concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described below. 
 Notwithstanding the material weakness described below, based on the additional analysis and other post-closing procedures performed, management believes the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, are fairly presented, in all material respects, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in "Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013)". As a result of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described below, management has concluded that, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2022. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte Touche LLP, has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, as stated in their report, which is included in Item 8 and incorporated herein. 
 A material weakness, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 12b-2, is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 Identification of the Material Weakness in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting : The Company did not design and maintain effective internal controls over the completeness of its accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities, specifically controls over the identification of regulatory filings by the Company during the period that are then reviewed to determine their potential accounting impact. A regulatory liability and corresponding decreases to operating revenue and deferred income taxes that had not been previously recorded for customer refunds in 2019 was identified during the fourth quarter of 2022 and has subsequently been corrected. Refer to Note 16 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Other than the material weakness noted above, there were no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting.

 Plan for Remediation of the Material Weakness in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Company management, with the oversight of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, is actively engaged in the planning for and implementation of remediation efforts to address the material weakness. Management plans to implement the following change in order to remediate the material weakness: 
 Management will implement the following control. Monthly, members of the rates and accounting departments will meet to evaluate the nature of all regulatory activity (examples include advice letter filings, GRC applications, testimony, and settlements) that has occurred during the month and expected to occur in the subsequent months. Accounting will determine the required accounting for the discussed activity and a memo will be written and reviewed to conclude on any accounting. 
 Management is committed to continuous improvement of the Company s financial reporting controls and will continue to diligently review the Company s internal controls over financial reporting. As management continues to evaluate and work to improve internal controls over financial reporting, the Company may determine to take additional measures to address the material weakness or determine to modify certain of the remediation measures described above. 
 Management will implement the remediation plan during the first quarter of 2023.

 Some provisions of our certificate, bylaws and Delaware law may have the effect of delaying, discouraging or preventing a change in control of us or changes in our management. Pursuant to our certificate and bylaws 
 the board of directors is authorized to issue blank check preferred stock without stockholder approval 
 the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal any provision of our bylaws 
 stockholders may not cumulate votes in the election of directors 

stockholders may take action only at a duly called meeting of the stockholders, and stockholders are not permitted to act by written consent 
 special meetings of the stockholders may be called by the stockholders only upon the request of stockholders owning shares representing 10 or more of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote on the matter or matters to be brought before the proposed special meeting 
 stockholders must satisfy advance notice procedures to submit proposals or nominate directors for consideration at a stockholders meeting and 
 we will indemnify officers and directors against losses that they may incur as a result of investigations and legal proceedings resulting from their services to us, which may include services in connection with takeover defense measures. 
 In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law DGCL ). In general, the statute prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date that the person became an interested stockholder unless, with some exceptions, the business combination or the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder is approved in a prescribed manner. Generally, a business combination includes a merger, asset or stock sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the stockholder, and an interested stockholder is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns (or within three years prior, did own) 15 or more of the corporation s outstanding voting stock. This provision may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control without further action by the stockholders. 
 Exclusive Forum 
 Our bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, a state court located within the State of Delaware (or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including any beneficial owner) to bring (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or employees to us or our stockholders (c) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our certificate or our bylaws (d) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine or (e) any other action asserting an internal corporate claim, as defined in Section 115 of the DGCL in all cases subject to the court's having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. It is possible that a court of law could rule that the choice of forum provision contained in our bylaws is inapplicable or unenforceable if it is challenged in a proceeding or otherwise. Such exclusive forum provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
