Item 1. Business 

General Corporate History 

Bio Essence Corp. we, us, 
 Bio Essence, or the Company is an herbal health, diet, and nutrition company. The Company s mission
is to provide herbal health, diet, and vitamin nutritional supplements through three (3) operational subsidiaries, as explained below. 

The Company was incorporated in the State of California
on January 1, 2000. On January 27, 2016, the Company entered into a change of control whereby our controlling shareholder, Jian Yang,
purchased a controlling interest in the Company. On that same date, Jian Yang entered into a stock purchase agreement with Fusion Diet
Systems, Inc. a Utah corporation dba, Fusion Naturals Fusion Naturals ). Fusion Naturals was originally incorporated in
Utah on April 20, 2010. On January 9, 2017, the Company created a new corporation in the State of California called Bio Essence Pharmaceutical,
Inc. to serve as a health supplements manufacturer BEP ). Then, on January 12, 2017, the Company created its third subsidiary,
Bio Essence Herbal Essentials Inc. BEH ). The Company serves as a holding corporation for these subsidiaries. On November
13, 2021, the Company dissolved Fusion Naturals and formed a new wholly owned subsidiary, McBE Pharma, Inc. McBE ). 

The primary focus of BEH is producing products
for BEE and McBE, along with providing original equipment manufacturing and private label services to other companies. BEE targets and
develops traditional Chinese medicines TCM in the form of single herbs, granules, pills, and tablets. It also offers special
formulated dietary supplements and medical food. The Company intends to develop this subsidiary into one that is engaged in integrated
health and to provide its customers to interact with dietitians, nutraceutical practitioners, and traditional integrative wellness doctors
worldwide. McBE is in the process of implementing a new business plan that focuses on developing pharmaceuticals, supplements, and other
similar products. 

The Company sells its products through channels
such as TCM practitioners, online websites, including its own proprietary website, and brick-and-mortar stores, such as GNC. Material
sales have been made through these channels. The Company has conducted sales meetings with prospects through brokers and direct contacts
to sell through other channels, including, Vitamin World, TJ Max, Home Goods, Marshalls, and grocery outlets, however as of the filing
of this Registration Statement, the Company has not made any material sales through these channels. 

The Company is headquartered at 8 Studebaker Drive
in Irvine, California 92618 and the Company s website is http://www.bioessencecorp.com. Our telephone number is (949) 706-9966.
An organizational chart appearing on the next page provides an illustration of the relationship between the entities identified above. 

Employees 

The Company currently has 11 full-time employees. 

Emerging Growth Company 

We are an emerging growth company under the JOBS
Act. We shall continue to be deemed an emerging growth company until the earliest of: 

(a) the last day of the fiscal year
of the issuer during which it had total annual gross revenues of 1,000,000,000 (as such amount is indexed for inflation every 5 years
by the Commission to reflect the change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
setting the threshold to the nearest 1,000,000) or more; 

(b) the last day of the fiscal year
of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of the issuer pursuant to an effective
IPO registration statement; 

(c) the date on which such issuer has,
during the previous 3-year period, issued more than 1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt; or 

(d) the date on which such issuer is
deemed to be a large accelerated filer , as defined in section 240.12b-2 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, or any
successor thereto. 

2 

As an emerging growth company, we are exempt from
Section 404(b) of Sarbanes Oxley. Section 404(a) requires Issuers to publish information in their annual reports concerning the scope
and adequacy of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. This statement shall also assess the effectiveness
of such internal controls and procedures. Section 404(b) requires that the registered accounting firm shall, in the same report, attest
to and report on the assessment on the effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. 

As an emerging growth company we are also exempt
from Section 14A (a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which require the shareholder approval of executive compensation and
golden parachutes. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under
Section 102(b)(2) of the Jobs Act, that allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective
dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements
may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide this information.

that 75 of its manufacturing is contracted out through third-party manufacturers, while the remaining is done in-house in its production
facility and primarily consists of small batches. The Company recently relocated to this facility after its former production facility
was compromised by the Company s former landlord specifically, the landlord permitted other business to sublease the property,

Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operation. 

Business Overview 

Bio Essence Corporation the Company or Bio Essence was incorporated in 2000 in the state of California. Fusion Diet Systems FDS was incorporated in 2010 in the state of Utah. Bio Essence and FDS were owned under common control since 2016. Bio Essence and FDS are
mainly engaged in manufacturing and distributing health supplement products. In January 2017, Bio Essence incorporated two subsidiaries
in the state of California: BEP and BEH, Bio Essence transferred its manufacturing operation into BEP, and transferred its distributing
operation into BEH. On March 1, 2017, the 100 shareholder of FDS transferred all her ownership in FDS into Bio Essence. On December 7,
2021, the Company dissolved FDS. On November 12, 2021, Bio Essence incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary McBE Pharma Inc. McBE in the state of California, McBE will be engaged in research and development and manufacture of prescription medicine. As a result of
the ownership restructure, BEP, BEH, and MCBE became wholly owned subsidiaries of Bio Essence, and Bio Essence serves as a holding corporation
for these subsidiaries. McBE has not engaged any operations since its inception. 

The primary focus of
BEP is producing products for BEH, along with providing OEM services to other companies. BEH targets healthcare practitioners with herbal
products in the form of granules, capsules, pills and tablets. It also offers special formulation service to practitioners. The Company
intends to develop the subsidiary into an integrated healthcare platform that provides customers direct connections with integrative healthcare
practitioners such as dietitians, nutraceutical practitioners, and other practitioners in this discipline worldwide. 

However, the pandemic
could result in significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing the Company s ability to access capital, which could
negatively affect the Company s liquidity. 

Related Party Transactions 

Loans from Officer 

At December 31, 2022
and 2021, the Company had loans from one major shareholder (also the Company s senior officer) of 2,543,155 and 1,785,154, respectively.
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had loan from another major shareholder for 608,631 for settling the litigation. There are
no written loan agreements for these loans. These loans are unsecured, non-interest bearing and have no fixed terms of repayment, and
therefore, deemed payable on demand. 

Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates 

Our management s
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements CFS ),
which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America US GAAP ).
The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported
net sales and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates
on historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the
basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual
results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

While our significant
accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our CFS, we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical
to assist you in fully understanding and evaluating this management discussion and analysis. 

5 

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying consolidated
financial statements CFS are prepared in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles US GAAP and
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC regarding interim financial reporting.
The functional currency of Bio Essence is U.S. dollars ). The accompanying financial statements are presented in
U.S. dollars ). The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries,
BEP, BEH and McBE. All significant inter-company transactions and balances were eliminated in consolidation. 

Going Concern 

The Company incurred
net losses of 809,679 and 647,564 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company also had an accumulated
deficit of 8,168,595 as of December 31, 2022. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern. The Company plans to increase its income by strengthening its sales force, providing attractive sales incentive programs,
and increasing marketing and promotion activities. Management also intends to raise additional funds by way of a private or public offering,
or by obtaining loans from banks or others. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate sufficient revenue
and in its ability to raise additional funds on reasonable terms and conditions, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability
of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to further implement its business plan and
generate sufficient revenue and its ability to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Use of Estimates 

In preparing financial
statements in conformity with US GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. 

Significant estimates,
required by management, include the recoverability of long-lived assets, allowance for doubtful accounts, and the reserve for obsolete
and slow-moving inventories. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Accounts Receivable 

The Company s policy
is to maintain an allowance for potential credit losses on accounts receivable. Management reviews the composition of accounts receivable
and analyzes historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer
payment patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the bad debt allowance was 2,252 and 2,252,
respectively. 

Revenue Recognition 

The Company recognizes
revenues following the five-step model prescribed under ASC 606: (i) identify contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance
obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations
in the contract; and (v) recognize revenues when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligation. 

Revenue is measured at
the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the sale of our product, which occurs at a point in time, typically upon
delivery to the customer. The Company expenses incremental costs of obtaining a contract as and when incurred if the expected amortization
period of the asset that it would have recognized is one year or less or the amount is immaterial. 

Revenues from sales of
goods are measured at net of reserves established for applicable discounts and allowances that are offered within contracts with the Company s
customers and are recognized when the goods are delivered to the customers. 

6 

Product revenue reserves,
which are classified as a reduction in product revenues, are generally characterized in the following categories: discounts, returns and
rebates. These reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions
of accounts receivable as the amount is payable to the Company s customers. 

Revenues from manufacture
services are recognized when the manufacture process is completed pursuant to the customers requirement and the finished goods
were delivered to the customers. 

The Company s return
policy allows for the return of damaged or defective products and shipment errors. A notice of damage or wrong items should make within
five days from receiving the goods, and actual return of the products must be completed within 30 days from the date of receiving the
goods. Delayed notification for damaged or wrong products will not be accepted for return or exchange. Custom formulas and capsules are
not returnable. The amount for return of products was immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Revenues 

Sales for the years ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 985,757 and 887,984, respectively, an increase of 97,773 or 11.01 . For the years ended December 31,
2022, we had sales of goods of 621,590 and manufacture service revenue of 364,167. For the years ended December 31, 2021, we had sales
of goods of 774,066 and manufacture service revenue of 113,918. The decreased sales of goods was mainly due to certain big customers
reducing their purchase orders in 2022, as a remediation, we started to provide OEM service since 4 th quarter of 2021,
which increased significantly in 2022 as a result of our effort to promote our manufacture service.

Cost of revenues 

Cost of revenues for
the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 600,808 and 589,660, respectively, an increase of 11,148 or 1.89 . The increase
of cost of revenue in 2022 was primarily attributed to the increased cost of manufacturing service. During the years ended December
31, 2022, we received quite a few big orders for the OEM, which required additional labor and manufacture equipment to complete the orders. 

Gross profit 

The gross profit for
the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 384,949 and 298,324, respectively, an increase of 86,625 or 29.04 . The profit margin
was 39.05 for 2022 compared to 33.60 for 2021, the increase in profit margin was mainly due to increased profit margin from sale of
goods, which was 53.37 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 35.68 for the year ended December 31, 2021. We lost a few big
customers due to strong competition and our pricing disadvantage, however the corresponding high cost was also decreased. 

Operating expenses 

Selling expenses consisted
mainly of advertising, show expense, product marketing, shipping expenses, and promotion expenses. Selling expense was 87,775 for the
year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 70,193 for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 17,582 or 25.05 , mainly
resulting from increased trade show expense by 11,740, increased advertising expense by 4,140, and increased marketing expense by 3,410,
which was partly offset by decreased shipping expenses by 1,720. 

Bad
debt expense was 0 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 8,615 for the year ended December 31, 2021, an decrease of 8,615
or 100 , primarily attributed to written off FDS s receivables in 2021, as FDS was dissolved. 

General and administrative
expenses consisted mainly of employee salaries and welfare, business meeting, utilities, audit, and legal expenses. General and administrative
expenses were 1,079,978 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 1,077,043 for the year ended December 31, 2021, a slight increase
of 2,935 or 0.27 . The increase was mainly due to increased salary expenses by 32,801, increased rental expense by 7,820; offset by
decreased consultant fees of 33,717. 

Other income (expense),
net 

Other expense was 23,575 for the year ended
December 31, 2022, compare to other income 213,263 for the year ended December 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2022,
other expenses mainly consisted of interest expense of 23,042, financial expense of 5,332, and net other income of 4,799. For the year
ended December 31, 2021, other income mainly consists of PPP Loan forgiveness of 242,985, which was partly offset by interest expense
of 38,558 and financial expense of 9,699. 

Net loss 

We had a net loss of
 809,679 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 647,564 for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 162,115 or 25.03 
reflected the above-mentioned factors combined.

Liquidity and Capital
Resources 

As of December 31, 2022,
we had cash and equivalents of 6,262, bank overdraft of 53,651, other current assets of 197,569, other current liabilities (excluding
bank overdraft) of 3,504,179, working capital deficit of 3,353,999, a current ratio of 0.06:1. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash
and equivalents of 303, bank overdraft of 19,032, other current assets of 261,659, other current liabilities (excluding bank overdraft)
of 2,736,932, working capital deficit of 2,494,002, a current ratio of 0.10:1. The following is a summary of cash provided by or used
in each of the indicated types of activities during the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively.

Net cash used in operating
activities 

Net cash used in operating
activities was 706,824 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 1,294,118 in 2021. The decrease of cash outflow of 587,294
from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was principally due to decreased cash outflow on prepaid expenses by 52,661,
and decreased cash outflow on accrued liability and other payable by 503,307. 

Net cash used in investing
activities 

Net cash used in investing
activities was 59,120 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 116,796 in 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we purchased
fixed assets of 59,120. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we purchased fixed assets of 119,496 and sold fixed assets for 2,700. 

Net cash provided
by financing activities 

Net cash provided by
financing activities was 771,903 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 1,405,892 in 2021. The net cash provided by financing
activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 consisted of proceeds of 758,000 from loans from one major shareholder (also the senior
officer) and increase in bank overdraft of 34,619, partly offset by repayment of loan payable of 12,218, repayment of government loan
of 698, and payment of finance lease liability of 7,800. The net cash provided by financing activities in 2021 consisted of proceeds
of 1,285,777 from loans from two major shareholders (one of which is the Company s senior officer), proceeds of 53,767 from loans
payable, and proceeds of 115,245 from government loans, partly offset by decrease in bank overdraft of 44,863 and repayment of loan
payable of 4,034. 

Our current liabilities
exceed current assets at December 31, 2022, and we incurred substantial losses and cash outflows from operating activities in the periods
presented. We may have difficulty to meet upcoming cash requirements. As of December 31, 2022, our principal source of funds was loans
from an officer (also is the Company s major shareholder). As of December 31, 2022, we believe we will need 1.2 million cash to
continue our current business for the next 12 months. In addition to our continuous effort to improve our sales and net profits, we have
explored and continue to explore other options to provide additional financing to fund future operations as well as other possible courses
of action. Such actions may include, but are not limited to, securing lines of credit, sales of debt or equity securities (which may result
in dilution to existing shareholders), loans and cash advances from other third parties or banks, and other similar actions. There can
be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funding (if needed), on acceptable terms or at all, through a sale of our common
stock, loans from financial institutions, or other third parties, or any of the actions discussed above. If we cannot sustain profitable
operations, and additional capital is unavailable, lack of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our business viability, financial
position, results of operations and cash flows.

There are not and have not been any changes in

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 

The Company s Chief Executive, Yin Yan,
is responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures for the Company. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

For purposes of this Item 9A., the term disclosure
controls and procedures means controls and other procedures of the Company (i) that are designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (15 U.S.C.
78a et seq. and hereinafter the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the
time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and (ii) include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing
similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

On December 31, 2022, Ms. Yan reviewed the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period
covered by this report and has concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that material
information relating to the Company is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC.

Report of Management on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Our internal control over
financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and BOD regarding the preparation and fair presentation
of published financial statements. Management conducted an assessment of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework
and criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework (2013). Based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal controls over financial reporting
were effective at the reasonable assurance level based on those criteria. 

Our independent public accountant has not conducted
an audit of our controls and procedures regarding internal control over financial reporting and therefore expresses no opinion with regards
to the effectiveness or implementation of our controls and procedures with regards to internal control over financial reporting. 

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial
Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting identified in connection with our evaluation of these controls as of the end of the fiscal year, December 31,
2022, as covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting. 

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 

The Company s management does not expect
that its disclosure controls or its internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control
system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s
objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of
controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation
of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances
of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making
can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts
of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based
in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving
its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are
subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance
with policies or procedures.

sole or shared voting or investment power within 60 days through the conversion or exercise of any convertible security, warrant, option
or other right. More than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same securities. The percentage of beneficial ownership
by any person as of a particular date is calculated by dividing the number of shares beneficially owned by such person, which includes
the number of shares as to which such person has the right to acquire voting or investment power within 60 days, by the sum of the number
of shares outstanding as of such date plus the number of shares as to which such person has the right to acquire voting or investment
power within 60 days. Consequently, the denominator used for calculating such percentage may be different for each beneficial owner.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and 
Stockholders of Bio Essence Corp. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Bio Essence Corp. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements
of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended
December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going Concern Matter 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has
incurred recurring net losses with significant accumulated deficit, and negative cash flows from operations. These conditions raise substantial
doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty . 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below
are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to
the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our
especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there were no critical audit matters.

and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company
also had an accumulated deficit of as of December 31, 2022. These conditions raise a substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. The Company plans to increase its income by strengthening its sales force, providing attractive
sales incentive program, and increasing marketing and promotion activities. Management also intends to raise additional funds by way
of a private or public offering, or by obtaining loans from banks or others. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy
to generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds on reasonable terms and conditions, there can be no assurances
to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to further implement
its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and its ability to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering. The
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

US Small Business Administration the SBA ). The loan will be fully forgiven if the funds are used for payroll costs, interest
on mortgages, rent, and utilities (at least of the forgiven amount must have been used for payroll). The loan amount not
forgiven, will have annual interest of . Loan payments will be deferred to either (1) the date that SBA remits the borrower s
loan forgiveness amount to the lender or (2) if the borrower does not apply for loan forgiveness, 10 months after the end of the borrower s
loan forgiveness covered period. Loans issued prior to June 5, 2020 have a maturity of two years, loans issued after June 5, 2020
have a maturity of five years. No collateral or personal guarantees are required. A borrower may apply for loan forgiveness any time on
or before the maturity date of the loan, including before the end of the Covered Period (either (1) the 24-week (168-day) period beginning
on the PPP Loan Disbursement Date, or (2) if the Borrower received its PPP loan before June 5, 2020, the Borrower
may elect to use an eight-week (56-day) Covered Period); provided such application for loan forgiveness is made within 10 months
after the last day of the covered period, otherwise the loan is no longer deferred and the borrower must begin paying principal and interest.
Subsequently, The U.S. Treasury and SBA announced a streamlined PPP forgiveness application for loans of or less (unless those
borrowers together with their affiliates received loans totaling million or more). It requires fewer calculations and may call for
less documentation. It does not require borrowers to reduce their loan forgiveness calculations if they have reduced full-time equivalent FTE or salaries. In addition, in February 2021, BEH, BEP and FDS received a total of from the second round of
PPP loan from the SBA. As of December 31, 2021, all BEH, BEP and FDS PPP loans forgiveness were approved and the Company
recorded PPP loan forgiveness as other income in the year ended December 31, 2021.

disaster loan for working capital to small businesses and non-profit organizations of any size suffering substantial economic injury
as a result of the Coronavirus (COVID-19), to help the businesses to meet financial obligations and operating expenses that could have
been met had the disaster not occurred. This loan has interest of and is not forgivable. The maturity of the loan is 30 years, installment
payments including principal and interest of monthly will begin 12 months from the date of the promissory note. On March 4,
2022, The FDS transferred its EIDL loan to BEC due to the dissolution of FDS. The SBA extended the deferment period to allow small businesses
and not-for-profits that received EIDL funds do not have to begin payments on the loan until 30 months after the date of the note. Accordingly,
the company began to make installment payments in the fourth quarter 2022.
