Item
1117 of Regulation AB, Legal Proceedings. 

The
registrant knows of no material pending legal proceeding involving the trust or any party related to the trust, other than routine
litigation incidental to the duties of those respective parties, and the following, with respect to U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, certificate
administrator and custodian. 

In the last several years,
U.S. Bank National Association U.S. Bank and other large financial institutions have been sued in their capacity as trustee or successor trustee for certain
residential mortgage backed securities RMBS trusts. The complaints, primarily filed by investors or investor groups against U.S. Bank and similar institutions,
allege the trustees caused losses to investors as a result of alleged failures by the sponsors, mortgage loan sellers and servicers to comply with the governing
agreements for these RMBS trusts. Plaintiffs generally assert causes of action based upon the trustees purported failures to enforce repurchase obligations of
mortgage loan sellers for alleged breaches of representations and warranties, notify securityholders of purported events of default allegedly caused by breaches of
servicing standards by mortgage loan servicers and abide by a heightened standard of care following alleged events of default. 

U.S. Bank denies liability
and believes that it has performed its obligations under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions were not the cause of losses to investors, that it has
meritorious defenses, and it has contested and intends to continue contesting the plaintiffs claims vigorously. However, U.S. Bank cannot assure you as to the
outcome of any of the litigation, or the possible impact of these litigations on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. 

On March 9, 2018, a law
firm purporting to represent fifteen Delaware statutory trusts (the DSTs that issued securities backed by student loans (the Student Loans filed a lawsuit
in the Delaware Court of Chancery against U.S. Bank National Association U.S. Bank in its capacities as indenture trustee and successor special servicer, and
three other institutions in their respective transaction capacities, with respect to the DSTs and the Student Loans. This lawsuit is captioned The National
Collegiate Student Loan Master Trust I, et al. v. U.S. Bank National Association, et al., C.A. No. 2018-0167-JRS (Del. Ch.) (the NCMSLT Action ). The complaint,
as amended on June 15, 2018, alleged that the DSTs have been harmed as a result of purported misconduct or omissions by the defendants concerning administration
of the trusts and special servicing of the Student Loans. Since the filing of the NCMSLT Action, certain Student Loan borrowers have made assertions against U.S.
Bank concerning special servicing that appear to be based on certain allegations made on behalf of the DSTs in the NCMSLT Action. 

U.S. Bank believes that
it has performed its obligations as indenture trustee and special servicer in good faith and in compliance in all material respects with the terms of the agreements
governing the DSTs (the Governing Agreements ), and accordingly that the claims against it in the NCMSLT Action are without merit. 

U.S. Bank has filed a
motion seeking dismissal of the operative complaint in its entirety with prejudice pursuant to Chancery Court Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) or, in the alternative,
a stay of the case while other prior filed disputes involving the DSTs and the Student Loans are litigated. On November 7, 2018, the Court ruled that the case
should be stayed in its entirety pending resolution of the first-filed cases. On January 21, 2020, the Court entered an order consolidating for pretrial purposes
the NCMSLT Action and three other lawsuits pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery concerning the DSTs and the Student Loans (the Consolidated Action ). U.S.
Bank and other parties to the Consolidated Action have briefed and argued motions for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Chancery Court Rule 12(c) regarding
disputed issues of contractual interpretation at issue in one or more of the cases comprising the Consolidated Action, including the NCMSLT Action. The Court
has not yet ruled on these motions or on U.S. Bank s dismissal motion in the NCMSLT Action. 

Item
1119 of Regulation AB, Affiliations and Certain Relationships and Related Transactions. 

The
information regarding this Item has been previously provided in a prospectus supplement of the Registrant relating to the issuing
entity filed on July 16, 2012 pursuant to Rule 424(b)(5).

2022 with respect to the Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such
activities. 

With
respect to servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(xi), and 1122(d)(4)(xii), the Company has engaged various
vendors to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria. The Company s management has determined that none
of these vendors is considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company s management
has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted
by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation C DI 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C DI
200.06) (formerly SEC Manual of Publicly Available Telephone Interpretations 17.06). The Company has policies and procedures in
place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with the servicing
criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company s management is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC
requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria. 

Investment
banking and securities are offered through Wells Fargo Securities LLC 

The
Company s management has assessed the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange
Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. Based on such assessment, management believes that, as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2022, the Company has complied in all material respects with the servicing criteria set forth in Item
1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the servicing of the Platform. 

The
Company has not identified and is not aware of any material instance of noncompliance by the Vendors with the applicable servicing
criteria as of December 31, 2022, or for the Reporting Period with respect to the Platform taken as a whole. 

The
Company has not identified any material deficiency in its policies and procedures to monitor the compliance by the Vendors with
the applicable servicing criteria as of December 31, 2022, or for the Reporting Period with respect to the Platform taken as a
whole. 

KPMG
LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report with respect to management s assessment
of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

The
Board of Directors 

 Wells
Fargo Bank, National Association: 

We
have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying 2022 Certification Regarding Compliance with Applicable
Servicing Criteria, that Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage Servicing, a division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the
Company) complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation
AB (the Servicing Criteria) for Commercial and Multifamily Loans (the Platform) except for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii),
1122(d)(3)(i)(B-D), 1122(d)(3)(ii-iv), 1122(d)(4)(ii), and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Company has determined are not applicable
to the activities it performs with respect to the Platform, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company has determined
that servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(xi) and 1122(d)(4)(xii) are applicable to the activities the Company performs with respect
to the Platform, except for certain tax payment activities that the Company has engaged various vendors to perform. With respect
to applicable servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(iii), the Company has determined that there were no activities performed during the
year ended December 31, 2022 with respect to the Platform because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company
to perform such activities. Appendix A to the 2022 Certification Regarding Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria identifies
the individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the Platform. Management is responsible
for the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s
assertion about the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria based on our examination. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and
in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to obtain reasonable
assurance and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the Servicing
Criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing
selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing selected servicing activities related to
the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities
in compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing
activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether
errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated
or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We
believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination
on the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria. 

We
are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements
relating to the examination engagement. 

As
described in the accompanying 2022 Certification Regarding Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, for servicing criteria
1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(vi), and for certain activities related to 1122(d)(4)(xi), and 1122(d)(4)(xii), the Company has engaged
various vendors to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria. The Company has determined that none of these
vendors is considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take
responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by the SEC s
 Compliance and Disclosure

LLP, a Delaware limited liability partnership and a member firm of 

 the
KPMG global organization of independent member firms affiliated with

Interpretation
(C DI) 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C DI 200.06). As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Company has asserted
that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply
in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining
that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendors and related servicing criteria as described in its
assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 

In
our opinion, management s assertion that Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage Servicing, a division of Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association, complied with the aforementioned Servicing Criteria, including servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(vi),
1122(d)(4)(xi), and 1122(d)(4)(xii) for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 as described above, as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2022 is fairly stated, in all material respects.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with the

in all material respects, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance
with the servicing criteria, including tests on a sample basis of the servicing activities related to the Platform, determining
whether the Company performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria during the specified period,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our procedures were limited to selected servicing
activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report and, accordingly, such samples may not have included
servicing activities related to each asset-backed transaction included in the Platform. Further, an examination is not designed
to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to the period specified above that may have affected the
balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that the evidence
we obtained in our examination is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

As described in management s assertion, for servicing
criteria Item 1122(d)(1)(ii), the Company has engaged vendors to perform certain activities required by this servicing criteria.
The Company has determined that these vendors are not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation
AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to these
vendors as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI
200.06 ). As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed
to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria
applicable to these vendors. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI
200.06 for these vendors and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the
Company s determination of its eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 

Our examination does not provide a legal determination
on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 

In our opinion, management s assertion
that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, for the commercial
mortgage loan platform, is fairly stated, in all material respects.

The
Board of Directors 

 U.S.
Bank National Association 

We
have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Report on Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing
Criteria, that U.S. Bank National Association and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association (collectively, the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB
for the U.S. Bank Corporate Trust Asset-Backed Securities Platform (the Platform ), for which the Company provides
trustee, securities administration, registrar and paying agent services, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, except
for servicing criteria Items 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(4)(i)-(ii), and 1122(d)(4)(iv)-(xiv), which the Company has determined are
not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the servicing platform covered by this report. Management is responsible
for the Company s compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s
assertion about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence
about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than all of the individual asset-backed transactions
and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining
whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing
criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company
during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either
prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during
the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. Although the Company is responsible
for assessing compliance with Items 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(v), and 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB, there were no servicing
activities performed by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2022 that required these servicing criteria to be complied
with. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

We
are required to be independent of the Company and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant
ethical requirements related to our examination engagement. 

Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 

In
our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2022, for the U.S. Bank Corporate Trust Asset-Backed Securities Platform is fairly stated, in all material
respects.
