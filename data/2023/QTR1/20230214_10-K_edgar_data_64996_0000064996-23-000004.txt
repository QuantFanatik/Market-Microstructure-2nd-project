Production and Servicing of Business 
 The Company sells its policies through a network of approximately 7,450 independent agents, its 100 owned insurance agencies, AIS and PoliSeek, and directly through internet sales portals. Approximately 1,900, 1,270, and 1,240 of the independent agents are located in California, Florida, and Texas, respectively. The independent agents and agencies are independent contractors selected and contracted by the Company and generally also represent competing insurance companies. Certain of these independent agencies are under the common ownership of a parent company; however, they each operate autonomously with their own contractual agreements with the Company and hence are accounted for as separate independent agencies. Excluding AIS and PoliSeek, independent agents and agencies collectively accounted for approximately 88 of the Company's direct premiums written in 2022 and no single independent agent or agency accounted for more than 1.1 of the Company s direct premiums written during any of the last three years. AIS and PoliSeek represented the Company as independent agencies prior to their acquisition in 2009, and continue to act as independent agencies selling policies for a number of other insurance companies. Policies sold directly through the internet sales portals are assigned to and serviced by the Company's agents and agencies, including AIS and PoliSeek. 
 
 The Company believes that it compensates its agents above the industry average. Net commissions incurred in 2022 were approximately 15 of net premiums written. 
 
 The Company s advertising budget is allocated among television, radio, newspaper, internet, and direct mailing media with the intent to provide the best coverage available within targeted media markets. While the majority of these advertising costs are borne by the Company, a portion of these costs are reimbursed by the Company s independent agents based upon the number of account leads generated by the advertising. The Company believes that its advertising program is important to generate leads, create brand awareness, and remain competitive in the current insurance climate. In 2022, the Company incurred approximately 12 million in net advertising expense. 

Underwriting 
 The Company sets its own automobile insurance premium rates, subject to rating regulations issued by the Department of Insurance or similar governmental agency of each state in which it is licensed to operate ("DOI"). Each state has different rate approval requirements. See "Regulation Department of Insurance Oversight." 
 
 The Company offers standard, non-standard, and preferred private passenger automobile insurance in 11 states. The Company also offers homeowners insurance in 10 states, commercial automobile insurance in 4 states, and mechanical protection insurance in most states. 
 
 In California, "good drivers," as defined by the California Insurance Code, accounted for approximately 88 of the Company's California voluntary private passenger automobile policies-in-force at December 31, 2022, while higher risk categories accounted for approximately 12 . The Company's private passenger automobile renewal rate in California (the rate of acceptance of offers to renew) averaged approximately 96 , 97 , and 96 in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. 

Claims 
 The Company conducts the majority of claims processing without the assistance of outside adjusters. The claims staff administers all claims and manages all legal and adjustment aspects of claims processing. 

Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves ("Loss Reserves") and Reserve Development 
 The Company maintains loss reserves for both reported and unreported claims. Loss reserves for reported claims are estimated based upon a case-by-case evaluation of the type of claim involved and the expected development of such claims. Loss reserves for unreported claims are determined on the basis of historical information by line of insurance business. Inflation is reflected in the reserving process through analysis of cost trends and review of historical reserve settlement. 
 
 The Company s ultimate liability may be greater or less than management estimates of reported loss reserves. The Company does not discount to a present value that portion of loss reserves expected to be paid in future periods. However, the Company is required to discount loss reserves for federal income tax purposes.

 (1) Under statutory accounting principles ("SAP"), reserves are stated net of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses whereas under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), reserves are stated gross of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses. 
 
 During 2022, inflationary trends accelerated to their highest level in decades, which had a significant impact on the cost of automobile parts and labor as well as medical expenses for bodily injuries, and supply chain and labor shortage issues lengthened the time to repair vehicles. Bodily injury costs were also under pressure from social inflation. These factors contributed to higher losses and loss adjustment expenses related to the current accident year for 2022 compared to 2021 and 2020. The increase in the provision for insured events of prior years in 2022 of approximately 47.3 million primarily resulted from higher than estimated losses and loss adjustment expenses in the automobile line of insurance business. The inflation, supply chain, and labor issues discussed above were major contributors to the adverse reserve development in the automobile line of insurance business for 2022. 
 
 The decrease in the provision for insured events of prior years in 2021 of approximately 26.1 million primarily resulted from lower than estimated losses and loss adjustment expenses in the homeowners and private passenger automobile lines of insurance business. 
 
 The increase in the provision for insured events of prior years in 2020 of approximately 23.0 million primarily resulted from higher than estimated losses and loss adjustment expenses in the homeowners and commercial automobile lines of insurance business. 
 
 The Company recorded catastrophe losses net of reinsurance of approximately 102 million, 104 million, and 64 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Catastrophe losses due to events that occurred in 2022 totaled approximately 101 million, w ith no reinsurance benefits used for these losses, resulting primarily from the deep freeze of Winter Storm Elliott and other extreme weather events in Texas, Oklahoma and Georgia, winter storms in California, and the impact of Hurricane Ian in Florida. In addition, the Company experienced unfavorable development of approximately 1 million on prior years' catastrophe losses in 2022. Catastrophe losses due to the events that occurred in 2021 totaled approximately 109 million, with no reinsurance benefits used for these losses, resulting primarily from the deep freeze of Winter Storm Uri and other extreme weather events in Texas and Oklahoma, rainstorms, wildfires and winter storms in California, and the impact of Hurricane Ida in New Jersey and New York. These losses were partially offset by favorable development of approximately 5 million on prior years' catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses due to the events that occurred in 2020 totaled approximately 69 
 5 

million, with no reinsurance benefits used for these losses, resulting primarily from wildfires and windstorms in California and extreme weather events outside of California. These losses were partially offset by favorable development of approximately 5 million on prior years' catastrophe losses. 

Statutory Accounting Principles 
 The Company s results are reported in accordance with GAAP, which differ in some respects from amounts reported under SAP prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities. Some of the significant differences under GAAP are described below: 
 Policy acquisition costs such as commissions, premium taxes, and other costs that vary with and are primarily related to the successful acquisition of new and renewal insurance contracts, are capitalized and amortized on a pro rata basis over the period in which the related premiums are earned, whereas under SAP, these costs are expensed as incurred. 
 Certain assets are included in the consolidated balance sheets, whereas under SAP, such assets are designated as "nonadmitted assets," and charged directly against statutory surplus. These assets consist primarily of premium receivables that are outstanding for more than 90 days, deferred tax assets that do not meet statutory requirements for recognition, furniture, equipment, leasehold improvements, capitalized software, and prepaid expenses. 
 Amounts related to ceded reinsurance are shown gross as prepaid reinsurance premiums and reinsurance recoverables, whereas under SAP, these amounts are netted against unearned premium reserves and loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. 
 Fixed-maturity securities are reported at fair value, whereas under SAP, these securities are reported at amortized cost, or the lower of amortized cost, or fair value, depending on the specific type of security. 
 Equity securities are marked to market through the consolidated statements of operations, whereas under SAP, these securities are marked to market through unrealized gains and losses in surplus. 
 Goodwill is reported as the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the underlying assets and assessed periodically for impairment. Intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives. Under SAP, goodwill is reported as the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the statutory book value and amortized over 10 years. Its carrying value is limited to 10 of adjusted surplus. Under SAP, intangible assets are not recognized. 
 The differing treatment of income and expense items results in a corresponding difference in federal income tax expense. Changes in deferred income taxes are reflected as an item of income tax benefit or expense, whereas under SAP, changes in deferred income taxes are recorded directly to statutory surplus as regards policyholders. Admittance testing under SAP may result in a charge to unassigned surplus for non-admitted portions of deferred tax assets. Under GAAP, a valuation allowance may be recorded against the deferred tax assets and reflected as an expense. 
 Certain assessments paid to regulatory agencies that are recoverable from policyholders in future periods are expensed, whereas under SAP, these assessments are recorded as receivables. 
 
 Operating Ratios (SAP basis) 
 
 Loss and Expense Ratios 
 Loss and expense ratios are used to evaluate the underwriting experience of property and casualty insurance companies. Under SAP, losses and loss adjustment expenses are stated as a percentage of premiums earned because losses occur over the life of a policy, while underwriting expenses are stated as a percentage of premiums written rather than premiums earned because most underwriting expenses are incurred when policies are written and are not spread over the policy period. The statutory underwriting profit margin is the extent to which the combined loss and expense ratios are less than 100 .

The following table presents, on a statutory basis, the Insurance Companies loss, expense and combined ratios, and the private passenger automobile industry combined ratio. The Insurance Companies ratios (Company-wide) include lines of insurance business other than private passenger automobile that accounted for approximately 35.7 of direct premiums written in 2022; hence, the Company believes its combined ratio (for private passenger automobile only) is more comparable to the industry ratios.

Investments 
 The Company s investments are directed by the Chief Investment Officer under the supervision of the Investment Committee of the Board of Directors. The Company s investment strategy emphasizes safety of principal and consistent income generation, within a total return framework. The investment strategy has historically focused on maximizing after-tax yield with a primary emphasis on maintaining a well diversified, investment grade, fixed income portfolio to support the underlying liabilities and achieve a return on capital and profitable growth. The Company believes that investment yield is maximized by selecting assets that perform favorably on a long-term basis and by disposing of certain assets to enhance after-tax yield and minimize the potential effect of downgrades and defaults. The Company believes that this strategy maintains the optimal investment performance necessary to sustain investment income over time. The Company s portfolio management approach utilizes a market risk and asset allocation strategy as the primary basis for the allocation of interest sensitive, liquid and credit assets as well as for monitoring credit exposure and diversification requirements. Within the ranges set by the asset allocation strategy, tactical investment decisions are made in consideration of prevailing market conditions. 
 
 Tax considerations are important in portfolio management. The Company closely monitors the timing and recognition of capital gains and losses to maximize the realization of any deferred tax assets arising from capital losses. The Company had no capital loss carryforward at December 31, 2022.

 Investment Results 
 The following table presents the investment results of the Company for the most recent five years: 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 (Dollars in thousands) Average invested assets at cost (1) (2) 
 4,902,755 4,681,462 4,291,888 4,008,601 3,740,497 Net investment income (3) 
 Before income taxes 168,356 129,727 134,858 141,263 135,838 After income taxes 146,204 115,216 120,043 125,637 121,476 Average annual yield on investments (3)

 __________ 
 (1) Fixed maturities and short-term bonds at amortized cost; equities and other short-term investments at cost. Average invested assets at cost are based on the monthly amortized cost of the invested assets for each period. 
 (2) At December 31, 2022, fixed maturity securities with call features totaled 3.1 billion at fair value and 3.2 billion at amortized cost. 
 (3) Net investment income before and after income taxes for 2022 increased compared to 2021, primarily due to higher average yield combined with higher average invested assets. Average annual yield on investments before and after income taxes for 2022 increased compared to 2021, primarily due to the maturity and replacement of lower yielding investments purchased when market interest rates were lower with higher yielding investments, as a result of increasing market interest rates, as well as higher yields on investments based on floating interest rates. 

Competitive Conditions 
 The Company operates in the highly competitive property and casualty insurance industry subject to competition on pricing, claims handling, consumer recognition, coverage offered and product features, customer service, and geographic coverage. Some of the Company s competitors are larger and well-capitalized national companies that sell directly to consumers or have broad distribution networks of employed or captive agents. 
 
 8 

Reputation for customer service and price are the principal means by which the Company competes with other insurers. In addition, the marketing efforts of independent agents can provide a competitive advantage. Based on the most recent regularly published statistical compilations of premiums written in 2021, the Company was the sixth largest writer of private passenger automobile insurance in California and the sixteenth largest in the United States. 
 
 The property and casualty insurance industry is highly cyclical, with alternating hard and soft market conditions. The Company has historically seen premium growth during hard market conditions. The Company believes that the automobile insurance market in most states has hardened during 2022 as insurance carriers began to increase rates reflecting high loss severity and increasing loss frequency as the country emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic. In California, market conditions in 2022 were hard as companies tightened their underwriting due to difficulty in obtaining regulatory approval for rate increases. 

Reinsurance 
 
 For California homeowners policies, the Company has reduced its catastrophe exposure from earthquakes by placing earthquake risks directly with the California Earthquake Authority ("CEA"). However, the Company continues to have catastrophe exposure to fires following an earthquake. For more detailed discussion, see "Regulation Insurance Assessments" below. 
 
 The Company is the assuming reinsurer under a Catastrophe Portfolio Participation Reinsurance Contract ("Contract") effective through December 31, 2025. The Company reimburses a group of affiliates of a ceding company for a proportional share of a portfolio of catastrophe losses based on the premiums ceded to the Company under the Contract, to the extent the actual loss ratio exceeds the threshold loss ratio of 73.5 . The total assumed premium under the Contract is 15.0 million for each of the 12 month periods ending December 31, 2023 through 2025 and 10.0 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2022. The total possible amount of losses for the Company under the Contract is 30.0 million for each of the 12 month periods ending December 31, 2023 through 2025 and 25.0 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2022. The Company recognized 10.0 million and 12.5 million in earned premiums and 8.4 million and 17.5 million in incurred losses under the Contract for the 12 months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 The Company is party to a Catastrophe Reinsurance Treaty ("Treaty") covering a wide range of perils that is effective through June 30, 2023. For the 12 months ending June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Treaty provides 936 million and 792 million of coverage, respectively, on a per occurrence basis after covered catastrophe losses exceed the Company retention limit of 60 million and 40 million, respectively. The Treaty specifically excludes coverage for any Florida business and for California earthquake losses on fixed property policies such as homeowners, but does cover losses from fires following an earthquake. The Treaty includes additional restrictions as noted in the tables below. 
 
 Coverage on individual catastrophes provided for the 12 months ending June 30, 2023 under the Treaty is presented below in various layers: 
 
 Catastrophe Losses and LAE In Excess of Up to Percentage of Coverage (Amounts in millions) Retained 60 Layer of Coverage 60 100 19.5 Layer of Coverage 100 200 98.8 Layer of Coverage (1) 
 200 530 98.6 Layer of Coverage (2) (3) (4) 
 530 930 100.0 Layer of Coverage 930 1,035 98.9 
 __________ 
 (1) 5 of this layer covers California, Arizona and Nevada only. 
 (2) 33 of this layer covers California, Arizona and Nevada only. 
 (3) Layer of Coverage represents multiple actual treaty layers that are grouped for presentation purposes. 
 (4) 6.3 of this layer covers only California wildfires and fires following an earthquake in California, and is not subject to reinstatement.

Coverage on individual catastrophes provided for the 12 months ended June 30, 2022 under the Treaty is presented below in various layers: 
 Catastrophe Losses and LAE In Excess of Up to Percentage of Coverage (Amounts in millions) Retained 40 Layer of Coverage 40 100 70 Layer of Coverage (1)(2) 
 100 450 100 Layer of Coverage (1) (3) (4)(5) 
 450 850 100 
 __________ 
 (1) Layer of Coverage represents multiple actual treaty layers that are grouped for presentation purposes. 
 (2) 4.1 of this layer excludes Texas. 
 (3) 11.9 of this layer excludes Texas. 
 (4) 15.0 of this layer covers California, Arizona and Nevada only. 
 (5) 12.7 of this layer covers only California wildfires and fires following an earthquake in California, and is not subject to reinstatement. 
 
 The table below presents the combined total reinsurance premiums under the Treaty (annual premiums and reinstatement premiums) for the 12 months ending June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively: 
 
 Treaty Annual Premium (1) 
 Reinstatement Premium (2) 
 Total Combined Premium (2) 
 (Amounts in millions) For the 12 months ending June 30, 2023 
 74 74 For the 12 months ended June 30, 2022 
 55 55 
 __________ 
 (1) The increase in the annual premium is primarily due to higher reinsurance coverage and rates and growth in the covered book of business. 
 (2) The reinstatement premium and the total combined premium for the treaty period ending June 30, 2023 are projected amounts to be paid based on the assumption that there will be no reinstatements occurring during this treaty period. The reinstatement premium for the treaty period ended June 30, 2022 is zero, as there were no actual reinstatement premiums paid. 
 
 The Treaty ending June 30, 2023 and 2022 each provides for one full reinstatement of coverage limits. Reinstatement premiums are based on the amount of reinsurance benefits used by the Company at 100 of the annual premium rate, with the exception of the reinstatement restrictions noted in the tables above, up to the maximum reinstatement premium of approximately 72 million and 51 million if the full amount of benefit is used for the 12 months ending June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 
 The total amount of reinstatement premiums is recorded as ceded reinstatement premiums written at the time of the catastrophe event based on the total amount of reinsurance benefits expected to be used for the event, and such reinstatement premiums are recognized ratably over the remaining term of the Treaty as ceded reinstatement premiums earned. 
 
 The catastrophe events that occurred in 2022 caused approximately 101 million in losses to the Company, resulting primarily from the deep freeze of Winter Storm Elliott and other extreme weather events in Texas, Oklahoma and Georgia, winter storms in California, and the impact of Hurricane Ian in Florida. No reinsurance benefits were available under the Treaty for these losses as none of the 2022 catastrophe events individually resulted in losses in excess of the Company s per-occurrence retention limit of 60 million and 40 million under the Treaty for the 12 months ending June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 
 The catastrophe events that occurred in 2021 caused approximately 113 million in losses to the Company as of December 31, 2022, resulting primarily from the deep freeze of Winter Storm Uri and other extreme weather events in Texas and Oklahoma, rainstorms, wildfires and winter storms in California, and the impact of Hurricane Ida in New Jersey and New York. No reinsurance benefits were available under the Treaty for these losses as none of the 2021 catastrophe events 
 10 

individually resulted in losses in excess of the Company s per-occurrence retention limit of 40 million under the Treaty for each of the 12 months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. 
 
 The Company carries a commercial umbrella reinsurance treaty and a per-risk property reinsurance treaty, and seeks facultative arrangements for large property risks. In addition, the Company has other reinsurance in force that is not material to the consolidated financial statements. If any reinsurers are unable to perform their obligations under a reinsurance treaty, the Company will be required, as primary insurer, to discharge all obligations to its policyholders in their entirety. 

Regulation 
 The Insurance Companies are subject to significant regulation and supervision by insurance departments of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled or licensed to operate business. 
 
 Department of Insurance Oversight 
 The powers of the DOI in each state primarily include the prior approval of insurance rates and rating factors and the establishment of capital and surplus requirements, solvency standards, restrictions on dividend payments and transactions with affiliates. DOI regulations and supervision are designed principally to benefit policyholders rather than shareholders. 
 
 California Proposition 103 (the "Proposition") requires that property and casualty insurance rates be approved by the California DOI prior to their use and that no rate be approved which is excessive, inadequate, unfairly discriminatory, or otherwise in violation of the provisions of the Proposition. The Proposition specifies four statutory factors required to be applied in "decreasing order of importance" in determining rates for private passenger automobile insurance: (1) the insured s driving safety record, (2) the number of miles the insured drives annually, (3) the number of years of driving experience of the insured and (4) whatever optional factors are determined by the California DOI to have a substantial relationship to risk of loss and are adopted by regulation. The statute further provides that insurers are required to give at least a 20 discount to "good drivers," as defined, from rates that would otherwise be charged to such drivers and that no insurer may refuse to insure a "good driver." The Company s rate plan operates under these rating factor regulations. 
 
 Insurance rates in California, Georgia, New York, New Jersey, and Nevada require prior approval from the state DOI, while insurance rates in Illinois, Texas, Virginia, Oklahoma, and Arizona must only be filed with the respective DOI before they are implemented. Florida has a modified version of use and file laws. Insurance laws and regulations in all states in which the Company operates provide that rates must not be excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory. 
 
 The DOI in each state in which the Company operates is responsible for conducting periodic financial and market conduct examinations of the Insurance Companies in their states. Market conduct examinations typically review compliance with insurance statutes and regulations with respect to rating, underwriting, claims handling, billing, and other practices. For more detailed information on the Company s current financial and market conduct examinations, see "Liquidity and Capital Resources F. Regulatory Capital Requirements" in "Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." 
 
 For a discussion of current regulatory matters in California, see "Regulatory and Legal Matters" in "Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 18. Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." 
 
 The operations of the Company are dependent on the laws of the states in which it does business and changes in those laws can materially affect the revenue and expenses of the Company. The Company retains its own legislative advocates in California. The Company made direct financial contributions of approximately 83,000 and 54,000 to officeholders and candidates in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company believes in supporting the political process and intends to continue to make such contributions in amounts which it determines to be appropriate. 
 
 The Insurance Companies must comply with minimum capital requirements under applicable state laws and regulations. The risk-based capital ("RBC") formula is used by insurance regulators to monitor capital and surplus levels. It was designed to capture the widely varying elements of risks undertaken by writers of different lines of insurance business having differing risk characteristics, as well as writers of similar lines where differences in risk may be related to corporate structure, investment policies, reinsurance arrangements, and a number of other factors. The Company periodically monitors the RBC level of each of the Insurance Companies. As of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, each of the Insurance Companies exceeded the minimum required RBC level. For more detailed information, see "Liquidity and Capital Resources F. Regulatory Capital Requirements" in "Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." 
 
 11 

Own Risk and Solvency Assessment 
 
 Insurance companies are required to file an Own Risk and Solvency Assessment ("ORSA") with the insurance regulators in their domiciliary states. The ORSA is required to cover, among many items, a company s risk management policies, the material risks to which the company is exposed, how the company measures, monitors, manages and mitigates material risks, and how much economic and regulatory capital is needed to continue to operate in a strong and healthy manner. The ORSA is intended to be used by state insurance regulators to evaluate the risk exposure and quality of the risk management processes within insurance companies to assist in conducting risk-focused financial examinations and for determining the overall financial condition of insurance companies. The Company filed its most recent ORSA Summary Report with the California DOI in November 2022. Compliance with the ORSA requirements did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Insurance Assessments 
 
 The California Insurance Guarantee Association ("CIGA") was created to pay claims on behalf of insolvent property and casualty insurers. Each year, these claims are estimated by CIGA and the Company is assessed for its pro-rata share based on prior year California premiums written in the particular line. These assessments are currently limited to 2 of premiums written in the preceding year and are recouped through a mandated surcharge to policyholders in the year after the assessment. There were no material CIGA assessments in 2022. 
 
 The CEA is a quasi-governmental organization that was established to provide a market for earthquake coverage to California homeowners. The Company places all new and renewal earthquake coverage offered with its homeowner policy directly with the CEA. The Company receives a small fee for placing business with the CEA, which is recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. Upon the occurrence of a major seismic event, the CEA has the ability to assess participating companies for losses. These assessments are made after CEA capital has been expended and are based upon each company s participation percentage multiplied by the amount of the total assessment. Based upon the most recent information provided by the CEA, the Company s maximum total exposure to CEA assessments at April 30, 2022, the most recent date at which information was available, was 76.7 million. There was no assessment made in 2022. 
 
 The Insurance Companies in other states are also subject to the provisions of similar insurance guaranty associations. There were no material assessments or payments during 2022 in other states. 
 
 Holding Company Act 
 The California Companies are subject to California DOI regulation pursuant to the provisions of the California Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act (the "Holding Company Act"). The California DOI may examine the affairs of each of the California Companies at any time. The Holding Company Act requires disclosure of any material transactions among affiliates within a holding company system. Some transactions require advance notice and may not be made if the California DOI disapproves the transaction within 30 days after notice. Such transactions include, but are not limited to, extraordinary dividends; management agreements, service contracts, and cost-sharing arrangements, and modifications thereto; all guarantees that are not quantifiable, or, if quantifiable, exceed the lesser of one-half of 1 of admitted assets or 10 of policyholders surplus as of the preceding December 31; derivative transactions or series of derivative transactions; reinsurance agreements or modifications thereto in which the reinsurance premium or a change in the insurer s liabilities equals or exceeds 5 of the policyholders surplus as of the preceding December 31; sales, purchases, exchanges, loans, and extensions of credit; and investments, in the net aggregate, involving more than the lesser of 3 of the respective California Companies admitted assets or 25 of statutory surplus as regards policyholders as of the preceding December 31. An extraordinary dividend is a dividend which, together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding 12 months, exceeds the greater of 10 of the insurance company s statutory policyholders surplus as of the preceding December 31 or the insurance company s statutory net income for the preceding calendar year. The Holding Company Act also requires filing of an annual enterprise risk report identifying the material risks within the insurance holding company system. 
 
 California-domiciled insurance companies are also required to notify the California DOI of any dividend after declaration, but prior to payment. There are similar limitations imposed by other states on the Insurance Companies ability to pay dividends. As of December 31, 2022, the Insurance Companies are permitted to pay in 2023, without obtaining DOI approval for extraordinary dividends, 151 million in dividends to Mercury General, of which 125 million may be paid by the California Companies. 
 
 The Holding Company Act also provides that the acquisition or change of "control" of a California domiciled insurance company or of any person who controls such an insurance company cannot be consummated without the prior approval of the 
 12 

California DOI. In general, a presumption of "control" arises from the ownership of voting securities and securities that are convertible into voting securities, which in the aggregate constitute 10 or more of the voting securities of a California insurance company or of a person that controls a California insurance company, such as Mercury General. A person seeking to acquire "control," directly or indirectly, of the Company must generally file with the California DOI an application for change of control containing certain information required by statute and published regulations and provide a copy of the application to the Company. The Holding Company Act also effectively restricts the Company from consummating certain reorganizations or mergers without prior regulatory approval. 
 
 Each of the Insurance Companies is subject to holding company regulations in the state in which it is domiciled. These provisions are substantially similar to those of the Holding Company Act.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 The Company s business involves various risks and uncertainties in addition to the normal risks of business, some of which are discussed in this section. It should be noted that the Company s business and that of other insurers may be adversely affected by a downturn in general economic conditions and other forces beyond the Company s control. In addition, other risks and uncertainties not presently known or that the Company currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect the Company s business. Any such risks or uncertainties, or any of the following risks or uncertainties, that develop into actual events could result in a material and adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. 
 
 The information discussed below should be considered carefully with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the other documents and materials filed by the Company with the SEC, as well as news releases and other information publicly disseminated by the Company from time to time.

Risks Related to the Company s Business 
 
 The Company remains highly dependent upon California to produce revenues and operating profits. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company generated approximately 81 of its direct automobile insurance premiums written in California. The Company s financial results are subject to prevailing regulatory, legal, economic, demographic, competitive, and other conditions in the states in which the Company operates and changes in any of these conditions could negatively impact the Company s results of operations. 
 
 Mercury General is a holding company that relies on regulated subsidiaries for cash flows to satisfy its obligations. 
 As a holding company, Mercury General maintains no operations that generate cash flows sufficient to pay operating expenses, shareholders dividends, or principal or interest on its indebtedness. Consequently, Mercury General relies on the ability of the Insurance Companies, particularly the California Companies, to pay dividends for Mercury General to meet its obligations. The ability of the Insurance Companies to pay dividends is regulated by state insurance laws, which limit the amount of, and in certain circumstances may prohibit the payment of, cash dividends. Generally, these insurance regulations permit the payment of dividends only out of earned surplus in any year which, together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding 12 months, do not exceed the greater of 10 of statutory surplus as of the end of the preceding year or the net income for the preceding year, with larger dividends payable only after receipt of prior regulatory approval. The inability of the Insurance Companies to pay dividends in an amount sufficient to enable the Company to meet its cash requirements at the holding company level could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, financial condition, and its ability to pay dividends to its shareholders. 
 
 The Insurance Companies are subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements, and any failure to meet these requirements could subject the Insurance Companies to regulatory action. 
 The Insurance Companies are subject to risk-based capital standards and other minimum capital and surplus requirements imposed under the applicable laws of their states of domicile. The risk-based capital standards, based upon the Risk-Based Capital Model Act adopted by the NAIC, require the Insurance Companies to report their results of RBC calculations to state departments of insurance and the NAIC. If any of the Insurance Companies fails to meet these standards and requirements, the DOI regulating such subsidiary may require specified actions by the subsidiary. 
 
 The Company s success depends on its ability to accurately underwrite risks and to charge adequate premiums to policyholders. 
 The Company s financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity depend on its ability to underwrite and set premiums accurately for the risks it assumes. Premium rate adequacy is necessary to generate sufficient premium to offset losses, loss adjustment expenses, and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit. In order to price its products accurately, the Company must collect and properly analyze a substantial volume of data; develop, test, and apply appropriate rating formulae; closely monitor and timely recognize changes in trends; and project both severity and frequency of losses with reasonable accuracy. The Company s ability to undertake these efforts successfully, and as a result, price accurately, is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to: 
 availability of sufficient reliable data; 
 incorrect or incomplete analysis of available data; 
 uncertainties inherent in estimates and assumptions, generally; 
 selection and application of appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies; 
 successful innovation of new pricing strategies; 
 recognition of changes in trends and in the projected severity and frequency of losses; 
 the Company s ability to forecast renewals of existing policies accurately; 
 unanticipated court decisions, legislation or regulatory action; 
 ongoing changes in the Company s claim settlement practices; 
 changes in operating expenses; 
 changing driving patterns; 
 extra-contractual liability arising from bad faith claims; 
 15 

catastrophes, including those which may be related to climate change; 
 unexpected medical inflation; and 
 unanticipated inflation in automobile repair costs, automobile parts prices, and used car prices. 
 
 Such risks and uncertainties may result in the Company s pricing being based on outdated, inadequate or inaccurate data, or inappropriate analyses, assumptions or methodologies, and may cause the Company to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims. As a result, the Company could underprice risks, which would negatively affect the Company s margins, or it could overprice risks, which could reduce the Company s volume and competitiveness. In either event, the Company s financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 The Company s insurance rates are subject to approval by the departments of insurance in most of the states in which the Company operates, and to political influences. 
 
 In five of the states in which it operates, including California, the Company must obtain the DOI s prior approval of insurance rates charged to its customers, including any increases in those rates. If the Company is unable to receive approval of the rate changes it requests, or if such approval is delayed, the Company s ability to operate its business in a profitable manner may be limited and its financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity may be adversely affected. Additionally, in California, the law allows for consumer groups to intervene in rate filings, which frequently causes delays in rate approvals and implementation of rate changes and can impact the rate that is ultimately approved. 
 
 From time to time, the automobile insurance industry comes under pressure from state regulators, legislators, and special interest groups to reduce, freeze, or set rates at levels that do not correspond with underlying costs, in the opinion of the Company s management. The homeowners insurance business faces similar pressure, particularly as regulators in catastrophe-prone states seek an acceptable methodology to price for catastrophe exposure. In addition, various insurance underwriting and pricing criteria regularly come under attack by regulators, legislators, and special interest groups. The result could be legislation, regulations, or new interpretations of existing regulations that adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 
 The effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on the Company s business are uncertain and may have an adverse effect on the Company s business. 
 As industry practices and legal, judicial, social, and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. These issues may adversely affect the Company s business by either extending coverage beyond its underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until sometime after the Company has issued insurance policies that are affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of liability under the Company s insurance policies may not be known for many years after a policy is issued. 
 
 Loss of, or significant restriction on, the use of credit scoring in the pricing and underwriting of personal lines products could reduce the Company s future profitability. 
 The Company uses credit scoring as a factor in pricing and underwriting decisions where allowed by state law. Some consumer groups and regulators have questioned whether the use of credit scoring unfairly discriminates against some groups of people and are seeking to prohibit or restrict the use of credit scoring in underwriting and pricing. Laws or regulations that significantly curtail or regulate the use of credit scoring, if enacted in a large number of states in which the Company operates, could negatively impact the Company s future results of operations. 
 
 If the Company cannot maintain its A.M. Best ratings, it may not be able to maintain premium volume in its insurance operations sufficient to attain the Company s financial performance goals. 
 
 The Company s ability to retain its existing business or to attract new business in its Insurance Companies is affected by its rating by A.M. Best. A.M. Best currently rates all of the Insurance Companies with sufficient operating history as either A (Excellent) or A- (Excellent). On February 10, 2022, A.M. Best affirmed the Financial Strength Rating ("FSR") of A (Excellent) with Stable outlook for the Company's A rated entities and A- (Excellent) with Stable outlook for the Company's A- rated entities. The Company believes that if it is unable to maintain its A.M. Best ratings within the A ratings range, it may face greater challenges to grow its premium volume sufficiently to attain its financial performance goals, which may adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 
 16 

The Company may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms. 
 
 The Company s future capital requirements, including to fund future growth opportunities, depend on many factors, including its ability to underwrite new business successfully, its ability to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses, the success of its expansion plans, the performance of its investment portfolio and its ability to obtain financing. The Company may seek to obtain financing through equity or debt issuances, or sales of all or a portion of its investment portfolio or other assets. The Company s ability to obtain financing also depends on economic conditions affecting financial markets and financial strength and claims-paying ability ratings, which are assigned based upon an evaluation of the Company s ability to meet its financial obligations. The Company s current financial strength rating with Fitch and Moody's is A and A2, respectively. If the Company were to seek financing through the capital markets in the future, there can be no assurance that the Company would obtain favorable ratings from rating agencies. Any equity or debt financing, if available at all, may not be available on terms that are favorable to the Company. In the case of equity financing, the Company s shareholders could experience dilution. In addition, such securities may have rights, preferences, and privileges that are senior to those of the Company s current shareholders. If the Company cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all, its business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 
 Changes in market interest rates, defaults on securities and tax considerations may have an adverse effect on the Company s investment portfolio, which may adversely affect the Company s financial results. 
 The Company s financial results are affected, in part, by the performance of its investment portfolio. The Company s investment portfolio contains interest rate sensitive-investments, such as municipal and corporate bonds. Increases in market interest rates may have an adverse impact on the value of the investment portfolio by decreasing the value of fixed income securities. Declining market interest rates could have an adverse impact on the Company s investment income as it invests positive cash flows from operations and as it reinvests proceeds from maturing and called investments in new investments that could yield lower rates than the Company s investments have historically generated. Defaults in the Company s investment portfolio may produce operating losses and negatively impact the Company s results of operations. 
 
 Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions, and other factors beyond the Company s control. Market interest rates have been at historic lows for the last several years. Many observers, including the Company, believe that market interest rates will rise as the economy improves. Although the Company takes measures to manage the risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment, it may not be able to mitigate interest rate sensitivity effectively. The Company s mitigation efforts include maintaining a high quality portfolio and managing the duration of the portfolio to reduce the effect of interest rate changes. Despite its mitigation efforts, a significant change in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition and results of operations. Although the Company monitors the timing and recognition of capital gains and losses in an effort to maximize the realization of deferred tax assets arising from capital losses, no guaranty can be provided that such monitoring or the Company's tax strategies will be effective. 
 
 The Company s valuation of financial instruments may include methodologies, estimates, and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to valuations that may materially adversely affect the Company s financial condition or results of operations. 
 The Company employs a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date using the exit price. Accordingly, when market observable data are not readily available, the Company s own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would be presumed to use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Assets and liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value are categorized based on the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value and the level of market price observability. 
 
 During periods of market disruption, including periods of significantly changing interest rates, rapidly widening credit spreads, inactivity or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain of the Company s securities if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data become less observable. There may be certain asset classes in historically active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to changes in the financial environment. In such cases, the valuations associated with such securities may rely more on management's judgment and include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation as well as valuation methods that are more sophisticated or require greater estimation. The valuations generated by such methods may be different from the value at which the investments ultimately may be sold. Further, rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities as reported 
 17 

within the Company s consolidated financial statements, and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly. Decreases in value may have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Changes in the method for determining London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") and the eventual replacement of LIBOR may affect the value of the Company's investment portfolio and its net investment income. 
 On July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the FCA ), which regulates LIBOR, announced that the FCA will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. On March 5, 2021, the FCA announced it will cease publication of the most commonly used U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors after June 30, 2023. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR in April 2018 as an alternative for LIBOR. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. On July 29, 2021, the U.S. Federal Reserve formally recommended the forward-looking SOFR term rates as the replacement for U.S. dollar LIBOR. 
 
 The Company has exposure to LIBOR-based financial instruments, such as LIBOR-based securities held in its investment portfolio. Alternative reference rates have different characteristics than LIBOR, and may demonstrate less predictable behavior over time and across different monetary, market, and economic environments. Although the full impact of transition remains unclear, this change could have an adverse impact on the securities markets, the value of the Company's investment portfolio, and its net investment income. 
 
 Changes in the financial strength ratings of financial guaranty insurers issuing policies on bonds held in the Company s investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on the Company s investment results. 
 In an effort to enhance the bond rating applicable to certain bond issues, some bond issuers purchase municipal bond insurance policies from private insurers. The insurance generally guarantees the payment of principal and interest on a bond issue if the issuer defaults. By purchasing the insurance, the financial strength ratings applicable to the bonds are based on the credit worthiness of the insurer as well as the underlying credit of the bond issuer. These financial guaranty insurers are subject to DOI oversight. As the financial strength ratings of these insurers are reduced, the ratings of the insured bond issues correspondingly decrease. Although the Company has determined that the financial strength ratings of the underlying bond issues in its investment portfolio are within the Company s investment policy without the enhancement provided by the insurance policies, any further downgrades in the financial strength ratings of these insurance companies or any defaults on the insurance policies written by these insurance companies may reduce the fair value of the underlying bond issues and the Company s investment portfolio or may reduce the investment results generated by the Company s investment portfolio, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. 
 
 Deterioration of the municipal bond market in general or of specific municipal bonds held by the Company may result in a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. 
 At December 31, 2022, approximately 50 of the Company s total investment portfolio at fair value and approximately 60 of its total fixed maturity securities at fair value were invested in tax-exempt municipal bonds. With such a large percentage of the Company s investment portfolio invested in municipal bonds, the performance of the Company s investment portfolio, including the cash flows generated by the investment portfolio, is significantly dependent on the performance of municipal bonds. If the value of municipal bond markets in general or any of the Company s municipal bond holdings deteriorates, the performance of the Company s investment portfolio, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity may be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 If the Company s loss reserves are inadequate, its business and financial position could be harmed. 
 The process of establishing property and liability loss reserves is inherently uncertain due to a number of factors, including underwriting quality, the frequency and amount of covered losses, variations in claims settlement practices, the costs and uncertainty of litigation, and expanding theories of liability. While the Company believes that its actuarial techniques and databases are sufficient to estimate loss reserves, the Company s approach may prove to be inadequate. If any of these contingencies, many of which are beyond the Company s control, results in loss reserves that are not sufficient to cover its actual losses, the Company s financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity may be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 There is uncertainty involved in the availability of reinsurance and the collectability of reinsurance recoverable. 
 The Company reinsures a portion of its potential losses on the policies it issues to mitigate the volatility of the losses on its financial condition and results of operations. The availability and cost of reinsurance is subject to market conditions, which are outside of the Company s control. From time to time, market conditions have limited, and in some cases, prevented insurers from obtaining the types and amounts of reinsurance that they consider adequate for their business needs. As a result, the 
 18 

Company may not be able to successfully purchase reinsurance and transfer a portion of the Company s risk through reinsurance arrangements. In addition, as is customary, the Company initially pays all claims and seeks to recover the reinsured losses from its reinsurers. Although the Company reports as assets the amount of claims paid which the Company expects to recover from reinsurers, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to collect from its reinsurers. If the amounts actually recoverable under the Company s reinsurance treaties are ultimately determined to be less than the amount it has reported as recoverable, the Company may incur a loss during the period in which that determination is made. 
 
 The failure of any loss limitation methods employed by the Company could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. 
 Various provisions of the Company s policies, such as limitations or exclusions from coverage which are intended to limit the Company s risks, may not be enforceable in the manner the Company intends. In addition, the Company s policies contain conditions requiring the prompt reporting of claims and the Company s right to decline coverage in the event of a violation of that condition. While the Company s insurance product exclusions and limitations reduce the Company s loss exposure and help eliminate known exposures to certain risks, it is possible that a court or regulatory authority could nullify or void an exclusion or legislation could be enacted modifying or barring the use of such endorsements and limitations in a way that would adversely affect the Company s loss experience, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 The Company s business is vulnerable to significant catastrophic property loss, which could have an adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations. 
 The Company faces a significant risk of loss in the ordinary course of its business for property damage resulting from natural disasters, man-made catastrophes and other catastrophic events, particularly hurricanes, earthquakes, hail storms, explosions, tropical storms, rain storms, fires, mudslides, sinkholes, war, acts of terrorism, severe weather and other natural and man-made disasters. Such events typically increase the frequency and severity of automobile and other property claims. Because catastrophic loss events are by their nature unpredictable, historical results of operations may not be indicative of future results of operations, and the occurrence of claims from catastrophic events may result in substantial volatility in the Company s financial condition and results of operations from period to period. Although the Company attempts to manage its exposure to such events, the occurrence of one or more major catastrophes in any given period could have a material and adverse impact on the Company s financial condition and results of operations and could result in substantial outflows of cash as losses are paid. 
 
 The Company depends on independent agents who may discontinue sales of its policies at any time. 
 The Company sells its insurance policies primarily through a network of approximately 7,450 independent agents. The Company must compete with other insurance carriers for these agents business. Some competitors offer a larger variety of products, lower prices for insurance coverage, higher commissions, or more attractive non-cash incentives. To maintain its relationship with these independent agents, the Company must pay competitive commissions, be able to respond to their needs quickly and adequately, and create a consistently high level of customer satisfaction. If these independent agents find it preferable to do business with the Company s competitors, it would be difficult to renew the Company s existing business or attract new business. State regulations may also limit the manner in which the Company s producers are compensated or incentivized. Such developments could negatively impact the Company s relationship with these parties and ultimately reduce revenues. 
 
 The Company s expansion plans may adversely affect its future profitability. 
 The Company intends to continue to expand its operations in several of the states in which the Company has operations and may expand into states in which it has not yet begun operations. The intended expansion will necessitate increased expenditures. The Company intends to fund these expenditures out of cash flows from operations. The expansion may not occur, or if it does occur, may not be successful in providing increased revenues or profitability. If the Company s cash flows from operations are insufficient to cover the costs of the expansion, or if the expansion does not provide the benefits anticipated, the Company s financial condition, results of operations, and ability to grow its business may be harmed. 
 
 Any inability of the Company to realize its deferred tax assets, if and when they arise, may have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition and results of operations. 
 The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences related to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and for tax credits. The Company evaluates its deferred tax assets for recoverability based on available evidence, including assumptions about future profitability and capital gain generation. Although management believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax 
 19 

assets will be realized, some or all of the Company s deferred tax assets could expire unused if the Company is unable to generate taxable income of an appropriate character and in a sufficient amount to utilize these tax benefits in the future. Any determination that the Company would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future would result in a charge to earnings in the period in which the determination is made. This charge could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the assumptions used to make this determination are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between the Company s projected operating performance and actual results. As a result, significant management judgment is required in assessing the possible need for a deferred tax asset valuation allowance. The changes in the estimates and assumptions used in such assessments and decisions can materially affect the Company s results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 The carrying value of the Company s goodwill and other intangible assets could be subject to an impairment write-down. 
 At December 31, 2022, the Company s consolidated balance sheets reflected approximately 43 million of goodwill and 9 million of other intangible assets. The Company evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that suggest that the fair values of its goodwill and other intangible assets are below their respective carrying values. The determination that the fair values of the Company s goodwill and other intangible assets are less than their carrying values may result in an impairment write-down. An impairment write-down would be reflected as expense and could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations during the period in which it recognizes the expense. In the future, the Company may incur impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets already recorded or arising out of future acquisitions. 
 
 Uncertain economic conditions may negatively affect the Company s business and operating results. 
 Uncertain economic conditions could adversely affect the Company in the form of consumer behavior and pressure on its investment portfolio. Consumer behavior could include policy cancellations, modifications, or non-renewals, which may reduce cash flows from operations and investments, may harm the Company s financial position, and may reduce the Insurance Companies statutory surplus. Uncertain economic conditions also may impair the ability of the Company s customers to pay premiums as they become due, and as a result, the Company s bad debt reserves and write-offs could increase. It is also possible that claims fraud may increase. The Company s investment portfolios could be adversely affected as a result of financial and business conditions affecting the issuers of the securities in the Company s investment portfolio. In addition, declines in the Company s profitability could result in a charge to earnings for the impairment of goodwill, which would not affect the Company s cash flows but could decrease its earnings, and could adversely affect its stock price. 
 
 The Company may be adversely affected if economic conditions result in either inflation or deflation. In an inflationary environment, established reserves may become inadequate and increase the Company s loss ratio, and market interest rates may rise and reduce the value of the Company s fixed maturity portfolio. The departments of insurance may not approve premium rate increases in time for the Company to adequately mitigate inflated loss costs. In a deflationary environment, some fixed maturity issuers may have difficulty meeting their debt service obligations and thereby reduce the value of the Company s fixed maturity portfolio; equity investments may decrease in value; and policyholders may experience difficulties paying their premiums to the Company, which could adversely affect premium revenue. 
 
 Risks Related to the Company s Industry 
 
 The private passenger automobile insurance industry is highly competitive, and the Company may not be able to compete effectively against larger or better-capitalized companies. 
 
 The Company competes with many property and casualty insurance companies selling private passenger automobile insurance in the states in which the Company operates. Many of these competitors are better capitalized than the Company, have higher A.M. Best ratings, and have a larger market share in the states in which the Company operates. The superior capitalization of the competitors may enable them to offer lower rates, to withstand larger losses, and to more effectively take advantage of new marketing opportunities. The Company s competition may also become increasingly better capitalized in the future as the traditional barriers between insurance companies and banks and other financial institutions erode and as the property and casualty industry continues to consolidate. The Company s ability to compete against these larger, better-capitalized competitors depends on its ability to deliver superior service and its strong relationships with independent agents. 
 
 The Company may undertake strategic marketing and operating initiatives to improve its competitive position and drive growth. If the Company is unable to successfully implement new strategic initiatives or if the Company s marketing campaigns do not attract new customers, the Company s competitive position may be harmed, which could adversely affect the Company s business and results of operations. Additionally, in the event of a failure of any competitor, the Company and other insurance 
 20 

companies would likely be required by state law to absorb the losses of the failed insurer and would be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from the failed insurer s former policyholders. 
 
 The Company may be adversely affected by changes in the private passenger automobile insurance industry. 
 Approximately 64 of the Company s direct premiums written for the year ended December 31, 2022 were generated from private passenger automobile insurance policies. Adverse developments in the market for personal automobile insurance or the personal automobile insurance industry in general, whether related to changes in competition, pricing or regulations, could cause the Company s results of operations to suffer. The property-casualty insurance industry is also exposed to the risks of severe weather conditions, such as rainstorms, snowstorms, hail and ice storms, hurricanes, tornadoes, wild fires, sinkholes, earthquakes and, to a lesser degree, explosions, terrorist attacks, and riots. The automobile insurance business is also affected by cost trends that impact profitability. Factors which negatively affect cost trends include inflation in automobile repair costs, automobile parts costs, new and used car valuations, medical costs, and changes in non-economic costs due to changes in the legal and regulatory environments. In addition, the advent of driverless cars and usage-based insurance could materially alter the way that automobile insurance is marketed, priced, and underwritten. 
 
 The Company cannot predict the impact that changing climate conditions, including legal, regulatory and social responses thereto, may have on its business. 
 Various scientists, environmentalists, international organizations, regulators and other commentators believe that global climate change has added, and will continue to add, to the unpredictability, frequency and severity of natural disasters (including, but not limited to, hurricanes, tornadoes, freezes, droughts, other storms and fires) in certain parts of the world. In response, a number of legal and regulatory measures and social initiatives have been introduced in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas and other carbon emissions that may be chief contributors to global climate change. The Company cannot predict the impact that changing climate conditions, if any, will have on its business or its customers, although the impact on the Company's results of operations or financial condition of incurred losses related to natural disasters that may result from changing climate conditions is mitigated to the extent its reinsurance programs provide coverage for such losses. See "Reinsurance" in "Item 1. Business" for information regarding the Company's reinsurance programs. It is also possible that the legal, regulatory and social responses to climate change could have a negative effect on the Company s results of operations or financial condition. 
 
 Changes in federal or state tax laws could adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. 
 
 The Company s financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity are dependent in part on tax policy implemented at the federal and/or state level. For example, a significant portion of the Company s investment portfolio consists of municipal securities that receive beneficial tax treatment under applicable federal tax law. The Company s results are also subject to federal and state tax rules applicable to dividends received from its subsidiaries and its equity holdings. Additionally, changes in tax laws could have an adverse effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities included in the Company s consolidated balance sheets and results of operations. The Company cannot predict whether any tax legislation will be enacted in the near future or whether any such changes to existing federal or state tax law would have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 The insurance industry is subject to extensive regulation, which may affect the Company s ability to execute its business plan and grow its business. 
 
 The Company is subject to extensive regulation and supervision by government agencies in each of the states in which its Insurance Companies are domiciled, sell insurance products, issue policies, or manage claims. Some states impose restrictions or require prior regulatory approval of specific corporate actions, which may adversely affect the Company s ability to operate, innovate, obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner or grow its business profitably. These regulations provide safeguards for policyholders and are not intended to protect the interests of shareholders. The Company s ability to comply with these laws and regulations, and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner is, and will continue to be, critical to its success. Some of these regulations include: 
 
 Required Licensing. The Company operates under licenses issued by the DOI in the states in which the Company sells insurance. If a regulatory authority denies or delays granting a new license, the Company s ability to enter that market quickly or offer new insurance products in that market may be substantially impaired. In addition, if the DOI in any state in which the Company currently operates suspends, non-renews, or revokes an existing license, the Company would not be able to offer affected products in that state. 
 
 21 

Transactions Between Insurance Companies and Their Affiliates. Transactions between the Insurance Companies and their affiliates (including the Company) generally must be disclosed to state regulators, and prior approval of the applicable regulator is required before any material or extraordinary transaction may be consummated. State regulators may refuse to approve or delay approval of some transactions, which may adversely affect the Company s ability to innovate or operate efficiently. 
 
 Regulation of Insurance Rates and Approval of Policy Forms. The insurance laws of most states in which the Company conducts business require insurance companies to file insurance rate schedules and insurance policy forms for review and approval. If, as permitted in some states, the Company begins using new rates before they are approved, it may be required to issue refunds or credits to the Company s policyholders if the new rates are ultimately deemed excessive or unfair and disapproved by the applicable state regulator. In other states, prior approval of rate changes is required and there may be long delays in the approval process or the rates may not be approved. Accordingly, the Company s ability to respond to market developments or increased costs in that state can be adversely affected. 
 
 Restrictions on Cancellation, Non-Renewal or Withdrawal. Most of the states in which the Company operates have laws and regulations that limit its ability to exit a market, or reduce risk by cancellation or non-renewal of individual policies. For example, these states may, for public policy reasons, limit an insurer s ability to cancel and non-renew private passenger automobile or homeowners insurance policies. They may also prohibit the Company from withdrawing one or more lines of insurance business from the state unless prior approval is received from the state DOI. In some states, the regulations restricting withdrawal extend to significant reductions in the amount of insurance written, not only to a complete withdrawal. Laws and regulations that limit the Company s ability to cancel and non-renew policies in some states or locations and that subject withdrawal plans to prior approval requirements may restrict the Company s ability to control its risk exposure or exit unprofitable markets, which may harm its business and results of operations. 
 
 Other Regulations. The Company must also comply with regulations involving, among other matters: 
 the use of non-public consumer information and related privacy issues; 
 the use of credit history in underwriting and rating; 
 limitations on the ability to charge policy fees; 
 limitations on types and amounts of investments; 
 the payment of dividends; 
 the acquisition or disposition of an insurance company or of any company controlling an insurance company; 
 involuntary assignments of high-risk policies, participation in reinsurance facilities and underwriting associations, assessments and other governmental charges; 
 reporting with respect to financial condition; 
 periodic financial and market conduct examinations performed by state insurance department examiners; and 
 the other regulations discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 The failure to comply with these laws and regulations may also result in regulatory actions, fines and penalties, and in extreme cases, revocation of the Company s ability to do business in that jurisdiction. In addition, the Company may face individual and class action lawsuits by insured and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations. 
 
 In addition, from time to time, the Company may support or oppose legislation or other amendments to insurance regulations in California or other states in which it operates. Consequently, the Company may receive negative publicity related to its support or opposition of legislative or regulatory changes that may have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. 
 
 Regulation may become more restrictive in the future, which may adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 No assurance can be given that states will not make existing insurance-related laws and regulations more restrictive in the future or enact new restrictive laws. New or more restrictive regulation in any state in which the Company conducts business could make it more expensive for it to continue to conduct business in these states, restrict the premiums the Company is able to charge or otherwise change the way the Company does business. In such events, the Company may seek to reduce its writings in or to withdraw entirely from these states. In addition, from time to time, the United States Congress and certain 
 22 

federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary. The Company cannot predict whether and to what extent new laws and regulations that would affect its business will be adopted, the timing of any such adoption and what effects, if any, they may have on the Company s business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 
 Assessments and other surcharges for guaranty funds, second-injury funds, catastrophe funds, and other mandatory pooling arrangements may reduce the Company s profitability. 
 Virtually all states require insurers licensed to do business in their state to bear a portion of the loss suffered by some insured parties as the result of impaired or insolvent insurance companies. Many states also have laws that established second-injury funds to provide compensation to injured employees for aggravation of a prior condition or injury which are funded by either assessments based on paid losses or premium surcharge mechanisms. In addition, as a condition to the ability to conduct business in various states, the Insurance Companies must participate in mandatory property and casualty shared-market mechanisms or pooling arrangements, which provide various types of insurance coverage to individuals or other entities that otherwise are unable to purchase that coverage from private insurers. The effect of these assessments and mandatory shared-market mechanisms or changes in them could reduce the Company s profitability in any given period or limit its ability to grow its business. 
 
 The insurance industry faces litigation risks, which, if resolved unfavorably, could result in substantial penalties and/or monetary damages, including punitive damages. In addition, insurance companies incur material expenses defending litigation and their results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected if they fail to accurately project litigation expenses. 
 Insurance companies are subject to a variety of legal actions including breach of contract claims, tort claims, fraud and misrepresentation claims, employee benefit claims, and wage and hour claims. In addition, insurance companies incur and likely will continue to incur potential liability for claims related to the insurance industry in general and to the Company s business in particular, such as those related to allegations for failure to pay claims, termination or non-renewal of coverage, interpretation of policy language, policy sales practices, reinsurance matters, and other similar matters. Such actions can also include allegations of fraud, misrepresentation, and unfair or improper business practices and can include claims for punitive damages. 
 
 Court decisions and legislative activity may increase exposures for any of the types of claims insurance companies face. There is a risk that insurance companies could incur substantial legal fees and expenses in any of the actions companies defend in excess of amounts budgeted for defense. 
 
 The Company and the Insurance Companies are named as defendants in a number of lawsuits. Those that management believes could have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements are described more fully in "Overview B. Regulatory and Legal Matters" in "Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 18. Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." Litigation, by its very nature, is unpredictable and the outcome of these cases is uncertain. The precise nature of the relief that may be sought or granted in any lawsuit is uncertain and may negatively impact the manner in which the Company conducts its business, which could materially increase the Company s legal expenses and negatively impact the results of operations. In addition, potential litigation involving new claim, coverage, and business practice issues could adversely affect the Company s business by changing the way policies are priced, extending coverage beyond its underwriting intent, or increasing the size of claims. 
 
 Risks Related to Technology and Cybersecurity 
 
 The Company relies on its information technology systems to manage many aspects of its business, and any failure of these systems to function properly or any interruption in their operation could result in a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 The Company depends on the accuracy, reliability, and proper functioning of its information technology systems. The Company relies on these information technology systems to effectively manage many aspects of its business, including underwriting, policy acquisition, claims processing and handling, accounting, reserving and actuarial processes and policies, and to maintain its policyholder data. The Company has deployed, and continues to enhance, new information technology systems that are designed to manage many of these functions across the states in which it operates and the lines of insurance it offers. See "Overview A. General Technology" in "Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." The failure of hardware or software that supports the Company s information technology systems, the loss of data contained in the systems, or any delay or failure in the full deployment of the Company s information 
 23 

technology systems could disrupt its business and could result in decreased premiums, increased overhead costs, and inaccurate reporting, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 
 In addition, despite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures, and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for the Company s information technology systems, these systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from: 
 earthquake, fire, flood and other natural disasters; 
 terrorist attacks and attacks by computer viruses, hackers, phishing, ransomware, or other exploits; 
 power loss in areas not covered by backup power generators; 
 unauthorized access; and 
 computer systems, internet, telecommunications or data network failure. 
 
 It is possible that a system failure, accident, or security breach could result in a material disruption to the Company s business. In addition, substantial costs may be incurred to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions. Following implementation of information technology systems, the Company may from time to time install new or upgraded business management systems. To the extent that a critical system fails or is not properly implemented and the failure cannot be corrected in a timely manner, the Company may experience disruptions to the business that could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations. 
 
 Cyber security risks and the failure to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of internal or policyholder systems and data could result in damages to the Company s reputation and/or subject it to expenses, fines or lawsuits. 
 
 The Company collects and retains large volumes of internal and policyholder data, including personally identifiable information, for business purposes including underwriting, claims and billing purposes, and relies upon the various information technology systems that enter, process, summarize and report such data. The Company also maintains personally identifiable information about its employees. The confidentiality and protection of the Company s policyholder, employee and Company data are critical to the Company s business. The Company s policyholders and employees have a high expectation that the Company will adequately protect their personal information. The regulatory environment, as well as the requirements imposed by the payment card industry and insurance regulators, governing information, security and privacy laws is increasingly demanding and continues to evolve. Maintaining compliance with applicable information security and privacy regulations may increase the Company s operating costs and adversely impact its ability to market products and services to its policyholders. Furthermore, a penetrated or compromised information technology system or the intentional, unauthorized, inadvertent or negligent release or disclosure of data could result in theft, loss, fraudulent or unlawful use of policyholder, employee or Company data which could harm the Company s reputation or result in remedial and other expenses, fines or lawsuits. Although the Company seeks to mitigate the impact and severity of potential cyber threats through cyber insurance coverage, not every risk or liability can be insured, and for risks that are insurable, the policy limits and terms of coverage reasonably obtainable in the market may not be sufficient to cover all actual losses or liabilities incurred. In addition, disputes with insurance carriers, including over policy terms, reservation of rights, the applicability of coverage (including exclusions), compliance with provisions (including notice) and/or the insolvency of one or more of our insurers, may significantly affect the amount or timing of recovery. 
 
 General Risk Factors 
 
 The Company is controlled by a small number of shareholders who will be able to exert significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval, including change of control transactions. 
 George Joseph and Gloria Joseph collectively own more than 50 of the Company s common stock. Accordingly, George Joseph and Gloria Joseph have the ability to exert significant influence on the actions the Company may take in the future, including change of control transactions. From time to time, certain institutional investors also each own over 5 of the Company's common stock. This concentration of ownership may conflict with the interests of the Company s other shareholders and lenders. 

24 

Future equity or debt financing may affect the market price of the Company s common stock and rights of the current shareholders, and the future exercise of options and granting of shares will result in dilution in the investment of the Company s shareholders. 
 The Company may raise capital in the future through the issuance and sale of its common stock or debt securities. The Company cannot predict what effect, if any, such future financing will have on the market price of its common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of its common stock in the public market or issuance of substantial amounts of debt securities could adversely affect the market price of the Company s outstanding common stock, and may make it more difficult for shareholders to sell common stock at a time and price that the shareholder deems appropriate. Furthermore, holders of some of the Company's securities may have rights, preferences, and privileges that are senior to those of the Company s current shareholders. In addition, the Company has issued and may issue options to purchase shares of its common stock as well as restricted stock units ("RSUs") to incentivize its executives and key employees. In the event that any options to purchase common stock are exercised or any shares of common stock are issued when the RSUs vest, shareholders will suffer dilution in their investment. 
 
 Applicable insurance laws may make it difficult to effect a change of control of the Company or the sale of any of its Insurance Companies. 
 Before a person can acquire control of a U.S. insurance company or any holding company of a U.S. insurance company, prior written approval must be obtained from the DOI of the state where the insurer is domiciled. Prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of the insurer or holding company, the state DOI will consider a number of factors relating to the acquirer and the transaction. These laws and regulations may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change of control of the Company or the sale by the Company of any of its Insurance Companies, including transactions that some or all of the Company s shareholders might consider to be desirable. 
 
 Although the Company has consistently paid cash dividends in the past, it may not be able to pay or increase cash dividends in the future. 
 The Company has consistently paid cash dividends since the public offering of its common stock in November 1985 and has consistently increased the dividend per share until 2022. As a result of challenging business conditions, the Company reduced the dividend per share during 2022 for the first time since 1985. Future cash dividends will depend upon a variety of factors, including the Company s profitability, financial condition, capital needs, future prospects, and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors. The Company s ability to pay dividends or increase the dividend per share may also be limited by the ability of the Insurance Companies to make distributions to the Company, which may be restricted by financial, regulatory or tax constraints, and by the terms of the Company s debt instruments. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company will pay dividends or increase the dividend per share even if the necessary financial and regulatory conditions are met and if sufficient cash is available for distribution. 
 
 Changes in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 The Company s consolidated financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP, which is periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, the Company is required to adopt new or revised accounting standards from time to time issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB. It is possible that future changes the Company is required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that the Company applies to its consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 The Company s disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect acts of fraud. 
 
 The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. The Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, the Company cannot provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been prevented or detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by an unauthorized override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and the Company cannot assure that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future 
 25 

conditions. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 
 Failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting may have an adverse effect on the Company s stock price. 
 The Company is required to include in its Annual Report on Form 10-K a report by its management regarding the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting, which includes, among other things, an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of its fiscal year, including a statement as to whether or not the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in the Company s internal control over financial reporting identified by management. Areas of the Company s internal control over financial reporting may require improvement from time to time. If management is unable to assert that the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective now or in any future period, or if the Company s independent auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of those internal controls, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of the Company s financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on the Company s stock price. 
 
 The ability of the Company to attract, develop and retain talented employees, managers and executives, and to maintain appropriate staffing levels, is critical to the Company s success. 
 The Company is constantly hiring and training new employees and seeking to retain current employees. An inability to attract, retain and motivate the necessary employees for the operation and expansion of the Company s business could hinder its ability to conduct its business activities successfully, develop new products and attract customers. 
 
 The Company s success also depends upon the continued contributions of its executive officers, both individually and as a group. The Company s future performance will be substantially dependent on its ability to retain and motivate its management team. The loss of the services of any of the Company s executive officers could prevent the Company from successfully implementing its business strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 
 Pandemics, epidemics, widespread health emergencies, or outbreaks of infectious diseases could disrupt the Company's business and adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 The Company's operations may be subject to disruptions due to the occurrence of public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or other similar unexpected events, some of which may be intensified by the effects of a government response to such an event. In March 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 was recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization and shortly thereafter, the President of the United States declared a National Emergency. While still evolving, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant economic and financial turmoil both in the United States and globally. 
 
 High inflation levels could have adverse consequences for the Company, the insurance industry and the U.S. economy generally. 
 
 The U.S. economy is currently experiencing increasing levels of inflation, which creates a heightened level of risk for the Company, the insurance industry and the U.S. economy generally. Rising inflation may impact the reliability of the Company's loss reserve estimates and its ability to accurately price insurance products, and may create additional volatility in the fair value of its investments. Additionally, regulatory agencies, such as various state Departments of Insurance, the U.S. government and Federal Reserve may be slow to approve rate changes or adopt measures to attempt to control inflation, which could affect the Company's ability to generate profits and cash flow. There can be no assurance that inflation rates will not continue to escalate in the future or that measures adopted or that may be adopted by the U.S. government or the Federal Reserve to control inflation will be effective or successful. Continuing significant inflation could have a prolonged effect on the U.S. economy and could in turn increase the Company's operating and loss costs due to higher labor and materials costs, and may negatively affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 The Company's business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and related disruptions in the global economy. 
 
 The global economy has been negatively impacted by the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. While the Company has no operations in Russia or Ukraine and writes business only in the United States, the escalation of geopolitical tensions related to this conflict, including increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade, could result in, among other things, heightened cybersecurity threats, prolonged supply chain disruptions, protracted or increased inflation, lower consumer 
 26 

demand, fluctuations in interest rates, and increased volatility in financial markets, which could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments 
 None. 

Item 2. Properties 
 The Company owns the following buildings which support all business segments. Space not occupied by the Company may be leased to independent third party tenants. 
 Location Purpose Size in Square Feet Percent Occupied by 
 the Company at 
 December 31, 2022 
 Brea, CA Home office and I.T. facilities (2 buildings) 236,000 100 Folsom, CA Administrative and Data Center 88,000 100 Los Angeles, CA Executive offices 41,000 96 Rancho Cucamonga, CA Administrative 127,000 46 Clearwater, FL Property held for sale 162,000 14 Oklahoma City, OK Administrative 100,000 25 
 
 The Company leases additional office space for operations. In addition, the Company owns 5.9 acres of land in Rancho Cucamonga, California. The Company s properties are well maintained, adequately meet its needs, and are being utilized for their intended purposes. 
 
 Office location is not crucial to the Company s operations. Although the Company occupies space in owned buildings and leased office space, and all team members may utilize this office space to carry out Company business, most of its workforce chooses to work from home, as a result of the "Mercury's My Workplace" policy that allows most of its employees to work from anywhere in the U.S. beginning January 2022. Consequently, the Company is in the process of reducing its office footprint. 

Item 3. Legal Proceedings 
 The Company is, from time to time, named as a defendant in various lawsuits or regulatory actions incidental to its insurance business. The majority of lawsuits brought against the Company relate to insurance claims that arise in the normal course of business and are reserved for through the reserving process. For a discussion of the Company s reserving methods, see "Overview-C. Critical Accounting Estimates" in "Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." 
 
 The Company also establishes accruals for estimated liabilities for non-insurance claims related lawsuits, regulatory actions, and other contingencies when the Company believes a loss is probable and is able to estimate its potential exposure. For loss contingencies believed to be reasonably possible, the Company also discloses the nature of the loss contingency and an estimate of the possible loss, range of loss, or a statement that such an estimate cannot be made. In addition, the Company accrues for anticipated legal defense costs associated with such lawsuits and regulatory actions. While actual losses may differ from the amounts recorded and the ultimate outcome of the Company s pending actions is generally not yet determinable, the Company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of currently pending legal or regulatory proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or cash flows. 
 
 In all cases, the Company vigorously defends itself unless a reasonable settlement appears appropriate. For a discussion of legal matters, see "Overview B. Regulatory and Legal Matters" in "Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 18. Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," which is incorporated herein by reference. 
 
 There are no environmental proceedings arising under federal, state, or local laws or regulations to be discussed.

The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events or otherwise. 

OVERVIEW 
 A. General 
 The operating results of property and casualty insurance companies are subject to significant quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year fluctuations due to the effect of competition on pricing, the frequency and severity of losses, the effect of weather and natural disasters on losses, general economic conditions, the general regulatory environment in states in which an insurer operates, state regulation of insurance including premium rates, changes in fair value of investments, and other factors such as changes in tax laws. The property and casualty insurance industry has been highly cyclical, with periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity followed by periods of severe price competition and excess capacity. These cycles can have a significant impact on the Company s ability to grow and retain business. 
 
 The Company is headquartered in Los Angeles, California and writes primarily personal automobile lines of business selling policies through a network of independent agents, 100 owned insurance agents and direct channels, in 11 states: Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Texas, and Virginia. The Company also offers homeowners, commercial automobile, commercial property, mechanical protection, fire, and umbrella insurance. Private passenger automobile lines of insurance business accounted for approximately 64 of the 4.0 billion of the Company s direct premiums written in 2022, and approximately 82 of the private passenger automobile premiums were written in California. 
 
 This section discusses some of the relevant factors that management considers in evaluating the Company s performance, prospects, and risks. It is not all-inclusive and is meant to be read in conjunction with the entirety of management s discussion and analysis, the Company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, and all other items contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 2022 Financial Performance Summary 
 The Company s net (loss) income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was (512.7) million, or (9.26) per diluted 
 30 

share, compared to 247.9 million, or 4.48 per diluted share, for the same period in 2021. Included in net (loss) income was 168.4 million of pre-tax net investment income that was generated during 2022 on a portfolio of 4.9 billion, at fair value, at December 31, 2022, compared to 129.7 million of pre-tax net investment income that was generated during 2021 on a portfolio of 5.1 billion, at fair value, at December 31, 2021. Also included in net (loss) income were pre-tax net realized investment (losses) gains of (488.1) million and 111.7 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, and pre-tax catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums earned, of approximately 101.3 million and 103.7 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Pre-tax net realized investment losses for 2022 resulted largely from the decrease in fair value of fixed maturity securities due to increases in market interest rates as well as the decrease in fair value of equity securities due to the decline in overall equity markets. 
 
 The Company continued its marketing efforts to enhance name recognition and lead generation in 2022, although it reduced the spending for advertising and marketing as part of its cost saving initiative. The Company believes that its marketing efforts, combined with its ability to maintain relatively low prices and a strong reputation, make its insurance products competitive in California and in other states. 
 
 The Company believes its thorough underwriting process gives it an advantage over its competitors. The Company s agent relationships and underwriting and claims processes are its most important competitive advantages. 
 
 The Company s operating results and growth have allowed it to consistently generate positive cash flow from operations, which was approximately 353 million and 502 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Cash flow from operations has been used to pay shareholder dividends and help support growth. 
 
 Economic and Industry Wide Factors 
 Regulatory Uncertainty The insurance industry is subject to strict state regulation and oversight and is governed by the laws of each state in which each insurance company operates. State regulators generally have substantial power and authority over insurance companies including, in some states, approving rate changes and rating factors, restricting cancellation and non-renewal of insurance policies, and establishing minimum capital and surplus requirements. In many states, insurance commissioners may emphasize different agendas or interpret existing regulations differently than previous commissioners. There is no certainty that current or future regulations and the interpretation of those regulations by insurance commissioners and the courts will not have an adverse impact on the Company. 
 Cost Uncertainty Because insurance companies pay claims after premiums are collected, the ultimate cost of an insurance policy is not known until well after the policy revenues are earned. Consequently, significant assumptions are made when establishing insurance rates and loss reserves. While insurance companies use sophisticated models and experienced actuaries to assist in setting rates and establishing loss reserves, there can be no assurance that current rates or current reserve estimates will be adequate. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that insurance regulators will approve rate increases when the Company s actuarial analyses indicate that they are needed. 
 Economic Conditions The Company s financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity may be negatively impacted by global, national and local economic conditions, such as recessions, increased levels of unemployment, inflation, and large fluctuations in interest rates. Further, volatility in global capital markets could adversely affect the Company s investment portfolio. The Company is not able to predict the timing and effect of these factors, or their duration and severity. 
 Inflation The largest cost component for automobile insurers is losses, which include medical, replacement automobile parts, and labor costs. There can be significant variation in the overall increases in medical cost inflation, and it is often years after the respective fiscal period ends before sufficient claims have closed for the inflation rate to be known with a reasonable degree of certainty. Therefore, it can be difficult to establish reserves and set premium rates, particularly when actual inflation rates may be higher or lower than anticipated. 
 Loss Frequency Another component of overall loss costs is loss frequency, which is the number of claims per risk insured. Loss frequency trends are affected by many factors such as fuel prices, the economy, the prevalence of distracted driving, collision avoidance and other technology in vehicles, and stay-at-home orders issued by state and local governments due to the pandemic. 
 Underwriting Cycle and Competition The property and casualty insurance industry is highly cyclical, with alternating hard and soft market conditions. The Company believes that the automobile insurance market in most states has hardened during 2022 as insurance carriers began to increase rates reflecting high loss severity and increasing loss frequency as the country emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic. In California, market conditions in 
 31 

2022 were hard as companies tightened their underwriting due to difficulty in obtaining regulatory approval for rate increases. 
 
 Technology 
 
 The Company has continued its core insurance platform modernization initiatives in 2022, and intends to complete the migration of most of its products from legacy systems to a single platform and continue to invest in the modernization of its technology and data science platforms in 2023. 
 
 Note on General Business and Economic Conditions 
 
 The outbreak of COVID-19 has had a notable impact on general economic conditions, including, but not limited to, the temporary closures of many businesses and reduced consumer spending. The Company has taken and continues to take a number of precautionary steps to safeguard its customers, business and employees from COVID-19. Most of the Company's employees have been working remotely, with only certain operationally critical employees working on site at various locations. In November 2021, the Company extended its "work-from-home" policy indefinitely under the new "Mercury's My Workplace" policy, allowing most of its employees to work from anywhere in the U.S. beginning January 2022. 
 
 The Company's automobile line of insurance business experienced a rapid drop in loss frequency in the second quarter of 2020 due to reduced driving following the outbreak of the pandemic. Since then, loss frequency has increased and is now near pre-pandemic levels. In 2022, inflationary trends accelerated to their highest level since the 1980s. Excessive inflation led to significant increases in loss severities related to vehicle repairs and bodily injuries. The COVID-19 pandemic also created more uncertainty, and the total effect on losses occurring during the COVID-19 era will not be known for several years. The Company expects more late reported claims and a prolonged settlement period. The sustained high loss severity, combined with loss frequency at near pre-pandemic levels, negatively impacted the Company's results of operations, and the Company has submitted private passenger automobile rate filings in many states requesting rate increases. In addition, the Company is taking various non-rate actions to improve profitability. 
 
 The Federal Open Market Committee started raising the federal funds rate in March 2022 as a response to inflationary pressures. The ensuing increases in market interest rates, combined with the high inflation, the supply chain and labor issues, and the Russia-Ukraine war, have placed significant strain on financial markets leading to market volatility and turmoil. The fair values of the Company's equity securities have reflected such market volatility and the fair values of its fixed maturity securities have decreased significantly as a result of increases in market interest rates during 2022. The Company believes that it will continue to have sufficient liquidity to support its business operations without the forced sale of investments, based on its existing cash and short-term investments, future cash flows from operations, and 175 million of undrawn credit in its unsecured credit facility. 
 
 The Company will continue to monitor the effects of COVID-19 and its variants, the high inflation and interest rates, the supply chain and labor issues, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the legislative relief programs, including the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 signed into law in August 2022. The extent of these effects on the Company's business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including the duration of the high inflation and interest rates and the war, most of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. 
 
 In October 2022, the Company reduced its workforce by approximately 40 employees, and a one-time cost of approximately 3 million associated with the workforce reduction was recorded as an expense for the fourth quarter of 2022. The Company anticipates this reduction will result in ongoing annual cost savings of approximately 6 million. 
 B. Regulatory and Legal Matters 
 The process for implementing rate changes varies by state. For more detailed information related to insurance rate approval, see "Item 1. Business Regulation." 
 During 2022, the Company implemented rate changes in 11 states. In California, no rate increases were approved by the California DOI for lines of insurance business that exceeded 5 of the Company's total net premiums earned in 2022. 
 
 In January 2023, the California DOI approved a 6.9 rate increase on each of MIC's and CAIC's private passenger automobile line of insurance business, which represented approximately 51 and 5 , respectively, of the Company's total net premiums earned in 2022. The Company plans to implement these rate increases in March 2023. In addition, the Company plans to file for another 6.9 rate increase with the California DOI in March 2023 on each of MIC's and CAIC's California private passenger automobile line of insurance business.

The Company is, from time to time, named as a defendant in various lawsuits or regulatory actions incidental to its insurance business. The majority of lawsuits brought against the Company relate to insurance claims that arise in the normal course of business and are reserved for through the reserving process. For a discussion of the Company s reserving methods, see "Critical Accounting Estimates" below and Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." 
 
 The Company also establishes accruals for estimated liabilities for non-insurance claims related lawsuits, regulatory actions, and other contingencies when the Company believes a loss is probable and is able to estimate its potential exposure. For material loss contingencies believed to be reasonably possible, the Company also discloses the nature of the loss contingency and an estimate of the possible loss, range of loss, or a statement that such an estimate cannot be made. In addition, the Company accrues for anticipated legal defense costs associated with such lawsuits and regulatory actions. While actual losses may differ from the amounts recorded and the ultimate outcome of the Company s pending actions is generally not yet determinable, the Company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of currently pending legal or regulatory proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or cash flows. 
 
 For a discussion of additional regulatory and legal matters, see Note 18. Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." In all cases, the Company vigorously defends itself unless a reasonable settlement appears appropriate. 
 
 C. Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves ("Loss Reserves") 
 
 Preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements requires management s judgment and estimates. The most significant is the estimate of loss reserves. Estimating loss reserves is a difficult process as many factors can ultimately affect the final settlement of a claim and, therefore, the loss reserve that is required. A key assumption in estimating loss reserves is the degree to which the historical data used to analyze reserves will be predictive of ultimate claim costs on incurred claims. Changes in the regulatory and legal environments, results of litigation, medical costs, the cost of repair materials, and labor rates, among other factors, can impact this assumption. In addition, time can be a critical part of reserving determinations since the longer the span between the incidence of a loss and the payment or settlement of a claim, the more variable the ultimate settlement amount could be. Accordingly, short-tail liability claims, such as property damage claims, tend to be more reasonably predictable than long-tail liability claims. 
 
 The Company calculates a loss reserve point estimate rather than a range. There is inherent uncertainty with estimates and this is particularly true with loss reserve estimates. This uncertainty comes from many factors which may include changes in claims reporting and settlement patterns, changes in the regulatory and legal environments, uncertainty over inflation rates, and uncertainty for unknown items. The Company does not make specific provisions for these uncertainties, rather it considers them in establishing its loss reserve by looking at historical patterns and trends and projecting these out to current loss reserves. The underlying factors and assumptions that serve as the basis for preparing the loss reserve estimate include paid and incurred loss development factors, expected average costs per claim, inflation trends, expected loss ratios, industry data, and other relevant information. 
 
 The Company also engages independent actuarial consultants to review the Company s loss reserves and to provide the annual actuarial opinions required under state statutory accounting requirements. The Company analyzes loss reserves quarterly primarily using the incurred loss, paid loss, average severity coupled with the claim count development methods, and the generalized linear model ("GLM") described below. When deciding among methods to use, the Company evaluates the credibility of each method based on the maturity of the data available and the claims settlement practices for each particular line of insurance business or coverage within a line of insurance business. The Company may also evaluate qualitative factors such as known changes in laws or legal rulings that could affect claims handling or other external environmental factors or internal factors that could affect the settlement of claims. When establishing the loss reserve, the Company generally analyzes the results from all of the methods used rather than relying on a single method. While these methods are designed to determine the ultimate losses on claims under the Company s policies, there is inherent uncertainty in all actuarial models since they use historical data to project outcomes. The Company believes that the techniques it uses provide a reasonable basis in estimating loss reserves. 
 
 The incurred loss method analyzes historical incurred case loss (case reserves plus paid losses) development to estimate ultimate losses. The Company applies development factors against current case incurred losses by accident period to calculate ultimate expected losses. The Company believes that the incurred loss method provides a 
 33 

reasonable basis for evaluating ultimate losses, particularly in the Company s larger, more established lines of insurance business which have a long operating history. 
 The paid loss method analyzes historical payment patterns to estimate the amount of losses yet to be paid. 
 The average severity method analyzes historical loss payments and/or incurred losses divided by closed claims and/or total claims to calculate an estimated average cost per claim. From this, the expected ultimate average cost per claim can be estimated. The average severity method coupled with the claim count development method provides meaningful information regarding inflation and frequency trends that the Company believes is useful in establishing loss reserves. The claim count development method analyzes historical claim count development to estimate future incurred claim count development for current claims. The Company applies these development factors against current claim counts by accident period to calculate ultimate expected claim counts. 
 The GLM determines an average severity for each percentile of claims that have been closed as a percentage of estimated ultimate claims. The average severities are applied to open claims to estimate the amount of losses yet to be paid. The GLM utilizes operational time, determined as a percentile of claims closed rather than a finite calendar period, which neutralizes the effect of changes in the timing of claims handling. 
 
 The Company analyzes catastrophe losses separately from non-catastrophe losses. For catastrophe losses, the Company generally determines claim counts based on claims reported and development expectations from previous catastrophes and applies an average expected loss per claim based on loss reserves established by adjusters and average losses on previous similar catastrophes. For catastrophe losses on individual properties that are expected to be total losses, the Company typically establishes reserves at the policy limits. 
 
 There are many factors that can cause variability between the ultimate expected loss and the actual developed loss. While there are certainly other factors, the Company believes that the following three items tend to create the most variability between expected losses and actual losses. 
 
 (1) Inflation 
 
 For the Company s California automobile lines of insurance business, total reserves are comprised of the following: 
 
 BI reserves approximately 70 of total reserves 
 
 Material damage ("MD") reserves, including collision and comprehensive property damage approximately 10 of total reserves 
 Loss adjustment expense reserves approximately 20 of total reserves. 
 Loss development on MD reserves is generally insignificant because MD claims are generally settled in a shorter period than BI claims. However, in periods of high rates of change in inflation rates, such as what has been experienced in late 2021 through 2022, loss development on MD reserves can be elevated for a short period of time. The majority of the loss adjustment expense reserves are estimated costs to defend BI claims, which tend to require longer periods of time to settle as compared to MD claims. 
 
 BI loss reserves are generally the most difficult to estimate because they take longer to close than other coverages. BI coverage in the Company s policies includes injuries sustained by any person other than the insured, except in the case of uninsured or underinsured motorist BI coverage, which covers damages to the insured for BI caused by uninsured or underinsured motorists. BI payments are primarily for medical costs and general damages. 
 
 The following table presents the typical closure patterns of BI claims in the Company's California personal automobile insurance coverage: 
 of Total Claims Closed Dollars Paid BI claims closed in the accident year reported 36 12 BI claims closed one year after the accident year reported 78 50 BI claims closed two years after the accident year reported 94 76 BI claims closed three years after the accident year reported 97 88 
 
 34 

BI claims closed in the accident year reported are generally the smaller and less complex claims that settle for approximately 8,000 to 9,000 on average, whereas the total average settlement, once all claims are closed for a particular accident year, is approximately 17,000 to 27,000. The Company creates incurred and paid loss triangles to estimate ultimate losses utilizing historical payment and reserving patterns and evaluates the results of this analysis against its frequency and severity analysis to establish BI loss reserves. The Company adjusts development factors to account for inflation trends it sees in loss severity. As a larger proportion of claims from an accident year are settled, there emerges a higher degree of certainty for the loss reserves established for that accident year. At December 31, 2022, the accident years that are most likely to develop are the 2020 through 2022 accident years; however, it is possible that older accident years could develop as well. 
 
 In general, the Company expects that historical claims trends will continue with costs tending to increase, which is generally consistent with historical data, and therefore the Company believes that it is reasonable to expect inflation to continue. Many potential factors can affect the BI inflation rate, including changes in claims handling process, changes in statutes and regulations, the number of litigated files, increased use of medical procedures such as MRIs and epidural injections, general economic factors, timeliness of claims adjudication, vehicle safety, weather patterns, changes in the relative percentages of single- and multi-car accidents, social inflation, and gasoline prices, among other factors; however, the magnitude of the impact of such factors on the inflation rate is unknown. 
 
 The Company's automobile line of insurance business experienced a rapid drop in loss frequency in the second quarter of 2020 due to reduced driving following the outbreak of the pandemic. Since then, loss frequency has increased and is now near pre-pandemic levels. In 2022, inflationary trends accelerated to their highest level since the 1980s. Excessive inflation led to significant increases in loss severities related to vehicle repairs and bodily injuries. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic created greater uncertainty in the reserve estimates: A greater number of large claims may emerge from the 2020, 2021 and 2022 accident years compared to the prior accident years as claimants may be reluctant to go to a medical provider due to the pandemic but subsequently seek monetary compensation to ease the economic hardship attributable to the pandemic. Based on these factors and uncertainty attributable to the pandemic and inflation, the reserve estimates for the 2020, 2021 and 2022 accident years are subject to a greater degree of variability. 
 
 The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the California automobile BI severity could vary from recorded amounts by as much as 12 , 8 and 6 for 2022, 2021 and 2020 accident years, respectively; however, the variation could be more or less than these amounts. 
 
 During the years 2018 through 2022, the changes in the loss severity amounts for the three preceding accident years from the prior year amounts (BI severity variance from prior year) have ranged as follows: 
 High Low Immediate preceding accident year 7.9 (2.9) Second preceding accident year 7.5 0.1 Third preceding accident year 5.2 (1.0) 
 
 The following table presents the effects on the California automobile BI loss reserves for the 2022, 2021 and 2020 accident years based on possible variations in the severity recorded; however, the actual variations could be more or less than these amounts:

 ___________ 
 (1) Implied inflation rate is calculated by dividing the difference between the current and prior year actual recorded severity by 
 35 

the prior year actual recorded severity. The Company believes that severity increases are caused by litigation, medical costs, inflation, and increased utilization of medical procedures. 
 (2) In 2022, inflationary trends accelerated to their highest level since the 1980s, which had a significant impact on medical expenses for bodily injuries. Bodily injury costs were also under pressure from social inflation. These inflationary factors led to an increase in loss severity in 2022. 
 
 (2) Claim Count Development 
 The Company generally estimates ultimate claim counts for an accident period based on development of claim counts in prior accident periods. Typically, almost every claim is reported within one year following the end of an accident year and at that point the Company has a high degree of certainty as to the ultimate claim count. There are many factors that can affect the number of claims reported after an accident period ends. These factors include changes in weather patterns, a change in the number of litigated files, the number of automobiles insured, and whether the last day of the accident period falls on a weekday or a weekend. However, the Company is unable to determine which, if any, of the factors actually impact the number of claims reported and, if so, by what magnitude. 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic created greater uncertainty in the claims count development for the 2020, 2021 and 2022 accident years. The Company believes that the reduced services for non-critical cases at medical facilities and fear of infection during the pandemic combined with the economic hardship caused by the pandemic are likely to increase the late reporting of claims seeking settlement for monetary compensation. At December 31, 2022, there were 19,589 California automobile BI claims reported for the 2022 accident year and the Company estimates that these are expected to ultimately grow by approximately 4.8 . The Company believes that while actual development in recent years has ranged approximately from 3 to 7 , it is reasonable to expect that the range of the development could be as great as between 0 and 10 . However, actual development may be more or less than the expected range. 
 
 The following table presents the effects on loss development of different claim counts within the broader possible range at December 31, 2022:

 (3) Unexpected Losses From Older Accident Periods 
 
 Unexpected losses are generally not provided for in the current loss reserve because they are not known or expected and tend to be unquantifiable. Once known, the Company establishes a provision for the losses, but it is not possible to provide any meaningful sensitivity analysis as to the potential size of any unexpected losses. These losses can be caused by many factors, including unexpected legal interpretations of coverage, ineffective claims handling, regulations extending claims reporting periods, assumption of unexpected or unknown risks, adverse court decisions as well as many unknown factors. During 2022, the Company did not incur any material unexpected losses related to claims from accident periods prior to 2019. 
 
 Unexpected losses are fairly infrequent but can have a large impact on the Company s losses. To mitigate this risk, the Company has established claims handling and review procedures. However, it is still possible that these procedures will not prove entirely effective, and the Company may have material unexpected losses in future periods. It is also possible that the Company has not identified and established a sufficient loss reserve for all material unexpected losses occurring in the older accident years, even though a comprehensive claims file review was undertaken. The Company may experience additional development on these loss reserves. 
 Discussion of Losses and Loss Reserves and Prior Period Loss Development 
 
 At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded its point estimate of approximately 2.58 billion and 2.23 
 36 

billion 2.56 billion and 2.19 billion, net of reinsurance), respectively, in loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, which included approximately 1.28 billion and 1.03 billion 1.28 billion and 1.02 billion, net of reinsurance), respectively, of incurred-but-not-reported liabilities ("IBNR"). IBNR includes estimates, based upon past experience, of ultimate developed costs, which may differ from case estimates, unreported claims that occurred on or prior to December 31, 2022 and 2021, and estimated future payments for reopened claims. Management believes that the liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses is adequate to cover the ultimate net cost of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to date; however, since the provisions are necessarily based upon estimates, the ultimate liability may be more or less than such provisions. 
 
 The Company evaluates its loss reserves quarterly. When management determines that the estimated ultimate claim cost requires a decrease for previously reported accident years, favorable development occurs and a reduction in losses and loss adjustment expenses is reported in the current period. If the estimated ultimate claim cost requires an increase for previously reported accident years, unfavorable development occurs and an increase in losses and loss adjustment expenses is reported in the current period. For 2022, the Company reported unfavorable development of approximately 47 million on the 2021 and prior accident years loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. The unfavorable development in 2022 was primarily attributable to higher than estimated losses and loss adjustment expenses in the automobile line of insurance business. In 2022, inflationary trends accelerated to their highest level in decades, which had a significant impact on the cost of automobile parts and labor as well as medical expenses for bodily injuries, and supply chain and labor shortage issues lengthened the time to repair vehicles. Bodily injury costs were also under pressure from social inflation. These factors were major contributors to the adverse reserve development in the automobile line of insurance business. 
 
 The Company recorded catastrophe losses net of reinsurance of approximately 102 million in 2022. Catastrophe losses due to the events that occurred during 2022 totaled approximately 101 million, with no reinsurance benefits used for these losses. The majority of the 2022 catastrophe losses resulted from the deep freeze of Winter Storm Elliott and other extreme weather events in Texas, Oklahoma and Georgia, winter storms in California, and the impact of Hurricane Ian in Florida. In addition, the Company experienced unfavorable development of approximately 1 million on prior years' catastrophe losses in 2022. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021 
 
 Revenues 
 
 Net premiums earned and net premiums written in 2022 increased 5.6 and 3.2 , respectively, from 2021. The increase in net premiums earned and written was primarily due to increases in the number of policies written outside of California, higher average premiums in the California homeowners line of insurance business, and rate increases in certain lines of insurance business in some states outside of California, partially offset by a decrease in the number of private passenger automobile policies written in California. During 2022, the Company discontinued offering twelve-month private passenger automobile policies on new and renewal businesses in most states where it operates, including California, which further offset the increase in net premiums written for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. At December 31, 2022, the Company's twelve-month private passenger automobile policies represented approximately 21 of its total private passenger automobile policies in force. 
 
 Net premiums earned included ceded premiums earned of 81.0 million and 65.0 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Net premiums written included ceded premiums written of 81.3 million and 65.5 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in ceded premiums earned and written resulted mostly from higher reinsurance coverage and rates and growth in the covered book of business. 
 
 Net premiums earned, a GAAP measure, represents the portion of net premiums written that is recognized as revenue in the financial statements for the periods presented and earned on a pro-rata basis over the term of the policies. Net premiums written is a non-GAAP financial measure which represents the premiums charged on policies issued during a fiscal period less any applicable reinsurance. Net premiums written is a statutory measure designed to determine production levels. 

37 

The following is a reconciliation of total net premiums earned to net premiums written: 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 (Amounts in thousands) Net premiums earned 3,952,482 3,741,948 Change in net unearned premiums 25,535 113,421 Net premiums written 3,978,017 3,855,369 
 
 Expenses 
 
 Loss and expense ratios are used to interpret the underwriting experience of property and casualty insurance companies. The following table presents the Company's consolidated loss, expense, and combined ratios determined in accordance with GAAP: 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Loss ratio 85.1 73.8 Expense ratio 23.6 24.5 Combined ratio 
 108.7 98.3 
 
 Loss ratio is calculated by dividing losses and loss adjustment expenses by net premiums earned. The Company s loss ratio was affected by unfavorable development of approximately 47 million and favorable development of approximately 26 million on prior accident years loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The unfavorable development in 2022 was primarily attributable to higher than estimated losses and loss adjustment expenses in the automobile line of insurance business. Inflationary trends accelerated to their highest level in decades in 2022, which had a significant impact on the cost of automobile parts and labor as well as medical expenses for bodily injuries, and supply chain and labor shortage issues lengthened the time to repair vehicles. Bodily injury costs were also under pressure from social inflation. These factors were major contributors to the adverse reserve development in the automobile line of insurance business. The favorable development in 2021 was primarily attributable to lower than estimated losses and loss adjustment expenses in the homeowners and private passenger automobile lines of insurance business. 
 
 The 2022 loss ratio was negatively impacted by a total of approximately 101 million of catastrophe losses, excluding unfavorable development of approximately 1 million on prior years' catastrophe losses, primarily due to the deep freeze of Winter Storm Elliott and other extreme weather events in Texas, Oklahoma and Georgia, winter storms in California, and the impact of Hurricane Ian in Florida. The 2021 loss ratio was negatively impacted by a total of approximately 109 million of catastrophe losses, excluding favorable development of approximately 5 million on prior years' catastrophe losses, primarily due to the deep freeze of Winter Storm Uri and other extreme weather events in Texas and Oklahoma, rainstorms, wildfires and winter storms in California, and the impact of Hurricane Ida in New Jersey and New York. 
 
 Excluding the effect of estimated prior periods loss development and catastrophe losses, the loss ratio was 81.3 and 71.5 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in the loss ratio was primarily due to increases in loss severity and frequency in the automobile line of insurance business. The inflationary pressures and the supply chain and labor shortage issues discussed above, coupled with a lag in obtaining timely rate increases to offset the effects of inflationary trends, led to a significant increase in automobile loss severity and increased losses and loss adjustment expenses for the insured events of the current accident year for 2022 compared to 2021. After bottoming out in the second quarter of 2020, automobile loss frequency has mostly been increasing and is near pre-pandemic levels. The Company has filed for rate increases in many states and is taking various non-rate actions to improve profitability. 
 
 Expense ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses by net premiums earned. The decrease in the expense ratio is primarily due to lower expenses for advertising and profitability-related accruals combined with higher net premiums earned. 
 
 Combined ratio is equal to loss ratio plus expense ratio and is the key measure of underwriting performance traditionally used in the property and casualty insurance industry. A combined ratio under 100 generally reflects profitable underwriting results; a combined ratio over 100 generally reflects unprofitable underwriting results. 
 
 Income tax (benefit) expense was (158.0) million and 51.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, 
 38 

respectively. The 209.4 million decrease in income tax expense was mainly due to a significant decrease in pre-tax income of 970.0 million. 
 
 The Company s effective income tax rate can be affected by several factors. These generally include large changes in fully-taxable income including net realized investment gains or losses, tax-exempt investment income, nondeductible expenses, and periodically, non-routine tax items such as adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits related to tax uncertainties. The effective income tax rate was 23.6 and 17.2 for 2022 and 2021, respectively. The effective income tax rate for 2022 was higher than the statutory tax rate of 21 because tax-exempt investment income of approximately 75 million was included in pre-tax loss of approximately 671 million, while the effective income tax rate for 2021 was lower than the statutory tax rate because tax-exempt investment income of approximately 74 million was included in pre-tax income of approximately 299 million.

Average annual yield on investments before and after income taxes increased primarily due to the maturity and replacement of lower yielding investments purchased when market interest rates were lower with higher yielding investments, as a result of increasing market interest rates, as well as higher yields on investments based on floating interest rates.

 See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 for a discussion of changes in its results of operations from the year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2021. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 A. General 
 The Company is largely dependent upon dividends received from its insurance subsidiaries in the current and prior years to pay debt service costs and to make distributions to its shareholders. Under current insurance law, the Insurance Companies are entitled to pay ordinary dividends of approximately 151 million in 2023 to Mercury General. As of December 31, 2022, Mercury General had approximately 96 million in investments and cash that could be utilized to satisfy its direct holding company obligations. 
 
 40 

The principal sources of funds for the Insurance Companies are premiums, sales and maturity of invested assets, and dividend and interest income from invested assets. The principal uses of funds for the Insurance Companies are the payment of claims and related expenses, operating expenses, dividends to Mercury General, and the purchase of investments. 
 
 B. Cash Flows 
 
 The Company has generated positive cash flow from operations since the public offering of its common stock in November 1985. The Company does not attempt to match the duration and timing of asset maturities with those of liabilities; rather, it manages its portfolio with a view towards maximizing total return with an emphasis on after-tax income. With combined cash and short-term investments of 412.7 million at December 31, 2022 as well as 175 million of undrawn credit in its unsecured credit facility, the Company believes its cash flow from operations is adequate to satisfy its liquidity requirements without the forced sale of investments. Investment maturities are also available to meet the Company s liquidity needs. However, the Company operates in a rapidly evolving and often unpredictable business environment that may change the timing or amount of expected future cash receipts and expenditures. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Company s sources of funds will be sufficient to meet its liquidity needs or that the Company will not be required to raise additional funds to meet those needs or for future business expansion, through the sale of equity or debt securities or from credit facilities with lending institutions. 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 352.6 million, a decrease of 149.0 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to increases in payments for losses and loss adjustment expenses and policy acquisition costs, partially offset by an increase in premium collections, a decrease in payments for income taxes, and an increase in investment income received. The Company utilized the cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily for the net purchases of investment securities and payment of dividends to its shareholders. The average annual net cash provided by operating activities for the past 10 years was approximately 364 million, and cash generated from operations was sufficient to meet the liquidity requirements over this period.

 See "D. Debt" below for cash flow related to outstanding debt. 
 
 C. Invested Assets 
 Portfolio Composition 
 An important component of the Company s financial results is the return on its investment portfolio. The Company s investment strategy emphasizes safety of principal and consistent income generation, within a total return framework. The investment strategy has historically focused on maximizing after-tax yield with a primary emphasis on maintaining a well-diversified, investment grade, fixed income portfolio to support the underlying liabilities and achieve return on capital and profitable growth. The Company believes that investment yield is maximized by selecting assets that perform favorably on a long-term basis and by disposing of certain assets to enhance after-tax yield and minimize the potential effect of downgrades and defaults. The Company believes that this strategy enables the optimal investment performance necessary to sustain investment income over time. The Company s portfolio management approach utilizes a market risk and consistent asset allocation strategy as the primary basis for the allocation of interest sensitive, liquid and credit assets as well as for determining overall below investment grade exposure and diversification requirements. Within the ranges set by the asset allocation strategy, tactical investment decisions are made in consideration of prevailing market conditions.

The following table presents the composition of the total investment portfolio of the Company at December 31, 2022: 
 Cost (1)

 __________ 
 (1) Fixed maturities and short-term bonds at amortized cost and equities and other short-term investments at cost. 
 (2) The fair value is measured using the net asset value practical expedient. See Note 4. Fair Value Measurements, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, 49.7 of the Company s total investment portfolio at fair value and 59.7 of its total fixed maturity investments at fair value were invested in tax-exempt state and municipal bonds. Equity holdings consist of preferred stocks, dividend-bearing common stocks on which dividend income is partially tax-sheltered by the 50 corporate dividend received deduction, and private equity funds. At December 31, 2022, 51.3 of short-term investments consisted of highly rated short-duration securities redeemable on a daily or weekly basis. 
 Fixed Maturity Securities and Short-Term Investments 
 Fixed maturity securities include debt securities, which may have fixed or variable principal payment schedules, may be held for indefinite periods of time, and may be used as a part of the Company s asset/liability strategy or sold in response to changes in interest rates, anticipated prepayments, risk/reward characteristics, liquidity needs, tax planning considerations, or other economic factors. Short-term investments include money market accounts, options, and short-term bonds that are highly rated short duration securities and redeemable within one year. 
 
 A primary exposure for the fixed maturity securities is interest rate risk. The longer the duration, the more sensitive the asset is to market interest rate fluctuations. As assets with longer maturity dates tend to produce higher current yields, the Company s historical investment philosophy has resulted in a portfolio with a moderate duration. The Company's portfolio is heavily weighted in investment grade tax-exempt municipal bonds. Fixed maturity securities purchased by the Company typically have call options attached, which further reduce the duration of the asset as interest rates decline. The holdings, that are heavily weighted with high coupon issues, are expected to be called prior to maturity. Modified duration measures the length of time it takes, on average, to receive the present value of all the cash flows produced by a bond, including reinvestment of interest. As it measures four factors (maturity, coupon rate, yield and call terms) which determine sensitivity to changes in interest rates, modified duration is considered a better indicator of price volatility than simple maturity alone. 
 42 

The following table presents the maturities and durations of the Company's fixed maturity securities and short-term investments: 
 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (in years) Fixed Maturity Securities Nominal average maturity: excluding short-term investments 12.4 10.8 including short-term investments 12.0 10.4 Call-adjusted average maturities: excluding short-term investments 4.9 4.6 including short-term investments 4.8 4.5 Modified duration reflecting anticipated early calls: excluding short-term investments 3.6 3.5 including short-term investments 3.5 3.4 Short-Term Investments 
 
 Another exposure related to the fixed maturity securities is credit risk, which is managed by maintaining a weighted-average portfolio credit quality rating of A+, at fair value at December 31, 2022, consistent with the average rating at December 31, 2021. The Company s municipal bond holdings, of which 89.1 were tax exempt, represented 67.0 of its fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2022, at fair value, and were broadly diversified geographically. 
 
 To calculate the weighted-average credit quality ratings as disclosed throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, individual securities were weighted based on fair value and a credit quality numeric score that was assigned to each security s average of ratings assigned by nationally recognized securities rating organizations. 
 
 Taxable holdings consist principally of investment grade issues. At December 31, 2022, fixed maturity holdings rated below investment grade and non-rated bonds totaled 6.6 million and 26.5 million, respectively, at fair value, and represented 0.2 and 0.6 , respectively, of total fixed maturity securities. The majority of non-rated issues are a result of municipalities pre-funding and collateralizing those issues with U.S. government securities with an implicit AAA equivalent credit risk. At December 31, 2021, fixed maturity holdings rated below investment grade and non-rated bonds totaled 7.1 million and 17.3 million, respectively, at fair value, and represented 0.2 and 0.4 , respectively, of total fixed maturity securities. 
 
 Credit ratings for the Company's fixed maturity portfolio were stable in 2022, with 95.0 of fixed maturity securities at fair value experiencing no change in their overall rating. 4.2 and 0.8 of fixed maturity securities at fair value experienced upgrades and downgrades, respectively, in 2022.

 __________ 
 (1) Intermediate ratings are included at each level (e.g., AA includes AA+, AA and AA-). 
 
 U.S. Government Bonds 
 The Company had 158.6 million and 13.1 million, or 3.9 and 0.3 of its fixed maturity portfolio, at fair value, in U.S. government bonds at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. At December 31, 2022, Moody's and Fitch ratings for 
 44 

U.S. government issued debt were Aaa and AAA, respectively, although a significant increase in government deficits and debt could lead to a downgrade. The Company understands that market participants continue to use rates of return on U.S. government debt as a risk-free rate and have continued to invest in U.S. Treasury securities. The modified duration of the U.S. government bonds portfolio reflecting anticipated early calls was 1.4 years and 0.9 years at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Municipal Securities 
 The Company had 2.74 billion and 2.84 billion, or 67.0 and 70.5 of its fixed maturity securities portfolio, at fair value, in municipal securities at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, of which 395.2 million and 424.1 million, respectively, were insured by bond insurers. The underlying ratings for insured municipal bonds have been factored into the average rating of the securities by the rating agencies with no significant disparity between the absolute bond ratings and the underlying credit ratings as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 
 At December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, 65.5 and 56.8 of the insured municipal securities, at fair value, most of which were investment grade, were insured by bond insurers that provide credit enhancement in addition to the ratings reflected by the financial strength of the underlying issuers. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the average rating of the Company s insured municipal securities was A+, which corresponded to the average rating of the investment grade bond insurers. The remaining 34.5 and 43.2 of insured municipal securities at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, were insured by non-rated or below investment grade bond insurers that the Company believes did not provide credit enhancement. The modified duration of the municipal securities portfolio reflecting anticipated early calls was 3.6 years and 3.1 years at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 The Company considers the strength of the underlying credit as a buffer against potential market value declines which may result from future rating downgrades of the bond insurers. In addition, the Company has a long-term time horizon for its municipal bond holdings, which generally allows it to recover the full principal amounts upon maturity and avoid forced sales prior to maturity of bonds that have declined in market value due to the bond insurers rating downgrades. Based on the uncertainty surrounding the financial condition of these insurers, it is possible that there will be additional downgrades to below investment grade ratings by the rating agencies in the future, and such downgrades could impact the estimated fair value of those municipal bonds. 
 Mortgage-Backed Securities 
 At December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, the mortgage-backed securities portfolio of 166.3 million and 137.0 million, or 4.1 and 3.4 of the Company's fixed maturity securities portfolio, at fair value, was categorized as loans to "prime" residential and commercial real estate borrowers. The Company had holdings of 27.3 million and 25.2 million, at fair value, in commercial mortgage-backed securities at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 The weighted-average rating of the entire mortgage backed securities portfolio was AA at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The modified duration of the mortgage-backed securities portfolio reflecting anticipated early calls was 7.3 years and 7.9 years at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Corporate Securities 
 At December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, the company had corporate securities of 569.6 million and 523.9 million, or 13.9 and 13.0 of its fixed maturity securities portfolio, at fair value. The weighted-average rating was A- and BBB+ at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The modified duration reflecting anticipated early calls was 3.1 years and 3.8 years at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Collateralized Loan Obligations 
 At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had collateralized loan obligations of 320.3 million and 314.2 million, respectively, which represented 7.8 of its fixed maturity securities portfolio, at fair value, at each of those dates. The weighted-average rating was A+ and AA- at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The modified duration reflecting anticipated early calls was 4.6 years and 6.3 years at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 Other Asset-Backed Securities 
 
 The Company had other asset-backed securities of 136.5 million and 200.2 million, which represented 3.3 and 5.0 of its fixed maturity securities portfolio, at fair value, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The weighted-average 
 45 

rating was A+ and AA- at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The modified duration reflecting anticipated early calls was 3.1 years and 2.6 years at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Equity Securities 
 Equity holdings of 699.6 million and 970.9 million, at fair value, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, consisted of preferred stocks, common stocks on which dividend income is partially tax-sheltered by the 50 corporate dividend received deduction, and private equity funds. The net (losses) gains due to changes in fair value of the Company s equity portfolio were (185.7) million and 107.7 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The primary cause for the decrease in fair value of the Company's equity securities in 2022 was the overall decline in equity markets, and the primary cause for the increase in fair value of the Company's equity securities in 2021 was the overall improvement in equity markets. 
 The Company s common stock allocation is intended to enhance the return of and provide diversification for the total portfolio. At December 31, 2022, 14.2 of the total investment portfolio, at fair value, was held in equity securities, compared to 18.9 at December 31, 2021.

 1,670 2,069 Total 398,330 372,931 
 __________ 
 (1) On March 8, 2017, the Company completed a public debt offering issuing 375 million of senior notes. The notes are unsecured senior obligations of the Company, with a 4.4 annual coupon payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year commencing September 15, 2017. These notes mature on March 15, 2027. The Company used the proceeds from the notes to pay off the total outstanding balance of 320 million under the existing loan and credit facility agreements and terminated the agreements on March 8, 2017. The remainder of the proceeds from the notes was used for general corporate 
 46 

purposes. The Company incurred debt issuance costs of approximately 3.4 million, inclusive of underwriters' fees. The notes were issued at a slight discount of 99.847 of par, resulting in the effective annualized interest rate, including debt issuance costs, of approximately 4.45 . 
 (2) On March 29, 2017, the Company entered into an unsecured credit agreement (the "2017 Credit Agreement") that provided for revolving loans of up to 50 million and was set to mature on March 29, 2022. On March 31, 2021, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the "Amended and Restated Credit Agreement") that amended and restated the 2017 Credit Agreement. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement increased the aggregate commitments by all the lenders to 75 million from 50 million under the 2017 Credit Agreement and extended the maturity date of the loan that was the subject of the 2017 Credit Agreement to March 31, 2026. On November 18, 2022, the Company entered into the First Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "First Amendment"). The First Amendment extended the maturity date of the loan to November 16, 2026 from March 31, 2026 with possible further extension if certain conditions are met, increased the aggregate commitments by all the lenders to 200 million from 75 million, and replaced the LIBOR with the term SOFR. The interest rates on borrowings under the credit facility are based on the Company's debt to total capital ratio and range from Term SOFR plus 112.5 basis points when the ratio is under 20 to Term SOFR plus 150.0 basis points when the ratio is greater than or equal to 30 . Commitment fees for the undrawn portions of the credit facility range from 12.5 basis points when the ratio is under 20 to 22.5 basis points when the ratio is greater than or equal to 30 . The debt to total capital ratio is expressed as a percentage of (a) consolidated debt to (b) consolidated shareholders' equity plus consolidated debt. The Company's debt to total capital ratio was 20.8 at December 31, 2022, resulting in a 15.0 basis point commitment fee on the 175 million undrawn portion of the credit facility. As of February 14, 2023, a total of 25 million was drawn down under this facility on a three-month revolving basis at an annual interest rate of approximately 5.68 . 
 (3) The unamortized discount and debt issuance costs are associated with the publicly traded 375 million senior unsecured notes. These are amortized to interest expense over the life of the notes, and the unamortized balance is presented in the Company's consolidated balance sheets as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt. The unamortized debt issuance cost of approximately 0.9 million associated with the 200 million unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on November 16, 2026 is included in other assets in the Company's consolidated balance sheets and amortized to interest expense over the term of the credit facility. 
 
 The Company was in compliance with all of its financial covenants pertaining to minimum statutory surplus, debt to total capital ratio, and RBC ratio under the unsecured credit facility at December 31, 2022. 
 
 For a further discussion, see Note 8. Notes Payable, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." 
 E. Uses of Capital 
 Dividends 
 
 Cash returned to shareholders through dividends in 2022, 2021 and 2020 totaled approximately 105.5 million, 140.2 million and 139.6 million, respectively. On February 10, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a 0.3175 quarterly dividend per share payable on March 29, 2023 to shareholders of record on March 15, 2023, with an expected payout of approximately 18 million. The Company currently expects quarterly dividends to continue in future periods, although the declaration and amount of any future cash dividends are at the discretion and subject to the approval of its Board of Directors. The decisions of the Company's Board of Directors regarding the amount and payment of dividends will depend on many factors, such as its financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions, debt service obligations, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, and other factors that its Board of Directors may deem relevant. The Company expects to fund its future dividend payments primarily with a combination of cash expected to be generated from future operations and cash and short-term investments on hand. 
 
 For a further discussion, see Note 13. Dividends, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." 
 Capital Expenditures 
 
 The Company's capital expenditures were approximately 35.5 million, 41.4 million and 40.0 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and they were primarily related to improving the Company's information technology infrastructure and corporate facilities. The Company expects the capital spending for 2023 to be at a level similar to that for 2022 and intends to use the capital to continue to invest in its technology assets and improve corporate facilities. The Company expects to fund its 
 47 

2023 capital expenditures primarily with a combination of cash expected to be generated from future operations and cash and short-term investments on hand. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 
 The Company s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations at December 31, 2022: 
 Contractual Obligations (4) 
 Payments Due By Period Total 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter (Amounts in thousands) Debt (including interest) (1) 
 474,609 41,859 16,500 16,500 16,500 383,250 Lease obligations (2) 
 30,223 12,227 7,952 5,316 3,443 1,146 139 Loss and loss adjustment expense reserves (3)

 __________ 
 (1) The Company s debt contains various terms, conditions and covenants which, if violated by the Company, would result in a default and could result in the acceleration of the Company s payment obligations. Amounts differ from the balances presented on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 because the debt amounts above include interest, calculated at the stated 4.4 coupon rate, and exclude the discount and issuance costs of the debt. 
 (2) The Company is obligated under various non-cancellable lease agreements providing for office space, automobiles, office equipment, and electronic data processing equipment that expire at various dates through the year 2028. Lease obligations include 3.6 million in lease commitments that have not yet commenced as of December 31, 2022. See Note 7. Leases, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information on lease obligations. 
 (3) Loss and loss adjustment expense reserves represents an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims, including IBNR as of December 31, 2022. The Company has estimated the timing of these payments based on its historical experience and expectation of future payment patterns. However, the timing of these payments may vary significantly from the amounts shown above. The ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts which are the Company s best estimates. For more detailed information on the Company's historical loss experience and payment patterns, see "Overview C. Critical Accounting Estimates" in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," as well as Note 12. Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." 
 (4) The table excludes liabilities of 6.6 million related to uncertainty in tax settlements as the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the timing and amount of related future payments. 
 
 The Company expects to meet these contractual obligations primarily with a combination of cash expected to be generated from future operations and cash and short-term investments on hand, except for the payment of the principal of the debt, which is expected to be made with a future borrowing. 
 F. Regulatory Capital Requirements 
 The Insurance Companies must comply with minimum capital requirements under applicable state laws and regulations. The RBC formula is used by insurance regulators to monitor capital and surplus levels. It was designed to capture the widely varying elements of risks undertaken by writers of different lines of insurance business having differing risk characteristics, as well as writers of similar lines where differences in risk may be related to corporate structure, investment policies, reinsurance arrangements, and a number of other factors. The Company periodically monitors the RBC level of each of the Insurance Companies. As of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, each of the Insurance Companies exceeded the minimum required RBC level, as determined by the NAIC and adopted by the state insurance regulators. None of the Insurance Companies RBC ratios were less than 330 of the authorized control level RBC as of December 31, 2022, none less than 400 as of December 31, 2021, and none less than 350 as of December 31, 2020. Generally, an RBC ratio of 200 or less would require some form of regulatory or company action. 
 
 Among other considerations, industry and regulatory guidelines suggest that the ratio of a property and casualty insurer s annual net premiums written to statutory policyholders surplus should not exceed 3.0 to 1. Based on the combined surplus of all the Insurance Companies of 1.50 billion at December 31, 2022 and net premiums written in 2022 of 4.0 billion, the ratio of premiums written to surplus was 2.65 to 1. 
 48 

Insurance companies are required to file an Own Risk and Solvency Assessment ("ORSA") with the insurance regulators in their domiciliary states. The ORSA is required to cover, among many items, a company s risk management policies, the material risks to which the company is exposed, how the company measures, monitors, manages and mitigates material risks, and how much economic and regulatory capital is needed to continue to operate in a strong and healthy manner. The ORSA is intended to be used by state insurance regulators to evaluate the risk exposure and quality of the risk management processes within insurance companies to assist in conducting risk-focused financial examinations and for determining the overall financial condition of insurance companies. The Company filed its most recent ORSA Summary Report with the California DOI in November 2022. Compliance with the ORSA requirements did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
 
 The DOI in each state in which the Company operates is responsible for conducting periodic financial and market conduct examinations of the Insurance Companies in their states. Market conduct examinations typically review compliance with insurance statutes and regulations with respect to rating, underwriting, claims handling, billing, and other practices. 
 
 The following table presents a summary of recent examinations: 
 State Exam Type Period Under Review Status CA, FL, GA, IL, OK, TX Coordinated Multi-state Financial 2018-2021 Examination began in the second quarter of 2022. CA Premium Tax 2018-2021 Examination was completed in the third quarter of 2022. 
 
 During the course of and at the conclusion of these examinations, the examining DOI generally reports findings to the Company. The Company has not been notified of any material findings related to the coordinated multi-state financial examination that began in the second quarter of 2022, and no material findings were reported at the completion of the California premium tax examination in the third quarter of 2022.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks 
 The Company is subject to various market risk exposures primarily due to its investing and borrowing activities. Primary market risk exposures are changes in interest rates, equity prices, and credit risk. Adverse changes to these rates and prices may occur due to changes in the liquidity of a market, or to changes in market perceptions of creditworthiness and risk tolerance. The following disclosure reflects estimates of future performance and economic conditions. Actual results may differ. 
 Overview 
 The Company s investment policies define the overall framework for managing market and investment risks, including accountability and controls over risk management activities, and specify the investment limits and strategies that are appropriate given the liquidity, surplus, product profile, and regulatory requirements of the Company's subsidiaries. Executive oversight of investment activities is conducted primarily through the Company s investment committee. The Company s investment committee focuses on strategies to enhance after-tax yields, mitigate market risks, and optimize capital to improve profitability and returns. 
 
 The Company manages exposures to market risk through the use of asset allocation, duration, and credit ratings. Asset allocation limits place restrictions on the total amount of funds that may be invested within an asset class. Duration limits on the fixed maturity securities portfolio place restrictions on the amount of interest rate risk that may be taken. Comprehensive day-to-day management of market risk within defined tolerance ranges occurs as portfolio managers buy and sell within their respective markets based upon the acceptable boundaries established by investment policies. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 Credit risk results from uncertainty in a counterparty s ability to meet its obligations. Credit risk is managed by maintaining a high credit quality fixed maturity securities portfolio. As of December 31, 2022, the estimated weighted-average credit quality rating of the fixed maturity securities portfolio was A+, at fair value, consistent with the average rating at December 31, 2021. 
 The following table presents municipal securities by state in descending order of holdings at fair value at December 31, 2022: 
 States Fair Value Average Rating (Amounts in thousands) Florida 295,665 A Texas 254,007 AA- California 180,747 A+ Illinois 175,257 A+ New York 166,472 AA- Other states 1,665,035 A+ Total 2,737,183 
 
 At December 31, 2022, the municipal securities portfolio was broadly diversified among the states and the largest holdings were in populous states such as Florida and Texas. These holdings were further diversified primarily among cities, counties, schools, public works, hospitals, and state general obligations. The Company seeks to minimize overall credit risk and ensure diversification by limiting exposure to any particular issuer. 
 Taxable fixed maturity securities represented 40.3 of the Company s fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2022. 9.6 of the Company s taxable fixed maturity securities were comprised of U.S. government bonds, which were rated AAA at December 31, 2022. 0.3 of the Company s taxable fixed maturity securities, representing 0.1 of its total fixed maturity portfolio, were rated below investment grade at December 31, 2022. Below investment grade issues are considered "watch list" items by the Company, and their status is evaluated within the context of the Company s overall portfolio and its investment policy on an aggregate risk management basis, as well as their ability to recover their investment on an individual issue basis. 
 Equity Price Risk 
 Equity price risk is the risk that the Company will incur losses due to adverse changes in the equity markets. 
 At December 31, 2022, the Company s primary objective for common equity investments was current income. The fair 
 50 

value of the equity investments consisted of 558.2 million in common stocks, 51.2 million in preferred stocks, and 90.1 million in private equity funds. Common stocks are typically valued for future economic prospects as perceived by the market. 
 Common stocks represented 11.4 of total investments at fair value at December 31, 2022. Beta is a measure of a security s systematic (non-diversifiable) risk, which is measured as the percentage change in an individual security s return for a 1 change in the return of the market. 
 Based on hypothetical reductions in the overall value of the stock market, the following table illustrates estimated reductions in the overall value of the Company s common stock portfolio at December 31, 2022 and 2021: 
 December 31, 2022 2021 (Amounts in thousands, except Average Beta) Average Beta 0.84 1.14 Hypothetical reduction of 25 in the overall value of the stock market 116,518 227,152 Hypothetical reduction of 50 in the overall value of the stock market 233,036 454,304 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate risk is the risk that the Company will incur a loss due to adverse changes in interest rates relative to the interest rate characteristics of interest bearing assets and liabilities. The Company faces interest rate risk, as it invests a substantial amount of funds in interest sensitive assets and issues interest sensitive liabilities. Interest rate risk includes risks related to changes in U.S. Treasury yields and other key benchmarks, as well as changes in interest rates resulting from widening credit spreads and credit exposure to collateralized securities. 
 The fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2022, which represented 83.3 of total investments at December 31, 2022, at fair value, is subject to interest rate risk. As market interest rates decrease, the value of the portfolio increases and vice versa. A common measure of the interest sensitivity of fixed maturity assets is modified duration, a calculation that utilizes maturity, coupon rate, yield and call terms to calculate an average age to receive the present value of all the cash flows produced by such assets, including reinvestment of interest. The longer the duration, the more sensitive the asset is to market interest rate fluctuations. 
 The Company has historically invested in fixed maturity securities with a goal of maximizing after-tax yields and holding assets to the maturity or call date. Since assets with longer maturities tend to produce higher current yields, the Company s historical investment philosophy resulted in a portfolio with a moderate duration. Fixed maturity securities purchased by the Company typically have call options attached, which further reduce the duration of the asset as interest rates decline. The modified duration of the overall fixed maturity securities portfolio reflecting anticipated early calls was 3.5 years at December 31, 2022. 
 If interest rates were to rise by 100 and 200 basis points, the Company estimates that the fair value of its fixed maturity securities portfolio at December 31, 2022 would decrease by 148.0 million and 296.0 million, respectively. Conversely, if interest rates were to decrease, the fair value of the Company s fixed maturity securities portfolio would rise, and it may cause a higher number of the Company s fixed maturity securities to be called away. The proceeds from the called fixed maturity securities would likely be reinvested at lower yields, which would result in lower overall investment income for the Company.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the Shareholders and Board of Directors 
 Mercury General Corporation: 
 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Mercury General Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedules I, II, and IV (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 14, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
 As discussed in Notes 1 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company estimates loss and loss adjustment expense reserves (loss reserves) to cover incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses. Specifically, loss reserves are established based on the Company s assessment of claims pending and the development of prior years loss liabilities. As of December 31, 2022, the loss and loss adjustment expense reserves balance was 2.58 billion, which included catastrophe losses. 
 
 We identified the evaluation of loss reserves, excluding catastrophe losses, as a critical audit matter. Subjective auditor judgment was required to assess the Company s selected methods and assumptions, such as paid and incurred loss development factors, used to estimate loss reserves. Specialized actuarial skills and knowledge were needed to evaluate the Company s actuarial methodologies and the estimate of future claims payment and reporting patterns based on observed historical patterns. 
 
 The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company s reserving process. This included controls related to the selection of methods and assumptions used in the estimate of loss reserves. We also 
 53 

involved actuarial professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: 
 
 assessing the Company s methodology for estimating loss reserves by comparing it to generally accepted actuarial methods 
 
 evaluating the Company s estimates for certain lines of business by performing independent analyses of loss reserves using the Company s underlying historical claims data 
 
 evaluating the Company s estimates for the remaining lines of business in comparison to internal experience and related industry trends 
 
 developing a range of reserves based on actuarial methodologies and comparing to the Company s total recorded loss reserves 
 
 evaluating the year-over-year movements of the Company s recorded loss reserves within the developed range of reserves.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the Shareholders and Board of Directors 
 Mercury General Corporation: 
 Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the Mercury General Corporation and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedules I, II, and IV (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 14, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 Use of Estimates 
 
 60 

Investments and Other Financial Instruments 
 
 of the fair value of its investments at December 31, 2022 is based on observable market prices, observable pricing parameters, or is derived from such prices or parameters. The availability of observable market prices and pricing parameters can vary by financial instrument. Observable market prices and pricing parameters of a financial instrument, or a related financial instrument, are used to derive a price without requiring significant judgment. 
 
 The Company may hold or acquire financial instruments that lack observable market prices or pricing parameters because they are less actively traded currently or in future periods. The fair value of such instruments is determined using techniques appropriate for each particular financial instrument. These techniques may involve some degree of judgment. The price transparency of the particular financial instrument will determine the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of the Company s financial instruments. Price transparency is affected by a wide variety of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether it is a new financial instrument and not yet established in the marketplace, and the characteristics particular to the transaction. Financial instruments for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available or for which fair value is derived from actively quoted prices or pricing parameters will generally have a higher degree of price transparency. By contrast, financial instruments that are thinly traded or not quoted will generally have diminished price transparency. Even in normally active markets, the price transparency for actively quoted financial instruments may be reduced during periods of market dislocation. Alternatively, in thinly quoted markets, the participation of market makers willing to purchase and sell a financial instrument provides a source of transparency for products that otherwise are not actively quoted. For a further discussion, see Note 4. Fair Value Measurements. 
 
 Fixed maturity securities include debt securities, which may have fixed or variable principal payment schedules, may be held for indefinite periods of time, and may be used as a part of the Company s asset/liability strategy or sold in response to changes in interest rates, anticipated prepayments, risk/reward characteristics, liquidity needs, tax planning considerations, or other economic factors. Premiums and discounts on fixed maturities are amortized using first call date and are adjusted for anticipated prepayments. Premiums and discounts on mortgage-backed securities are adjusted for anticipated prepayment using the retrospective method, with the exception of some beneficial interests in securitized financial assets, which are accounted for using the prospective method. 
 
 Equity securities consist of preferred stocks, common stocks on which dividend income is partially tax-sheltered by the corporate dividend received deduction, and private equity funds. 
 
 Short-term investments include money market accounts, options, and short-term bonds that are highly rated short duration securities and redeemable within one year.

 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, goodwill and other intangible impairment assessments indicated that there was impairment. 
 Premium Revenue Recognition 
 The Company evaluates its unearned premiums periodically for premium deficiencies by comparing the sum of expected claim costs, unamortized acquisition costs and maintenance costs, partially offset by investment income, to related unearned premiums.

 The Company is party to a Catastrophe Reinsurance Treaty ("Treaty") covering a wide range of perils that is effective through June 30, 2023. The Treaty provides million of coverage on a per occurrence basis after covered catastrophe losses exceed the million Company retention limit. The Treaty specifically excludes coverage for any Florida business and for California earthquake losses on fixed property policies, such as homeowners, but does cover losses from fires following an earthquake.

The negative ceded losses and loss adjustment expenses in each of 2022 and 2021 was primarily the result of favorable development on prior years' catastrophe losses that had previously been ceded to the Company's reinsurers. The negative ceded losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2020 was mainly due to the reimbursements from Pacific Gas and Electric Corporation ("PG E") Subrogation Trust Fund to the Company for claims paid to its policyholders related to certain wildfires. These loss recoveries from PG E were ceded to the Company's reinsurers as the original losses had previously been ceded to its reinsurers under the Treaty. 
 
 The Insurance Companies, as primary insurers, are required to pay losses to the extent reinsurers are unable to discharge their obligations under the reinsurance agreements.

Due to the immateriality of the Company's commission income and its related expenses to the overall consolidated financial statements, the commission income, net of related expenses, is included in other revenues in the Company's consolidated statements of operations, and in other income of the Property and Casualty business segment in the Company's segment reporting in accordance with Topic 280, Segment Reporting (see Note 19. Segment Information). 
 
 AIS and PoliSeek are primarily engaged in the marketing and sales of insurance policies in private passenger automobile, commercial automobile and homeowners lines of business. Their revenues primarily consist of commission income received from property and casualty insurers. The primary performance obligation of AIS and Poliseek in return for the commission income from the insurers is to complete the sale of the policy and deliver the control of the policy to the insurer prior to the policy effective date. The total revenue from the sale of a policy is recognized when the sale is complete and the policy is effective as all the material aspects of the performance obligation are satisfied and the insurer is deemed to obtain control of the insurance policy at that time. The commission income is constrained such that the revenue is recognized only to the extent that the commission income received is not likely to be returned to the insurers due to policy cancellations. Any commission income not received when the sale is complete is recognized as commission income receivable, which is included in other receivables in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. Commission income receivable at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was approximately million and million, respectively. 
 
 The refund liability at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was approximately million and million, respectively, which was included in other liabilities in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.

The cumulative-effect adjustment primarily resulted from re-estimating credit losses on the outstanding balances of the Company's premiums receivable and reinsurance recoverables at the adoption date. Topic 326 replaced the "incurred loss" methodology for recognizing credit losses with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses for financial assets that are not accounted for at fair value through net income. The Company's investment portfolio, not including accrued investment income, was not affected by Topic 326 as it applies the fair value option to all of its investments. 
 
 Premiums Receivable

 The Company applies the fair value option to all fixed maturity and equity securities and short-term investments at the time an eligible item is first recognized. The cost of investments sold is determined on a first-in and first-out method, and realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in net realized investment gains in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. See Note 3. Investments for additional information. 
 
 Options Sold 
 
 The Company writes covered call options through listed and over-the-counter exchanges. When the Company writes an option, an amount equal to the premium received by the Company is recorded as a liability and is subsequently adjusted to the current fair value of the option written. Premiums received from writing options that expire unexercised are treated by the Company as realized gains from investments on the expiration date. If a call option is exercised, the premium is added to the proceeds from the sale of the underlying security in determining whether the Company has realized a gain or loss. The Company, as writer of an option, bears the market risk of an unfavorable change in the price of the security underlying the written option. Liabilities for covered call options are included in other liabilities in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.

 Level 3 measurements Fair values of financial assets are based on inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement, including any items in which the evaluated prices obtained elsewhere were deemed to be of a distressed trading level. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not have any financial assets or financial liabilities based on Level 3 measurements. 
 Fair value measurement using NAV practical expedient - The fair values of the Company's investment in private equity funds measured at net asset value are determined using net asset value ("NAV") as advised by the external fund managers and the third party administrators. The NAV of the Company's limited partnership or limited liability company interest in such a fund is based on the manager's and the administrator's valuation of the underlying holdings in accordance with the fund's governing documents and GAAP. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, private equity funds measured at fair value using the NAV practical expedient are not classified in the fair value hierarchy. At December 31, 2022, the Company had capital invested in five such funds: the strategy of three such funds with a combined fair value of approximately million at December 31, 2022 is to provide current income to investors by investing mainly in secured loans, CLOs or CLO issuers, and equity interests in vehicles established to purchase and warehouse loans; the strategy of another such fund with a fair value of approximately at December 31, 2022 is to achieve favorable long-term financial returns and measurable positive social and environmental returns by investing in privately held technology, healthcare, specialty consumer goods and service companies; and the strategy of the other such fund with a fair value of approximately million at December 31, 2022 is to achieve long-term capital appreciation through privately-negotiated venture capital investments in seed- and early-stage portfolio companies with technology-enabled business models. The Company had approximately million in unfunded commitments at December 31, 2022 with respect to the private equity funds measured at NAV. The underlying assets of the funds are expected to be liquidated over the period of approximately to from December 31, 2022. In addition, the Company does not have the ability to redeem or withdraw from the funds, or to sell, assign, pledge or transfer its investment, without the consent from the General Partner or Managers of each fund, but will receive distributions based on the liquidation of the underlying assets and the interest proceeds from the underlying assets.

Certain leases also include options to purchase the leased property. The Company's lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees. 
 
 The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Right-of-use ("ROU") assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of lease payments over the lease term. 
 
 The Company uses its estimated incremental borrowing rate for leases for office space, office equipment and EDP equipment, which is derived from information available at the lease commencement date, in determining the present value of lease payments, as the rate implicit in the lease is not readily available for such leases. The Company gives consideration to its recent debt issuances as well as publicly available data for instruments with similar characteristics when calculating its incremental borrowing rates. For automobile leases, the Company uses the rate implicit in the lease at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments, as the readily-determinable implicit rate is provided in such leases. 
 
 The Company's lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that it will exercise that option. The Company does not use the short-term lease exemption practical expedient and records all leases on the balance sheets, including leases with a term of twelve months or less. The Company accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for leases for office space, automobiles, and office equipment, while it accounts for the lease components separately from the non-lease components for EDP equipment leases.

 Uncertainty in Income Taxes 
 The Company recognizes tax benefits related to positions taken, or expected to be taken, on its tax returns, only if the positions are "more-likely-than-not" sustainable. Once this threshold has been met, the Company s measurement of its expected tax benefits is recognized in its financial statements. 
 
 There were changes to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to tax uncertainties during 2022. The Company does not expect any changes in unrecognized tax benefits to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements within the next 12 months. 
 
 The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service and the taxing authorities of various states. Tax years that remain subject to examination by major taxing jurisdictions are 2019 through 2021 for federal taxes, and 2011 through 2013 and 2020 through 2021 for California state taxes. The Company submitted a formal protest to the Notices of Action on Proposed Assessment issued by the California Franchise Tax Board ("FTB") for the 2011 tax year and is disputing the tax assessment due for the 2012 and 2013 tax years for California state taxes. Tax years 2014 through 2019 for California state taxes have been resolved with no outstanding issues. 
 
 If a reasonable settlement is not reached for tax years 2011 through 2013 for California state taxes, the Company intends to pursue other options, including a formal hearing with the FTB, an appeal with the California Office of Tax Appeals, or litigation in Superior Court. The Company believes that the resolution of these examinations and assessments will not have a material impact on the financial position of the Company.

 During 2022, inflationary trends accelerated to their highest level in decades, which had a significant impact on the cost of automobile parts and labor as well as medical expenses for bodily injuries, and supply chain and labor shortage issues lengthened the time to repair vehicles. Bodily injury costs were also under pressure from social inflation. These factors contributed to higher losses and loss adjustment expenses related to the current accident year for 2022 compared to 2021 and 2020. The increase in the provision for insured events of prior years in 2022 of approximately million primarily resulted from higher than estimated losses and loss adjustment expenses in the automobile line of insurance business. The inflationary pressures and the supply chain and labor shortage issues discussed above were major contributors to the adverse reserve development in the automobile line of insurance business for 2022.

Catastrophe losses due to the events that occurred in 2022 totaled approximately million, w ith no reinsurance benefits used for these losses, resulting primarily from the deep freeze of Winter Storm Elliott and other extreme weather events in Texas, Oklahoma and Georgia, winter storms in California, and the impact of Hurricane Ian in Florida. In addition, the Company experienced unfavorable development of approximately million on prior years' catastrophe losses in 2022. Catastrophe losses due to the events that occurred in 2021 totaled approximately million, with no reinsurance benefits used for these losses, resulting primarily from the deep freeze of Winter Storm Uri and other extreme weather events in Texas and Oklahoma, rainstorms, wildfires and winter storms in California, and the impact of Hurricane Ida in New Jersey and New York. These losses were partially offset by favorable development of approximately million on prior years' catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses due to the events that occurred in 2020 totaled approximately million, with no reinsurance benefits used for these losses, resulting primarily from wildfires and windstorms in California and extreme weather events outside of California. These losses were partially offset by favorable development of approximately million on prior years' catastrophe losses. 
 
 The following is information about incurred and paid claims development as of December 31, 2022, net of reinsurance, as well as cumulative claim frequency and the total of incurred-but-not-reported liabilities plus expected development on reported claims included within the net incurred claims amounts for our two major product lines: automobile and homeowners lines of business. As the information presented is for these two major product lines only, the total incurred and paid claims development shown below does not correspond to the aggregate development presented in the table above, which is for all product lines and includes unallocated claims adjustment expenses. The cumulative number of reported claims represents open claims, claims closed with payment, and claims closed without payment. It does not include an estimated amount for unreported claims. The number of claims is measured by claim event (such as a car accident or storm damage) and an individual claim event may result in more than one reported claim. The Company considers a claim that does not result in a liability as a claim closed without payment.

 Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company s stock over the term of the stock options. The Company estimated the expected term of stock options, which represents the period of time that stock options granted are expected to be outstanding, by using historical exercise patterns and post-vesting termination behavior. The risk free interest rate is determined based on U.S. Treasury yields with equivalent remaining terms in effect at the time of the grant.

 Regulatory and Legal Matters 
 
 On October 5, 2021, the Company received a letter from the California DOI requesting additional information on the 
 90 

million should be provided to its private passenger automobile policyholders, purportedly based upon its analysis of the Company s data. The Company believes that the amounts returned to-date, including the mileage reductions on individual policies, have provided appropriate and material relief to its policyholders and that there is no legal basis for the California DOI or the courts to require the Company to issue additional refunds. The total amount of premiums returned to the Company's policyholders through refunds or credits is approximately million, which reduced its net premiums earned for 2020. The Company has also worked with its agents and policyholders to reclassify exposures on an individual policy basis, including reducing mileage on a large number of vehicles since the pandemic began. Management believes the mileage reductions have significantly reduced premiums on those individual policies in a manner consistent with the Company s filed and approved rates. Although the Company cannot predict whether or not the California DOI or private plaintiffs will take further actions against the Company related to the premium refunds and credits, which may include attempting to induce the Company to provide additional premium refunds to its policyholders, the Company maintains that such relief is barred as a matter of law. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the amount of such additional refunds or other losses, if any, due to any potential actions by the California DOI or the courts and the Company's responses to such actions. The Company is engaged in settlement discussions with the California DOI regarding voluntary refunds or credits and future rate increases. 
 
 On September 10, 2021, the California DOI served the Company a Notice of Non-Compliance ("NNC"), alleging violations in connection with its 2014 Rating Underwriting Examination Report, which was adopted by the California DOI in 2019. The NNC itemizes alleged violations, many of which management believes were corrected or otherwise resolved during the course of the examination, and seeks penalties. The Company has participated in lengthy and detailed discussions with the California DOI since the adoption of the examination report, in an attempt to address the issues deemed unresolved by the California DOI, and has taken several additional corrective actions approved by the California DOI. The Company is continuing discussions with the California DOI to resolve the outstanding issues, or at least obtain the agreement of the California DOI to remove the resolved items from the NNC before proceeding to a formal hearing process if a settlement is not reached. On August 1, 2022, the California DOI publicly announced its intention to pursue an administrative action against the Company with respect to certain outstanding issues. The Company filed a written response to the NNC on September 29, 2022. The response, consisting of a notice of defense, a motion to strike, and a motion to dismiss, challenges the NNC on procedural and substantive grounds. On November 9, 2022, the California DOI served objections and non-substantive responses to the Company's discovery requests. The Company is continuing settlement discussions with the California DOI. The parties are also conferring regarding the California DOI s defective discovery responses, and the possible filing of an Amended NNC that would eliminate the resolved items and identify the remaining issues in dispute should the matter proceed to a hearing. The Company cannot reasonably predict the likelihood, timing or outcome of any hearing process or administrative action, nor can it reasonably estimate the amount of penalties, if any. 
 
 The Company is, from time to time, named as a defendant in various lawsuits or regulatory actions incidental to its insurance business. The majority of lawsuits brought against the Company relate to insurance claims that arise in the normal course of business and are reserved for through the reserving process. For a discussion of the Company s reserving methods, see Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. 
 
 The Company also establishes accruals for estimated liabilities for non-insurance claims related lawsuits, regulatory actions, and other contingencies when the Company believes a loss is probable and is able to estimate its potential exposure. For loss contingencies believed to be reasonably possible, the Company also discloses the nature of the loss contingency and an estimate of the possible loss, range of loss, or a statement that such an estimate cannot be made. In addition, the Company accrues for anticipated legal defense costs associated with such lawsuits and regulatory actions. While actual losses may differ from the amounts recorded and the ultimate outcome of the Company s pending actions is generally not yet determinable, the Company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of currently pending legal or regulatory proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or cash flows. 
 
 The Company is also involved in proceedings relating to assessments made by the FTB. See Note 11. Income Taxes.

 The Company has reportable business segment - the Property and Casualty business segment. 
 The Company s Chief Operating Decision Maker evaluates operating results based on pre-tax underwriting results which is calculated as net premiums earned less (a) losses and loss adjustment expenses and (b) underwriting expenses (policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses). 
 Expenses are allocated based on certain assumptions that are primarily related to premiums and losses. The Company s net investment income, net realized investment gains (losses), other income, and interest expense are excluded in evaluating pre-tax underwriting profit. The Company does not allocate its assets, including investments, or income taxes in evaluating pre-tax underwriting profit. 
 Property and Casualty Lines 
 The Property and Casualty business segment offers several insurance products to the Company s individual customers and small business customers. These insurance products are: private passenger automobile, which is the Company s primary business, and related insurance products such as homeowners, commercial automobile and commercial property. These insurance products are primarily sold to the Company s individual customers and small business customers, which increases retention of the Company s private personal automobile client base. The insurance products comprising the Property and Casualty business segment are sold through the same distribution channels, mainly through independent and 100 owned insurance agents, and go through a similar underwriting process. 
 Other Lines 
 The Other business segment represents net premiums written and earned from an operating segment that does not meet the quantitative thresholds required to be considered a reportable segment. This operating segment offers automobile mechanical protection warranties which are primarily sold through automobile dealerships and credit unions.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 As required by Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 13a-15(b), the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on the foregoing, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. 
 All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. 
 The Company s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). Based upon its assessment, the Company s management believes that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria. 
 KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements included in this 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, which is included herein. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the Company s most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. The Company s process for evaluating controls and procedures is continuous and encompasses constant improvement of the design and effectiveness of established controls and procedures and the remediation of any deficiencies which may be identified during this process. 
 The Company has not experienced any material impact to its internal controls over financial reporting due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company will continually monitor and assess the COVID-19 situation with respect to its internal controls to minimize the impact of the pandemic on their design and operating effectiveness.
