EXPLANATORY NOTES 

 The One Kendall Square Mortgage Loan, which constituted approximately
9.7 of the asset pool of the issuing entity as of its cut-off date, is an asset of the issuing entity and is part of a loan combination
that includes the One Kendall Square Mortgage Loan and one other pari passu loan, which is not an asset of the issuing entity.
This loan combination, including the One Kendall Square Mortgage Loan, is being serviced and administered pursuant to the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement, which is incorporated by reference as Exhibit 4.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

 The Exhibit Index describes exhibits provided by certain parties (in their
capacities indicated on the Exhibit Index) with respect to the Google and Amazon Office Portfolio Mortgage Loan, which constituted approximately
9.7 of the asset pool of the issuing entity as of its cut-off date. The Google and Amazon Office Portfolio Mortgage Loan is an
asset of the issuing entity and is part of a loan combination that includes the Google and Amazon Office Portfolio Mortgage Loan and three
other pari passu loans, which are not assets of the issuing entity. A pari passu portion of the loan combination was securitized
in the COMM 2014-CCRE14 Mortgage Trust transaction, Commission File Number 333-184376-11 (the COMM 2014-CCRE14 Transaction ).
This loan combination, including the Google and Amazon Office Portfolio Mortgage Loan, is being serviced and administered pursuant to
the pooling and servicing agreement for the COMM 2014-CCRE14 Transaction, which is incorporated by reference as Exhibit 4.2 to this Annual
Report on Form 10-K. 

 The master servicer of a pooling and servicing agreement or trust and servicing
agreement also functions as the primary servicer of the related mortgage loans serviced and administered pursuant to such agreement unless
a separate primary servicer is identified herein. If this report does not identify a separate primary servicer, the servicer compliance
statement provided by the master servicer under any such agreement also encompasses its responsibilities as primary servicer of the related
mortgage loan or mortgage loans. 

 U.S. Bank National Association acts as trustee of the mortgage loans serviced
under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the Google and Amazon Office Portfolio Mortgage Loan prior to October 17, 2022, and U.S.
Bank Trust Company, National Association acts as trustee of the mortgage loans serviced under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and
the Google and Amazon Office Portfolio Mortgage Loan on and after October 17, 2022. Pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and
the pooling and servicing agreement for the COMM 2014-CCRE14 Transaction, the trustee is required to provide an assessment of compliance
with applicable servicing criteria solely with respect to Item 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB (regarding advances of funds or guarantees
regarding collections, cash flows or distributions, and any interest or other fees charged for such advances, are made, reviewed and approved
as specified in the transaction agreements). However, during the reporting period, the trustee did not perform any servicing function
with respect to the servicing criteria specified in Item 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB. The master servicer or the special servicer,
to the extent required, performed the servicing function identified with respect to Item 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB, and each such
party included Item 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB in the assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria and accountant s
attestation report for the subject transaction. As a result, this Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an assessment of compliance
with applicable servicing criteria of the trustee. One or more other servicers of the mortgage loans serviced under the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement and the Google and Amazon Office Portfolio Mortgage Loan have delivered one or more assessments of compliance with respect to
Item 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB. 

 This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes assessments of compliance with applicable
servicing criteria and accountants attestation reports from CoreLogic Solutions, LLC. This entity was engaged by the primary
servicer of the Google and Amazon Office Portfolio Mortgage Loan to remit tax payments received from the escrow accounts of borrowers
to local taxing authorities, to report tax amounts due, to verify tax parcel information, and to verify non-escrow tax payments. These
servicing functions are included within the servicing criteria set forth in Items 1122(d)(4)(xi) and 1122(d)(4)(xii) of Regulation AB. 
Therefore, under the principles-based definition of servicer set forth in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB that looks to the
functions that an entity performs, this vendor is a servicer for the purposes of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. See 
Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations, Section 301.01 (Item 1101(j)). 

 The assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria, accountants 
attestation report and servicer compliance statement of the certificate administrator of the Google and Amazon Office Portfolio Mortgage
Loan is omitted from this Annual Report on Form 10-K as the certificate administrator pursuant to the related pooling and servicing agreement
or trust and servicing agreement does not perform any activities that address servicing criteria with respect to the issuing entity and
because it is not a servicer that meets the criteria in Item 1108(a)(2)(i) through (iii) of Regulation AB. 

 With respect to the pari passu loan combination that includes the
Google and Amazon Office Portfolio Mortgage Loan, the servicer compliance statements of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as primary
servicer of the Google and Amazon Office Portfolio Mortgage Loan and Rialto Capital Advisors, LLC as special servicer of the Google and
Amazon Office Portfolio Mortgage Loan, listed on the Exhibit Index are omitted from this Annual Report on Form 10-K as they are not required
by Item 1123 of Regulation AB to be included on this Annual Report on Form 10-K because they are each an unaffiliated party that is not
a servicer that meets the criteria in Item 1108(a)(2)(i) through (iii) of Regulation AB.

 Item 1117 of Regulation AB, Legal Proceedings. 

 The registrant knows of no material pending legal proceeding involving the
trust or any party related to the trust, other than routine litigation incidental to the duties of those respective parties, and the following,
with respect to Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as Certificate Administrator and Custodian, and U.S. Bank National Association,
as Trustee. 

Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas DBTCA and Deutsche Bank National
Trust Company DBNTC have been sued by investors in civil litigation concerning their role as trustees of certain residential
mortgage-backed securities RMBS trusts. 

On June 18, 2014, a group of investors, including funds managed by Blackrock Advisors,
LLC, PIMCO-Advisors, L.P., and others, filed an action against DBNTC and DBTCA in New York State Supreme Court alleging that DBNTC and
DBTCA failed to perform purported duties, as trustees for 544 private-label RMBS trusts, to enforce breaches of representations and warranties
as to mortgage loans held by the trusts and to enforce breaches by servicers of their mortgage loan servicing obligations for the trusts.
During the course of the litigation, plaintiffs dismissed the case from New York State Supreme Court and refiled two separate cases, one
in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (the BlackRock SDNY Case and the other in the Superior
Court of California, Orange County (the BlackRock California Case ). Pursuant to a settlement among the parties, the
 BlackRock SDNY Case was dismissed on December 6, 2018, and the BlackRock California Case was dismissed on January 11, 2019. 

On September 27, 2017, DBTCA was added as a defendant to a case brought by certain
special purpose entities including Phoenix Light SF Limited in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, in which
the plaintiffs previously alleged incorrectly that DBNTC served as trustee for all 43 of the trusts at issue. On September 27, 2017, plaintiffs
filed a third amended complaint that names DBTCA as a defendant in addition to DBNTC. DBTCA serves as trustee for one of the 43 trusts
at issue. DBNTC serves as trustee for the other 42 trusts at issue. Plaintiffs third amended complaint brings claims for violation
of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939 TIA breach of contract; breach of fiduciary duty; negligence and gross negligence;
violation of New York s Streit Act; and breach of the covenant of good faith. However, in the third amended complaint, plaintiffs
acknowledge that, before DBTCA was added to the case, the court dismissed plaintiffs TIA Act claims, negligence and gross negligence
claims, Streit Act claims, claims for breach of the covenant of good faith, and certain theories of plaintiffs breach of contract
claims, and plaintiffs only include these claims to preserve any rights on appeal. Plaintiffs allege damages of hundreds of millions
of dollars. On November 13, 2017, DBNTC and DBTCA filed an answer to the third amended complaint. On December 7, 2018, DBNTC and
DBTCA filed a motion for summary judgment. Also on December 7, 2018, plaintiffs, jointly with Commerzbank AG (see description of Commerzbank
case below), filed a motion for partial summary judgment. On October 27, 2021, DBNTC and DBTCA filed a supplemental motion for summary
judgment relating to plaintiffs standing. On February 8, 2022, the court issued an order in which it granted DBNTC and DBTCA s
supplemental motion for summary judgment, granted in part DBNTC and DBTCA s initial motion for summary judgment, and denied plaintiffs 
motion for partial summary judgment. As a result of that order, all of plaintiffs claims were dismissed with prejudice. On March
10, 2022, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit with respect to the court s
orders on the motions to dismiss and for summary judgment. 

On November 30, 2017, DBTCA was added as a defendant to a case brought by Commerzbank
AG Commerzbank in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, in which Commerzbank previously alleged
incorrectly that DBNTC served as trustee for all 50 of the trusts at issue. On November 30, 2017, Commerzbank filed a second amended complaint
that names DBTCA as a defendant in addition to DBNTC. DBTCA serves as trustee for 1 of the 50 trusts at issue. DBNTC serves as trustee
for the other 49 trusts at issue. Commerzbank s second amended complaint brings claims for violation of the TIA; breach of contract;
breach of fiduciary duty; negligence; violation of the Streit Act; and breach of the covenant of good faith. However, in the second amended
complaint, Commerzbank acknowledges that, before DBTCA was added to the case, the court dismissed Commerzbank s TIA claims for the
trusts governed by pooling and servicing agreements, as well as its Streit Act claims and claims for breach of the covenant of good faith,
and Commerzbank only includes these claims to preserve any rights on appeal. The second amended complaint alleges that DBNTC and DBTCA
caused Commerzbank to suffer hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, but the complaint does not include a demand for
money damages in a sum certain. On January 29, 2018, DBNTC and DBTCA filed an answer to the second amended complaint. On December 7, 2018,
DBNTC and DBTCA filed a motion for summary judgment. Also on December 7, 2018, Commerzbank, jointly with the Phoenix Light plaintiffs,
filed a motion for partial summary judgment. On February 8, 2022, the court issued an order in which it granted in part DBNTC and DBTCA s
motion for summary judgment and denied plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment. As a result of that order, many of plaintiffs 
claims and theories were dismissed with prejudice. Discovery is ongoing. 

On December 30, 2015, IKB International, S.A. in Liquidation and IKB Deutsche Industriebank
A.G. (collectively, IKB ), as an investor in 37 RMBS trusts, filed a summons with notice in the Supreme Court of the State
of New York, New York County, against DBNTC and DBTCA as trustees of the trusts. On May 27, 2016, IKB served its complaint asserting claims
for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of duty to avoid conflicts of interest, violation of the Streit Act, violation
of the TIA, violation of Regulation AB, and violation of Section 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code. IKB alleges that DBNTC and DBTCA are
liable for over U.S. 268 million in damages. On October 5, 2016, DBNTC and DBTCA, together with several other trustees defending lawsuits
by IKB, filed a joint motion to dismiss. On January 6, 2017 and June 20, 2017, IKB voluntarily dismissed with prejudice all claims as
to seven trusts. On January 27, 2021, the court granted in part and denied in part DBNTC and DBTCA s motion to dismiss. The court
granted the motion to dismiss with respect to IKB s claims for violations of the Streit Act, Regulation AB, and Section 9 of the
Uniform Commercial Code, as well as certain aspects of IKB s claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and violation
of the TIA. The court denied the remainder of the motion to dismiss. IKB s remaining claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary
duty, breach of duty to avoid conflicts of interest, and violation of the TIA will proceed. On May 10, 2021, DBNTC and DBTCA filed a notice
of appeal with the New York Supreme Court Appellate Division, First Department, regarding certain aspects of the court s order on
the motion to dismiss. On May 20, 2021, IKB filed a notice of cross appeal with respect to other aspects of that order. On August 30,
2022, the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department affirmed in part and reversed in part the court s order on
the motion to dismiss. On November 10, 2022, the First Department granted DBNTC and DBTCA s motion for leave to appeal to the Court
of Appeals, and denied IKB s separate motion for reargument and leave to appeal. On June 2, 2021, IKB filed a motion for re-argument
regarding certain aspects of the court s order on the motion to dismiss, which the court denied on August 3, 2021. On May 13, 2021,
DBNTC and DBTCA filed an answer to the complaint. On October 28, 2021, the parties filed a stipulation, voluntarily dismissing with prejudice
all claims as to seven additional trusts. On December 29, 2021, the parties filed a stipulation, voluntarily dismissing with prejudice
all claims as to one additional trust. On April 22, 2022, the parties filed a stipulation, voluntarily dismissing with prejudice all claims
as to 17 certificates at issue (including all claims as to 5 trusts), leaving 17 trusts at issue. Discovery is ongoing. 

 It is DBTCA s belief that it has no pending legal proceedings (including,
based on DBTCA s present evaluation, the litigation disclosed in the foregoing paragraphs) that would materially affect its ability
to perform its duties under the related servicing agreement. 

 In the last several years, U.S. Bank National Association U.S. Bank and other large financial institutions have been sued in their capacity as trustee or successor trustee for certain residential mortgage
backed securities RMBS trusts. The complaints, primarily filed by investors or investor groups against U.S. Bank and similar
institutions, allege the trustees caused losses to investors as a result of alleged failures by the sponsors, mortgage loan sellers and
servicers to comply with the governing agreements for these RMBS trusts. Plaintiffs generally assert causes of action based upon the trustees 
purported failures to enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for alleged breaches of representations and warranties,
notify securityholders of purported events of default allegedly caused by breaches of servicing standards by mortgage loan servicers and
abide by a heightened standard of care following alleged events of default. 

 U.S. Bank denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations
under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions were not the cause of losses to investors, that it has meritorious defenses, and
it has contested and intends to continue contesting the plaintiffs claims vigorously. However, U.S. Bank cannot assure you as to
the outcome of any of the litigation, or the possible impact of these litigations on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. 

 On March 9, 2018, a law firm purporting to represent fifteen Delaware statutory
trusts (the DSTs that issued securities backed by student loans (the Student Loans filed a lawsuit in the
Delaware Court of Chancery against U.S. Bank National Association U.S. Bank in its capacities as indenture trustee and
successor special servicer, and three other institutions in their respective transaction capacities, with respect to the DSTs and the
Student Loans. This lawsuit is captioned The National Collegiate Student Loan Master Trust I, et al. v. U.S. Bank National Association,
et al., C.A. No. 2018-0167-JRS (Del. Ch.) (the NCMSLT Action ). The complaint, as amended on June 15, 2018, alleged that
the DSTs have been harmed as a result of purported misconduct or omissions by the defendants concerning administration of the trusts and
special servicing of the Student Loans. Since the filing of the NCMSLT Action, certain Student Loan borrowers have made assertions against
U.S. Bank concerning special servicing that appear to be based on certain allegations made on behalf of the DSTs in the NCMSLT Action. 

 U.S. Bank believes that it has performed its obligations as indenture trustee
and special servicer in good faith and in compliance in all material respects with the terms of the agreements governing the DSTs (the
 Governing Agreements ), and accordingly that the claims against it in the NCMSLT Action are without merit. 

 U.S. Bank has filed a motion seeking dismissal of the operative complaint
in its entirety with prejudice pursuant to Chancery Court Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) or, in the alternative, a stay of the case while
other prior filed disputes involving the DSTs and the Student Loans are litigated. On November 7, 2018, the Court ruled that the case
should be stayed in its entirety pending resolution of the first-filed cases. On January 21, 2020, the Court entered an order consolidating
for pretrial purposes the NCMSLT Action and three other lawsuits pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery concerning the DSTs and the
Student Loans (the Consolidated Action ). U.S. Bank and other parties to the Consolidated Action have briefed and argued

 Item 1119 of Regulation AB, Affiliations and Certain Relationships
and Related Transactions. 

 The information regarding this Item has been previously provided in a prospectus
supplement of the Registrant relating to the issuing entity filed on March 18, 2014 pursuant to Rule 424(b)(5). 

 Item 1122 of Regulation AB, Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria. 

 The reports on assessments of compliance with the servicing criteria for
asset-backed securities and related attestation reports on such assessments of compliance with respect to the mortgage loans are attached
hereto under Item 15 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Attached as Schedule II to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement incorporated by
reference as Exhibit 4.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K is a chart identifying the entities participating in a servicing function
for the transaction responsible for each applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d). 

 The reports on assessments of compliance with the servicing criteria for
asset-backed securities and related attestation reports on such assessments of compliance with respect to the Google and Amazon Office
Portfolio Mortgage Loan, which is being serviced and administered pursuant to the pooling and servicing agreement for the COMM 2014-CCRE14
Transaction, are attached hereto under Item 15 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Attached as Schedule II to the pooling and servicing
agreement for the COMM 2014-CCRE14 Transaction incorporated by reference as Exhibit 4.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K is a chart
identifying the entities participating in a servicing function for the COMM 2014-CCRE14 Transaction responsible for each applicable servicing
criteria set forth in Item 1122(d). 

 The report on assessment of compliance for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2022, furnished pursuant to Item 1122 of Regulation AB by KeyBank National Association KeyBank ), as
servicer, discloses that the following material instance of noncompliance occurred with respect to its platform: 

 The examination performed by Ernst Young LLP identified an instance
of material noncompliance with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)(4)(ix) of Regulation AB applicable to KeyBank during the
year ended December 31, 2022. During compliance testing, it was discovered, that not all FlexARM loan mortgagors were offered loan rates
within 45-60 days before the rate change date, as required per the related pool asset documents. Per the related note, if the holder fails
to offer a loan rate within 45-60 days of any change date a margin of 2.25 is to be used. Given the notification was not made to the
borrowers, a 3 margin was incorrectly applied. The noncompliance in Item 1122 (d)(4)(ix) is related to a servicing portfolio which is
wholly owned by the investor and is not held in a publicly traded security. 

 The following remediation procedures have been initiated by KeyBank: (i)
the impacted mortgage loans are currently in the process of being identified, (ii) investor contact has been initiated, (iii) corrective
actions are being considered and will be tracked and monitored by senior management, (iv) procedures will be reviewed and revised, if
necessary, to include new tracking and action steps to prevent this situation from recurring in the future, and (v) training will be provided
to the relevant staff members to prevent a recurrence.

MANAGEMENT S ASSERTION ON 

 COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATION AB SERVICING CRITERIA 

KeyBank National Association, as successor
by merger to KeyCorp Real Estate Capital Markets, Inc. (the Asserting Party is responsible for assessing compliance for
the transactions listed on Appendix A for the period January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022 (the Reporting Period ), with
the servicing criteria set forth in Title 17, Section 229.1122(d) of the Code of Federal Regulations (the CFR ), except for
the servicing criteria which the Asserting Party has concluded are not applicable, as indicated on Appendix B attached hereto (the Applicable
Servicing Criteria ), to the servicing of the transactions listed on Appendix A, backed by commercial real estate mortgage loans
and serviced by the Asserting Party. Although the Asserting Party is responsible for assessing compliance with Section 229.1122 (d)(1)(iii)
of Regulation AB, there were no servicing activities performed by the Asserting Party during the year ended December 31, 2022, that required
this servicing criteria to be complied with. 

The Asserting Party has assessed compliance
with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Reporting Period and has concluded that the Asserting Party has complied, in all material
respects, except as discussed in Appendix C, with the applicable servicing criteria for the transactions listed on Appendix A backed by
commercial real estate mortgage loans serviced by the Asserting Party. 

The Asserting Party has engaged a vendor
to perform the activities required by the servicing criteria as set forth in Appendix B. The Asserting Party has determined that this
vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Asserting Party has elected to
take responsibility for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria applicable to the vendor as permitted by Regulation
AB Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations of the Division of Corporation Finance, Section 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers 
C DI 200.06. As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Asserting Party has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed
to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with servicing criteria applicable
to the vendor. The Asserting Party is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for
the vendor and related criteria. 

Ernst Young LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the assessment of compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria
for the Reporting Period as set forth in this assertion.

KeyBank National Association 
Management s Assessment of Compliance with Regulation AB Criteria 
For the Period of January 1 through December 31, 2022 
Appendix C 

 KeyBank National Association (KeyBank) has identified the following
material instance of noncompliance with servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(ix) during the calendar year ended December 31, 2022, with respect
to the Platform. 

1) Servicing Criteria impacted 

 1122(d)(4)(ix) Adjustments to interest rates or rates
of return for pool assets with variable rates are computed based on the related pool asset documents. 

2) Material Instance of Noncompliance with Servicing Criteria 

 During compliance testing, it
was discovered, that not all FlexARM loan mortgagors were offered loan rates within 45-60 days before the rate change date, as required
per the related pool asset documents. Per the Note, if the holder fails to offer a loan rate within 45-60 days of any change date a margin
of 2.25 is to be used. Given the notification was not made to the borrowers, a 3 margin was incorrectly applied. The noncompliance in
Item 1122 (d)(4)(ix) is related to a servicing portfolio which is wholly owned by the investor and is not held in a publicly traded security . 

3) Remediation 

 The following remediation procedures have been initiated by KeyBank:
(i) the impacted mortgage loans are currently in the process of being identified, (ii) investor contact has been initiated, (iii) corrective
actions are being considered and will be tracked and monitored by senior management, (iv) procedures will be reviewed and revised, if
necessary, to include new tracking and action steps to prevent this situation from recurring in the future, and (v) training will be provided
to the relevant staff members to prevent a recurrence.

MANAGEMENT S ASSERTION OF COMPLIANCE 

Management of the Trust Agency Services department of Deutsche Bank National
Trust Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (collectively the Company is responsible for assessing the servicing
criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission to determine which criteria
are applicable to the Company in respect of the servicing platform described below. Management has determined that the servicing criteria
are applicable in regard to the servicing platform as of and for the period as follows: 

Platform : Publicly-issued i.e. , transaction-level reporting required
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) and certain privately-issued i.e. , for which transaction-level reporting
is required pursuant to contractual obligation) residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities and other
asset-backed securities issued on or after January 1, 2006, for which the Company provides trustee, certificate administrator, securities
administration, paying agent or custodian services, as defined in the transaction agreements, excluding publicly-issued securities sponsored
or issued by any government sponsored entity (the Platform (see Appendix A). 

Applicable Servicing Criteria : All servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d),
to the extent required by Item 1122(d) servicing criteria in regards to the activities performed by the Company with respect to the Platform
as to any transaction, except for the following criteria: 1122(d)(4)(iv) 1122(d)(4)(xiv), which management has determined are
not applicable to the activities the Company performs with respect to the Platform (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ).
With respect to Applicable Servicing Criteria 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(iii) and 1122(d)(4)(iii) there were no activities
performed during the year ended December 31, 2022 with respect to the Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would
require the Company to perform such activities. 

Period : Year ended December 31, 2022 (the Period ). 

Management's interpretation of Applicable Servicing Criteria : The Company s
management has determined that servicing criterion 1122(d)(1)(iii) is applicable only with respect to its continuing obligation to act
as, or locate a, successor servicer under the circumstances referred to in certain transaction agreements. It is management's interpretation
that the Company has no other active back-up servicing responsibilities in regards to servicing criterion 1122(d)(1)(iii) as of and for
the Period. The Company s management has determined that servicing criterion 1122(d)(1)(v) is applicable only to the activities
the Company performs related to the mathematically accurate aggregation of information received from servicers and the accurate conveyance
of such information within reports to investors. The Company s management has determined that servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii)
is applicable to the activities the Company performs with respect to the Platform only as it relates to the Company s obligation
to report additions, removals or substitutions on reports to investors in accordance with the transaction agreements. 

With respect to the Platform as of and for the Period, the Company s management
provides the following assertion of compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria: 

The Company s management is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria. 

The Company s management has assessed compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. In making
this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation
AB. 

Based on such assessment, the Company has complied, in all material respects with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria. 

Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued
an attestation report with respect to management s assertion of compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria as of and for
the Period.

RE: Management's Report on Assessment of 2022 Compliance by 
Park Bridge Lender Services LLC with Regulation AB Servicing Criteria 

 Park Bridge Lender Services LLC (the Asserting Party or PBLS is responsible for assessing its compliance, as of and for the calendar year ended December 31, 2022 (the Reporting Period ),
with the servicing criteria set forth in Title 17, Section 229.1122(d) of the Code of Federal Regulations. 

 The transactions covered by this assertion are those transactions processed
by the Asserting Party in its capacity as trust advisor or operating advisor for the asset-backed securities transactions listed in Exhibit
A attached hereto (the Platform ). 

 The Asserting Party is responsible for assessing its compliance with
the servicing criteria applicable to it. The Asserting Party used the criteria in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB (17 C.F.R.
229.1122) to assess its compliance. The full outline of the Asserting Party's contractually applicable servicing criteria under various
securitization pooling and servicing agreements can be found in Exhibit B attached hereto. The servicing criteria listed in the
column title Inapplicable Servicing Criteria on Exhibit B hereto are not applicable to the Asserting Party based on
the activities it performs with respect to the Platform. 

 Based on its assessment, the Asserting Party believes that, as of and for the
periods the contractual obligations existed for the Platform in the Reporting Period, the Asserting Party has complied in all material
respects with the servicing criteria listed in the column title Applicable Servicing Criteria on Exhibit B hereto (the
 Applicable Servicing Criteria ). 

 FORVIS, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued
an attestation report on the assessment of compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Reporting Period as set forth in
this assertion.

2022 Certification Regarding Compliance with Applicable
Servicing Criteria 

 Management of Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage Servicing,
a division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, (the Company is responsible for assessing compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the servicing of commercial
and multifamily loans (the Platform ), except for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(B-D), 1122(d)(3)(ii-iv),
1122(d)(4)(ii), and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to
the Platform, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. Appendix A to this letter identifies the commercial mortgage and multifamily
pools and other structures involving the commercial and multifamily loans constituting the Platform. Appendix B to this letter identifies
the applicable servicing criteria with respect to the Platform. 

 With respect to servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(xi)
and 1122(d)(4)(xii), the Company performs applicable activities covered by these criteria, with respect to the Platform, except the Company
has engaged a vendor to perform certain tax payment activities. Such vendor has provided a separate Regulation AB Item 1122 management
assessment and attestation for such activities. 

 With respect to applicable servicing criterion
1122(d)(4)(iii), there were no activities performed during the year ended December 31, 2022 with respect to the Platform, because there
were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities. 

 With respect to servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i),
1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(xi), and 1122(d)(4)(xii), the Company has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these
servicing criteria. The Company's management has determined that none of these vendors is considered a servicer as defined
in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company's management has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing
criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by the SEC's Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation C DI 200.06, Vendors
Engaged by Servicers (C DI 200.06) (formerly SEC Manual of Publicly Available Telephone Interpretations 17.06). The Company has
policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors' activities comply in all material respects
with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company's management is solely responsible for determining that it meets the
SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria. 

The Company s management has assessed the Company's compliance
with the applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the
criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. Based on such assessment,
management believes that, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company has complied in all material respects with the servicing
criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the servicing of the Platform. 

 The Company has not identified and is not aware of
any material instance of noncompliance by the Vendors with the applicable servicing criteria as of December 31, 2022, or for the Reporting
Period with respect to the Platform taken as a whole. 

 The Company has not identified any material deficiency
in its policies and procedures to monitor the compliance by the Vendors with the applicable servicing criteria as of December 31, 2022,
or for the Reporting Period with respect to the Platform taken as a whole. 

 KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting
firm, has issued an attestation report with respect to management's assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria as
of and for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

 The Board of Directors and Shareholder KeyBank National Association 

 We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying
Management s Assertion on Compliance with Regulation AB Servicing Criteria, that KeyBank National Association, as successor by merger
to KeyCorp Real Estate Capital Markets, Inc., (the Company) complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of the Securities
and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for commercial real estate mortgage loans platform, except for the instance of material
noncompliance described therein, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, except for Item 1122 (d)(3)(i)(b), 1122 (d)(3)(i)(c),
1122 (d)(3)(i)(d), 1122 (d)(3)(ii), 1122 (d)(3)(iii) and 1122 (d)(3)(iv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities
performed by them with respect to the servicing platform covered by this report as noted in Appendix B of management s assertion.
See Appendix A of management s assertion for the asset backed transactions covered by this platform. Management is responsible for
the Company s compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion
about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 

 Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than all
of the individual asset backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities
related to the Platform and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities
in compliance with the servicing criteria and as permitted by Regulation AB Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations of the Division
of Corporation Finance, Section 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C DI 200.06). Furthermore, our procedures were
limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures
were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the
balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any
other transactions. Although the Company is responsible for assessing compliance with Item 1122 (d)(1)(iii) of Regulation AB, there were
no servicing activities performed by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2022 that required these servicing criteria to be
complied with. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 A member firm of Ernst Young Global Limited 

Our examination disclosed the following material
noncompliance with servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(ix) applicable to the Company during the year ended December 31, 2022. With respect to
servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(ix), the servicer did not consistently process adjustments to interest rates in accordance with pool asset
documents. 

 We are required to be independent of Key Bank National
Association and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements related to our examination
engagement. 

 Our examination does not provide a legal determination
on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 

 As described in management s assertion, for servicing
criteria 1122 (d)(4)(xi), the Company has engaged a vendor to perform the activities required by this servicing criteria. The Company
has determined that this vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company
has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria applicable to the vendor as permitted
by C DI 200.06. As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to
provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with servicing criteria applicable to
the vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendor
and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s eligibility to
apply C DI 200.06. 

 In our opinion, except for the material noncompliance
described in the third paragraph, the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria, including servicing criteria 1122 (d)(4)(xi)
for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 as described above, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022.

 To the Members of

 We have examined management's assertion, included in the accompanying Management
Report on Assessment of Compliance with SEC Regulation AB Servicing Criteria included on Appendix A, that LNR Partners, LLC (the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation AB for the commercial

(4)(xiv) and (4) (xv) (the servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, which management has determined
are not applicable to the activities performed by the Company with respect to the Platform. Management is responsible for the Company's
compliance with the servicing criteria and its assertion. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assertion about
the Company's compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 

 Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether management's assertion about compliance with the servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all material respects, and, accordingly,
included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance with the servicing criteria, including tests on a sample
basis of the servicing activities related to the Platform, determining whether the Company performed those selected activities in compliance
with the servicing criteria during the specified period, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
Our procedures were limited to selected servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report and, accordingly,
such samples may not have included servicing activities related to each asset-backed transaction included in the Platform. Further, an
examination is not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to the period specified above that
may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that
the evidence we obtained in our examination is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

 As described in management's assertion, for servicing criteria Item 1122(d)(2)(vii),
the Company has engaged a vendor to perform certain activities required by this servicing criteria. The Company has determined that this
vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility
for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to this vendor as permitted by the SEC's Compliance and Disclosure
Interpretation 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06 ). As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Company has
asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor's activities comply in
all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to this vendor. The 

Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements
to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendor and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect
to the Company's determination of its eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 

 Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company's
compliance with the servicing criteria. 

 In our opinion, management's assertion that the Company complied with the
aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, for the commercial mortgage-backed securities Platform
is fairly stated, in all material respects.

engagement.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

Board of Directors 
Berkadia Commercial Mortgage, LLC 

We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying
Management s Report on Assessment of Compliance with SEC Regulation AB Servicing Criteria Management s Report ),
that Berkadia Commercial Mortgage, LLC (the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the Master Servicing of Commercial Mortgage Loans within Public Securitizations
(the Master Servicing Platform or the Platform as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, excluding
criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(C), 1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(vii), and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which management has determined are not
applicable to the activities performed by the Company with respect to the Platform. The Platform consists of the publicly issues asset-backed
transactions and securities for which the Company is named the master servicer of commercial mortgage loans. Management is responsible
for the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s
assertion about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria for the Platform based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance
with the applicable servicing criteria for the Platform and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
Our examination included testing selected asset-backed transactions and securities constituting the Platform and evaluating whether the
Company performed servicing activities related to those transactions and securities in compliance with the applicable servicing criteria
for the period covered by this report. Accordingly, our testing may not have included servicing activities related to each asset-backed
transaction or security constituting the Platform. Further, our examination was not designed to detect material noncompliance that may
have occurred prior to the period covered by this report and that may have affected the Company s servicing activities during the
period covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide
a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. 

We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance
with relevant ethical requirements relating to the engagement. 

As described in Management s Report, the Company engaged various
vendors to perform servicing activities with respect to criteria 1122(d)(2)(i), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(4)(i), and 1122(d)(4)(xi) through
1122(d)(4)(xiii). The Company determined that each vendor is not considered a servicer, as that term is defined in Item
1101(j) of Regulation AB, and therefore, the Company is assuming responsibility for compliance with such servicing criteria applicable
to each vendor s servicing activities. In accordance with Regulation AB and its related interpretations, the requirement for management
to assess compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to a vendor s activities is satisfied if the Company has instituted
policies and procedures to monitor whether such vendor s activities comply in all material respects with such criteria. Compliance
with the applicable servicing criteria is achieved if those policies and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that
such vendor s activities comply with such criteria and those policies and procedures are operating effectively for the period covered
by Management s Report. Our examination does not provide a legal determination of whether a vendor is or is not considered a servicer,
and therefore, on whether the Company, in its Management Report, is eligible to elect to take responsibility for assessing compliance
with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor s servicing activities. 

 In our opinion, management s assertion that Berkadia Commercial
Mortgage LLC complied with the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 for the Master
Servicing Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.

Our examination included testing selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing selected servicing
activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected
activities in compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing
activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors
may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by
the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe that our examination
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance
with the Servicing Criteria. 

 We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to the examination engagement.

with Applicable Servicing Criteria, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(vi), and for certain activities related to 1122(d)(4)(xi),
and 1122(d)(4)(xii), the Company has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria. The Company
has determined that none of these vendors is considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the
Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted

200.06). As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable
assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The
Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendors and related
servicing criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s eligibility to apply
