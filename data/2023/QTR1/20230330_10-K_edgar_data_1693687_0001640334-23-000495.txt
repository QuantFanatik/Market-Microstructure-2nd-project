BUSINESS. Background Corporate History and General Information MS Young Adventure Enterprise, Inc.

The Company engages in consulting services. On November 13, 2017, the Company changed of the Company s name to AllyMe Holding Inc. On August 6, 2019, the Company changed the Company s name to MS Young Adventure Enterprise, Inc. In May 2018, the Company implemented a change in control by electing a new officer and director and accepting the resignations of its then existing officer and director and whereby the then majority shareholder of the Company, Zilin Wang, sold his common stock shares in the Company to Chunxia Jiang. On March 10, 2021, Chunxia Jiang entered into a stock purchase agreement for the sale of 6,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company to Pearl Digital International Limited, an accredited investor, and resigned from all executive officer positions with the Company, including Chief Executive Officer and President, and as a member of the Board.

Risks and Uncertainties facing the Company As an early-stage company, the Company expects to experience losses in the near term. The Company needs to generate revenue or locate additional financing in order to continue its developmental plans. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to identify sufficient numbers of customers to generate enough revenues to continue operations. One of the biggest challenges facing the Company will be in securing adequate capital to fund to keep operation, including securing adequate capital to pay for operations and hiring service providers. Secondarily, a major challenge will be implementing effective sales and marketing strategies to reach the intended end customers. The Company has considered and devised its initial sales, marketing and advertising strategy; however, the Company will need to skillfully implement this strategy in order to achieve success in its business. 4 Table of Contents In December 2019, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) originated in Wuhan, China, and has since spread to a number of other countries, including the United States.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The following discussions are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Going Concern Considerations The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, which contemplate continuation of our Company as a going concern. We currently have no revenues, have incurred net losses, and have an accumulated deficit of 432,084 as of December 31, 2022. The continuation of our Company as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise equity or debt financing, and the attainment of profitable operations from our encryption services. There are no assurances that we will be successful in obtaining sufficient capital to continue as a going concern. If our working capital needs are not met and we are unable to obtain adequate capital, we could be forced to cease operations. Use of Estimates and Assumptions The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 7 Table of Contents Recently Issued Accounting Standards The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position and result of operations. Trends and Uncertainties Demand for our products is dependent on general economic conditions, which are cyclical in nature. Because a major portion of our activities are the receipt of revenues from our services and products, our business operations may be adversely affected by competitors and prolonged recessionary periods. There are no other known trends, events or uncertainties that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on our short-term or long-term liquidity. Sources of liquidity will come from the sale of our products and services. There are no material commitments for capital expenditure at this time. There are no trends, events or uncertainties that have had or are reasonably expected to have a material impact on the net sales or revenues or income from continuing operations. There are no significant elements of income or loss that do not arise from the registrant s continuing operations. There are no other known causes for any material changes from period to period in one or more line items of our financial statements. Impact of COVID-19 During the year 2020, the effects of a new coronavirus COVID-19 and related actions to attempt to control its spread began to impact our business. The impact of COVID-19 on our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2022 was limited, in all material respects, due to the government mandated numerous measures, including closures of businesses, limitations on movements of individuals and goods, and the imposition of other restrictive measures, in its efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 within the country. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization designated COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Governments around the world have mandated, and continue to introduce, orders to slow the transmission of the virus, including but not limited to shelter-in-place orders, quarantines, significant restrictions on travel, as well as work restrictions that prohibit many employees from going to work. Uncertainty with respect to the economic effects of the pandemic has introduced significant volatility in the financial markets.

Seasonality Our operating results are not affected by seasonality. Inflation Our business and operating results are not affected in any material way by inflation. Critical Accounting Policies The Securities and Exchange Commission issued Financial Reporting Release No. 60, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies suggesting that companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on their most critical accounting policies. In Financial Reporting Release No. 60, the Securities and Exchange Commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and operating results and require management to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. The nature of our business generally does not call for the preparation or use of estimates. I TEM 7A.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Substantial Doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company s minimal activities raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.

The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

These factors among others raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations and/or obtaining additional financing from its members or other sources, as may be required. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Management believes that the current actions to obtain additional funding and implement its strategic plans provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. There are no assurances that additional funds will be available when needed from any source or, if available, will be available on terms that are acceptable to us.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedure include, without limitations, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In accordance with Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, an evaluation was completed by the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on that evaluation, the Company s sole officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in providing reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act was recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that: Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. 12 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2022, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on that evaluation, they concluded that, during the period covered by this report, such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP rules as more fully described below. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses. The matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and (3) ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our management in connection with the review of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2012. Management believes that the material weaknesses set forth in items (2) and (3) above did not have an effect on our financial results. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods. This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only the management s report in this annual report. Management s Remediation Initiatives Given the financial resources available to the Company, the Company is not in a position to institute any realistic remediation of the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls. As such time as the Company commences operations and has no financial resources to address and eliminate the identified weaknesses, we intend to take action to do so. Unfortunately, until the Company has such financial resources, the identified weaknesses will continue to exist. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting . During the last quarter of the Company s fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, there were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls . A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected. ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION None 13 Table of Contents PART III. ITEM 10. DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Set forth below is the name of our sole director and executive officer and all positions and offices that he held with us, the period during which he has served as such, and his business experience during at least the last five years. Name Positions Held Fu Yong Nan Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary, and Sole Director since March 10, 2021 Fu Yong Nan. Fu Yong Nan has been the Senior Vice-President Finance of Guangxi Sanhuan Enterprise Group Holding Co., Ltd. since June 2013. Mr. Fu earned a Bachelor of Science in Financial Management from Guangxi University of Science and Technology in 1990, and a Master s Degree in Banking and Finance from Guangxi University in 1993. Fu Yong Nan devotes approximately 25 of his business time to the affairs of the Company. The time Mr. Fu Yong Nan spends on the business affairs of the Company varies from week to week and is based upon the needs and requirements of the Company. Audit Committee and Audit Committee Financial Expert We do not currently have an audit committee financial expert, nor do we have an audit committee. Our entire board of directors, which currently consists of Mr. Fu Yong Nan, handles the functions that would otherwise be handled by an audit committee. We do not currently have the capital resources to pay director fees to a qualified independent expert who would be willing to serve on our board and who would be willing to act as an audit committee financial expert. As our business expands and as we appoint others to our board of directors, we expect that we will seek a qualified independent expert to become a member of our board of directors. Before retaining any such expert our board would make a determination as to whether such person is independent. Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance. Section 16(a) of the Securities Act of 1934 requires the Company s officers and directors, and greater than 10 stockholders, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership of its securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Copies of the reports are required by SEC regulation to be furnished to the Company. Based on management s review of these reports during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 all reports required to be filed were filed on a timely basis. Code of Ethics Our board of directors has adopted a code of ethics that our officers, directors and any person who may perform similar functions are subject to. Currently Mr. Fu Yong Nan is our only officer and our sole director, therefore, he is the only person subject to the Code of Ethics. If we retain additional officers in the future to act as our principal financial officer, principal accounting officer, controller or persons serving similar functions, they would become subject to the Code of Ethics. The Code of Ethics does not indicate the consequences of a breach of the code. If there is a breach, the board of directors would review the facts and circumstances surrounding the breach and take action that it deems appropriate, which action may include dismissal of the employee who breached the code. Currently, since Mr. Fu Yong Nan serves as the sole director and sole officer, he is responsible for reviewing his own conduct under the Code of Ethics and determining what action to take in the event of his own breach of the Code of Ethics. ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION. No past officer or director of the Company has received any compensation and none is due or payable. Our sole current officer and director, Fu Yong Nan, does not receive any compensation for the services he renders to the Company, has not received compensation in the past, and is not accruing any compensation pursuant to any agreement with the Company. We currently have no formal written salary arrangement with our sole officer. Mr. Fu Yong Nan may receive a salary or other compensation for services that he provides to the Company in the future. No retirement, pension, profit sharing, stock option or insurance programs or other similar programs have been adopted by the Company for the benefit of the Company s employees. 14 Table of Contents ITEM 12.

Certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares outstanding is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person (and only such person) by reason of these acquisition rights. As a result, the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as shown in this table does not necessarily reflect the person s actual ownership or voting power with respect to the number of shares of common stock actually outstanding on March 20, 2023. As of March 20, 2023, there were 6,731,667 shares of our Company s common stock issued and outstanding. ITEM 13.
