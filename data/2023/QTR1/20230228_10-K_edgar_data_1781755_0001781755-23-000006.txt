PART I 
 
 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 The Company 
 BRP Group, Inc. BRP Group, the Company, we, us or our is an independent insurance distribution firm delivering tailored insurance and risk management insights and solutions that give our Clients the peace of mind to pursue their purpose, passion and dreams. We support our Clients, Colleagues, Insurance Company Partners and communities through the deployment of vanguard resources, technology and capital to drive both organic and inorganic growth. When we consistently execute for these key stakeholders, we believe that the outcome is an increase in value for our fifth stakeholder, our shareholders. We are innovating the industry by taking a holistic and tailored approach to risk management, insurance and employee benefits. Our growth plan includes continuing to recruit, train and develop industry leading talent, continuing to add geographic representation, insurance product expertise and end-client industry expertise via our Partnership strategy, and continuing to build out our MGA of the Future platform, which delivers proprietary, technology-enabled insurance solutions to our internal Risk Advisors as well as to a growing channel of external distribution partners. We are a destination employer supported by an award-winning culture, powered by exceptional people and fueled by industry-leading growth and innovation. 
 We represent over 1.2 million Clients across the United States and internationally. Our more than 3,800 Colleagues include over 700 Risk Advisors, who are fiercely independent, relentlessly competitive and insurance geeks. We have approximately 125 offices in 23 states, all of which are equipped to provide diversified products and services to empower our Clients at every stage through our four Operating Groups. 
 In 2011, we adopted the Azimuth as our corporate constitution. Named after a historical navigation tool used to find true north, the Azimuth asserts our core values, business basics and stakeholder promises. The ideals encompassed by the Azimuth support our mission to deliver indispensable, tailored insurance and risk management insights and solutions to our Clients. We strive to be regarded as the preeminent insurance advisory firm fueled by relationships, powered by people and exemplified by client adoption and loyalty. This type of environment is upheld by the distinct vernacular we use to describe our services and culture. We are a firm, instead of an agency; we have Colleagues, instead of employees; and we have Risk Advisors, instead of producers/agents. We serve Clients instead of customers and we refer to our strategic acquisitions as Partnerships. We refer to insurance brokerages that we have acquired, or in the case of asset acquisitions, the producers, as Partners. 
 Industry 
 Our core products include commercial property and casualty insurance, employee benefits insurance, personal lines insurance, wealth management and retirement services, and Medicare. As a distributor of these products, we compete on the basis of reputation, client service, industry insights and know-how, product offerings, ability to tailor our services to the specific needs of a Client and, to a lesser extent, price of our services. In the United States, our industry is comprised of large, global participants, such as those described in the section titled Competition below. The remainder of our industry is highly fragmented and comprised of over 30,000 regional and community participants that vary significantly in size and scope. 
 In recent years, there has been notable merger and acquisition activity in the insurance brokerage space. Despite the recent consolidation in the insurance brokerage industry, the industry remains highly fragmented, and the number of independent agencies has remained roughly constant since 2006. The fragmented industry landscape presents us with the opportunity to continue acquiring high-quality Partners. 
 Commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds and normally follow premium levels. Insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions. Various factors, including competition for market share among underwriting enterprises, increased underwriting capacity and improved economies of scale following consolidations, can result in flat or reduced property/casualty premium rates (a soft market). A soft market tends to put downward pressure on commission revenues. Various countervailing factors, such as greater than anticipated loss experience, unexpected loss exposure and capital shortages, can result in increasing property/casualty premium rates (a hard market). A hard market tends to favorably impact commission revenues. Hard and soft markets may be broad-based or more narrowly focused across individual product lines or geographic areas. As markets harden, buyers of insurance (such as our brokerage Clients), have historically tried to mitigate premium increases and the higher commissions these premiums generate, including by raising their deductibles and/or reducing the overall amount of insurance coverage they purchase. As the market softens, or costs decrease, these trends have historically reversed. During a hard market, buyers may switch to negotiated fee in lieu of commission arrangements to compensate us for placing their risks, or may consider the alternative insurance market, which includes self-insurance, captives, rent-a-captives, risk retention groups and capital market solutions to transfer risk.

Commercial Property and Casualty Industry 
 Commercial property and casualty brokers provide businesses with access to property, professional liability, workers compensation, management liability, commercial auto insurance products as well as risk-management services. In addition to negotiating competitive policy terms on behalf of clients, insurance brokers also serve as a distribution channel for insurers and often perform much of the administrative functions. Insurance brokers generate revenues through commissions, calculated as a percentage of total insurance premium, and through fees for management and consulting services. We have relationships with leading commercial writers, as well as regional insurers who have a presence in our target markets. We conduct commercial property and casualty business within our Middle Market, MainStreet and Specialty Operating Groups, which includes manufacturing our own proprietary products within our MGA of the Future platform. Current products include commercial umbrella and management liability, with several additional commercial lines products in our existing product pipeline. 
 Employee Benefits Industry 
 Employee benefit advisors provide businesses and their employees with access to individual and group medical, dental, life and disability coverage. In addition to functioning as distributors, employee benefits brokers also provide assistance with benefit plan design. Employee benefits brokers capabilities often enable middle-market businesses to fully outsource their employee benefits program design, management and administration without committing internal resources or investing substantial capital in systems. Employee benefit advisors generate revenues through commissions and fees for management and consulting services. In recent years, as a result of the Affordable Care Act ACA ), healthcare has become increasingly more complex, and the demand has grown for sophisticated employee benefits consultants. We expect this trend to continue and believe we remain well positioned as a result of our consistent investment in our employee benefits capabilities. We conduct employee benefits business within our Middle Market and MainStreet Operating Groups. 
 Personal Lines Industry 
 Personal lines brokers provide individual consumers with access to home, auto, umbrella and recreational insurance products. Similar to commercial lines agents, personal lines insurance agents generate revenues through commissions and fees for management and consulting services. In addition to negotiating competitive policy terms on behalf of clients, insurance brokers also serve as a distribution channel for insurers and often perform much of the administrative functions. We conduct personal lines business within our Middle Market (high net worth), MainStreet and Specialty Operating Groups. We believe that embedded distribution will play a meaningful role in the future of personal lines to that end, we have made deep investments in technology to enable our long-term vision of creating a one-stop, digital distribution platform for advisors, consumers and businesses alike. We believe our retail agency model, embedded technology, national distribution capabilities and ability to build proprietary products in our MGA of the Future platform uniquely position us to execute on this strategy. 
 Wealth Management and Retirement Services 
 Wealth management and retirement services is comprised of financial solutions for small and mid-sized businesses and certain individuals. Our specialties include risk management, employee benefits, and retirement plan consulting. We advise on corporate retirement plans and executive benefits focused on employee retention and engagement. We also provide comprehensive financial planning and wealth management services to high net worth individuals and families. Wealth management services can include investment advisory services, tax and financial planning, and other services. 
 Medicare Industry 
 In the U.S., Medicare provides health insurance to retirees, who by definition lack coverage via an employer sponsored healthcare program. U.S. citizens typically become eligible for Medicare upon turning 65 years old. The Medicare market is split between the Original Medicare Plan, a fee-for-service plan managed by the federal government which represents approximately two-thirds of the market, and Medicare Advantage, a rapidly growing private Medicare option representing approximately one-third of the market. Medicare advisors assist in determining optimal coverage and healthcare/doctor access based on an individual s healthcare needs and spending limitations. 
 6 

Business Strategy 
 Relative to our industry peers, we believe our business strategy is uniquely focused on investing aggressively in the growth of our business, which we believe over time produces better and more sustainable results for all of our stakeholders, including our Clients, Colleagues, Insurance Company Partners, the communities in which we work, live and play, and our Shareholders. For our Clients, our growth affords us the ability to provide better advice and an expanded and more cost effective suite of insurance solutions. For our Colleagues, our growth provides expanded career and development opportunities. For our Insurance Company Partners, our growth facilitates expanded access to a more diversified universe of clients and more distributed pools of risk. For our Communities, our growth facilitates enhanced economic contribution, and the ability of our Colleagues to make charitable impacts. And for our Shareholders, while we believe our business will naturally accrete margin over time, we believe that more robust top-line growth, at the expense of near-term margin, generates more free cash flow over a relatively finite period of time. 
 We have taken, and will continue to take, a two-pronged approach to growing our business, which includes investing meaningfully into our existing businesses to drive organic growth, and to drive inorganic growth via our Partnership strategy. 
 Over time, our organic growth will be driven primarily by our ability to continue to add new Clients and win new business, our ability to offer and advise on a broader array of insurance solutions in an increasingly larger geographic footprint, and to capture an increasingly larger portion of the economics associated with the sale of insurance. To achieve this, we have invested heavily in our sales leadership infrastructure and recruitment of sales talent, technology talent and solutions to deliver better, faster and more efficient insurance insights and solutions to our Advisors and Clients, and in our MGA of the Future platform, which will continue to deliver proprietary and technology-enabled insurance solutions that provide our Advisors and select external distribution partners speed, ease of use, and certainty of execution, while also delivering BRP an enhanced share of the economics associated with the underlying insurance transaction. Factors contributing to our organic growth include net new business growth, fees, rate increases, retention, exposure unit growth, and contingent commissions. Contributions to organic revenue growth from recent Partnerships begins after BRP has owned the Partner firm for 12 months. 
 Our Partnership strategy has contributed meaningful inorganic growth to BRP. In 2023, we anticipate very little Partnership activity. Looking forward to 2024 and beyond, we will continue to identify attractive investment opportunities. As a result, while we anticipate that Partnerships will continue to contribute to our overall growth, we expect them to be more episodic in nature. Adding new Partners significantly aids our ability to bolster our geographic footprint, product expertise, and end-Client industry expertise, while adding incremental industry-leading talent to our organization. We are uniquely focused on the industry s best and fastest growing independent firms, and we believe we offer a truly differentiated value proposition to prospective Partners relative to our more mature and/or private equity-backed peers, which includes retained business decision-making autonomy, leadership opportunities for new Partners and an environment focused on entrepreneurialism and the continued growth of our Partners businesses. We believe our recent success attracting high quality Partners has validated our differentiated value proposition we have consummated Partnerships with 35 firms since the beginning of 2020, for a total of 538.7 million of Acquired Revenue, which includes eight Top 100 firms since 2020, more than any other peer in our industry. It is important to note that we also have a highly systematic and regimented integration process for all new Partners, supported by our fully dedicated integration team, the Navigators, which balances ensuring proper operational, financial and accounting, and technology and cybersecurity controls with business decision making autonomy and impact on new Colleagues. 
 The financial impact of Partnerships may affect the comparability of our results from period to period. We completed three Partnerships for an aggregate purchase price of 413.8 million during 2022, which added 4.4 million of premiums, commissions and fees receivable, 223.7 million of intangible assets and 187.8 million of goodwill to the consolidated balance sheet. 
 We continue to make the investments designed to better service our Clients and establish a competitive advantage in the industry. Ongoing investments to date include, but are not limited to, continued buildout of our MGA of the Future platform, continued buildout of our tech-enabled homeowners efforts (both in the MGA of the Future and in our MainStreet business), numerous enterprise-wide technology initiatives, pursuing potential alternative capacity, and continued hiring of Risk Advisors and sales leadership infrastructure in our Middle Market and MainStreet Operating Groups. 
 7 

Operating Groups 
 Our business is divided into four Operating Groups: Middle Market, Specialty, MainStreet and Medicare. 
 We earn commissions and fees by facilitating the arrangement between Insurance Company Partners and individuals or businesses for the Insurance Company Partners to provide insurance to the Client. Our commissions and fees are usually a percentage of the premium paid by the Client and generally depends on the type of insurance, the particular Insurance Company Partner and the nature of the services provided. Under certain arrangements with Clients, we earn pre-negotiated service fees in lieu of commissions. Additionally, we may also receive from Insurance Company Partners a profit-sharing commission, or straight override, which represents a form of variable consideration associated with the placement of coverage that is based primarily on underwriting results, but may also contain considerations for volume, growth or retention. 
 The Middle Market Operating Group provides expertly-designed commercial risk management, employee benefits solutions and private risk management for mid-to-large-size businesses and high net worth individuals, as well as their families. We are privileged to have partnered with some of the best independent agencies in the country, each of which has brought strategic capabilities and expertise. We have been intentional in recognizing and elevating this talent across the organization to build out world class industry-focused practice groups and product centers of excellence that can be leveraged by the firm as a whole. 
 The Specialty Operating Group consists of two distinct businesses our specialty wholesale broker businesses, which deliver specialty insurers, professionals, individuals and niche industry businesses expanded access to exclusive specialty markets, capabilities and programs requiring complex underwriting and placement, and our MGA of the Future platform (representing approximately 87 of Specialty's revenue during 2022), in which we manufacture proprietary, technology-enabled insurance products that are then distributed (in many instances via technology and/or application programming interface API integrations) internally via our Risk Advisors in Middle Market and MainStreet and externally via select distribution partners, with a focus on sheltered channels where our products deliver speed, ease of use and certainty of execution, an example of which is our national embedded renters insurance product sold at point of lease via integrations with property management software providers. As a prominent growth driver for BRP, we have invested heavily in the expansion of our MGA of the Future product suite, which is now comprised of more than 12 products across both commercial and personal lines. 
 The MainStreet Operating Group offers personal insurance, commercial insurance, and life and health solutions to individuals and businesses in their communities, with a focus on accessing clients via sheltered distribution channels, which include, but are not limited to, new home builders, realtors, mortgage originators/lenders, master planned communities, and various other community centers of influence. We have invested deeply in talent, technology and capabilities across our MainStreet Operating Group, which includes our acquisition of Westwood, a national expansion of our distribution footprint, and enhanced digital capabilities focused on meaningfully improving the advisor and client experience. 
 The Medicare Operating Group offers consultation for government assistance programs and solutions, including traditional Medicare, Medicare Advantage and Affordable Care Act, to seniors and eligible individuals, through a network of primarily independent contractor agents. In the Medicare Operating Group, BRP generates commissions and fees in the form of direct bill insurance placement and marketing income. Marketing income is earned through co-branded marketing campaigns with our Insurance Company Partners. 
 Competition 
 The business of providing insurance products and services is highly competitive. We compete for Clients on the basis of reputation, client service, program and product offerings, and our ability to tailor products and services to meet the specific needs of a Client. We actively compete with numerous integrated financial services organizations as well as insurance companies and brokers, producer groups, individual insurance agents, investment management firms, independent financial planners and broker-dealers, including large, global participants, such as Aon plc, Marsh McLennan Companies, Inc. and Willis Towers Watson plc and mid-sized participants, such as Arthur J. Gallagher Co., AssuredPartners, Inc., Brown Brown Inc., Hub International Limited and USI, Inc. In various parts of our business (mainly in our MGA of the Future and MainStreet businesses), we compete with smaller Insurtech participants such as Lemonade, Inc., Goosehead Insurance, Inc. and Hippo Holdings, Inc. 
 Clients 
 Our Clients are highly diversified and include individuals, professionals, businesses, including those in niche industries, and specialty insurers. No material part of our business depends upon a single Client or on a few Clients. The loss of any one Client would not have a material adverse effect on our operations. In 2022, our largest single Client represented less than 1 of our total revenues. 
 8 

Human Capital 
 BRP is an independent Colleague-centric insurance advisory firm fueled by relationships, powered by people, and exemplified by our Colleagues ability to deliver tailored insurance and risk management insights and solutions to our Clients. Our success continues to be driven by our greatest asset, our talented team of Colleagues, each of which plays a crucial role in helping us achieve our firm goals. We attract Colleagues who share our passion for nurturing relationships and focusing on service, and who are inspired by the core values outlined in our cultural guide, The Azimuth. 
 Powered by People 
 As of December 31, 2022, BRP had more than 3,800 Colleagues, the vast majority of whom are full-time. There were 3,802 full-time Colleagues (98 of total Colleague population) and 86 part-time Colleagues. The firm also partners with over 4,400 independent contracted agents, primarily supporting our Medicare business. 
 BRP is a place for Colleagues to build a career, not just have a job, and we believe every Colleague should feel a sense of ownership in the firm. To promote that connection, we grant all newly-hired BRP Colleagues shares of BRP Group common stock. 
 We highly value the powerful and innovative results that come from seeking and weighing a broad range of perspectives and we strive to hire and promote talent that brings wide ranging diversity of thought, background, and experience. 
 Approximately 62 of our executive leadership team joined BRP from other industries, bringing unique background and thoughtful insight on our continued best path to success. 
 As of December 31, 2022, women comprise 59 of our Colleague population and 48 of our leadership positions are held by women. 
 We benefit from a wide age range and experience level within the firm. We have a robust mix of entry-level and post-college Colleagues. This balanced representation fosters our talent strategy of providing great mentoring and learning opportunities for our developing Colleagues. 
 Our talent acquisition team continues to proactively source and contact underrepresented candidates as part of our recruiting process for open roles. 
 In the midst of a challenging labor market due in part to the impact of COVID-19 and the so-called great resignation, we did not institute any layoffs or furloughs or make any reductions to pay or benefits to Colleagues during 2022. To the contrary, our BRP workforce continued to grow during 2022 as evidenced by more than 1,500 organic new hires and adding over 200 new Colleagues via Partnerships. We have also continued to maintain a relatively high annual retention rate, which was in excess of 80 for 2022. Our commitment to rewarding our Colleagues is evidenced by merit increases and bonuses we have continued to pay each year. 
 BRP continues to make additional investments in ensuring we remain competitive in attracting top talent and all Colleagues are paid at least 15.00 per hour. We re proud to be an employer leading by example when it comes to living wages. 
 Culture and Belonging 
 Part of being better together means we operate with transparency and strive to make it easy for others to know us and trust us by striving to always do the right thing in an open and authentic way. We actively seek out our Colleagues input through our formal and anonymous PULSE survey, asking for feedback on a variety of topics including career path opportunities, trust in team and leadership, and feeling valued. The results of this annual pulse check are always shared with Colleagues and leadership so thoughtful and meaningful improvements can be made to enhance engagement. 
 Another way we aim to create a sense of belonging for our Colleagues is by striving to be a destination employer. We are continuously recognized for our people-first approach, our commitment to a culture of continuous learning, and for providing a place where our Colleagues learn, grow, and thrive. 
 BRP continued to be Great Place to Work-Certified and was ranked as a Fortune Best Workplaces in Financial Services and Insurance in 2022. 
 We were also recognized by Top Workplaces USA as a 2022 nationally recognized employer for making the world a better place to work by prioritizing a people-centered culture and giving employees a voice.

We have a variety of ways we promote our culture, support our communities, and take care of each other within the BRP family. 
 We sponsor a Colleagues In Action program that supports charities, events, and causes that are important and meaningful to our Colleagues. 
 We promote our Colleagues actively participating in community outreach by providing three days of Community Service PTO. 
 AHT Insurance's International Aid and Development Practice is enabling International Development Organizations and Non-Governmental Organizations to operate safely and securely, to help the most vulnerable communities in some of the highest risk communities in the world. 
 To help any qualifying Colleague experiencing extraordinary hardship, we set up the BRP True North Colleague Fund (operated by America s Charities, a 501(c)(3) non-profit), to which Colleagues can also contribute by making a donation. BRP has pledged up to 250,000 to the fund and is honored to provide an additional dollar-for-dollar match for Colleague contributions up to another 250,000. 
 We believe in having fun at work and celebrating our successes by promoting peer recognition at all levels of the firm through our Give a Wow compliment program. 
 In 2022, our Colleagues were given the gift of giving wherein BRP made donations to six separate organizations on behalf of over 1,300 participants. 
 Nurture and Grow Talent 
 We care about our Colleagues and their families from a holistic perspective and genuinely believe that taking great care of our Colleagues allows them to live their best life. We offer comprehensive benefits such as health care and retirement savings through an employer-match 401(k) plan, along with a variety of other personalized benefits valued by our Colleagues, such as: 
 Summertime Friday half-days; 
 Employee assistance program services, including mental health; 
 Telemedicine benefits at no cost for Colleagues and their direct family members; 
 Expert referral services in legal and financial assistance; 
 Company sponsored BRP Vitality Wellness Program, including a partnership with Peerfit to provide customizable fitness benefits for Colleagues; 
 Health Savings Account with 600+ employer contribution; 
 Adoption assistance program; 
 Paid leave for new parents; and 
 Paid sick days and expanded holidays for 2022, including Juneteenth. 
 To support the ongoing growth and development of our Colleagues, we provide education and training on a variety of topics, including technical, professional, and business development, leadership development, client service experience, regulatory and compliance topics. 
 During 2022, we began development of the Azimuth Institute, which encompasses all things learning and development with BRP culture at the core of the training. We anticipate this being a three-to-five-year project in which all client facing roles will have fully-developed training programs that address job skills, system training, insurance acumen, soft skills and leadership training for leaders. 
 In partnership with The Institutes, we launched the Professional Risk Consultant PRC designation course in February 2023. We anticipate putting approximately 100 BRP Colleagues through this course in fiscal year 2023. 
 10 

In February 2023, we launched our inaugural The Azimuth Institute s North Star Program, which provides an innovative learning journey designed for newly hired, high-potential young professionals to equip them with the skills, knowledge, and behaviors needed to ensure continued success in their careers. The first cohort will consist of a four-month comprehensive training program that takes commercial analysts through the core elements of policy coverage and the workflows necessary to process those in our agency management system. This training will be followed by six months of insurance acumen in the PRC designation program mentioned above. Following completion of the program, participants will have a deeper understanding of the what, the how, and the why behind the core skills and behaviors needed to thrive in their new roles. 
 We offer a catalog of more than 650 training courses, all designed to support individual growth and development. Examples of topics include Emotional Intelligence, Managing Conflict, and Feedback Essentials. In addition to the homegrown content mentioned above, we have contracted with LinkedIn Learning to access more than 9,000 soft skill courses across a broad array of topics that open up a whole new world of learning for our Colleagues. 
 In July 2022, we conducted our annual BRP Leadership Retreat by hosting a three-day training event where over 200 leaders (director level and above) participated in interactive leadership development sessions. 
 For new and developing Risk Advisors, we offer a 10-week intensive training course, SCORE, which is a combination of online, instructor-led and real-life application training aimed at developing their skills so they can be their best in providing exceptional service to our Clients. 
 We also support the continuing education and certification needs of our Colleagues by providing access to a variety of technical training courses. Examples of content include Cyber Risk Fundamentals, Professional Liability and Commercial Property. 
 We also promote Colleague growth and development through an ongoing performance feedback model, including 90-day check-ins for new Colleagues, and a formal annual year-end review process for all Colleagues. Our performance feedback processes enable every Colleague to have clear alignment with how we execute on our goals, maximize their performance potential, and also drive their own development and growth through individual development plans. 
 Cultivating an Ethical Environment for our Colleagues and Clients 
 We take very seriously our responsibility to operate with the highest level of integrity and foster an ethical environment for both our Colleagues and Clients. We have established numerous policies and procedures outlining our intention to live our values and do business in a responsible and ethical manner, including providing avenues for asking questions or reporting concerns about non-compliance. Many of these can be found publicly on our company website at baldwinriskpartners.com. Documented policies and procedures include, but are not limited to: 
 The Azimuth (our cultural and corporate constitution, available on our Company website); 
 Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (available in the Governance section of our Investor Relations website); 
 Whistleblower Policy, which governs reporting of concern related to accounting, auditing and ethical violations (available in the Governance section of our Investor Relations website); 
 Statement of Policy Concerning Trading in Company Securities, which prohibits Colleagues from trading BRP Group securities while in possession of Material Non-Public Information (available in the Governance section of our Investor Relations website); 
 Privacy Policy, which governs how we handle personal client information in a responsible manner (available at the bottom of our Company homepage); 
 Transparency Disclosure Statement, which sets forth our commitment to fair dealings with our Clients (available at the bottom of our Company homepage); and 
 Anti-Corruption and Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA Policy, which defines our commitment to adhere to the FCPA and avoid corrupt business practices.

Seasonality 
 The insurance brokerage market is seasonal and our results of operations are somewhat affected by seasonal trends. Our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margins are typically highest in the first quarter and lowest in the fourth quarter. This variation is primarily due to fluctuations in our revenues, while overhead remains consistent throughout the year. Our revenues are generally highest in the first quarter due to a higher degree of first quarter policy commencements and renewals in Medicare and certain Middle Market lines of business such as employee benefits and commercial. In addition, a higher proportion of our first quarter revenue is derived from our highest margin businesses. 
 Partnerships can significantly impact Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margins in a given year and may increase the amount of seasonality within the business, especially results attributable to Partnerships that have not been fully integrated into our business or owned by us for a full year. 
 Regulation 
 Our activities in connection with insurance brokerage services are subject to regulation and supervision by state regulatory authorities. State insurance laws are often complex and generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities in adopting regulations and supervising regulated activities, which generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents, intermediaries and third-party administrators. Our continuing ability to provide insurance brokerage in the states in which we currently operate is dependent upon our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the regulatory authorities in each of these states. 
 The health insurance industry is heavily regulated by the ACA, Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services CMS and state jurisdictions. Each jurisdiction has its own rules and regulations relating to the offer and sale of health insurance plans, typically administered by a department of insurance, department of financial services, or similar regulatory authority. We are required to maintain valid life or health agency or agent licenses in each jurisdiction in which we transact health insurance business. 
 Regulations and guidelines issued by CMS place a number of requirements on health insurance carriers and agents and brokers in connection with the marketing and sale of Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. We are subject to similar requirements of state insurance departments with respect to our marketing and sale of Medicare Supplement plans. CMS and state insurance department regulations and guidelines include a number of prohibitions regarding the ability to contact Medicare-eligible individuals and place many restrictions on the marketing of Medicare-related plans. In addition, the laws and regulations applicable to the marketing and sale of Medicare-related plans are ambiguous, complex and, particularly with respect to regulations and guidance issued by CMS for Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans, change frequently. 
 We are subject to federal law and the laws of many states that require financial institutions to protect the security and confidentiality of certain sensitive Client information, notify customers about their policies and practices relating to collection, disclosure and security of certain sensitive Client information. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPAA and regulations adopted pursuant to HIPAA require us to maintain the privacy of protected health information that we collect on behalf of Insurance Company Partners and employer-sponsored health plans, implement measures to safeguard such information and provide notification in the event of certain breaches in the privacy or confidentiality of such information. The use and disclosure of certain data that we collect from consumers is also regulated by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act GLBA and state statutes implementing GLBA, which generally require brokers to provide Clients with notice regarding how their non-public personal health and financial information is used and the opportunity to opt out of certain disclosures before sharing such information with a third party, and which generally require safeguards for the protection of personal information. 
 In addition, our portfolio of companies includes several registered investment advisors RIAs ), each of which are federally registered with the SEC. Our portfolio will also include a limited purpose broker dealer LPBD ), once registered with the SEC, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA ). These areas of our financial services business are also subject to rules formulated by the SEC under both the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the 40 Act and the Exchange Act, as well as by state securities regulators under applicable state law. Through a combination of the SEC, FINRA, the 40 Act and the Exchange Act, our RIAs and the LPBD are heavily regulated in the areas of duties to clients, disclosures, communications, contracting, fee sharing, oversight and audit. 
 As a publicly-traded company, we are required to file certain reports, and are subject to various marketing restrictions, among other requirements, in connection with the Exchange Act and SEC regulations.

Climate Change Risk Management 
 As an insurance distribution firm, our operations do not have a large environmental footprint or significant direct greenhouse gas emissions. However, we recognize the significant challenges that climate change presents, and we are committed to good stewardship of the environment and our resources while managing the impact on our business. 
 Through our strategic planning process and risk management framework, we identify and track a number of ways in which our industry, our Clients, and our operations are being impacted by climate change issues today, or could be impacted by climate change issues in the medium-to-long-term. We take a number of actions to address relevant opportunities and risks. 
 Evolving Client Solutions: Climate-related issues can have an impact on our Clients in a number of ways, including offer relevant risk management guidance. 
 Promoting Client Safety: As a commitment to our Clients safety and well-being, we provide resources and information to help prepare for and protect against severe weather events. 
 Ensuring Operational Continuity: We recognize that workplace emergencies might result from extreme weather events, exacerbated by the impacts of climate change, including hurricanes, floods, tornados, and other natural or environmental disasters. In order to manage workplace emergencies, we have developed and implemented a company-wide Emergency Preparedness Plan, which describes the process by which we respond when a major event threatens to harm our organization, our stakeholders, or the general public. Critical elements of the Plan include assigned responsibilities, relevant operating procedures, crisis communication guidelines, and evacuation and recovery procedures. 
 Our Corporate Structure 
 BRP Group is a holding company and its sole material asset is a controlling ownership and profits interest in BRP. BRP Group has engaged to date only in activities relating to BRP. All of our business is conducted through BRP and its consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates, and the financial results of BRP and its consolidated subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements of BRP Group. 
 BRP is currently taxed as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and, as a result, its members, including BRP Group, pay taxes with respect to their allocable shares of its net taxable income. We expect that redemptions and exchanges of LLC Units will result in increases in the tax basis in our share of the tangible and intangible assets of BRP that otherwise would not have been available. These increases in tax basis may reduce the amount of tax that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future. The Tax Receivable Agreement requires BRP Group to pay 85 of the amount of such cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that we actually realize to BRP s LLC Members that redeem and exchange LLC Units. Furthermore, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will give rise to additional tax benefits and therefore additional payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement itself.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 Summary Risk Factors 
 Some of the factors that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects, include the following: 
 Macroeconomic conditions, political events, other market conditions in the U.S. and around the world and a decline in economic activity could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Volatility or declines in premiums or other adverse trends in the insurance industry may seriously undermine our profitability. 
 Quarterly and annual variations in our commissions that result from the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production may have unexpected effects on our results of operations. 
 Conditions impacting our Insurance Company Partners or other parties with whom we do business may impact us. 
 Competition in our industry is intense and, if we are unable to compete effectively, we may lose Clients and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected. 
 If we are unable to apply technology effectively in driving value for our Clients through technology-based solutions or gain internal efficiencies through the application of technology and related tools, our results of operations, client relationships, growth and compliance programs could be adversely affected. 
 Our inability to retain or hire qualified Colleagues, as well as the loss of any of our executive officers or senior leaders, could negatively impact our reputation and/or ability to retain existing business and generate new business. 
 Damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 The occurrence of natural or man-made disasters, health epidemics and pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and associated governmental responses, could result in declines in business and increases in claims that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Partnerships have been, and may in the future continue to be, important to our growth. We may not be able to successfully identify and acquire Partners or integrate Partners into our company, and we may become subject to certain liabilities assumed or incurred in connection with our Partnerships that could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 We have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility and subjects us to restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to effectively operate our business. 
 Our business had historically been highly concentrated in the Southeastern United States. While we still maintain a concentration in the Southeastern United States, our rapid growth has resulted in our having several regional concentrations of our business, such that adverse economic conditions, natural disasters, loss trends or regulatory changes in one of these regions could adversely affect our financial condition. 
 We derive a significant portion of our commissions and fees from a limited number of our Insurance Company Partners, the loss of which could result in additional expense and loss of market share. 
 We rely on third parties to perform key functions of our business operations, enabling our provision of services to our Clients. These third parties may act in ways that could harm our business. 
 Our corporate culture has contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain this culture, or if we experience a change in management, management philosophy or business strategy, our business may be harmed. 
 Non-compliance with or changes in laws, regulations or licensing requirements applicable to us could restrict our ability to conduct our business and/or could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 14 

Regulations affecting Insurance Company Partners with which we place insurance affect how we conduct our operations. 
 Our business is subject to risks related to legal proceedings, regulatory investigations, and governmental inquiries and actions. 
 E O claims against us, and other incidents, claims, risks, exposures and/or liabilities that require us to make claims against our insurance policies, may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Failure to obtain, maintain, protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights, or allegations that we have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated the intellectual property rights of others, could harm our reputation, ability to compete effectively, business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Improper disclosure of confidential, personal or proprietary information, whether due to human error, misuse of information by Colleagues, contractors, vendors, or third party bad actors, or as a result of cyberattacks or other security incidents with respect to our or our vendors systems, tools, information, processes or services, or failure to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations, orders, industry standards and contractual obligations regarding data privacy, security and/or cybersecurity, could result in regulatory scrutiny, legal and financial liability, reputational harm, lost revenue, and remediation costs, and could have an adverse effect on our business and/or operations. 
 Our business depends on information processing systems. Data breaches or other security incidents with respect to our or our vendors information processing systems may hurt our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We are a holding company with our principal asset being our 53 ownership interest in BRP, and our Pre-IPO LLC Members, whose interest in our business may be different from yours, have approval rights over certain transactions and actions taken by us. 
 In certain circumstances, BRP will be required to make distributions to us and the other holders of LLC Units, and the distributions that BRP will be required to make may be substantial. 
 We will be required to pay BRP s LLC Members and any other persons that become parties to the Tax Receivable Agreement for certain tax benefits we may receive, and the amounts we may pay could be significant. 
 We may issue a substantial amount of our common stock in the future, which could cause dilution to investors and otherwise adversely affect our stock price. 
 Short selling could increase the volatility of our stock price of our Class A Common Stock. 
 Risks Relating to our Business Operations and Industry 
 Macroeconomic conditions, political events, other market conditions in the U.S. and around the world and a decline in economic activity could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Macroeconomic conditions, political events and other market conditions in the U.S. and around the world, including the recent resurgence of inflation and interest rate increases, and the risk that the U.S. economy will decelerate into a recession, affect the financial services industry. These conditions may reduce demand for our services or depress pricing for those services, which could have a material adverse effect on our costs and results of operations. Changes in macroeconomic and political conditions, such as the impact from rising inflation and interest rates could also shift demand to services for which we do not have a competitive advantage, and this could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain. Any changes in U.S. trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, resulting in trade wars, which could affect volume of economic activity in the U.S., including demand for our services. 
 For example, the demand for insurance policies may be depressed by higher levels of inflation. In addition, a significant portion of our operating expenses goes to employee compensation and benefits, which, in addition to other areas of our operating expenses, are sensitive to inflation. To maintain our ability to successfully compete for the best talent, rising inflation rates may require us to provide compensation increases beyond historical increases, which may significantly increase our compensation costs. Consequently, inflation is expected to increase our operating expenses (both compensation and non-compensation related) over time and may adversely impact our results of operating cash flow. 
 15 

Moreover, we have various agreements to lease office space located in 23 states throughout the U.S. and part of such leases contain effective annual rent escalations either fixed or indexed based on a consumer price index or other index. During higher inflationary periods, our rent expenses may increase significantly, which may adversely affect to our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Furthermore, during inflationary periods, interest rates have historically increased, which would have a direct effect on the interest expense in case we decide to refinance our existing long-term borrowings, including the JPM Credit Agreement, or incur in any additional indebtedness. 
 In addition to macroeconomic conditions, political events and other market conditions, other factors such as business commissions and fees, microeconomic conditions, and the volatility and strength of the capital markets, can affect our business and economic environment. The demand for insurance generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and generally falls as such activity decreases, affecting both the commissions and fees generated by our Middle Market, MainStreet, Medicare and Specialty Operating Groups. Downward fluctuations in the year-over-year insurance premiums charged by our Insurance Company Partners to protect against the same risk, referred to in the industry as softening of the insurance market, could adversely affect our business as a significant portion of the earnings are determined as a percentage of premium charged to our Clients. Insolvencies and consolidations associated with an economic downturn could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of Clients by hampering our ability to place insurance business. Also, some of our Clients may experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties in the event of a prolonged deterioration in the economy, or any segment or sub-segment of the economy, which could have an adverse effect on our collectability of receivables. Errors and omissions claims against us, which we refer to as E O claims, may increase in economic downturns, adversely affecting our brokerage business. In addition, other incidents, claims, risks, exposures and/or liabilities that require us to make claims against our own policies of insurance may have a similar effect. Also, the volatility or decline of economic or other market conditions could result in the increased surrender of insurance products or cause individuals to forgo insurance, thereby impacting our contingent commissions, which are primarily driven by our Insurance Company Partners growth and profitability metrics. A decline in economic activity could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Volatility or declines in premiums or other adverse trends in the insurance industry may seriously undermine our profitability. 
 We derive most of our commissions and fees from our brokerage and related services. We do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based. Moreover, insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions. Because of market cycles for insurance product pricing, which we cannot predict or control, our brokerage commissions and fees and profitability can be volatile or remain depressed for significant periods of time. In addition, there have been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance industry toward alternative insurance markets, including, among other things, greater levels of self-insurance, captives, rent-a-captives, risk retention groups and non-insurance capital markets-based solutions to traditional insurance. Our ability to generate premium-based commission revenue may also be challenged by the growing desire of some clients to compensate brokers based upon flat fees rather than a percentage of premium. This could negatively impact us because fees are generally not indexed for inflation and might not increase with premiums as commissions do or with the level of service provided. 
 As traditional risk-bearing insurance companies continue to outsource the production of premium commissions and fees to non-affiliated brokers or agents such as us, those insurance companies may seek to further minimize their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance brokers or agents. The reduction of these commission rates, along with general volatility or declines in premiums, may significantly affect our profitability. Because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes, it is difficult to precisely forecast our commission and contingent commissions and fees, including whether they will significantly decline. As a result, we may have to adjust our budgets for future acquisitions, capital expenditures, dividend payments, loan repayments and other expenditures to account for unexpected changes in commissions and fees, and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 16 

Because the commissions and fees we earn on the sale of certain insurance products is based on premiums and commission rates set by our Insurance Company Partners, any decreases in these premiums or commission rates, or actions by our Insurance Company Partners seeking repayment of commissions, could result in commissions and fees decreases or expenses to us. 
 We derive commissions and fees from the sale of insurance products that are paid by our Insurance Company Partners from whom our Clients purchase insurance. Because payments for the sale of insurance products are processed internally by our Insurance Company Partners, we may not receive a payment that is otherwise expected in any particular period until after the end of that period, which can adversely affect our ability to budget for significant future expenditures. Additionally, our Insurance Company Partners or their affiliates may, under certain circumstances, seek the chargeback or repayment of commissions as a result of policy lapse, surrender, cancellation, rescission, default or upon other specified circumstances. As a result of the chargeback or repayment of commissions, we may incur an expense in a particular period related to commissions and fees previously recognized in a prior period and reflected in our financial statements. Such an expense could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the expense is greater than the amount of related commissions and fees retained by us. 
 The commission rates are set by our Insurance Company Partners and are based on the premiums that the Insurance Company Partners charge. The potential for changes in premium rates is significant, due to pricing cyclicality in the insurance market. In addition, the insurance industry has been characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity and periods of favorable premium levels due to shortages of capacity. Capacity could also be reduced by our Insurance Company Partners failing or withdrawing from writing certain coverages and/or geographic areas that we offer our Clients. Commission rates and premiums can change based on prevailing legislative, economic and competitive factors that affect our Insurance Company Partners. These factors, which are not within our control, include the capacity of our Insurance Company Partners to place new business, underwriting and non-underwriting profits of our Insurance Company Partners, consumer demand for insurance products, the availability of comparable products from other insurance companies at a lower cost and the availability of alternative insurance products, such as government benefits and self-insurance products, to consumers. We cannot predict the timing or extent of future changes in commission rates or premiums or the effect any of these changes will have on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Quarterly and annual variations in our commissions that result from the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production may have unexpected effects on our results of operations. 
 Our commission income (including profit-sharing contingent commissions and override commissions) can vary quarterly or annually due to the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production. We do not control the factors that cause these variations. Specifically, Clients demand for insurance products can influence the timing of renewals, new business and lost business (which includes policies that are not renewed and cancellations). In addition, we rely on our Insurance Company Partners for the payment of certain commissions. Quarterly and annual fluctuations in commissions and fees based on increases and decreases associated with the timing of new business, policy renewals and payments from our Insurance Company Partners may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Profit-sharing contingent commissions are special revenue-sharing override commissions paid by our Insurance Company Partners based on the attainment of certain metrics such as the profitability, volume or growth of the business placed with such companies generally during the prior year. These are not guaranteed payments and our Insurance Company Partners may change the calculations or potentially elect to stop paying them at all on an annual basis. Over the last two years contingent commissions generally have been in the range of 7.0 to 9.0 of our current year s total core commissions and fees. Increases in loss ratios experienced by our Insurance Company Partners will result in a decreased profit to them and may result in decreases in payments of contingent or profit-sharing commissions to us. Due to, among other things, potentially poor macroeconomic conditions, the inherent uncertainty of loss in our Clients industries and changes in underwriting criteria (including profitability, volume or growth thresholds), due in part to the high loss ratios experienced by our Insurance Company Partners, we cannot predict the payment of these profit-sharing contingent commissions. Further, we have no control over the ability of our Insurance Company Partners to estimate loss reserves, which affects our ability to make profit-sharing calculations. Override commissions are paid by our Insurance Company Partners based on the attainment of certain metrics such as the profitability, volume or growth of the business that we place with them and are generally paid over the course of the year or in the beginning of the following year. Because profit-sharing contingent commissions and override commissions materially affect our commissions and fees, any decrease in their payment to us could adversely affect our results of operations, profitability and our financial condition.

See Our business had historically been highly concentrated in the Southeastern United States. While we still maintain a concentration in the Southeastern United States, our rapid growth has resulted in our having several regional concentrations of our business, such that adverse economic conditions, natural disasters, loss trends or regulatory changes in one of these regions could adversely affect our financial condition. 
 Conditions impacting our Insurance Company Partners or other parties with whom we do business may impact us. 
 We have a significant amount of accounts receivable from our Insurance Company Partners with whom we place insurance. If those Insurance Company Partners were to experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties, we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us, which could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. The potential for one of our Insurance Company Partners to cease writing insurance we offer our Clients could negatively impact overall capacity in the industry, which in turn could have the effect of reduced placement of certain lines and types of insurance and reduced commissions and fees and profitability for us. Questions about one of our Insurance Company Partners perceived stability or financial strength may contribute to such Insurance Company Partners strategic decisions to focus on certain lines of insurance to the detriment of others. The failure of an Insurance Company Partner with whom we place insurance could result in E O claims against us by our Clients, and the failure of our Insurance Company Partners could make the E O insurance we rely upon cost prohibitive or unavailable, which could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if any of our Insurance Company Partners merge or if one of our large Insurance Company Partners fails or withdraws from certain geographic areas or from offering certain lines of insurance, overall risk-taking capital capacity could be negatively affected, which could reduce our ability to place certain lines of insurance and, as a result, reduce our commissions and fees and profitability. Such failures or insurance withdrawals on the part of our Insurance Company Partners could occur for any number of reasons, including large unexpected payouts related to climate events or other emerging risk areas. 
 If we are unable to apply technology effectively in driving value for our Clients through technology-based solutions or gain internal efficiencies through the application of technology and related tools, our results of operations, client relationships, growth and compliance programs could be adversely affected. 
 Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to the threat of, and the opportunity presented by, digital disruption and other technology change. These may include new applications or insurance-related services based on artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, blockchain or new approaches to data mining. We may be exposed to competitive risks related to the adoption and application of new technologies by established market participants (for example, through disintermediation) or new entrants such as technology companies, Insurtech start-up companies and others. We must also develop and implement technology solutions and technical expertise among our employees that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology, industry standards, client preferences and control standards. We may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and cost-effective basis, and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace. Additionally, the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business may require us to incur significant expenses. Our technological development projects may also not deliver the benefits we expect once they are completed or may be replaced or become obsolete more quickly than expected, which could result in the accelerated recognition of expenses. If we cannot develop or implement new technologies as quickly as our competitors, or if our competitors develop more cost-effective technologies or product offerings, we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations, client relationships, growth and compliance programs. Our investments in new products and services may not generate the expected returns, which could hinder our ability to generate organic growth in the future. 
 
 Competition in our industry is intense and, if we are unable to compete effectively, we may lose Clients and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected. 
 The business of providing insurance products and services is highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify. We compete for Clients on the basis of reputation, Client service, program and product offerings and our ability to tailor products and services to meet the specific needs of a Client. 
 18 

We actively compete with numerous integrated financial services organizations as well as Insurance Company Partners and brokers, producer groups, individual insurance agents, investment management firms, independent financial planners and broker-dealers. Competition may reduce the fees that we can obtain for services provided, which would have an adverse effect on commissions and fees and margins. Many of our competitors have greater financial and marketing resources than we do and may be able to offer products and services that we do not currently offer and may not offer in the future. To the extent that banks, securities firms, insurance companies affiliates and the financial services industry may experience further consolidation, we may experience increased competition from insurance companies and the financial services industry, as a growing number of larger financial institutions increasingly, and aggressively, offer a wider variety of financial services, including insurance intermediary services. In addition, a number of insurance companies are engaged in the direct sale of insurance, primarily to individuals, and do not pay commissions to brokers or other market intermediaries. Furthermore, we compete with various other companies that provide risk-related services or alternatives to traditional insurance services, including Insurtech start-up companies, which are focused on using technology and innovation, including artificial intelligence (AI), digital platforms, data analytics, robotics and blockchain, to simplify and improve the Client experience, increase efficiencies, alter business models and effect other potentially disruptive changes in the industries in which we operate. In addition, in recent years, private equity sponsors have invested tens of billions of dollars into the insurance sector, transforming existing players and creating new ones to compete with large brokers. These new competitors, alliances among competitors or mergers of competitors could emerge and gain significant market share, and some of our competitors may have or may develop a lower cost structure, adopt more aggressive pricing policies or provide services that gain greater market acceptance than the services that we offer or develop. With respect to our sale of Medicare-related insurance, we also compete with government-run health insurance exchanges. The federal government operates a website where Medicare beneficiaries can purchase Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans or be referred to carriers to purchase Medicare Supplement plans. We also compete with the original Medicare program. The Affordable Care Act exchanges have websites where individuals and small businesses can purchase health insurance, and they also have offline customer support and enrollment capabilities. 
 Competitors may be able to respond to the need for technological changes and innovate faster, or price their services more aggressively. They may also compete for skilled professionals, finance acquisitions, fund internal growth and compete for market share more effectively than we do. To respond to increased competition and pricing pressure, we may have to lower the cost of our services or decrease the level of services provided to Clients, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In the event that any of such competitors initiates litigation against us, such litigation, even if without merit, could be time-consuming and costly to defend and may divert management s attention and resources away from our business and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Similarly, any increase in competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect us. These developments include: 
 increased capital-raising by insurance companies, which could result in new capital in the industry, which in turn may lead to lower insurance premiums and commissions; 
 insurance companies selling insurance directly to the insured without the involvement of a broker or other intermediary; 
 changes in our business compensation model as a result of legal, policy and/or regulatory developments; 
 federal and state governments establishing programs to provide property insurance in catastrophe-prone areas or other alternative market types of coverage that compete with, or completely replace, insurance products offered by insurance companies; 
 climate change regulation in the U.S. and around the world moving us toward a low-carbon economy, which could create new competitive pressures around innovative insurance solutions; and 
 increased competition from new market participants such as banks, accounting firms, consulting firms and Internet or other technology firms offering risk management, insurance brokerage services or new distribution channels for insurance, such as payroll firms. 
 New competition as a result of these or other competitive or industry developments could cause the demand for our products and services to decrease, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 19 

Our inability to retain or hire qualified Colleagues, as well as the loss of any of our executive officers or senior leaders, could negatively impact our reputation and/or ability to retain existing business and generate new business. 
 Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel. There is significant competition from within the insurance industry and from businesses outside the industry for exceptional employees, especially in key positions. Our competitors may be able to offer a work environment with higher compensation or more opportunities than we can. Any new personnel we hire may not be or become as productive as we expect, as we may face challenges in adequately or appropriately integrating them into our workforce and culture. Our effort to retain and develop personnel may also result in significant additional expenses, which could adversely affect our profitability. We can make no assurances that qualified Colleagues will continue to be employed or that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. If we are not able to successfully attract, retain and motivate our Colleagues, whether as a result of an insufficient number of qualified applicants, difficulty in recruiting new Colleagues, or inadequate resources to train, integrate, and retain qualified Colleagues, our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation could be materially and adversely affected. 
 In addition, we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of our senior leaders, including our founders and key executives, or if one or more of them is the victim of any accident, injury, illness or other ailment. In particular, our future success depends substantially on the continued service of our co-founder and Chairman, Lowry Baldwin, and our Chief Executive Officer, Trevor Baldwin. The loss of our senior managers or other key personnel (including the legacy management of certain joint ventures or acquired subsidiaries) in any circumstance, including any limitation on the performance of their duties or short- or long-term absence as a result of any accident, injury, illness or other ailment, or our inability to continue to identify, recruit and retain such personnel, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 Our reputation is one of our key assets. We advise our Clients on and provide services related to a wide range of subjects and our ability to attract and retain Clients depends greatly on the external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business practices, financial condition and other subjective qualities. If a Client is not satisfied with our services, it could cause us to incur additional costs and impair profitability or lose the Client relationship altogether, which may negatively impact other Clients perception regarding us. Our success is also dependent on maintaining a good reputation with existing and potential Colleagues, investors, Insurance Company Partners, vendors, regulators and the communities in which we operate. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these or other matters, including our association with Clients or business partners who themselves have a damaged reputation, or from actual or alleged conduct by us or our Colleagues, could damage our reputation. Any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, Clients and our Colleagues with respect to our environmental, social and governance ESG practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks. 
 There is increased focus, including from governmental organizations, investors, employees and Clients, on ESG issues such as environmental stewardship, climate change, diversity and inclusion, pay equity, racial justice, workplace conduct and cybersecurity and data privacy. There can be no certainty that we will manage such issues successfully, or that we will successfully meet society s expectations as to our proper role. Negative public perception, adverse publicity or negative comments in social media, including as a result of actions taken by companies we acquire before the acquisition, could damage our reputation, or harm our relationships with investors, other stakeholders, regulators and the communities in which we operate, if we do not, or are not perceived to, adequately address these issues. Any harm to our reputation could impact Colleague engagement and retention and the willingness of Clients and Insurance Company Partners to do business with us. 
 A variety of organizations have developed ratings to measure the performance of companies on ESG topics, and the results of these assessments are widely publicized. Investments in funds that specialize in companies that perform well in such assessments are increasingly popular, and major institutional investors have publicly emphasized the importance of such ESG measures to their investment decisions. Unfavorable ratings of BRP Group or our industry, as well as omission of inclusion of our stock into ESG-oriented investment funds may lead to negative investor sentiment and the diversion of investment to other companies or industries, which could have a negative impact on our stock price. 
 20 

The occurrence of natural or man-made disasters, health epidemics and pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and associated governmental responses, could result in declines in business and increases in claims that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We are exposed to various risks arising out of natural disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods, landslides, tornadoes, typhoons, tsunamis, hailstorms, explosions, climate events or weather patterns and public health crises, epidemics or pandemic health events, as well as man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism, military actions, cyber-terrorism, explosions and biological, chemical or radiological events, and associated governmental responses. The continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, and a natural or man-made disaster could trigger an economic downturn in the areas directly or indirectly affected by the disaster. These consequences could, among other things, result in a decline in business and increased claims from those areas. They could also result in reduced underwriting capacity of our Insurance Company Partners, making it more difficult for our Colleagues and contracted agents to place business. Disasters also could disrupt public and private infrastructure, including communications and financial services, which could disrupt our ordinary business operations. Any increases in loss ratios due to natural or man-made disasters could impact our contingent commissions, which are primarily driven by both growth and profitability metrics. 
 A natural or man-made disaster also could disrupt the operations of our counterparties or result in increased prices for the products and services they provide to us. Finally, a natural or man-made disaster could increase the incidence or severity of E O claims against us, or other incidents, claims, risks, exposures and/or liabilities that require us to make claims against our insurance policies. 
 See Our business had historically been highly concentrated in the Southeastern United States. While we still maintain a concentration in the Southeastern United States, our rapid growth has resulted in our having several regional concentrations of our business, such that adverse economic conditions, natural disasters, loss trends or regulatory changes in one of these regions could adversely affect our financial condition. 
 Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability. 
 Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our personnel, offices, and technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations. Should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, such as an earthquake, hurricane, terrorist attack, pandemic, protest or riot, security breach, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made disaster, our continued success will depend, in part, on the availability of personnel, office facilities, and the proper functioning of computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations. In events like these, we can experience near-term operational challenges in particular areas of our operations. We could potentially lose key executives, personnel, client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to Clients in a disaster recovery scenario. We may experience additional disruption due to system upgrades, outages, an increase in remote work or other impacts as a result of health epidemics or pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic. Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem, could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships, or legal liability. Our insurance coverage with respect to natural disasters is limited and is subject to deductibles and coverage limits. Such coverage may not be adequate, or may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms. 
 If our ability to enroll individuals during enrollment periods is impeded, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed. 
 It is difficult for the health insurance Risk Advisors we employ and our systems and processes to handle the increased volume of health insurance transactions that occur in a short period of time during the healthcare reform annual open enrollment period and the Medicare annual enrollment period. We hire additional Colleagues on a temporary or seasonal basis in a limited period of time to address the expected increase in the volume of health insurance transactions during the Medicare annual enrollment period. We must ensure that our health insurance Risk Advisors and those of outsourced call centers are timely licensed, trained and certified and have the appropriate authority to sell health insurance in a number of states and for a number of different health insurance companies. We depend on our own Colleagues, state departments of insurance, government exchanges and Insurance Company Partners for licensing, certification and appointment. If our ability to market and sell Medicare-related health insurance and individual and family health insurance is constrained during an enrollment period for any reason, such as technology failures, reduced allocation of resources, any inability to timely employ, license, train, certify and retain our Colleagues and our contractors and their health insurance Risk Advisors to sell health insurance, interruptions in the operation of our website or systems or issues with government-run health insurance exchanges, we could acquire fewer members, suffer a reduction in our membership and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed. 
 21 

Partnerships have been, and may in the future continue to be, important to our growth. We may not be able to successfully identify and acquire Partners or integrate Partners into our company, and we may become subject to certain liabilities assumed or incurred in connection with our Partnerships that could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Strategic acquisitions to complement and further expand our business, which we refer to as Partnerships, have been an important part of our competitive strategy. The acquisition landscape is competitive and accordingly we do not expect that Partnerships will be as important to our growth in 2023, although we will remain active in pursuing potential transactions. Our ability to identify and complete acquisitions, or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any Partner into our operations, may impact our ability to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share, profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services. The process of integrating a Partner has created, and will continue to create, operating difficulties. The risks we face include: 
 diversion of management time and focus from operating our core business to acquisition integration challenges; 
 excessive costs of deploying our business support and financial management tools in acquired companies; 
 delays in the successful integration of the Partner into our operations; 
 failure to successfully integrate the Partner into our operations, including cultural challenges associated with integrating and retaining Colleagues; 
 failure to achieve anticipated efficiencies or benefits, including through the loss of key Clients or personnel of the Partner; 
 failure to realize our strategic objectives for the Partner or further develop the Partner; and 
 the consequences of the conduct of our acquired companies prior to their acquisition by us, including the occurrence of data breaches or other cybersecurity attacks during the integration of information systems, as well as increased costs associated with implementing state and regulatory compliance procedures, including data privacy and cybersecurity protections. 
 Furthermore, when regulatory approval of our proposed Partnerships is required, our ability to complete such Partnerships may be limited by an ongoing regulatory review or other issues with the relevant regulator. 
 There may be liabilities that we fail to discover while conducting due diligence, that we inadequately assess or that are not properly disclosed to us. In particular, to the extent that any Partner (i) failed to comply with or otherwise violated applicable laws or regulations, (ii) failed to fulfill contractual obligations to Clients, Insurance Company Partners or other third parties such as vendors, service providers or contracted agents, or (iii) incurred material liabilities or obligations to Clients that are not identified during the diligence process, we, as the successor owner, may be financially responsible for these violations, failures and liabilities and may suffer financial or reputational harm or otherwise be adversely affected. In addition, as part of a Partnership, we may assume responsibilities and obligations of the Partner pursuant to the terms and conditions of agreements entered by the acquired entity that are not consistent with the terms and conditions that we typically accept and require. We also may be subject to litigation or other claims in connection with a Partner, including claims from Colleagues, Clients, stockholders or other third parties. Any material liabilities we incur that are associated with our Partnerships could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Our Partnership strategy is also affected by our ability to secure additional debt or equity financing in the future to fund acquisitions. We may not be able to obtain such additional financing or, if available, it may not be in amounts and on terms acceptable to us. We cannot predict or guarantee that we will successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates, consummate any Partnership or integrate any Partner. Any failure to do so could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Partnerships for further discussion of our strategic acquisitions. 
 22 

The provision of advisory services to clients with respect to captive insurance, and specifically, utilization of an 831(b) election, is subject to numerous, complex and frequently changing laws, regulations and governmental interpretations of the same, and non-compliance or changes in laws and regulations or governmental interpretations of the same, could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 We have an advisory services business that assists certain clients with establishment of captive insurance companies, for their own purposes, which leverage the benefits of Section 831(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and which are subject to audit and oversight from the Internal Revenue Service IRS ). The IRS has conducted investigations, and may be conducting investigations, of certain peers of ours that also provide similar services, with respect to whether or not such third parties are acting as a tax shelter promoter in connection with those operations. We have no reason to believe that we have been or are currently a target of any such investigation. If the IRS were to disallow 831(b) elections, modify its guidance around 831(b) elections, or otherwise investigate our business and conclude that we are a tax shelter promoter, such actions, whether or not merited, could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 An impairment of goodwill could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 When we acquire Partners, we record goodwill and other intangible assets. As of December 31, 2022, goodwill represented 41 of our total assets. Goodwill is not amortized and is subject to assessment for impairment at least annually. The identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of our reporting units. We compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount to determine if there is potential impairment of goodwill. Management reviews the carrying value attributed to each reporting unit at least annually to determine if the facts and circumstances suggest that there is impairment. 
 We may in the future be required to take additional goodwill or other asset impairment charges. Any such non-cash charges could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 In connection with the implementation of our corporate strategies, we face risks associated with the entry into new lines of business and the growth and development of these businesses. 
 From time to time, either through Partnerships or internal development, we may enter new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. These new lines of business or new products and services may present additional risks, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. Such risks include the investment of significant time and resources; the possibility that these efforts will not be successful; the possibility that the marketplace does not accept our products or services, or that we are unable to retain Clients that adopt our new products or services; and the risk of additional liabilities associated with these efforts. Other risks include developing knowledge of and experience in the new lines of business, integrating the Partner into our systems and culture, recruiting professionals and developing and capitalizing on new relationships with experienced market participants. External factors, such as compliance with new or revised regulations, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business. Failure to manage these risks in the acquisition or development of new businesses could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we dispose of or otherwise exit certain businesses, there can be no assurance that we will not incur certain disposition-related charges, or that we will be able to reduce overhead related to the divested assets. Our investments in new products and services may not generate the expected returns, which could hinder our ability to generate organic growth in the future. 
 We have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility and subjects us to restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to effectively operate our business. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately 1.3 billion, collateralized by substantially all the Company s assets, including a pledge of all equity securities the Company holds in each of its subsidiaries. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we had debt servicing costs of 115.1 million, inclusive of 50.5 million in principal repayments and 62.7 million of interest payments. 
 23 

The level of debt we have outstanding during any period could adversely affect our financial flexibility. We also bear risk at the time debt matures. Our ability to make interest and principal payments, to refinance our debt obligations and to fund our planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash from operations. Our ability to generate cash from operations is, to a certain extent, subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control, such as an environment of rising interest rates. The need to service our indebtedness will also reduce our ability to use cash for other purposes, including working capital, dividends to stockholders, acquisitions, capital expenditures, share repurchases and general corporate purposes. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, raising additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and investments, any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business. Additionally, we may not be able to effect such actions, if necessary, on favorable terms, or at all. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all. 
 The JPM Credit Agreement contains covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to make certain restricted payments, incur additional debt, engage in certain asset sales, mergers, acquisitions or similar transactions, create liens on assets, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, change our business or make certain investments and require us to comply with certain financial covenants. The restrictions in the JPM Credit Agreement governing our debt may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and our stockholders and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. We may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional or more restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility, including our ability to pay dividends. We cannot make any assurances that we will be able to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all. A failure to comply with the restrictions under the JPM Credit Agreement could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions. The occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could cause our obligations with respect to our debt to be accelerated and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The JPM Credit Agreement provides for an interest rate based on, depending on the type of loan, the Eurodollar rate or the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the JPM Credit Agreement), plus, in each case, a margin based on Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the JPM Credit Agreement). Under existing guidance, the publication of LIBOR was to be discontinued beginning on or around the end of 2021. However, the ICE Benchmark Administration, in its capacity as administrator of USD LIBOR, announced that it extended publication of USD LIBOR (other than one-week and two-month tenors) by 18 months to June 2023. The uncertainty regarding the transition from LIBOR to another benchmark rate or rates could have adverse impacts on our available debt that currently uses LIBOR as a benchmark rate, and ultimately, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. 
 We may incur significant additional indebtedness, which may affect our ability to satisfy our obligations under the JPM Credit Agreement. 
 Under the terms of the JPM Credit Agreement, we may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, in the future. This could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital and capital expenditures and execute on our Partnership strategy, expose us to the risk of increased interest rates and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions. If new indebtedness is added to our current indebtedness levels, the related risks that we face could be increased, and we may not be able to meet all of our debt obligations. Furthermore, the terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants, which could affect our financial and operational flexibility, including our ability to pay dividends. 
 24 

Our business had historically been highly concentrated in the Southeastern United States. While we still maintain a concentration in the Southeastern United States, our rapid growth has resulted in our having several regional concentrations of our business, such that adverse economic conditions, natural disasters, loss trends or regulatory changes in one of these regions could adversely affect our financial condition. 
 A significant portion of our business remains concentrated in the Southeastern U.S., with several other regional concentrations. The insurance business is primarily a state-regulated industry, and therefore state legislatures may enact laws that adversely affect the insurance industry. Because our business is concentrated in several regions of the U.S., we face greater exposure to unfavorable changes in regulatory conditions in those regions than insurance intermediaries whose operations are more diversified through a greater number of states. In addition, the occurrence of adverse economic conditions, natural or other disasters, loss trends or other circumstances specific to or otherwise significantly impacting these states could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Increases in loss ratios, combined ratios and related costs experienced by our Insurance Company Partners will result in a decreased profit to them and may result in decreases in payments of contingent or profit-sharing commissions to us. This trend may also cause one or more of our Insurance Company Partners to reduce or cease writing insurance we offer our Clients, whether in part, entirely or on a geographic basis, which in turn could reduce our ability to place certain lines of insurance and, as a result, reduce our commissions and fees and profitability. 
 In addition, we are susceptible to losses and interruptions caused by hurricanes (particularly in Florida, where our headquarters and numerous offices are located), earthquakes, tornadoes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, floods, fire, extreme weather conditions, geopolitical events, such as terrorist acts, and other natural or man-made disasters. Hurricanes in particular may have an outsized impact on the insurance industry. We expect to continue to grow our footprint throughout the country and beyond, but our plans to execute on this geographic diversification effort may not be successful. 
 We derive a significant portion of our commissions and fees from a limited number of our Insurance Company Partners, the loss of which could result in additional expense and loss of market share. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, two Insurance Company Partners accounted for an aggregate of approximately 15 of our total core commissions. Should either of these Insurance Company Partners seek to terminate their respective arrangements with us or in the case of material financial impairment of such Insurance Company Partners, we could be forced to move our business to other Insurance Company Partners and additional expense and loss of market share could possibly result. 
 Our business may be harmed if we lose our relationships with Insurance Company Partners, fail to maintain good relationships with Insurance Company Partners, become dependent upon a limited number of Insurance Company Partners or fail to develop new Insurance Company Partner relationships. 
 Our business typically enters into contractual agency relationships with Insurance Company Partners that are sometimes unique to BRP Group, but nonexclusive and terminable on short notice by either party for any reason. In many cases, Insurance Company Partners also have the ability to amend the terms of our agreements unilaterally, including commission rates on short notice. Our Insurance Company Partners may be unwilling to allow us to sell their existing or new insurance products or may amend our agreements with them, for a variety of reasons, including for competitive or regulatory reasons or because of a reluctance to distribute their products through our platform. Our Insurance Company Partners may decide to rely on their own internal distribution channels, choose to exclude us from their most profitable or popular products, or decide not to distribute insurance products in individual markets in certain geographies or altogether. The termination or amendment of our relationship with an Insurance Company Partner could reduce the variety of insurance products we offer. We also could lose a source of, or be paid reduced commissions for, future sales and could lose renewal commissions for past sales. Our business could also be harmed if we fail to develop new Insurance Company Partner relationships. 
 In the future, it may become necessary for us to offer insurance products from a reduced number of Insurance Company Partners or to derive a greater portion of our commissions and fees from a more concentrated number of Insurance Company Partners as our business and the insurance industry evolve. Should our dependence on a smaller number of Insurance Company Partners increase, whether as a result of the termination of Insurance Company Partner relationships, Insurance Company Partner consolidation or otherwise, we may become more vulnerable to adverse changes in our relationships with our Insurance Company Partners, particularly in states where we offer insurance products from a relatively small number of Insurance Company Partners or where a small number of insurance companies dominate the market. The termination, amendment or consolidation of our relationship with our Insurance Company Partners could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 25 

We rely on third parties to perform key functions of our business operations, enabling our provision of services to our Clients. These third parties may act in ways that could harm our business. 
 We rely on third parties, and in some cases subcontractors, to provide services, data, and information, such as technology, information security, funds transfers, data processing and administration and support functions, that are critical to our business operations. These third parties include correspondents, agents and other brokerage and intermediaries, insurance markets, data providers, plan trustees, payroll service providers, benefits administrators, software and system vendors, health plan providers, investment managers and providers of human resources, among others. As we do not fully control the actions of these third parties, we are subject to the risk that their decisions, actions or inactions may adversely impact us and replacing these service providers could create significant delays and expenses. Because we do not control our vendors and our ability to monitor their cybersecurity is limited, we cannot ensure the cybersecurity measures they take will be sufficient to protect any information we share with them or to which they may have access. Due to applicable laws and regulations or contractual obligations, we may be held responsible for security breaches, cyberattacks or other similar incidents attributed to our vendors as they relate to the information we share with them or to which we grant them access. A failure by third parties to comply with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements in a high-quality and timely manner, particularly during periods of our peak demand for their services, could result in economic and reputational harm to us. In addition, we face risks as we transition from in-house functions to third-party support functions and providers, or vice versa, that there may be disruptions in service or other unintended results that may adversely affect our business operations. These third parties face their own technology, operating, business, and economic risks, and any significant failures by them, including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential Client, Colleague, consumer, or Company information, could cause harm to our reputation. An interruption in or the cessation of service by any service provider as a result of systems failures, data breaches or other cybersecurity incidents, capacity constraints, financial difficulties, or for any other reason could disrupt our operations, impact our ability to offer certain products and services, and result in contractual or regulatory fines or penalties, liability claims from Clients, or Colleagues, damage to our reputation, and harm to our business. 
 We have experienced significant growth in recent periods, and our recent growth rates may not be indicative of our future growth. As our costs increase, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve and, if achieved, maintain profitability. 
 We have experienced significant revenue growth in recent periods. In future periods, we may not be able to sustain revenue growth consistent with recent history, or at all. We believe our revenue growth depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to: 
 attract new Clients, successfully deploy and implement our products, obtain Client renewals and provide our Clients with excellent Client support; 
 increase our network of Insurance Company Partners and the profit-sharing, override and/or contingent commissions that we earn from such Insurance Company Partners; 
 adequately expand, train, integrate and retain our Colleagues, including our executive officers and senior leaders, and maintain or increase our sales force s productivity; 
 improve our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures to ensure timely and accurate reporting of our operational and financial results; 
 successfully introduce new products and enhance existing products; 
 successfully deploy information technology assets for use by our Colleagues and interaction with our Clients and Insurance Company Partners; 
 adapt to the ever-changing regulatory and legal landscape; 
 protect sensitive, personal and confidential information and data within BRP s custody from third party bad actors; 
 successfully identify and acquire new Partners; 
 successfully integrate Partnerships into the Company in an operationally efficient manner; 
 service our existing indebtedness; 
 access the capital markets or otherwise obtain access to capital to satisfy future needs of the Company; 
 successfully introduce our products to new markets and geographies; and 
 successfully compete against larger companies and new market entrants. 
 26 

We may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives and, in particular, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty may impact our ability to successfully accomplish any of the above, and as a result, it is difficult for us to forecast our future results of operations. Our historical growth rate should not be considered indicative of our future performance and may decline in the future. In future periods, our revenue could grow more slowly than in recent periods or decline for any number of reasons, including those outlined above. If our revenue or revenue growth rates decline, investors perceptions of our business may be adversely affected and the market price of common stock could decline. 
 If we fail to manage future growth effectively, our business could be materially adversely affected. 
 We have experienced rapid growth. This growth has placed significant demands on management and our operational infrastructure. As we continue to grow, we must effectively integrate, develop and motivate a large number of new Colleagues, while maintaining the beneficial aspects of our Company culture. If we do not manage the growth of our business and operations effectively, the quality of our services and efficiency of our operations could suffer and we may not be able to execute on our business plan, which could harm our brand, results of operations and overall business. 
 Our corporate culture has contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain this culture, or if we experience a change in management, management philosophy or business strategy, our business may be harmed. 
 We believe that a significant contributor to our success has been our entrepreneurial and sales-oriented culture, as outlined in the Azimuth, our corporate constitution. As we grow, including from the integration of Colleagues and businesses acquired in connection with previous or future Partnerships, we may find it difficult to maintain important aspects of our corporate culture, which could negatively affect our profitability or our ability to retain and recruit people of the highest integrity and quality who are essential to our future success. We may face pressure to change our culture as we grow, particularly if we experience difficulties in attracting competent personnel who are willing to embrace our culture. In addition, as our organization grows and we are required to implement more complex organizational structures, or if we experience a change in management, management philosophy or business strategy, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture, such as our Partnership operating model, which could negatively impact our future success. 
 Our results may be adversely affected by changes in the mode of compensation in the insurance industry. 
 In the past, state regulators have scrutinized the manner in which insurance brokers are compensated. For example, the Attorney General of the State of New York brought charges against members of the insurance brokerage community. These actions have created uncertainty concerning longstanding methods of compensating insurance brokers. Given that the insurance brokerage industry has faced scrutiny from regulators in the past over its compensation practices, and the transparency and discourse to Clients regarding brokers compensation, it is possible that regulators may choose to revisit the same or other practices in the future. If they do so, compliance with new regulations along with any sanctions that might be imposed for past practices deemed improper could have an adverse impact on our future results of operations and inflict significant reputational harm on our business. 
 Certain of our results of operations and financial metrics may be difficult to predict as a result of seasonality. 
 We have presented, and may continue to present, certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, in filings with the SEC and other public statements. Any failure to accurately report and present our non-GAAP financial measures could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock. 
 The insurance brokerage market is seasonal and our results of operations are somewhat affected by seasonal trends. Our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margins are typically highest in the first quarter and lowest in the fourth quarter. This variation is primarily due to fluctuations in our revenue, while overhead remains consistent throughout the year. Our revenues are generally highest in the first quarter due to the impact of contingent commission payments received in the first quarter from Insurance Company Partners that we cannot readily estimate before receipt without the risk of significant reversal and a higher degree of first quarter policy commencements and renewals in Medicare and certain Middle Market lines of business such as employee benefits and commercial. In addition, a higher proportion of our first quarter revenue is derived from our highest margin businesses. 
 Partnerships can significantly impact Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margins in a given year and may increase the amount of seasonality within the business, especially results attributable to Partnerships that have not been fully integrated into our business or owned by us for a full year.

Climate risks, risks associated with the physical effects of climate events, and risks associated with governmental responses to climate risks, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 The effects of climate events continue to create an alarming level of concern. The U.S. Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies continue to propose numerous initiatives to supplement the global effort to address climate and climate-related events. If new legislation or regulation is enacted, we could incur increased costs and capital expenditures to comply with its limitations, which may impact our financial condition and operating performance. 
 In addition, the U.S. Federal Reserve recently identified the climate as a systemic risk to the economy. It also reported that a gradual change in investor sentiment regarding climate risk introduces the possibility of abrupt tipping points or significant swings in sentiment, which could create unpredictable follow-on effects in financial markets. If this occurred, not only would we be negatively impacted by the general economic decline, but a drop in the stock market affecting our stock price could negatively impact our ability to grow through mergers and acquisitions financed using our common stock. 
 The transition to a low-carbon economy could harm specific industries or sectors such as oil and gas in ways that could impact our business. Our Clients in certain industries may be more adversely affected by climate events and could go out of business or have reduced needs for insurance-related services, which could adversely impact our revenues. Negative publicity arising from our association with Clients in disfavored businesses or industries, or the perception that we are not sufficiently focused on climate risks, could damage our reputation with investors, Clients, Colleagues and regulators. In addition, the transition to a low-carbon economy could give rise to the need for innovative insurance and risk management solutions for entirely new industries and companies, as well as advice and services to bolster climate resilience for existing companies. If we fail to innovate in response to these changes, we could lose market share to our competitors or new market entrants that do. 
 Moreover, if our Insurance Company Partners fail or withdraw from offering certain lines of coverage because of large payouts related to climate events, overall risk-taking capital capacity could be negatively affected, which could reduce our ability to place certain lines of coverage and, as a result, reduce our revenues and profitability. 
 Furthermore, climate events may pose physical risks to our business, such as the frequency and intensity of unfavorable weather conditions, such as fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, drought, water shortages, rainfall, unseasonably warm. Overall, climate events, their effects and the resulting, unknown impact could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Risks Relating to Legal, Compliance and Regulatory Matters 
 Non-compliance with or changes in laws, regulations or licensing requirements applicable to us could restrict our ability to conduct our business and/or could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The industry in which we operate is subject to extensive regulation. We are subject to regulation and supervision both federally and in each applicable local jurisdiction. In general, these regulations are designed to protect Clients and the insured and to protect the integrity of the financial markets, rather than to protect stockholders or creditors. Our ability to conduct business in these jurisdictions depends on our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated by federal, state and other regulatory and self-regulatory authorities. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements, or changes in regulatory requirements or interpretations, could result in actions by regulators, potentially leading to fines and penalties, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation in the marketplace. There can be no assurance that we will be able to adapt effectively to any changes in law. Furthermore, in some areas of our business, we act on the basis of our own or the industry's interpretations of applicable laws or regulations, which may conflict from state to state. In the event those interpretations eventually prove different from the interpretations of regulatory authorities, we may be penalized. In extreme cases, revocation of a subsidiary s authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions could result from failure to comply with regulatory requirements. Due to the complexity, periodic modification and differing interpretations of state insurance laws and regulations, we may not have always been, and we may not always be, in compliance with them. In addition, we could face lawsuits by Clients, the insured and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws and regulations. It is difficult to predict whether changes resulting from new laws and regulations, as well as changes in interpretation of current laws and regulations, will affect the industry or our business and, if so, to what degree. 
 Colleagues and principals who engage in the solicitation, negotiation or sale of insurance, or provide certain other insurance services, generally are required to be licensed individually. Insurance and laws and regulations govern whether licensees may share commissions with unlicensed entities and individuals. We believe that any payments we make to third parties are in compliance with applicable laws. However, should any regulatory agency take a contrary position and prevail, we will be required to change the manner in which we pay fees to such Colleagues or principals or require entities receiving such payments to become registered or licensed. 
 28 

State insurance laws grant supervisory agencies, including state departments of insurance, departments of financials services, and similar regulatory authorities, broad administrative authority. State insurance regulators and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners continually review existing laws and regulations, some of which affect our business. These supervisory agencies regulate many aspects of the insurance business, including, the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and other insurance intermediaries, the handling of third-party funds held in a fiduciary capacity and trade practices, such as marketing, advertising and compensation arrangements entered into by insurance brokers and agents. This legal and regulatory oversight could reduce our profitability or limit our growth by increasing the costs of legal and regulatory compliance, and by limiting or restricting the products or services we sell, the markets we serve or enter, the methods by which we sell our products and services, and the form of compensation we can accept from our Clients, Insurance Company Partners and third parties. Moreover, in response to perceived excessive cost or inadequacy of available insurance, states have from time to time created state insurance funds and assigned risk pools, which compete directly, on a subsidized basis, with private insurance providers. 
 Federal, state and other regulatory and self-regulatory authorities have focused on, and continue to devote substantial attention to, the insurance industry as well as to the sale of products or services to seniors. Regulatory review or the issuance of interpretations of existing laws and regulations may result in the enactment of new laws and regulations that could adversely affect our operations or our ability to conduct business profitably. We are unable to predict whether any such laws or regulations will be enacted and to what extent such laws and regulations would affect our business. 
 Other legislative developments that could adversely affect us include: changes in our business compensation model as a result of regulatory developments (for example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act), and federal and state governments establishing programs to provide health insurance or other alternative market types of coverage, that compete with, or completely replace, insurance products offered by insurance carriers. Also, as climate risk issues become more prevalent, the U.S. is beginning to respond to these issues. This increasing governmental focus on climate risks may result in new environmental regulations that cause us to incur additional compliance costs, which may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. 
 An increasing quantity of state legislatures and judiciaries, as well as the Federal Trade Commission, have begun promulgating laws, orders and regulations that reflect a shifting sentiment against the enforceability of certain types of restrictive covenant agreements, including non-compete agreements and non-solicitation agreements, that are core to our business. The further promulgation of such laws, orders and regulations could adversely affect our operations or our ability to conduct business profitably. We are unable to predict whether any such laws, orders or regulations will be enacted, and if enacted, enforceable, and to what extent such laws and regulations would affect our business. 
 Proposed tort reform legislation, if enacted, could decrease demand for casualty insurance, thereby reducing our commission revenues. 
 Legislation concerning tort reform has been considered, from time to time, in the United States Congress and in several state legislatures. Among the provisions considered in such legislation have been limitations on damage awards, including punitive damages, and various restrictions applicable to class action lawsuits. Enactment of these or similar provisions by Congress, or by states in which we sell insurance, could reduce the demand for casualty insurance policies or lead to a decrease in policy limits of such policies sold, thereby reducing our commission revenues. 
 Regulations affecting Insurance Company Partners with which we place insurance affect how we conduct our operations. 
 Our Insurance Company Partners are also regulated by state departments of insurance for solvency and other issues and are subject to reserve requirements. We cannot guarantee that all Insurance Company Partners with which we do business comply with regulations instituted by state departments of insurance. We may need to expend resources to address questions or concerns regarding our relationships with these Insurance Company Partners, which diverts management resources away from business operations. 
 29 

Our business is subject to risks related to legal proceedings, regulatory investigations, and governmental inquiries and actions. 
 We are subject to litigation, regulatory investigations and claims arising in the ordinary course of our business operations. The risks associated with these matters often may be difficult to assess or quantify and the existence and magnitude of potential claims often remain unknown for substantial periods of time. While we have insurance coverage for some of these potential claims, others may not be covered by insurance, insurers may dispute coverage or any ultimate liabilities may exceed our coverage. We may be subject to actions and claims relating to the sale, solicitation and negotiation of insurance, including the suitability of such products and services, as well as denials of coverage from our Insurance Company Partners. Actions and claims may result in the rescission of such sales; consequently, our Insurance Company Partners may seek to recoup commissions paid to us, which may lead to legal action against us. The outcome of such actions cannot be predicted and such claims or actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We are subject to laws and regulations, as well as regulatory investigations. The insurance industry has been subject to a significant level of scrutiny by various regulatory bodies, including state Attorneys General offices and state departments of insurance, concerning certain practices within the insurance industry. These practices include, without limitation, the receipt of contingent commissions by insurance brokers and agents from insurance companies and the extent to which such compensation has been disclosed, the collection of agency fees, which we define as fees separate from commissions charged directly to Clients for efforts performed in the issuance of new insurance policies, bid rigging and related matters. From time to time, our subsidiaries receive informational requests from governmental authorities. 
 There have been a number of revisions to existing, or proposals to modify or enact new, laws and regulations regarding insurance agents and brokers. These actions have imposed or could impose additional obligations on us with respect to our products sold. Some insurance companies have agreed with regulatory authorities to end the payment of contingent commissions on insurance products, which could impact our commissions that are based on the volume, consistency and profitability of business generated by us. 
 We cannot predict the impact that any new laws, rules or regulations may have on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Given the current regulatory environment and the number of our subsidiaries operating in local markets throughout the country, it is possible that we will become subject to further governmental inquiries and subpoenas and have lawsuits filed against us. Regulators may raise issues during investigations, examinations or audits that could, if determined adversely, have a material impact on us. The interpretations of regulations by regulators may change and statutes may be enacted with retroactive impact. We could also be materially adversely affected by any new industry-wide regulations or practices that may result from these proceedings. 
 Our involvement in any investigations and lawsuits would cause us to incur additional legal and other costs and, if we were found to have violated any laws, we could be required to pay fines, damages and other costs, perhaps in material amounts. Regardless of final costs, these matters could have a material adverse effect on us by exposing us to negative publicity, reputational damage, harm to client relationships or diversion of personnel and management resources. 
 In addition, we may from time to time be subject to certain litigation brought by one or more of our shareholders. The outcome of any such litigation, particularly class action lawsuits, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits, including the possibility of having attorney s fees awarded, may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The cost to defend such litigation may be significant. There may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. As a result, litigation may materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition and results of operations.

The marketing and sale of Medicare plans are subject to numerous, complex and frequently changing laws and regulations, and non-compliance or changes in laws and regulations could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 The marketing and sale of Medicare plans are subject to numerous laws, regulations and guidelines at the federal and state level. The marketing and sale of Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans are principally regulated by the CMS. The marketing and sale of Medicare Supplement plans are principally regulated on a state-by-state basis by state departments of insurance. The laws and regulations applicable to the marketing and sale of Medicare plans are numerous, ambiguous and complex, and, particularly with respect to regulations and guidance issued by CMS for Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans, change frequently. The telephone calls on which we enroll individuals into Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans are required to be recorded. Health insurance companies audit these recordings for compliance and listen to them in connection with their investigation of complaints. In addition, Medicare eligible individuals may receive a special election period and the ability to change Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans outside the Medicare annual enrollment period in the event that the sale of the plan was not in accordance with CMS rules and guidelines. Given CMS s scrutiny of Medicare product health insurance companies and the responsibility of the Insurance Company Partners for actions that we take, Insurance Company Partners may terminate our relationship with them or take other corrective action if our Medicare product sales, marketing and operations are not in compliance or give rise to too many complaints. The termination of our relationship with Insurance Company Partners for this reason would reduce the products we are able to offer, could result in the loss of commissions for past and future sales and would otherwise harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 As a result of the laws, regulations and guidelines relating to the sale of Medicare plans, we have altered, and likely will have to continue to alter, our websites and sales process to comply with several requirements that are not applicable to our sale of non-Medicare-related health insurance plans. For instance, many aspects of our online platforms and our marketing material and processes, as well as changes to these platforms, materials and processes, including call center scripts, must be filed on a regular basis with CMS and reviewed and approved by health insurance companies in light of CMS requirements. In addition, certain aspects of our Medicare plan marketing partner relationships have been in the past, and will be in the future, subjected to CMS and health insurance company review. Changes to the laws, regulations and guidelines relating to Medicare plans, their interpretation or the manner in which they are enforced could be incompatible with these relationships, our platforms or our sale of Medicare plans, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Due to changes in CMS guidance or enforcement or interpretation of existing guidance applicable to our marketing and sale of Medicare products, or as a result of new laws, regulations and guidelines, CMS, state departments of insurance or Insurance Company Partners may determine to object to or not to approve aspects of our online platforms or marketing material and processes and may determine that certain existing aspects of our Medicare-related business are not in compliance. As a result, the progress of our Medicare operations could be slowed or we could be prevented from operating aspects of our Medicare commissions and fees generating activities altogether, which would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition, particularly if it occurred during the Medicare annual enrollment period. 
 We have received, and may in the future receive, inquiries from CMS or state departments of insurance regarding our marketing and business practices and compliance with laws and regulations. Inquiries and proceedings initiated by the government could adversely impact our health insurance licenses, require us to pay fines, require us to modify marketing and business practices, result in litigation and otherwise harm our business, operating results or financial condition. 
 31 

In May 2021, CMS changed its process for the submission and approval of marketing materials related to Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. The practical application of the previous process allowed for a lead carrier to handle most of the review and filing of Medicare plan marketing materials with CMS. The new process requires each carrier to approve of each filed marketing material and has resulted in a more complicated and time consuming process to get our marketing material filed with CMS and through the process with carriers. In October 2021, CMS issued new guidance that significantly broadens the types of marketing materials that we are required to file with CMS, including the requirement to file certain generic marketing materials that refer to the benefits or costs of Medicare Advantage or Medicare Part D prescription drug plans but that do not specifically mention a health insurance carrier's name or a specific plan. As a result, we now submit to each Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plan carrier with which we have a relationship a significantly larger number of marketing materials than we have in the past. We may not be able to use certain of our marketing materials and implement our marketing programs effectively if CMS or an Insurance Company Partner has comments or disapproves of our marketing materials. If we do not timely file the additional marketing materials with CMS, if Insurance Company Partners do not adapt to the new CMS requirements or increase the efficiency with which they review our marketing material, or if we or our marketing partners are not successful in timely receiving Insurance Company Partner or CMS approval of our marketing materials, it could harm our sales and also harm our ability to efficiently change and implement new or existing marketing material, including call center scripts and our websites, which could impact negatively in our business, operating results and financial condition, particularly if such delay or non-compliance occurs during the Medicare annual enrollment period. 
 E O claims against us, and other incidents, claims, risks, exposures and/or liabilities that require us to make claims against our insurance policies, may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We have significant insurance agency and brokerage operations, and are subject to claims and litigation in the ordinary course of business resulting from alleged and actual E O in placing insurance and rendering coverage advice. In addition, many of our Colleagues regularly interact with Clients and prospective Clients in the field, which increases the risks of property and casualty claims arising from such interactions. Further, many of our office locations are in jurisdictions (such as California, Texas and Florida) that see higher incidents of climate events (such as hurricanes, other aggressive weather patterns and earthquakes). Dealing with any of these activities can involve the expenditure of substantial amounts of money. Since E O claims against us may allege our liability for all or part of the amounts in question, claimants may seek large damage awards. These claims can involve significant defense costs. E O could include failure to, whether negligently or intentionally, place coverage on behalf of Clients, provide our Insurance Company Partners with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or appropriately apply funds that we hold on a fiduciary basis. It is not always possible to prevent or detect E O and other types of claims, and the precautions we take may not be effective in all cases. 
 We have E O insurance coverage to protect against the risk of liability resulting from our alleged and actual E O. We also maintain a variety of other property and casualty policies of insurance providing varying degrees of protection against loss and damage to our property and liability for certain conduct of our Colleagues. Prices for these policies of insurance and the scope and limits of the coverage terms available depend on our claims history as well as market conditions that are outside of our control. While we endeavor to purchase coverage that is appropriate to our assessment of our risk, we are unable to predict with certainty the frequency, nature or magnitude of claims for direct or consequential damages or whether our policies of insurance will cover such claims. 
 In establishing liabilities for claims, we utilize case level reviews by outside counsel and an internal analysis to estimate potential losses. The liability is reviewed annually and adjusted as developments warrant. Given the unpredictability of E O and other claims and of litigation that could flow from them, it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period.

Efforts to reduce healthcare costs and alter healthcare financing practices could adversely affect our business. 
 The U.S. healthcare industry is subject to increased governmental regulation at both the federal and state levels. Certain proposals have been made at the federal and state government levels in an effort to control healthcare costs, including proposing to lower reimbursement under the Medicare program. These proposals include single payor government funded healthcare and price controls on prescription drugs. If these or similar efforts are successful, our business and operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, changing political, economic and regulatory influences may affect healthcare financing and reimbursement practices. If the current healthcare financing and reimbursement system changes significantly, our business could be materially adversely affected. Congress periodically considers proposals to reform the U.S. healthcare system such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act in 2010. Our Insurance Company Partners may react to these proposals and the uncertainty surrounding them by reducing or delaying purchases of services that we provide. We cannot predict what effect, if any, these proposals may have on our business. Other legislative or market-driven changes in the healthcare system that we cannot anticipate could also materially adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, consolidated financial position or consolidated cash flow from operations. 
 Risks Relating to Intellectual Property and Cybersecurity 
 Our business depends on a strong brand, and any failure to maintain, protect, defend and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to grow our business, particularly in new markets where we have limited brand recognition. 
 We have developed, and will continue to develop, a strong brand that we believe has contributed significantly to the success of our business. Maintaining, protecting and enhancing those brands is critical to growing our business, particularly in new markets where we have limited brand recognition. If we do not successfully build and maintain a strong brand, our business could be materially harmed. Maintaining and enhancing the quality of our brand may require us to make substantial investments in areas such as marketing, community relations, outreach and employee training. We actively engage in advertisements, targeted promotional mailings and email communications, and engage on a regular basis in public relations and sponsorship activities. These investments may be substantial and may fail to encompass the optimal range of traditional, online and social advertising media to achieve maximum exposure and benefit to our brand. Moreover, our brand promotion activities may not generate brand awareness or yield increased revenue and, even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building our brand. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand, we may fail to attract new Clients or retain our existing Clients to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts. 
 We believe that our portfolio of trademarks (some of which are pending registration) have significant value and that these and other intellectual property are valuable assets that are critical to our success. Unauthorized uses or other infringement, misappropriation or violation of our trademarks, service marks or other intellectual property could diminish the value of our brand and may adversely affect our business. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every market in which we operate. Moreover, the laws of some countries do not protect intellectual property and proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries may be inadequate. Additionally, we cannot guarantee that future trademark registrations for pending or future applications will issue, or that any registered trademarks will be enforceable or provide adequate protection of our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. The United States Patent and Trademark Office and various foreign trademark offices also require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the trademark registration process and after a registration has issued. There are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or cancellation of a trademark filing, resulting in partial or complete loss of trademark rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If this occurs, our competitors might be able to enter the market under identical or similar brands. 
 Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could damage our brand and impair our ability to compete effectively. Even where we have effectively secured statutory protection for our trademarks and other intellectual property, our competitors and other third parties may infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate our intellectual property. In the course of litigation, or as a preventative measure, such competitors and other third parties may attempt to challenge the scope of our rights or invalidate our intellectual property. If such challenges were to be successful, it could limit our ability to prevent others from using similar marks or designs may ultimately result in a reduced distinctiveness of our brand in the minds of consumers. Defending or enforcing our trademark rights, branding practices and other intellectual property could result in the expenditure of significant resources and divert the attention of management, which in turn may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations, even if such defense or enforcement is ultimately successful. 
 33 

Failure to obtain, maintain, protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights, or allegations that we have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated the intellectual property rights of others, could harm our reputation, ability to compete effectively, business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our success and ability to compete depends in part on our ability to obtain, maintain, protect, defend and enforce our intellectual property. To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely on a combination of trademark and copyright laws in the United States and certain other jurisdictions (whether via international convention, treaty or otherwise), trade secret protection, confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements with our affiliates, Colleagues, Clients, Partners and others. However, such measures provide only limited protection and the steps that we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate to deter infringement, misappropriation or other violation of our intellectual property or proprietary information. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, particularly in countries where the laws may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States and where mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be weak. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. In addition, we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights. 
 Failure to protect our intellectual property adequately could harm our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively. In addition, even if we initiate litigation against third parties, such as suits alleging infringement, misappropriation or other violation of our intellectual property, we may not prevail. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management. Our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Additionally, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. An adverse determination of any litigation proceedings could put our intellectual property at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our related intellectual property at risk of not issuing or being cancelled. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Meanwhile, third parties may assert intellectual property-related claims against us, including claims of infringement, misappropriation or other violation of their intellectual property, which may be costly to defend, could require the payment of damages, legal fees, settlement payments, royalty payments and other costs or damages, including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed, and could limit our ability to use or offer certain technologies, products or other intellectual property. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be expensive, take significant time and divert management s resources, time and attention from other business concerns. Moreover, other companies, including our competitors, may have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights and to defend claims that may be brought against them. Successful challenges against us could require us to modify or discontinue our use of technology or business processes where such use is found to infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the rights of others, or require us to purchase costly licenses from third parties, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if a license is available to us, it could be non-exclusive thereby giving our competitors and other third parties access to the same technologies licensed to us, and we may be required to pay significant upfront fees, milestone payments or royalties, which would increase our operating expenses. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Improper disclosure of confidential, personal or proprietary information, whether due to human error, misuse of information by Colleagues, contractors, vendors or third party bad actors, or as a result of cyberattacks or other security incidents with respect to our or our vendors systems, tools, information, processes or services, or failure to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations, orders, industry standards and contractual obligations regarding data privacy, security and/or cybersecurity, could result in regulatory scrutiny, legal and financial liability, reputational harm, lost revenue, and remediation costs, and could have an adverse effect on our business and/or operations. 
 We maintain confidential, personal and proprietary information relating to our Company, our Colleagues, our Insurance Company Partners, our vendors and our actual and prospective Clients. This information could include personally identifiable information, protected health information, such as information regarding the medical history of Clients, financial information, and other categories of sensitive or protected information. We are subject to laws, rules, regulations, orders, industry standards, contractual obligations and other legal obligations relating to the collection, use, retention, security, transfer, storage, disposition and other processing of this information. These requirements may also apply to transfers of information among our affiliates, as well as to transactions we enter into with unaffiliated third-parties. 
 34 

Cybersecurity risks have significantly increased in recent years, in part, because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to exchange information and conduct transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of computer hackers, organized crime, terrorists, and other external parties, including foreign state actors. We have in the past and may in the future be subject to cyberattacks. These cyberattacks could include computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, phishing attacks, social engineering attacks, denial of service or information, improper access by employees or third-party partners or other security breaches that have or could in the future result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our confidential, proprietary, personal, and other information concerning Colleagues, Clients, Insurance Company Partners, vendors or consumers, or otherwise materially disrupt our network access or business operations. 
 Cybersecurity breaches, cyberattacks and other similar incidents, including, among other things, computer viruses, denial of service or information attacks, ransomware attacks, credential stuffing, social engineering, human error, fraud, unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems, malware infections, phishing campaigns and vulnerability exploit attempts could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications or those of our vendors and impair our ability to provide services to our Clients and protect the privacy of their data. Any such incidents may also compromise confidential business information, result in intellectual property or other confidential or proprietary information being lost or stolen, including Client, Colleague or Company data, which could harm our reputation, competitive position or otherwise adversely affect our business. Cyber threats are constantly evolving, which makes it more difficult to detect cybersecurity incidents, assess their severity or impact in a timely manner, and successfully defend against them. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic generally is increasing the attack surface available to criminals, as more companies and individuals work remotely and otherwise work online. Consequently, the risk of a cybersecurity incident has increased, and as cybersecurity threats evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate or remediate any information security vulnerabilities, security breaches, cyberattacks or other similar incidents. We cannot provide assurances that our preventative efforts, or those of our vendors or service providers, will be successful, and we may not be able to anticipate all security breaches, cyberattacks or other similar incidents, detect or react to such incidents in a timely manner, implement guaranteed preventive measures against such incidents, or adequately remediate any such incident. 
 Although we maintain policies, procedures and technical safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of confidential, personal and proprietary information, we cannot eliminate the risk of, and have in the past experienced, improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable information and related costs to mitigate the consequences from such events. It is possible that the measures we implement, including our security controls over personal data and training of Colleagues on data security, may not prevent improper access to, disclosure of or misuse of confidential, personal or proprietary information. This could cause harm to our reputation, create legal exposure or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of commissions and fees. In addition, improper access to or disclosure of personal and proprietary information could occur in a target we acquire prior to the acquisition or as a result of actions taken prior to the acquisition or during the integration period. Even if we receive indemnification for such events (which may not be the cure), such events could cause harm to our reputation, create legal exposure or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data. 
 The occurrence of any security breach, cyberattack or other similar incident with respect to our or our vendors systems, or our failure to make adequate or timely disclosures to the public, regulators, law enforcement agencies or affected individuals, as applicable, following any such event, could cause harm to our reputation, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, expose us to civil litigation, fines, damages or injunctions or subject us to liability under applicable data privacy, cybersecurity and other laws, rules and regulations, resulting in increased costs or loss of commissions and fees, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for cybersecurity liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that our insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. 
 We are subject to complex and frequently changing laws, rules and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we operate relating to the collection, use, retention, security, transfer, storage, disposition and other processing of personal information. For example, legislators in the United States are proposing new and more robust cybersecurity legislation in light of the recent broad-based cyberattacks at a number of companies. These and similar initiatives around the country could increase the cost of developing, implementing or securing our networks, tools, systems and other information technology assets and require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies, adding to our information technology and compliance costs. Ensuring that our collection, use, retention, security, transfer, storage, disposition and other processing of personal information complies with applicable laws, regulations, rules and standards regarding data privacy and cybersecurity in relevant jurisdictions can increase operating costs, impact the development of new products or services, and reduce operational efficiency.

At the federal level, we are subject to, among other laws, rules and regulations, the GLBA, which requires financial institutions to, among other things, periodically disclose their privacy policies and practices relating to sharing personal information and, in some cases, enables retail customers to opt out of the sharing of certain personal information with unaffiliated third parties. The GLBA also requires financial institutions to implement an information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of consumer records and information. We are also subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission, which regulates unfair or deceptive acts or practices, including with respect to data privacy and cybersecurity. Moreover, the United States Congress has recently considered, and is currently considering, various proposals for more comprehensive data privacy and cybersecurity legislation, to which we may be subject if passed. Data privacy and cybersecurity are also areas of increasing state legislative focus and we are, or may in the future become, subject to various state laws and regulations regarding data privacy and cybersecurity. For example, the California Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (the CCPA ), which became effective on January 1, 2020, applies to for-profit businesses that conduct business in California and meet certain revenue or data collection thresholds. The CCPA gives California residents the right to, among other things, request disclosure of information collected about them and whether that information has been sold to others, request deletion of personal information (subject to certain exceptions), opt out of the sale of their personal information, and not be discriminated against for exercising these rights. The CCPA contains several exemptions, including an exemption applicable to personal information that is collected, processed, sold or disclosed pursuant to the GLBA. Further, effective in most material respects starting on January 1, 2023, the California Privacy Rights Act CPR (which was passed via a ballot initiative as part of the November 2020 election) will significantly modify the CCPA, including by expanding California residents rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information. The CPRA also creates a new state agency which will be vested with authority to implement and enforce the CCPA and the CPRA. Other states where we do business, or may in the future do business, or from which we otherwise collect, or may in the future otherwise collect, personal information of residents have adopted or are considering adopting similar laws. For example, Virginia and Colorado have recently adopted comprehensive data privacy laws similar to the CCPA, which will go into effect in January and July of 2023, respectively. In addition, laws in all 50 U.S. states generally require businesses to provide notice under certain circumstances to consumers whose personal information has been improperly accessed, disclosed or otherwise compromised as a result of a data breach. Certain state laws and regulations may be more stringent, broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights, with respect to personal information than federal or other state laws and regulations, and such laws and regulations may differ from each other, which may complicate compliance efforts and increase compliance costs. Aspects of the CCPA, the CPRA, and other federal and state laws and regulations relating to data privacy and cybersecurity, as well as their enforcement, remain unclear, and we may be required to modify our practices in an effort to comply with them. 
 Further, while we strive to publish and prominently display privacy policies that are accurate, comprehensive, and compliant with applicable laws, regulations, rules and industry standards, we cannot ensure that our privacy policies and other statements regarding our practices will be sufficient to protect us from claims, proceedings, liability or adverse publicity relating to data privacy or cybersecurity. Although we endeavor to comply with our privacy policies, we may at times fail to do so or be alleged to have failed to do so. The publication of our privacy policies and other documentation that provide promises and assurances about privacy, data protection and cybersecurity can subject us to potential federal or state action if they are found to be deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our actual practices. 
 Any actual or perceived failure to adhere to, or successfully implement processes in response to, changing legal or regulatory requirements in this area or to comply with our privacy policies could result in legal liability, including litigation (including class actions), claims, proceedings, regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, governmental investigations, enforcement actions, the expenditure of substantial costs, time and other resources, damage to our reputation in the marketplace and other adverse impacts, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our business depends on information processing systems. Data breaches or other security incidents with respect to our or our vendors' information processing systems may hurt our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our ability to provide insurance services to Clients and to create and maintain comprehensive tracking and reporting of Client accounts depends on our capacity to collect, store, retrieve and otherwise process data, manage significant databases and expand and periodically upgrade our information processing capabilities. As our operations evolve, we will need to continue to make investments in new and enhanced information systems. Additionally, as our information system providers revise and upgrade their hardware, software and equipment technology, we may encounter difficulties integrating these new technologies into our business. Interruption or loss of our information processing capabilities or adverse consequences from implementing new or enhanced systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 36 

In the course of providing financial services, we may electronically store, transmit or otherwise process personally identifiable information, such as social security numbers or credit card or bank information, of Clients or employees of Clients. Breaches in data security or infiltration of our network security by unauthorized persons could cause interruptions in operations and damage to our reputation, among other adverse impacts. While we maintain policies, procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information, we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of, and have in the past experienced, improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable information and related costs to mitigate the consequences from such events. Privacy laws, rules and regulations are matters of growing public concern and are continuously changing in the states in which we operate. The failure to adhere to or successfully implement procedures to respond to these laws, rules and regulations could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation. 
 Further, despite security measures we and our vendors take, our systems and those of our vendors may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, unauthorized access, viruses or other disruptive problems. As we continue to expand our business through Partnerships, we may be exposed to increased vulnerability to data breaches, cybersecurity attacks and other security incidents during the integration of information systems. If our systems or facilities were infiltrated or damaged, our Clients could experience data loss, financial loss and significant business interruption leading to a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify protective measures, to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures or to make required notifications. 
 We rely on the availability and performance of information technology services provided by third parties. 
 While we maintain some of our critical information technology systems, we also depend on third-party service providers to provide important information technology services relating to, among other things, agency management services, sales and service support, network, device and event monitoring, cybersecurity, electronic communications and certain finance functions. If the service providers to which we outsource these functions do not perform effectively, we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings and may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers. Depending on the function involved, such errors may also lead to business disruption, processing inefficiencies, the loss of or damage to intellectual property through a security breach, the loss of sensitive, personal or confidential data through a security breach, or otherwise. While we and our third-party service providers have not experienced any significant disruption, failure or breach impacting our or their information technology systems, any such disruption, failure or breach could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Risks Relating to our Organizational Structure 
 We are a holding company with our principal asset being our 53 ownership interest in BRP, and our Pre-IPO LLC Members, whose interest in our business may be different from yours, have approval rights over certain transactions and actions taken by us or BRP. 
 We are a holding company, and our principal asset is our direct or indirect ownership of 53 of the outstanding LLC Units. We have no independent means of generating commissions and fees. 
 
 Further, we are a party to a Stockholders Agreement entered into in connection with the initial public offering with the Pre-IPO LLC Members. Pursuant to the terms of the Stockholders Agreement, so long as the Pre-IPO LLC Members and their permitted transferees (collectively, the Holders beneficially own at least 10 of the aggregate number of outstanding shares of our common stock (the Substantial Ownership Requirement ), the Holders have approval rights over certain transactions and actions taken by us and BRP, including: 
 
 a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of BRP and its subsidiaries; 
 any dissolution, liquidation or reorganization (including filing for bankruptcy) of BRP and its subsidiaries or any acquisition or disposition of any asset for consideration in excess of 5 of our and our subsidiaries' total assets on a consolidated basis; 
 the incurrence, guarantee, assumption or refinancing of indebtedness, or grant of a security interest, in excess of 10 of total assets (or that would cause aggregate indebtedness or guarantees thereof to exceed 10 of total assets); 
 the issuance of certain additional equity interests of the Company, BRP or any of their subsidiaries in an amount exceeding 10 million (other than pursuant to an equity incentive plan that has been approved by our board of directors); 
 the establishment or amendment of any equity, purchase or bonus plan for the benefit of employees, consultants, officers or directors; 
 any capital or other expenditure in excess of 5 of total assets; 
 37 

the declaration or payment of dividends on Class A common stock or distributions by BRP on LLC Units other than tax distributions as defined in the Amended LLC Agreement; 
 changing the number of directors on our board of directors; 
 hiring, termination or replacement of, establishment of compensation (including benefits) payable to, or making other significant decisions involving, our or BRP's senior management and key employees, including our Chief Executive Officer, including entry into or modification of employment agreements, adopting or modifying plans relating to any incentive securities or employee benefit plans or granting incentive securities or benefits under any existing plans; 
 changing our or BRP s jurisdiction of incorporation; 
 changing the location of our or BRP s headquarters; 
 changing our or BRP s name; 
 changing our or BRP s fiscal year; 
 changing our public accounting firm; 
 amendments to our or BRP s governing documents; and 
 adopting a shareholder rights plan. 
 
 Furthermore, the Stockholders Agreement provides that, for so long as the Substantial Ownership Requirement is met, the Holders may designate the nominees for a majority of the members of our board of directors, including the Chairman of our board of directors. 
 
 In addition, a group comprised of Lowry Baldwin, our Chairman, Baldwin Insurance Group Holdings, LLC, an entity controlled by Lowry Baldwin, Elizabeth Krystyn, Laura Sherman, Trevor Baldwin, our Chief Executive Officer, Kris Wiebeck, our Chief Strategy Officer, John Valentine, our Chief Partnership Officer, Dan Galbraith, our Chief Operating Officer, and Brad Hale, our Chief Financial Officer, and certain trusts established by such individuals, have entered into a Voting Agreement, as amended, with Lowry Baldwin, our Chairman, pursuant to which, in connection with any meeting of our shareholders or any written consent of our shareholders, each such person and trust party will agree to vote or exercise their right to consent in the manner directed by Lowry Baldwin. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Lowry Baldwin through the Voting Agreement beneficially owns 29.8 of the voting power of our common stock. 
 
 This concentration of ownership and voting power may also delay, defer or even prevent an acquisition by a third party or other change of control of our Company, which could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of Class A common stock and may make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of the Holders, even if such events are in the best interests of stockholders other than the Holders. Furthermore, this concentration of voting power with Holders may have a negative impact on the price of our Class A common stock. In addition, the Holders will have the ability to designate the nominees for a majority of the members of our board of directors, including the Chairman of our board of directors, until the Substantial Ownership Requirement is no longer met. As a result, the Holders may not be inclined to permit us to issue additional shares of Class A common stock, including for the facilitation of acquisitions, if it would dilute their holdings below the Substantial Ownership Requirement. 
 
 Furthermore, Holders interests may not be fully aligned with yours, which could lead to actions that are not in your best interests. Because the Holders hold a majority of their economic interests in our business through BRP rather than through BRP Group, they may have conflicting interests with holders of shares of our Class A common stock. For example, the Holders may be in a different tax position than holders of shares of our Class A common stock, which could influence their decisions regarding whether and when BRP should dispose of assets or incur new or refinance existing indebtedness, especially in light of the existence of the Tax Receivable Agreement, and whether and when we should undergo certain changes of control for purposes of the Tax Receivable Agreement or terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement. In addition, the structuring of future transactions may take into consideration these tax or other considerations even where no similar benefit would accrue to holders of shares of our Class A common stock. Pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, if the IRS makes audit adjustments to BRP s federal income tax returns, it may assess and collect any taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) resulting from such audit adjustment directly from BRP. If, as a result of any such audit adjustment, BRP is required to make payments of taxes, penalties and interest, BRP s cash available for distributions to us may be substantially reduced. These rules are not applicable to BRP for tax years beginning on or prior to December 31, 2017. In addition, the Holders significant ownership in us and approval rights under the Stockholders Agreement may discourage someone from making a significant equity investment in us, or could discourage transactions involving a change in control, including transactions in which you as a holder of shares of our Class A common stock might otherwise receive a premium for your shares over the then-current market price. 
 38 

We are dependent upon distributions from BRP to pay dividends, if any, and taxes, make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and pay other expenses. 
 As the sole managing member of BRP, we intend to cause BRP to make distributions to the holders of LLC Units and us, in amounts sufficient to (i) cover all applicable taxes payable by us and the holders of LLC Units, (ii) allow us to make any payments required under the Tax Receivable Agreement and (iii) fund dividends to our stockholders in accordance with our dividend policy, to the extent that our board of directors declares such dividends. 
 Deterioration in the financial conditions, earnings or cash flow of BRP and its subsidiaries for any reason could limit or impair their ability to pay such distributions. Additionally, to the extent that we need funds and BRP is restricted from making such distributions to us under applicable law or regulation, as a result of covenants in its debt agreements or otherwise, we may not be able to obtain such funds on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and, as a result, could suffer a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition. 
 In certain circumstances, BRP will be required to make distributions to us and the other holders of LLC Units, and the distributions that BRP will be required to make may be substantial. 
 Under the Amended LLC Agreement, BRP will generally be required from time to time to make pro rata distributions in cash to us and the other holders of LLC Units at certain assumed tax rates in amounts that are intended to be sufficient to cover the taxes on our and the other LLC Unit holders respective allocable shares of the taxable income of BRP. As a result of (i) potential differences in the amount of net taxable income allocable to us and the other LLC Unit holders, (ii) the lower tax rate applicable to corporations than individuals and (iii) the favorable tax benefits that we anticipate receiving from (a) previous acquisitions by BRP Group of LLC Units and future taxable redemptions or exchanges of LLC Units for shares of our Class A common stock or cash and (b) payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, we expect that these tax distributions will be in amounts that exceed our tax liabilities and obligations to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Our board of directors will determine the appropriate uses for any excess cash so accumulated, which may include, among other uses, dividends, repurchases of our Class A common stock, the payment of obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement and the payment of other expenses. We will have no obligation to distribute such cash (or other available cash other than any declared dividend) to our stockholders. No adjustments to the redemption or exchange ratio of LLC Units for shares of Class A common stock will be made as a result of either (i) any cash distribution by us or (ii) any cash that we retain and do not distribute to our stockholders. To the extent that we do not distribute such excess cash as dividends on our Class A common stock and instead, for example, hold such cash balances or lend them to BRP, holders of LLC Units would benefit from any value attributable to such cash balances as a result of their ownership of Class A common stock following a redemption or exchange of their LLC Units. 
 We will be required to pay BRP s LLC Members and any other persons that become parties to the Tax Receivable Agreement for certain tax benefits we may receive, and the amounts we may pay could be significant. 
 Previous acquisitions by BRP Group of LLC Units from BRP's LLC Members and future taxable redemptions or exchanges by BRP s LLC Members of LLC Units for shares of our Class A common stock or cash, as well as other transactions described herein, are expected to result in tax basis adjustments to the assets of BRP that will be allocated to us and thus produce favorable tax attributes. These tax attributes would not be available to us in the absence of those transactions. The tax basis adjustments are expected to reduce the amount of tax that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future. 
 The Tax Receivable Agreement with BRP s LLC Members provides for the payment by us to BRP s LLC Members of 85 of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that we actually realize as a result of (i) any increase in tax basis in BRP Group s assets resulting from (a) previous acquisitions by BRP Group of LLC Units from BRP s LLC Members, (b) the purchase of LLC Units from BRP s LLC Members using the net proceeds from any future offering, (c) redemptions or exchanges by BRP s LLC Members of LLC Units for shares of our Class A common stock or cash or (d) payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and (ii) tax benefits related to imputed interest resulting from payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement. The payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement are our obligations and not obligations of BRP. 
 The actual increases in tax basis with respect to future taxable redemptions, exchanges or purchases of LLC Units, as well as the amount and timing of any payments we are required to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement will depend on a number of factors, including the market value of our Class A common stock at the time of future redemptions or exchanges, the prevailing federal tax rates applicable to us over the life of the Tax Receivable Agreement (as well as the assumed combined state and local tax rate), the amount and timing of the taxable income that we generate in the future and the extent to which future redemptions, exchanges or purchases of LLC Units are taxable transactions. 
 39 

Payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are not conditioned on BRP s LLC Members continued ownership of us. There may be a material negative effect on our liquidity if the payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement exceed the actual benefits we receive in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement and/or distributions to us by BRP are not sufficient to permit us to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. 
 In addition, although we are not aware of any issue that would cause the IRS to challenge the tax basis increases or other benefits arising under the Tax Receivable Agreement, BRP s LLC Members will not reimburse us for any payments previously made if such tax basis increases or other tax benefits are subsequently disallowed, except that any excess payments made to BRP s LLC Members will be netted against future payments otherwise to be made under the Tax Receivable Agreement, if any, after our determination of such excess. As a result, in such circumstances, we could make payments to BRP s LLC Members under the Tax Receivable Agreement that are greater than our actual cash tax savings and we may not be able to recoup those payments, which could negatively impact our liquidity. 
 In addition, the Tax Receivable Agreement provides that, upon certain mergers, asset sales or other forms of business combination, or certain other changes of control, our or our successor s obligations with respect to tax benefits would be based on certain assumptions, including that we or our successor would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the increased tax deductions and tax basis and other benefits covered by the Tax Receivable Agreement. As a result, upon a change of control, we could be required to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement that are greater than the specified percentage of our actual cash tax savings, which could negatively impact our liquidity. 
 This provision of the Tax Receivable Agreement may result in situations where BRP s LLC Members have interests that differ from or are in addition to those of our other stockholders. In addition, we could be required to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement that are substantial and in excess of our, or a potential acquirer s, actual cash savings in income tax. 
 Our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement will also apply with respect to any person who is issued LLC Units in the future and who becomes a party to the Tax Receivable Agreement. 
 Finally, because we are a holding company with no operations of our own, our ability to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement depends on the ability of BRP to make distributions to us. The JPM Credit Agreement restricts the ability of BRP to make distributions to us, which could affect our ability to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. To the extent that we are unable to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid, which could negatively impact our results of operations and could also affect our liquidity in periods in which such payments are made. 
 Risks Relating to Ownership of our Class A Common Stock 
 Some provisions of Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may deter third parties from acquiring us and diminish the value of our Class A common stock. 
 Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws provide for, among other things: 
 division of our board of directors into three classes of directors, with each class as equal in number as possible, serving staggered three-year terms; 
 until the Substantial Ownership Requirement is no longer met, the Holders may designate a majority of the nominees for election to our board of directors, including the nominee for election to serve as Chairman of our board of directors; 
 our ability to issue additional shares of Class A common stock and to issue preferred stock with terms that our board of directors may determine, in each case without stockholder approval (other than as specified in our certificate of incorporation); 
 the absence of cumulative voting in the election of directors; and 
 advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations. 
 These provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company that is in the best interest of our minority stockholders. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our Class A common stock if they are viewed as discouraging future takeover attempts. These provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to nominate directors for election to our board of directors and take other corporate actions. 
 40 

Certain statutory provisions afforded to stockholders are not applicable to us. 
 Our certificate of incorporation and Stockholders Agreement provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the doctrine of corporate opportunity under Delaware law will only apply against our directors and officers and their respective affiliates for competing activities related to insurance brokerage activities. This doctrine will not apply to any business activity other than insurance brokerage activities. Furthermore, the Pre-IPO LLC Members have business relationships outside of our business. 
 We may issue a substantial amount of our common stock in the future, which could cause dilution to investors and otherwise adversely affect our stock price. 
 A key element of our growth strategy is to make acquisitions. As part of our acquisition strategy, we may issue shares of our common stock, as well as LLC Units of BRP, as consideration for such acquisitions. These issuances could be significant. To the extent that we make acquisitions and issue our shares of common stock as consideration, your equity interest in us will be diluted. Any such issuance will also increase the number of outstanding shares of common stock that will be eligible for sale in the future. Persons receiving shares of our common stock in connection with these acquisitions may be more likely to sell off their common stock, which may influence the price of our common stock. In addition, the potential issuance of additional shares in connection with anticipated acquisitions could lessen demand for our common stock and result in a lower price than might otherwise be obtained. We may issue a significant amount of our common stock in the future for other purposes as well, including in connection with financings, including to finance the cash portion of acquisition consideration to execute on our Partnership strategy, for compensation purposes, in connection with strategic transactions or for other purposes. 
 We expect that our stock price will be volatile, which could cause the value of your investment to decline, and you may not be able to resell your shares for a profit. 
 Securities markets worldwide have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, could reduce the market price of our Class A common stock regardless of our results of operations. The trading price of our Class A common stock is likely to be volatile and subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors, including: 
 market conditions in the broader stock market in general, or in our industry in particular; 
 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financials and results of operations; 
 introduction of new products and services by us or our competitors; 
 issuance of new or changed securities analysts reports or recommendations; 
 investor perceptions of us and the industries in which we or our Clients operate; 
 low trading volumes or sales, or anticipated sales, of large blocks of our Class A common stock, including those by our existing investors or our Partners; 
 concentration of Class A common stock ownership; 
 additions or departures of key personnel; 
 regulatory or political developments; 
 litigation and governmental investigations; 
 changing economic and political conditions; 
 the perceived adequacy of our ESG efforts; 
 our ability or perceived ability to: 
 attract new Clients, successfully deploy and implement our products, obtain Client renewals and provide our Clients with excellent Client support; 
 increase our network of Insurance Company Partners and the profit-sharing, override and/or contingent commissions that we earn from such Insurance Company Partners; 
 adequately expand, train, integrate and retain our Colleagues, including our executive officers and senior leaders, and maintain or increase our sales force s productivity; 
 improve our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures to ensure timely and accurate reporting of our operational and financial results; 
 41 

successfully introduce new products and enhance existing products; 
 successfully deploy information technology assets for use by our Colleagues and interaction with our Clients and Insurance Company Partners; 
 adapt to the ever-changing regulatory and legal landscape; 
 protect sensitive, personal and confidential information and data within BRP s custody from third party bad actors; 
 successfully identify and acquire new Partners; 
 successfully integrate Partnerships into the Company in an operationally efficient manner; 
 service our existing indebtedness; 
 access the capital markets or otherwise obtain access to capital to satisfy future needs of the Company; 
 successfully introduce our products to new markets and geographies; and 
 successfully compete against larger companies and new market entrants. 
 announced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by us or our competitors; and 
 new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business, including developments relating to the health care industry and the marketing and sale of Medicare plans. 
 These and other factors may cause the market price and demand for shares of our Class A common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of Class A common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our Class A common stock. In addition, in the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit. Such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management from our business, which could significantly harm our profitability and reputation. 
 Our ability to pay dividends to our Class A common stockholders may be limited by our holding company structure, contractual restrictions and regulatory requirements. 
 We are a holding company and have no material assets other than our ownership of LLC Units in BRP and we do not have any independent means of generating commissions and fees. We intend to cause BRP to make pro rata distributions to BRP s LLC Members and us in an amount at least sufficient to allow us and BRP s LLC Members to pay all applicable taxes, to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and to pay our corporate and other overhead expenses. BRP is a distinct legal entity and may be subject to legal or contractual restrictions that, under certain circumstances, may limit our ability to obtain cash from them. If BRP is unable to make distributions, we may not receive adequate distributions, which could materially and adversely affect our dividends and financial position and our ability to fund any dividends to Class A common stock. 
 Our board of directors will periodically review the cash generated from our business and the capital expenditures required to finance our global growth plans and determine whether to declare periodic dividends to our stockholders. Our board of directors will take into account general economic and business conditions, including our financial condition and results of operations, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, including restrictions and covenants contained in the JPM Credit Agreement, business prospects and other factors that our board of directors considers relevant. In addition, the JPM Credit Agreement limits the amount of distributions that BRP can make to us and the purposes for which distributions could be made. Accordingly, we may not be able to pay dividends to our Class A common stockholders even if our board of directors would otherwise deem it appropriate. Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section under Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information. 
 42 

Short selling could increase the volatility of our stock price of our Class A Common Stock. 
 Short selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather has borrowed or intends to borrow from a third party with the intention of buying identical securities at a later date to return to the lender. A short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the sale. As it is therefore in the short seller s interest for the price of the stock to decline, some short sellers publish, or arrange for the publication of, opinions or characterizations regarding the relevant issuer, its business prospects and similar matters, calculated to or which may create negative market momentum, and which may permit them to obtain profits for themselves as a result of selling the stock short. These opinions and characterizations may contain falsehoods, incomplete and deceptive statements and/or otherwise be misleading. Issuers whose securities have historically had limited trading volumes, and issuers who are susceptible to relatively high volatility levels, can be particularly vulnerable to such short seller attacks. In addition to impacting the pricing of our stock, such short seller attacks could also divert the time and attention of our management from our business, which could significantly harm our profitability and reputation. 
 If securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they publish negative evaluations of our Class A common stock, the price of our Class A common stock could decline. 
 The trading market for our Class A common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We currently have research coverage by industry and securities analysts. If no or few analysts continue coverage of us, the trading price of our Class A common stock would likely decrease. If one or more of the analysts covering our business downgrade their evaluations of our Class A common stock, the price of our Class A common stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease to cover our Class A common stock, we could lose visibility in the trading market for our Class A common stock, which in turn could cause our Class A common stock price to decline. 
 If we experience material weaknesses or substantial deficiencies in the future, or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock. 
 If we identify material weaknesses or substantial deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, or if we are unable to comply with the demands that will be placed upon us as a public company, including the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, in a timely manner, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results, or report them within the timeframes required by the SEC. In addition, if we are unable to disclose that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, we may face restricted access to the capital markets, and our stock price may be adversely affected. 
 
 ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS 
 None. 
 
 ITEM 2. PROPERTIES 
 Our corporate headquarters is located in leased offices in Tampa, Florida. The leases consist of approximately 105,000 square feet and expire in August 2030. Our insurance brokerage business leases office space in approximately 125 operating locations located in 23 states throughout the U.S. These offices are generally located in shopping centers, small office parks and office buildings, with lease terms expiring within one to eight years. These facilities are suitable for our needs and we believe that they are well maintained. 
 
 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 We are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

 ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 
 Our Class A common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market Nasdaq under the symbol BRP. Our Class B Common Stock is not listed nor traded on any stock exchange. 
 On February 20, 2023, there were 121 shareholders of record of our Class A common stock and 62 shareholders of record of our Class B common stock. The number of record holders does not include persons who held shares of our Class A common stock in nominee or street name accounts through brokers. 
 Dividend Policy 
 Subject to funds being legally available, we intend to cause BRP to make pro rata distributions to the holders of LLC Units and us in an amount at least sufficient to allow us and the holders of LLC Units to pay all applicable taxes, to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and to pay our corporate and other overhead expenses. The declaration and payment of any dividends will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors, which may change our dividend policy at any time. We do not currently pay dividends outside of tax payments. Should that change, our board of directors will take into account: 
 general economic and business conditions; 
 our financial condition and operating results; 
 our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs; 
 our capital requirements; 
 contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions and implications on the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries (including BRP) to us; and 
 such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant. 
 BRP Group is a holding company and has no material assets other than its ownership of LLC Units in BRP, and as a consequence, our ability to declare and pay dividends to the holders of our Class A common stock will be subject to the ability of BRP to provide distributions to us. If BRP makes such distributions, the holders of LLC Units will be entitled to receive equivalent distributions from BRP. However, because we must pay taxes, make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and pay our expenses, amounts ultimately distributed as dividends to holders of our Class A common stock are expected to be less than the amounts distributed by BRP to the holders of LLC Units on a per share basis. 
 Assuming BRP makes distributions to its members in any given year, the determination to pay dividends, if any, to our Class A common stockholders out of the portion, if any, of such distributions remaining after our payment of taxes, Tax Receivable Agreement payments and expenses (any such portion, an excess distribution will be made by our board of directors. Because our board of directors may determine to pay or not pay dividends to our Class A common stockholders, our Class A common stockholders may not necessarily receive dividend distributions relating to excess distributions, even if BRP makes such distributions to us.

 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF 2022 FINANCIAL RESULTS 
 We are a rapidly growing independent insurance distribution firm delivering solutions that give our Clients the peace of mind to pursue their purpose, passion and dreams. The following is a summary of our 2022 financial results: 
 Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 were 980.7 million, an increase of 413.4 million, or 73 , year over year. This increase was related to amounts attributable to Partners acquired during 2021 and 2022 prior to their having reached the twelve-month owned mark (such amounts, the Partnership Contribution and organic growth. The Partnership Contribution accounted for 280.7 million of the increase to revenues and organic growth accounted for 132.6 million. 
 Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 were 1.0 billion, an increase of 412.9 million, or 69 , year over year. The increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to commissions, employee compensation and benefits, which grew in conjunction with our revenues and due to hiring to support our growth. We also had increases in other operating expenses, related to our continued investments in new product development and ongoing Partnership integration, and amortization costs, related to our Partnerships. 
 Interest expense, net, for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 71.1 million, an increase of 44.2 million, or 164 , year over year. Interest expense, net, increased as a result of the higher interest rate environment during 2022 in addition to higher average borrowings outstanding under the JPM Credit Agreement. 
 Other income, net, for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 26.1 million, an increase of 25.7 million year over year. Other income, net, increased as a result of a gain on interest rate caps recorded in connection with rising interest rates and market estimates for future rate increases. 
 Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 76.7 million, an increase of 18.6 million as compared to net loss of 58.1 million in the same period of 2021. 
 Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 196.5 million, an increase of 83.6 million year over year. Adjusted EBITDA Margin was 20 for each of 2022 and 2021. 
 Organic Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 700.1 million as compared to 295.0 million for the same period of 2021. Organic Revenue Growth was 132.6 million, or 23 , for 2022 and 54.0 million, or 22 , for 2021. Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below for reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Organic Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. 
 
 PARTNERSHIPS 
 During 2022, we completed three Partnerships for an aggregate purchase price of 413.8 million. We amended our JPM Credit Agreement to upsize the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Facility thereunder from 475.0 million to 600.0 million to assist with funding our 2022 Partnerships. Partnerships completed during 2022 added 4.4 million of premiums, commissions and fees receivable, 223.7 million of intangible assets and 187.8 million of goodwill to the consolidated balance sheet. During 2021, we completed 16 Partnerships for an aggregate purchase price of 1.1 billion. We completed a follow-on public offering for aggregate net proceeds of approximately 269.4 million and borrowed an additional 450.0 million under the Term Loan B to assist with funding our 2021 Partnerships. 
 Refer to Note 3 to BRP Group s consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the Partnerships that we have completed during 2022.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 AND 2021 
 For a discussion of our 2020 financial results and a comparison of financial results for the years ended December 31, 2021 to 2020, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 1, 2022. 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results and timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 The following is a discussion of our consolidated results of operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 For the Years Ended December 31, Variance (in thousands, except percentages) 2022 2021 Amount Revenues:

 Seasonality 
 The insurance brokerage market is seasonal and our results of operations are somewhat affected by seasonal trends. Our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margins are typically highest in the first quarter and lowest in the fourth quarter. This variation is primarily due to fluctuations in our revenues, while overhead remains consistent throughout the year. Our revenues are generally highest in the first quarter due to a higher degree of first quarter policy commencements and renewals in Medicare and certain Middle Market lines of business such as employee benefits and commercial. In addition, a higher proportion of our first quarter revenue is derived from our highest margin businesses. 
 47 

Partnerships can significantly impact Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margins in a given year and may increase the amount of seasonality within the business, especially results attributable to Partnerships that have not been fully integrated into our business or owned by us for a full year. 
 Commissions and Fees 
 We earn commissions and fees by facilitating the arrangement between Insurance Company Partners and individuals or businesses for the carrier to provide insurance to the insured party. Our commissions and fees are usually a percentage of the premium paid by the insured and generally depends on the type of insurance, the particular Insurance Company Partner and the nature of the services provided. Under certain arrangements with Clients, we earn pre-negotiated service fees in lieu of commissions. Additionally, we earn policy fees for acting in the capacity of an MGA and fulfilling certain administrative functions on behalf of Insurance Company Partners. We may also receive profit-sharing commissions, or straight overrides, which represent forms of variable consideration from Insurance Company Partners associated with the placement of coverage based primarily on underwriting results, but may also contain considerations for volume, growth or retention. 
 Commissions and fees increased by 413.4 million year over year. The increase relates to the Partnership Contribution of 280.7 million and organic growth of 132.6 million. 
 Major Sources of Commissions and Fees 
 The following table sets forth our commissions and fees by major source by amount for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: 
 For the Years Ended December 31, Variance (in thousands, except percentages) 2022 2021 Amount Commission revenue 786,794 472,495 314,299 67 Profit-sharing revenue 
 66,091 37,392 28,699 77 Consulting and service fee revenue 61,244 30,182 31,062 103 Policy fee and installment fee revenue 
 55,362 19,903 35,459 178 Other income 
 11,229 7,318 3,911 53 Total commissions and fees 980,720 567,290 413,430 
 Commission revenue primarily represents commission revenue earned by providing insurance placement services to Clients. Commission revenue increased by 314.3 million year over year as a result of the Partnership Contribution of 237.2 million and organic growth of 77.1 million. 
 Profit-sharing revenue represents bonus-type revenue that is earned by us as a sales incentive provided by certain Insurance Company Partners. Profit-sharing revenue increased by 28.7 million year over year as a result of Partnership Contribution of 17.8 million and organic growth of 10.9 million. 
 Consulting and service fee revenue represents fees received in lieu of a commission and specialty insurance consulting revenue. Consulting and service fee revenue increased 31.1 million year over year as a result of the Partnership Contribution of 21.8 million and organic growth of 9.2 million. 
 Policy fee and installment fee revenue represents revenue earned by our Specialty Operating Group for acting in the capacity of an MGA and providing payment processing and services and other administrative functions on behalf of Insurance Company Partners. Policy fee and installment fee revenue increased 35.5 million year over year primarily due to organic growth. 
 Other income consists of other fee income and premium financing income generated across all Operating Groups as well as Medicare marketing income that is based on agreed-upon cost reimbursement for fulfilling specific targeted marketing campaigns. Other income increased 3.9 million year over year primarily due to the Partnership Contribution. 
 48 

Commissions, Employee Compensation and Benefits 
 Commissions, employee compensation and benefits is our largest expense. It consists of (a) base compensation comprising salary, bonuses and benefits paid and payable to Colleagues, commissions paid to Colleagues and outside commissions paid to others; and (b) equity-based compensation associated with the grants of restricted and unrestricted stock awards to senior management, Colleagues, Risk Advisors and directors. We expect to continue to experience a general rise in commissions, employee compensation and benefits expense commensurate with expected growth in our revenue and headcount. We operate in competitive markets for human capital and need to maintain competitive compensation levels as we expand geographically and create new products and services. Our Colleague-related costs have risen as a result of the increasingly competitive market and the inflationary environment. In addition, our compensation arrangements with our Colleagues contain significant bonus or commission components driven by the results of our operations. Therefore, as we grow commissions and fees, we expect compensation costs to rise. 
 Commissions, employee compensation and benefits expenses increased by 319.4 million year over year. The Partnership Contribution accounted for 154.1 million of the increase to commissions, employee compensation and benefits. Share-based compensation expense increased 28.2 million as a result of equity grants awarded to all newly hired Colleagues, including those who joined us through Partnerships, and grants to reward Colleagues, including members of senior management (which also includes executive leaders, who will each be paid their entire annual bonuses for the year ended December 31, 2022 in the form of fully-vested shares of Class A common stock in April of 2023). The remaining increase in commissions, employee compensation and benefits expense can be attributed to higher commissions expense relating to our organic growth, higher compensation and benefits related to hiring to support our growth, and the inflationary environment, which has resulted in significant increases in the cost of human capital. 
 Other Operating Expenses 
 Other operating expenses include travel, accounting, legal and other professional fees, placement fees, rent, office expenses and other costs associated with our operations. Our occupancy-related costs and professional services expenses, in particular, generally increase or decrease in relative proportion to the number of our Colleagues and the overall size and scale of our business operations. 
 Other operating expenses increased by 71.5 million year over year related to increases in dues and subscriptions of 22.4 million from integration costs and investment in technology to support our growth, travel and entertainment of 12.6 million relating to integration of our 2021 Partnerships and our leadership and advisor conference, advertising and marketing of 9.5 million, rent expense of 8.5 million relating to expansion of our operating locations, Colleague education and welfare of 5.0 million relating to investments in our Colleagues, licenses and taxes of 4.2 million, repair and maintenance of 3.2 million, and recruiting expense of 2.2 million relating to the increased cost of human capital. 
 Amortization Expense 
 Amortization expense increased by 33.0 million year over year driven by amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with Partnerships during 2021 and 2022. 
 Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration 
 Change in fair value of contingent consideration was a 32.3 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to a 45.2 million loss for the same period of 2021. The fair value loss related to contingent consideration for 2022 was impacted by changes in growth trends of certain partners, offset in part by high market volatility and rising interest rates, which resulted in an overall higher contingent earnout liability value. 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 Interest expense, net, increased by 44.2 million year over year resulting from the high interest rate environment in addition to higher average borrowings outstanding under our JPM Credit Agreement. We expect interest expense to continue to increase during 2023 as a result of recent unprecedented interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve, which directly affect our variable rate debt. 
 Refer to Item 7A. Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risk for further discussion of the impact of rising interest rates on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 49 

Other Income, Net 
 Other income, net, increased by 25.7 million year over year, primarily as a result of a current year gain on interest rate caps of 26.2 million recorded in connection with rising interest rates and market estimates for future rate increases. The current year gain on interest rate caps includes 13.5 million realized in connection with the sale of three interest rate caps and 2.2 million realized from cash settlements. 
 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION COMPARISON OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION AT DECEMBER 31, 2022 TO DECEMBER 31, 2021. 
 Our total assets and total liabilities increased 585.9 million and 633.4 million, respectively, year over year. The most significant changes in assets and liabilities are described below. 
 Premiums, commissions and fees receivable, net increased 191.2 million as a result of revenue growth and the changes in revenue seasonality of our business given the underlying revenue streams of Partnerships. 
 Intangible assets, net increased 155.5 million primarily as a result of our 2022 Partnerships, which contributed 223.7 million to gross intangible assets during 2022, and software development costs of 10.1 million for infrastructure to support our business. These additions were offset in part by 81.7 million of amortization during the year. 
 Goodwill increased 193.3 million as a result of our 2022 Partnerships and measurement period adjustments for certain Partnerships formed in 2021. 
 Premiums payable to insurance companies increased 155.4 million as a result of revenue growth. 
 Accrued expenses and other current liabilities increased 33.5 million as a result of higher accrued compensation and benefits relating to revenue growth and an increase in the number of Colleagues, as well as higher contract liabilities relating to our revenue growth. 
 Related party notes payable decreased 60.0 million as a result of the payment of 61.5 million of these notes during the second quarter of 2022. 
 The revolving line of credit increased 470.0 million as a result of borrowings on our Revolving Facility for funding our 2022 Partnerships and general working capital purposes in 2022. 
 Contingent earnout liabilities increased 8.3 million resulting from an increase of 32.3 million related to fair value adjustments from Partnerships that have outperformed on our platform since the date of Partnership and issuances of 14.9 million at fair value related to our 2022 Partnerships. These increases were offset in part by 38.9 million of settlements, of which 2.1 million were noncash. 
 
 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Organic Revenue, Organic Revenue Growth, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share EPS ), are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered substitutes for GAAP measures, including commissions and fees (for Organic Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth), net income (loss) (for Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin), net income (loss) attributable to BRP Group (for Adjusted Net Income) or diluted earnings (loss) per share (for Adjusted Diluted EPS), which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing our operating performance, you should not consider these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as substitutes for commissions and fees, net income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to BRP Group, diluted earnings (loss) per share or other consolidated income statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies in our industry may define or calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, and accordingly, these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, change in fair value of contingent consideration and certain items of income and expense, including share-based compensation expense, transaction-related Partnership and integration expenses, severance, and certain non-recurring items, including those related to raising capital. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it eliminates the impact of income and expenses that do not relate to business performance, and that the presentation of this measure enhances an investor s understanding of our financial performance. 
 50 

Adjusted EBITDA Margin is Adjusted EBITDA divided by commissions and fees. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is a key metric used by management and our board of directors to assess our financial performance. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA Margin is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it eliminates the impact of income and expenses that do not relate to business performance, and that the presentation of this measure enhances an investor s understanding of our financial performance. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA Margin is helpful in measuring profitability of operations on a consolidated level. 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin have important limitations as analytical tools. For example, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin: 
 do not reflect any cash capital expenditure requirements for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may have to be replaced in the future; 
 do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 
 do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; 
 do not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; 
 do not reflect share-based compensation expense and other non-cash charges; and 
 exclude certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us. 
 We calculate Organic Revenue based on commissions and fees for the relevant period by excluding the first twelve months of commissions and fees generated from new Partners. Organic Revenue Growth is the change in Organic Revenue period-to-period, with prior period results adjusted to include commissions and fees that were excluded in the prior period because the relevant Partners had not yet reached the twelve-month owned mark, but which have reached the twelve-month owned mark in the current period. For example, revenues from a Partner acquired on June 1, 2021 are excluded from Organic Revenue for 2021. However, after June 1, 2022, results from June 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021 for such Partners are compared to results from June 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022 for purposes of calculating Organic Revenue Growth in 2022. Organic Revenue Growth is a key metric used by management and our board of directors to assess our financial performance. We believe that Organic Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth are appropriate measures of operating performance as they allow investors to measure, analyze and compare growth in a meaningful and consistent manner. 
 Adjusted Net Income is presented for the purpose of calculating Adjusted Diluted EPS. We define Adjusted Net Income as net income (loss) attributable to BRP Group adjusted for depreciation, amortization, change in fair value of contingent consideration and certain items of income and expense, including share-based compensation expense, transaction-related Partnership and integration expenses, severance, and certain non-recurring costs that, in the opinion of management, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results, and the related tax effect of those adjustments. We believe that Adjusted Net Income is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it eliminates the impact of expenses that do not relate to business performance. 
 Adjusted Diluted EPS measures our per share earnings excluding certain expenses as discussed above and assuming all shares of Class B common stock were exchanged for Class A common stock. Adjusted Diluted EPS is calculated as Adjusted Net Income divided by adjusted dilutive weighted-average shares outstanding. We believe Adjusted Diluted EPS is useful to investors because it enables them to better evaluate per share operating performance across reporting periods.

 OPERATING GROUP RESULTS 
 Commissions and Fees 
 In the Middle Market, MainStreet and Specialty Operating Groups, the Company generates commissions and fees from insurance placement under both agency bill and direct bill arrangements. In addition, we generate profit-sharing income in each of those segments based on either the underlying book of business or performance, such as loss ratios. In the Middle Market and Specialty Operating Groups, we generate fees from service fee and consulting arrangements. Service fee arrangements are in place with certain customers in lieu of commission arrangements. 
 53 

In the Specialty Operating Group, we generate policy fee and installment fee revenue for acting in the capacity of an MGA and fulfilling certain services on behalf of Insurance Company Partners. 
 In the Medicare Operating Group, we generate commissions and fees in the form of direct bill insurance placement and marketing income. Marketing income is earned through co-branded marketing campaigns with our Insurance Company Partners. 
 The following table sets forth our commissions and fees by Operating Group and for Corporate and Other by amount and as a percentage of our commissions and fees: 
 Commissions and Fees by Operating Group (in thousands, except percentages) For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Percent of Business Percent of Business Variance Operating Group Amount Amount Amount Middle Market 558,776 57 363,822 64 194,954 54 Specialty 307,748 31 144,455 25 163,293 113 MainStreet 118,581 12 34,344 6 84,237 245 Medicare 38,457 4 27,392 5 11,065 40 Corporate and Other (42,842) (4) (2,723) (40,119) n/m 980,720 567,290 413,430 
 __________ 
 n/m not meaningful 
 Commissions and fees for our Middle Market Operating Group increased 195.0 million year over year as a result of the Partnership Contribution of 142.7 million and organic growth of 52.1 million. Organic growth included 43.7 million related to core commissions and fees and 8.4 million related to contingent and other revenue. 
 Commissions and fees for our Specialty Operating Group increased 163.3 million year over year as a result of the Partnership Contribution of 91.9 million and organic growth of 67.8 million. Organic growth included 63.9 million attributable to our renters and homeowners insurance products, of which 27.1 million is related to the QBE Program Administrator Agreement, and 3.9 million related to contingent and other revenue. 
 Commissions and fees for our MainStreet Operating Group increased 84.2 million year over year as a result of the Partnership Contribution of 40.8 million, intercompany revenue of 35.6 million and organic growth of 7.9 million, primarily related to base commissions and fees. Organic growth included 6.1 million related to core commissions and fees and 1.8 million related to contingent and other revenue. 
 Commissions and fees for our Medicare Operating Group increased 11.1 million year over year as a result of the Partnership Contribution of 5.5 million and organic growth of 4.8 million, the majority of which was related to core commissions. 
 The amount reported for Corporate and Other relates to the elimination of intercompany revenue. During 2022, the Middle Market Operating Group recorded intercompany commissions and fees revenue from activity with the Specialty Operating Group of 1.7 million; the Specialty Operating Group recorded intercompany commissions and fees from activity with itself of 3.7 million; the MainStreet Operating Group recorded intercompany commissions and fees from activity with the Middle Market and Specialty Operating Groups of 36.1 million; and the Medicare Operating Group recorded intercompany commissions and fees revenue from activity with itself of 1.3 million. These amounts were eliminated through Corporate and Other. 
 The substantial increase in intercompany commissions and fees is related to the QBE Program Administrator Agreement. A portion of the revenue recognized by the Specialty Operating Group related to this agreement is passed through to the MainStreet Operating Group, who serves as the retail agent. We expect that revenue relating to this agreement will continue to grow as we serve as the MGA on more intersegment revenue such as homeowners insurance sold through the MainStreet Operating Group.

Commissions, Employee Compensation and Benefits 
 The following table sets forth our commissions, employee compensation and benefits by Operating Group and for Corporate and Other by amount and as a percentage of our commissions, employee compensation and benefits: 
 Commissions, Employee Compensation and Benefits by Operating Group (in thousands, except percentages) For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Percent of Business Percent of Business Variance Operating Group Amount Amount Amount Middle Market 385,492 54 234,652 58 150,840 64 Specialty 218,859 31 102,824 26 116,035 113 MainStreet 72,763 10 22,884 6 49,879 218 Medicare 24,969 3 16,309 4 8,660 53 Corporate and Other 17,362 2 23,381 6 (6,019) (26) 719,445 400,050 319,395 
 Commissions, employee compensation and benefits expenses increased across all Operating Groups year over year. The Partnership Contribution accounted for 82.0 million, 30.2 million, 37.9 million, and 3.9 million of the increase to commissions, employee compensation and benefits expenses in the Middle Market, Specialty, MainStreet and Medicare Operating Groups, respectively. The remaining increase in commissions, employee compensation and benefits expenses across all Operating Groups can be attributed to higher commissions expense relating to our organic growth, higher compensation and benefits related to continued investments in our Growth Services team to support our growth, which costs are primarily allocated among the Operating Groups. In addition, there have been significant increases in the cost of human capital in the current year as a result of the increasingly competitive market and the inflationary environment, which has impacted employee compensation and benefits costs. 
 Commissions, employee compensation and benefits expenses for Corporate and Other decreased year over year primarily as a result of an increase of 40.1 million in the elimination of intercompany expense, offset in part by 28.2 million of additional share-based compensation expense. 
 The substantial increase in intercompany commissions, employee compensation and benefits expense for 2022 is related to the QBE Program Administrator Agreement. We expect that commissions, employee compensation and benefits expense relating to this agreement will continue to grow as we serve as the MGA on more intersegment revenue such as homeowners insurance sold through the MainStreet Operating Group. 
 Other Operating Expenses 
 The following table sets forth our other operating expenses by Operating Group and for Corporate and Other by amount and as a percentage of our other operating expenses: 
 Other Operating Expenses by Operating Group (in thousands, except percentages) For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Percent of Business Percent of Business Variance Operating Group Amount Amount Amount Middle Market 73,638 42 50,037 49 23,601 47 Specialty 31,313 18 13,716 13 17,597 128 MainStreet 17,736 10 4,970 5 12,766 257 Medicare 7,966 5 5,289 5 2,677 51 Corporate and Other 43,055 25 28,150 28 14,905 53 173,708 102,162 71,546 
 55 

Other operating expenses for our Middle Market Operating Group increased 23.6 million year over year, driven by higher costs for dues and subscriptions of 9.4 million from Partnership integration costs and our investment in technology to support our growth, rent expense of 5.8 million relating to expansion of our operating locations, travel and entertainment of 5.5 million relating to integration of our Partnerships, settlement expense of 2.0 million, licenses and taxes and Colleague education and welfare relating to investments in our Colleagues of 1.7 million each, and advertising and marketing of 1.3 million. These increases were partially offset by lower costs for professional fees of 2.3 million. 
 Other operating expenses for our Specialty Operating Group increased 17.6 million year over year, driven by higher costs for dues and subscriptions of 8.3 million from Partnership integration costs, primarily associated with the QBE Program Administrator Agreement, and investment in technology to support our growth, travel and entertainment of 2.5 million relating to integration of our Partnerships, bank charges and rent expense of 0.9 million each, bad debt expense of 0.8 million, consulting fees of 0.7 million, and licenses and taxes and Colleague education and welfare relating to investments in our Colleagues of 0.6 million each. 
 Other operating expenses for our MainStreet Operating Group increased 12.8 million year over year, driven by higher costs for advertising and marketing of 4.1 million, rent expense of 2.6 million relating to expansion of our operating locations, professional fees of 1.7 million, dues and subscriptions of 1.5 million from our investment in technology to support our growth, and recruiting expense of 0.7 million relating to the increased cost of human capital. 
 Other operating expenses for our Medicare Operating Group increased 2.7 million year over year, driven by higher costs for advertising and marketing of 1.9 million and dues and subscriptions of 0.6 million. 
 Other operating expenses in Corporate and Other increased 14.9 million year over year due to higher costs for travel and entertainment of 3.8 million, dues and subscriptions of 2.7 million relating to our investment in technology to support our growth, Colleague education and welfare of 2.4 million relating to investments in our Colleagues, repairs and maintenance of 2.2 million, advertising and marketing of 1.7 million and licenses and taxes of 1.5 million. 
 Amortization Expense 
 The following table sets forth our amortization by Operating Group and for Corporate and Other by amount and as a percentage of our amortization: Amortization Expense by Operating Group (in thousands, except percentages) For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Percent of Business Percent of Business Variance Operating Group Amount Amount Amount Middle Market 50,209 61 34,056 70 16,153 47 Specialty 16,946 21 11,326 23 5,620 50 MainStreet 12,809 16 1,617 3 11,192 n/m Medicare 1,769 2 1,716 4 53 3 Corporate and Other 5 5 81,738 48,720 33,018 
 __________ 
 n/m not meaningful 
 Amortization expense increased across our Middle Market, Specialty and MainStreet Operating Groups year over year, driven by amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with Partnerships during 2021 and 2022. Amortization for the Medicare Operating Group was relatively flat. 
 56 

Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration 
 The following table sets forth our change in fair value of contingent consideration by Operating Group by amount and as a percentage of our change in fair value of contingent consideration: 
 Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration by Operating Group (in thousands, except percentages) For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Percent of Business Percent of Business Variance Operating Group Amount Amount Amount Middle Market 26,429 82 32,735 73 (6,306) (19) Specialty 5,354 16 11,881 26 (6,527) (55) MainStreet 253 1 926 2 (673) (73) Medicare 271 1 (346) (1) 617 (178) 32,307 45,196 (12,889) 
 The change in fair value of contingent consideration for 2022 was impacted by changes in growth trends of certain partners, offset in part by high market volatility and rising interest rates, which resulted in an overall higher contingent earnout liability value. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Our primary liquidity needs for the foreseeable future will include cash to (i) provide capital to facilitate the organic growth of our business and to fund future Partnerships, (ii) pay operating expenses, including cash compensation to our employees and expenses related to being a public company, (iii) make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, (iv) pay interest and principal due on borrowings under the JPM Credit Agreement, (v) pay contingent earnout liabilities, (vi) pay income taxes, and (vii) fund potential investments in third party businesses that support the growth of our business, which may include the sponsorship of, and a minority, non-controlling interest in, an investment fund, the purpose of which may include facilitating the establishment of additional and alternative capacity that supports the growth of our MGA of the Future business. We have historically financed our operations and funded our debt service through the sale of our insurance products and services, and we have financed significant cash needs to fund growth through the acquisition of Partners through debt and equity financing. 
 As of December 31, 2022, our cash and cash equivalents were 118.1 million and we had 95.0 million of available borrowing capacity on the Revolving Facility under the JPM Credit Agreement. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations and available borrowings will be sufficient to fund our working capital and meet our commitments for the next twelve months and beyond. In connection with our continuous exploration of Partnership opportunities, we will consider raising additional debt or equity financing if and as necessary to support our growth. 
 See Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Relating to our Business Partnerships have been, and may in the future continue to be, important to our growth. We may not be able to successfully identify and acquire Partners or integrate Partners into our company, and we may become subject to certain liabilities assumed or incurred in connection with our Partnerships that could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 JPM Credit Agreement 
 As of December 31, 2021, our JPM Credit Agreement provided for senior secured credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of 1.325 billion, which consisted of (i) a term loan facility in the principal amount of 850.0 million maturing in October 2027 (the Term Loan B and (ii) a revolving credit facility with commitments in an aggregate principal amount of 475.0 million maturing in 2025 (the Revolving Facility ). 
 On March 28, 2022, BRP entered into Amendment No. 5 to the JPM Credit Agreement, under which (i) the aggregate principal commitment amount of the Revolving Facility was increased from 475.0 million to 600.0 million and (ii) the interest rate on the Revolving Facility changed to the SOFR, plus a credit spread adjustment of 10 bps, plus an amount between 200 bps and 300 bps based on the total net leverage ratio, (iii) the total net leverage ratio covenant increased to 7.0x consolidated EBITDA and (iv) the maturity of the Revolving Facility was extended to April 1, 2027. The other terms of the Revolving Facility and the terms of the Term Loan B remained unchanged. Amendment No. 5 to the JPM Credit Agreement provided us incremental capacity to assist in funding our Partnership pipeline during 2022 with a reduction in our cost of capital. 
 57 

The Term Loan B bears interest at LIBOR plus 350 bps with a LIBOR floor of 50 bps. The applicable interest rate on the Term Loan B at December 31, 2022 was 7.79 . Borrowings under the Revolving Facility accrue interest at SOFR plus 210 bps to SOFR plus 310 bps based on total net leverage ratio. BRP will pay a letter of credit fee equal to the margin then in effect with respect to SOFR loans under the Revolving Facility multiplied by the daily amount available to be drawn under any letter of credit, a fronting fee and any customary documentary and processing charges for any letter of credit issued under the JPM Credit Agreement. The outstanding borrowings on the Revolving Facility of 505.0 million had an applicable interest rate of 7.41 at December 31, 2022. The Revolving Facility is also subject to a commitment fee of 0.40 on the unused capacity at December 31, 2022. 
 We have entered into interest rate cap agreements to limit the potential impact of interest rate changes on cash flows. The interest rate caps limit the variability of the base rate to the amount of the cap. The interest rate cap agreements in place at December 31, 2022 mitigate the interest rate volatility on 300.0 million to a maximum base rate of 1.50 and mitigate the interest rate volatility on 1.2 billion of debt to a maximum base rate of 7.00 . 
 The outstanding principal balance on the Term Loan B of 838.1 million at December 31, 2022 is required to be repaid in equal quarterly installments equal to approximately 0.2506 of the original principal amount of the Term Loan B, the balance of which is due at maturity. Outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Facility are not subject to amortization. 
 The Revolving Facility and the New Term Loans are collateralized by a first priority lien on substantially all the assets of BRP, including a pledge of all equity securities of certain of its subsidiaries. The JPM Credit Agreement contains covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to make certain restricted payments, incur additional debt, engage in certain asset sales, mergers, acquisitions or similar transactions, create liens on assets, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, change our business, make certain investments or restrict BRP s ability to make dividends or other distributions to BRP Group. In addition, the JPM Credit Agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain our Total First Lien Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the JPM Credit Agreement) at or below 7.00 to 1.00. 
 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated: 
 For the Years Ended December 31, Variance (in thousands) 2022 2021 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities (2,462) 40,129 (42,591) Net cash used in investing activities (414,357) (678,473) 264,116 Net cash provided by financing activities 419,553 724,059 (304,506) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash 2,734 85,715 (82,981) Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of year 
 227,737 142,022 85,715 Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of year 
 230,471 227,737 2,734 
 Operating Activities 
 The primary sources and uses of cash for operating activities are net income (loss) adjusted for non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities, or operating working capital, and payment of contingent earnout consideration. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased 42.6 million year over year driven by an increase in cash payments for contingent earnout consideration in excess of the liability recognized at the acquisition date of 45.1 million from Partnerships that have outperformed on our platform since the date of Partnership. An increase in premiums, commissions and fees receivable of 118.5 million also reduces cash as a result of revenue growth and the changes in revenue seasonality of our business given the underlying revenue streams of Partnerships. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in cash from a higher balance in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities of 118.2 million related, in part, to the aforementioned revenue growth and changes in seasonality of our business. 
 Investing Activities 
 The primary sources and uses of cash for investing activities relate to cash consideration paid to fund Partnerships and other investments to grow our business. Net cash used in investing activities decreased 264.1 million year over year driven by a decrease in cash consideration paid for Partnership activity of 280.0 million due to fewer Partnerships completed during 2022, offset in part by an increase in capital expenditures of 16.7 million as a result of software development projects for infrastructure to support our business, including key customer relationship management software, and other purchases to support our growth. 
 58 

Financing Activities 
 The primary sources and uses of cash for financing activities relate to the issuance of our Class A common stock; debt servicing costs in connection with the JPM Credit Agreement, as well as purchases, sales and settlements of interest rate caps to mitigate interest rate volatility on that debt; payment of contingent earnout consideration; and other equity transactions. Net cash provided by financing activities decreased 304.5 million year over year driven by a decrease in net proceeds of 268.3 million from an equity raise completed during 2021, an increase in payments of contingent earnout consideration up to the amount of purchase price accrual of 40.6 million and a decrease in net borrowings on our credit facilities of 9.3 million. This activity was partially offset by an increase in cash from interest rate cap activity of 23.9 million. 
 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 The following table represents our contractual obligations and commitments, aggregated by type, at December 31, 2022: 
 Payments Due by Period (in thousands) Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Operating leases (1) 
 120,222 18,776 37,945 33,250 30,251 Debt obligations payable (2)

 __________ 
 (1) Represents noncancelable operating leases for our facilities. Operating lease expense was 19.9 million and 13.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 (2) Represents scheduled debt obligation and interest payments under the JPM Credit Agreement. 
 (3) Includes 266.9 million of current and non-current estimated contingent earnout liabilities at December 31, 2022. 
 Our contractual obligations and commitments are comprised of operating lease obligations, principal and interest payments on our borrowings under the JPM Credit Agreement, potential payments of contingent earnout liabilities and our commitment to the University of South Florida USF ). 
 Our operating lease obligations represent noncancelable agreements for our corporate headquarters and office space for our insurance brokerage business. Our operating lease agreements expire through December 2030. These obligations do not include leases with an initial term of 12 months or less, which are expensed as incurred. We may extend, terminate or otherwise modify or sub-lease facilities as needed to best suit the needs of our business. The lease term is the non-cancelable period of the lease and includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that an option will be exercised. 
 Borrowings under our JPM Credit Agreement include 838.1 million under the Term Loan B and 505.0 million on the Revolving Facility. Interest payable on outstanding borrowings on the Term Loan B and Revolving Facility in the table above was calculated based on applicable interest rates at December 31, 2022 of 7.79 and 7.41 , respectively, through their respective expiration dates of October 2027 and April 2027. 
 Substantially all of our Partnerships and certain acquisitions of select books of business that do not constitute a complete business enterprise include contractual earnout provisions. We record an estimation of the fair value of the contingent earnout obligations at the Partnership date as a component of the consideration paid. Our contingent earnout obligations are measured at fair value at each reporting period based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to Partners in accordance with the provisions outlined in the respective purchase agreements. The recorded obligations are based on estimates of the Partners' future performance using financial projections for the earnout period. The maximum future contingent payment obligation at December 31, 2022 was 954.3 million, of which 63.1 million must be settled in cash and the remaining 891.2 million can be settled in cash or stock at our option. The aggregate estimated contingent earnout liabilities included on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2022 was 266.9 million, of which 23.9 million must be settled in cash and the remaining 243.0 million can be settled in cash or stock at our option. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we have a commitment to USF to donate an aggregate 4.7 million through October 2028. The gift will provide support for the School of Risk Management and Insurance in the USF Muma College of Business. It is currently anticipated that Lowry Baldwin, our Board Chair, will fund half of this commitment. 
 59 

Effects of Inflation 
 Certain of our lease agreements feature annual rent escalations either fixed or based on a consumer price index or other index, which, historically, have not had a material impact on our results of operations, including our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Given the recent rise in inflation, we anticipate the inflation rate increase for the upcoming year to be higher than those of past years. Despite this anticipated increase, we do not anticipate the inflation rate increase for 2023 to have a material impact on our results of operations. We have monitored and will continue to monitor the components of compensation costs and operating expenses for the potential impact of inflation. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We do not invest in any off-balance sheet vehicles that provide liquidity, capital resources, market or credit risk support, or engage in any activities that expose us to any liability that is not reflected in our consolidated financial statements except for those described under this Liquidity and Capital Resources section. 
 Dividend Policy 
 Assuming BRP makes distributions to its members in any given year, the determination to pay dividends, if any, to our Class A common stockholders out of the portion, if any, of such distributions remaining after our payment of taxes, Tax Receivable Agreement payments and expenses (any such portion, an excess distribution will be made at the sole discretion of our board of directors. Our board of directors may change our dividend policy at any time. See Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Dividend Policy. 
 Tax Receivable Agreement 
 On October 28, 2019, BRP Group entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement with BRP s LLC Members that provides for the payment by BRP Group to BRP s LLC Members of 85 of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that BRP Group actually realizes as a result of (i) any increase in tax basis in BRP assets resulting from (a) previous acquisitions by BRP Group of BRP s LLC Units from BRP s LLC Members, (b) the acquisition of LLC Units from BRP s LLC Members using the net proceeds from any future offering, (c) redemptions or exchanges by BRP s LLC Members of LLC Units and the corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock for shares of Class A common stock or cash or (d) payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, and (ii) tax benefits related to imputed interest resulting from payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement. 
 Holders of BRP s LLC Units (other than BRP Group) may, subject to certain conditions and transfer restrictions described above, redeem or exchange their LLC Units for shares of Class A common stock of BRP Group on a one-for-one basis. BRP intends to make an election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations thereunder (the Code effective for each taxable year in which a redemption or exchange of LLC Units for shares of Class A common stock occurs, which is expected to result in increases to the tax basis of the assets of BRP at the time of a redemption or exchange of LLC Units. The redemptions or exchanges are expected to result in increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of BRP. These increases in tax basis may reduce the amount of tax that BRP Group would otherwise be required to pay in the future. We have entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement with BRP s LLC Members that provides for the payment by us to BRP s LLC Members of 85 of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that we actually realize as a result of (i) any increase in tax basis in BRP Group s assets resulting from (a) the purchase of LLC Units from any of BRP s LLC Members using the net proceeds from any future offering, (b) redemptions or exchanges by BRP s LLC Members of LLC Units for shares of our Class A common stock or (c) payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and (ii) tax benefits related to imputed interest deemed arising as a result of payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement. This payment obligation is an obligation of BRP Group and not of BRP. For purposes of the Tax Receivable Agreement, the cash tax savings in income tax will be computed by comparing the actual income tax liability of BRP Group (calculated with certain assumptions) to the amount of such taxes that BRP Group would have been required to pay had there been no increase to the tax basis of the assets of BRP as a result of the redemptions or exchanges and had BRP Group not entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement. Estimating the amount of payments that may be made under the Tax Receivable Agreement is by its nature imprecise, insofar as the calculation of amounts payable depends on a variety of factors. While the actual increase in tax basis, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of redemptions or exchanges, the price of shares of our Class A common stock at the time of the redemption or exchange, the extent to which such redemptions or exchanges are taxable, the amount and timing of our income, the tax rates then applicable and the portion of our payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement constituting imputed interest. We account for the effects of these increases in tax basis and associated payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement arising from future redemptions or exchanges as follows:

we record an increase in deferred tax assets for the estimated income tax effects of the increases in tax basis based on enacted federal and state tax rates at the date of the redemption or exchange; 
 to the extent we estimate that we will not realize the full benefit represented by the deferred tax asset, based on an analysis that will consider, among other things, our expectation of future earnings, we reduce the deferred tax asset with a valuation allowance; and 
 we record 85 of the estimated realizable tax benefit (which is the recorded deferred tax asset less any recorded valuation allowance) as an increase to the liability due under the Tax Receivable Agreement and the remaining 15 of the estimated realizable tax benefit as an increase to additional paid-in capital. 
 All of the effects of changes in any of our estimates after the date of the redemption or exchange will be included in net income. Similarly, the effect of subsequent changes in the enacted tax rates will be included in net income. 
 During 2022, we exchanged 1,841,134 LLC Units of BRP on a one-for-one basis for shares of BRP Group's Class A common stock and cancelled the corresponding shares of BRP Group's Class B common stock. We receive an increase in our share of the tax basis in the net assets of BRP due to the interests being redeemed. We have assessed the realizability of the net deferred tax assets and in that analysis have considered the relevant positive and negative evidence available to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets at BRP Group as of December 31, 2022, which will be maintained until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. 
 Deferred Tax Assets 
 To determine the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we analyzed if the Company was in a cumulative pre-tax income or loss position over a three-year period (2020, 2021 and 2022). Based on the analysis, the Company is in a pre-tax book loss position, and therefore we have determined that its deferred tax assets are not more likely than not to be realized. Accordingly, we maintain a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. As the Company emerges from its cumulative loss position, we will reassess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and the necessity for a full valuation allowance. 
 
 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
 Please refer to Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that may impact us. 
 61 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our estimates, judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on historical experience, known or expected trends, independent valuations and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Our most critical accounting policies and estimates, as discussed below, govern the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Commission revenue is earned at a point in time upon the effective date of bound insurance coverage, as no performance obligation exists after coverage is bound. The Company makes its best estimate of direct bill commissions at the policy effective date, particularly in employee benefits within the Middle Market Operating Group, which is subject to change based on enrollment and other factors over the policy period. 
 Commissions revenue is recorded net of an allowance for estimated policy cancellations. The allowance for estimated policy cancellations is determined based on an evaluation of historical and current cancellation data. 
 We are entitled to commissions each year for multi-year Medicare contracts. We are required to estimate the total expected value of future renewal commissions for all new policies in the year in effect. A risk of significant reversal exists for renewal policies and is influenced by external factors outside of our control including (1) policyholder discretion over plans and Insurance Company Partner relationships, (2) political influence, and (3) a contractual provision, which limits our right to receive renewal commissions to ongoing compliance and regulatory approval of the relevant Insurance Company Partner and compliance with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. 
 Profit-sharing commissions represent a form of variable consideration, which includes additional commissions over base commissions received from Insurance Company Partners. A constraint of variable consideration is necessary when commissions and fees are subject to significant reversal. Profit-sharing commissions associated with loss performance are uncertain, and therefore, are subject to significant reversal as loss data remains subject to material change. Management estimates profit-sharing commissions using historical outcomes and known trends impacting premium volume or loss ratios, subject to a constraint. The constraint is relieved when management estimates commissions and fees that are not subject to significant reversal, which often coincides with the earlier of written notification from the Insurance Company Partner that the target has been achieved or cash collection. Year-end amounts incorporate estimates subject to a constraint or where applicable, are based on confirmation from Insurance Company Partners after calculation of premium volume or loss ratios that are impacted by catastrophic losses. 
 Costs to obtain contracts includes compensation in the form of producer commissions paid on new business. These incremental costs are capitalized as deferred commission expense and amortized over five years, which represents management s estimate of the average period over which a Client maintains its initial coverage relationship with the original Insurance Company Partner. 
 The nature of estimates used in recognizing commissions and fees revenue do not involve a significant level of subjectivity, judgment, or estimation uncertainty that could have a material impact on the Company's results of operations. 
 We have determined that there are significant judgments and uncertainties included in the application of guidance for valuation of acquired relationships; impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill; valuation of contingent consideration; share-based compensation related to performance-based restricted stock unit awards; and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. The nature of the estimates and assumptions used and the impact the estimates and assumptions could have on our actual results are discussed in the tables below. 

62 

Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions Valuation of Acquired Relationships We acquire significant intangible assets in connection with our strategic acquisitions of a business. The valuation of the acquired business includes determining the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the acquisition date. We anticipate that for most acquisitions, we will exercise significant judgment in estimating the fair value of intangible assets. 
 
 In a typical acquisition, acquired relationships are our most significant definite-lived intangible asset. In valuing these relationships, we engage a third-party valuation expert to fair value these assets using a version of the income approach known as the excess earnings method. 
 
 The excess earnings method uses a discounted cash flow approach that is derived from historical information, future revenue and operating profit margins, contributory asset charges, and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. We consider this approach the most appropriate valuation technique because the inherent value of these assets is their ability to generate current and future income. 
 Future revenue growth, future operating performance margin as a percentage of revenues, attrition rate, and discount rate applied are the significant estimates used in the excess earnings method to determine the fair value of the relationships. These estimates are influenced by many factors, including historical financial information, estimated retention rates, and management's expectations for future growth as a combined company. Another estimate that impacts the valuation is the contributory charge for (i) the acquired workforce, which involves management assumptions based on historical experience, including interview time and new hire productivity, and (ii) the use of trade names or technology, which involves the selection of an appropriate royalty rate for the use of these intangible assets. The estimated life is determined by calculating the number of years necessary to obtain 95 of the value of the discounted cash flows of the relationships and is directly tied to the accuracy of the above assumptions. We have not made any changes in the accounting methodology used to determine the fair value of relationships during the last three years. 
 
 If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop the values of the identifiable intangible assets, then we could record material impairment losses. 
 
 With all other assumptions held constant, a 10 increase in the calculated fair value of the Westwood acquired relationships would increase our annual amortization expense by 0.7 million in 2022. 
 
 See the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets critical accounting estimate for information about impairment evaluations. 

63 

Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We evaluate our amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. These events and circumstances include, but are not limited to: higher than expected attrition for relationships; a current expectation that a long-lived asset will be disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life, such as when we classify a business as held for sale; a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use a long-lived asset; or a change in the physical condition of a long-lived asset. Undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if impairment exists; if impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value. Our impairment evaluations require us to apply judgment in determining whether a triggering event has occurred, including the evaluation of whether it is more-likely-than-not that a long-lived asset will be disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. Incorrect estimation of useful lives may result in inaccurate depreciation and amortization charges over future periods leading to future impairment. Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows. During the last three years, we have not made any changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate the impairment of long-lived assets or to estimate the useful lives of our long-lived assets. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, we had 1.1 billion of intangible assets, which are included in each of our reporting units at the following amounts: 
 
 Middle Market 725.4 million 
 
 Specialty 129.3 million 
 
 MainStreet 209.8 million 
 
 Medicare 32.4 million 
 
 We performed a qualitative analysis of each of our reporting units as of October 1, 2022 and determined that there were no events or changes in circumstances that had occurred to indicate that the carrying amount of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable. Therefore, we concluded that there were no indicators of impairment. 
 Impairment of Goodwill Goodwill is not amortized but rather tested at least annually for impairment, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more-likely-than-not that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which represents the operating segment. Goodwill is tested for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test. The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. We may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all of our reporting units and instead perform a quantitative impairment test. We estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. The income approach incorporates the use of a discounted cash flow method in which the estimated future cash flows and terminal value are calculated for each reporting unit and then discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. Our impairment evaluations require us to apply judgment in determining whether a triggering event has occurred. The valuation of our reporting units requires significant judgment in evaluation of recent indicators of market activity and estimated future cash flows, discount rates, and other factors. Our impairment analyses contain inherent uncertainties due to uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact anticipated future economic and operating conditions. In making these estimates, the weighted-average cost of capital is utilized to calculate the present value of future cash flows and terminal value. Many variables go into estimating future cash flows, including estimates of our future revenue growth and operating results. When estimating our projected revenue growth and future operating results, we consider industry trends, economic data, and our competitive advantage. The market approach estimates fair value of a reporting unit by using market comparables for reasonably similar public companies. During the last three years, we have not made any changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate impairment of goodwill. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, we had 1.4 billion of goodwill. Our goodwill is included in each of our Operating Groups at the following amounts: 
 
 Middle Market 906.1 million 
 
 Specialty 271.4 million 
 
 MainStreet 213.6 million 
 
 Medicare 30.9 million 
 
 A quantitative goodwill impairment analysis was performed for each of our reporting units as of October 1, 2022. Based on these studies, the implied fair value of each of our reporting units was substantially in excess of its carrying value. Therefore, we concluded there were no indicators of impairment. A 10 decrease in the estimated fair value of any of our reporting units would not have resulted in a different conclusion.

Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions Valuation of Contingent Consideration Substantially all of our Partnerships and certain acquisitions of select books of business that do not constitute a complete business enterprise include contingent consideration arrangements, which are based on the acquired company achieving thresholds related to revenues, total insured value or number of rented units. The structure of these contingent earn-out arrangements can reduce the risk of overpaying for acquisitions if the projected financial results are not achieved. 
 
 The fair values of these contingent consideration arrangements are included as part of the purchase price of the acquired companies on their respective acquisition dates. For each transaction, we estimate the fair value of contingent earnout payments as part of the initial purchase price and record the estimated fair value of contingent consideration as a liability on the consolidated balance sheets. The fair values of the earnout arrangements are estimated by discounting the expected future contingent payments to present value using a variation of the income approach, specifically using a Monte Carlo Simulation approach. We have 35 acquisitions with a corresponding contingent consideration liability still outstanding. 
 The fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements is estimated by simulating the metrics corresponding to a payment using a Monte Carlo Simulation approach and discounting the expected future contingent payments to present value. The key assumptions used in our valuation were: (i) forecast of revenue, total insured value or number of rented units, (ii) the volatility associated with the revenues, total insured value or number of rented units, (iii) risk-adjusted discount rate applied to forecasted revenues, total insured value or number of rented units, and (iv) the credit-adjusted discount rate related to the payment of the contingent consideration. These estimates are influenced by many factors, including historical financial information, guideline public company data, and management's expectations for future revenue of the acquired businesses, total insured value and number of rented units, as well as market conditions, economic conditions and the company s performance. Changes in these inputs could have a significant impact on the fair value of the contingent consideration liability. We review and re-assess the estimated fair value of contingent consideration on a quarterly basis, and the updated fair value could be materially different from the initial estimates or prior quarterly amounts. Any changes in the estimated fair value of contingent considerations and adjustments to the estimated fair value related to unobservable inputs will be recognized within change in fair value of contingent consideration in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. We recognized 32.3 million of expense related to the change in fair value of contingent consideration in 2022. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, we recorded 266.9 million of contingent consideration liabilities related to the 35 contingent consideration arrangements still outstanding and the total potential maximum of the contingent consideration payments is 954.3 million. If all remaining revenue, insured value and rental units targets were achieved, our Partners would be entitled payments of up to 132.5 million in calendar year 2023 for achieving targets through September 30, 2023; 480.4 million in calendar year 2024 for achieving targets through September 30, 2024; 331.4 million in calendar year 2025 for achieving targets through September 30, 2025; and 10.0 million in calendar year 2026 for achieving targets through September 30, 2026. If the actual achievement of contingent considerations payments in 2023 through 2026 was at the maximum target amounts, we would record an additional 687.3 million of expense over the next four years.

Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions Share-Based Compensation Related to Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Awards PSUs 
 We issue PSUs to our executive officers in connection to our Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP that is adopted each year. These PSUs have historically been granted with market-based conditions and may include a performance-based condition. The PSUs granted under the LTIP in 2022 were based on two market conditions and a performance condition. Performance is measured over the three-year vesting period and the achievement with respect to each condition contributes a percentage to the overall PSUs earned. 
 The market conditions measure BRP Group's relative total shareholder return, which is determined by comparing BRP Group's total shareholder return to that of two benchmark groups: a peer group and the Russel 3000 Index. Total shareholder return is calculated using the simple average trading price of our common stock for the 30-day trading period prior to the beginning and at the end of the performance period. 
 We engaged a third-party valuation expert to assist in the valuation of relative performance for the determination of the PSUs grant date fair value. The valuation expert used the Monte Carlo analysis, which is used to model all potential outcomes by running multiple iterations of relative shareholder return over the vesting period. 
 Relative performance is subject to varying degrees of expected volatilities, and correlation to a combination of simulated end stock price values. The Monte Carlo method allows for the combination of simulated end stock price values throughout the vesting schedule to estimate relative performance. 
 Significant assumptions utilized in the Monte Carlo analysis include historical stock price data, a range of expected future stock price data, volatility, correlations, risk-free rate and the term of the awards. 
 A statistical sample was selected of 99 publicly-traded companies from within the peer group and the Russel 3000 Index, which made up the benchmark companies. A combined 100,000 iterations of probable outcomes were generated using a range of assumptions for BRP Group and the benchmark companies. 
 Volatility, which is subject to significant judgment, was estimated for BRP Group and each of the benchmark companies using an average of one-year historical stock price data and Bloomberg s reported implied volatility on the valuation date, as an estimate of future volatility. The volatility effects the range of stock price data utilized in the iterations of the model over the term of the awards. The correlations of the results generated by the model for BRP Group and the benchmark companies result in the valuation of relative performance of the PSUs. 
 We monitor the performance metrics of the awards over the vesting period and adjust compensation expense based on how each performance metric is tracking toward its respective performance goal. We recognized 4.2 million in compensation expense related to our outstanding PSUs during 2022, of which 2.9 million related to the relative performance metrics. We expect to recognize additional compensation expense of 4.9 million for PSUs related to relative performance goals.

Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions Valuation Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets 
 We record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. We compute the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the currently enacted tax rates in each jurisdiction that applies to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. We are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and record a charge to income if it is determined, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Our evaluation of the realizability of the deferred tax assets contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future net income or net loss before taxes. It also requires management to consider significant, objective evidence that we will more likely than not be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future. Many variables go into estimating future net income or net loss before taxes, including estimates of our future revenue growth and management's expectations of ongoing investments. We review and re-assess our cumulative three-year loss before income taxes on a quarterly basis. During the last three years, we have not made any changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets have been reduced by a full valuation allowance at December 31, 2022 due to a determination that it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized based on the weight of all available evidence.

ITEM 7A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as premium amounts, interest rates and equity prices. We are exposed to market risk through our investments and borrowings under the JPM Credit Agreement. We use derivative instruments to mitigate our risk related to the effect of rising interest rates on our cash flows. However, we do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
 Our invested assets are held primarily as cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash. To a lesser extent, we may also utilize certificates of deposit, U.S. treasury securities and professionally managed short duration fixed income funds. These investments are subject to market risk. The fair values of our invested assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021 approximated their respective carrying values due to their short-term duration and therefore, such market risk is not considered to be material. 
 At December 31, 2022, we had 838.1 million and 505.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan B and the Revolving Facility, respectively. These borrowings bear interest on a floating basis tied to either the prime rate or one of various other variable rates as defined in the JPM Credit Agreement. The variable rate currently in effect for the Term Loan B and the Revolving Facility is LIBOR and SOFR, respectively. 
 We have entered into interest rate cap agreements to limit the potential impact of interest rate changes on cash flows. The interest rate caps limit the variability of the base rate to the amount of the cap. The interest rate cap agreements in place at December 31, 2022 mitigate the interest rate volatility on 300.0 million of debt to a maximum base rate of 1.50 and mitigate the interest rate volatility on 1.2 billion of debt to a maximum base rate of 7.00 . Taking the interest rate cap agreements into consideration, an increase of 100 basis points on the variable interest rates in effect at December 31, 2022 would increase our annual interest expense for the JPM Credit Agreement by 10.4 million.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of BRP Group, Inc. 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BRP Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive loss, of stockholders equity and mezzanine equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 Change in Accounting Principle 
 As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2021. 
 Basis for Opinions 
 The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 70 

As described in Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded three partnerships (Westwood Insurance Agency, Venture Captive Management, LLC and National Health Plans Benefits Agency, LLC) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 because they were acquired by the Company in purchase business combinations during 2022. We have also excluded these three partnerships from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. These partnerships are wholly-owned entities whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting collectively represent less than 1 and approximately 8 , respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 Valuation of the Acquired Relationships Intangible Assets 
 As described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company acquired intangible assets relating to acquired relationships with a total fair value of 189.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. Management assesses the fair value of acquired relationships by considering the estimated future cash flow benefits associated with ownership of the assets through the use of a recognized income approach valuation method. The valuation of these intangible assets involves significant assumptions concerning matters such as revenue and expense growth rates, customer attrition rates and discount rates. 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of the acquired relationships intangible assets is a critical matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in estimating the fair value of the acquired relationships intangible assets; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management s significant assumptions related to revenue and expense growth rates, customer attrition rates and discount rates (collectively referred to as the significant assumptions and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
 71 

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management s valuation of the acquired relationships intangible assets, including the development of the significant assumptions. These procedures also included, among others (i) reading the purchase agreements; (ii) testing the consideration transferred; and (iii) testing management s process for estimating the fair value of the acquired relationships intangible assets. Testing management s process included evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation method, testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data provided by management, and evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions. Evaluating the significant assumptions involved considering the historical performance of the acquired partnerships, the historical performance of the Company, as well as industry and economic performance and forecasts. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the Company s valuation method and the reasonableness of the customer attrition rates and discount rates. 
 Valuation of Contingent Earnout Liabilities 
 As described in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s contingent earnout liabilities balance was 266.9 million as of December 31, 2022. The fair value of the contingent earnout liabilities is based on Monte Carlo simulations that measure the present value of the expected future payments to be made to acquired companies or producers Partners in accordance with the provisions outlined in the respective purchase agreements. In determining the fair value, management estimates the Partner s future performance using financial projections developed for the Partner and market participant assumptions that were derived for revenue growth, the number of rental units tracked or the insured value of sourced homeowners insurance. Management estimates future payments using the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement and the financial projections. These payments are discounted to present value using a risk-adjusted rate. 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of contingent earnout liabilities is a critical matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in estimating the fair value of the contingent earnout liabilities; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management s significant assumptions related to revenue growth and risk-adjusted discount rates; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management s valuation of the contingent earnout liabilities, including the development of the significant assumptions related to revenue growth and risk-adjusted discount rates. These procedures also included, among others (i) reading the purchase agreements and terms related to the contingent earnout and (ii) testing management s process for estimating the fair value of the contingent earnout liabilities. Testing management s process included evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation method, testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data provided by management, and evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions related to revenue growth and risk-adjusted discount rates. Evaluating the significant assumptions related to revenue growth and risk-adjusted discount rates involved considering the historical performance of the Partners, the historical performance of the Company, as well as industry and economic performance and forecasts. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the Company s valuation method and the reasonableness of the risk-adjusted discount rates.

 Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the reasonably assured lease term at inception of the lease. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts. The difference between the net book value of the assets and proceeds from disposal is recognized as a gain or loss on disposal, which is included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. Routine maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, while costs of improvements and renewals are capitalized. 
 Property and equipment is evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. An asset is considered to be impaired when the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition does not exceed its carrying amount. The amount of the impairment loss, if any, is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value.

In accordance with Topic 805, total consideration was first allocated to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the excess being recorded as goodwill.

Specifically, the Company's valuations of premiums, commissions and fees receivable and premiums payable to insurance companies in accordance with Topic 606 are estimates subject to change based on relevant factors over the policy period. In addition, the valuations of intangible assets are estimates based on assumptions of factors such as discount rates and growth rates. Accordingly, these assets are subject to measurement period adjustments as determined after the passage of time. Any measurement period adjustments related to prior period business combinations are reflected as current period adjustments in accordance with Topic 805.

 The application of Topic 606 requires the use of management judgment. The following are the areas of most significant judgment as it relates to Topic 606: 
 The Company considers the policyholders as representative of its customers in the majority of contractual relationships, with the exception of contracts in its Medicare operating group, where the Insurance Company Partner is considered its customer. 
 Contracts in the Medicare operating group are multi-year arrangements in which the Company is entitled to renewal commissions. However, the Company has applied a constraint to renewal commissions that limits revenue recognized on new policies to the policy year in effect, and revenue recognized on renewed policies to the receipt of periodic cash, when a risk of significant reversals exists based on: (i) insufficient history; and (ii) the influence of external factors outside of the Company s control including policyholder discretion over plans and Insurance Company Partner relationship, political influence, and a contractual provision, which limits the Company s right to receive renewal commissions to ongoing compliance and regulatory approval of the relevant Insurance Company Partner and compliance with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. 
 The Company recognizes separately contracted commissions revenue at the effective date of insurance placement and considers any ongoing interaction with the customer to be insignificant in the context of the obligations of the contract. 
 Variable consideration includes estimates of direct bill commissions, reserves for policy cancellations and accruals for profit-sharing income. 
 Costs to obtain a contract are deferred and recognized over , which represents management s estimate of the average period over which a Client maintains its initial coverage relationship with the original Insurance Company Partner. 
 Due to the relatively short time period between the information gathering phase and binding insurance coverage, the Company has determined that costs to fulfill contracts are not significant. Therefore, costs to fulfill a contract are expensed as incurred.

The RSAs vest in equal annual installments over . 
 Valuation Assumptions 
 The fair value of the PSUs was estimated on the grant date using a Monte Carlo analysis to model the value of the PSUs using the following assumptions. Expected volatility is based on an average of implied volatility on the valuation date and the one-year historical volatility of BRP Group and publicly-traded companies within a peer group and the Russell 3000 Index. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury rates in effect at the time of the grant. Expected term is based on the actual term of the awards.

 As of December 31, 2022, the Company has not recognized any uncertain tax positions, penalties, or interest as management has concluded that no such positions exist. The Company is subject to examination for tax years beginning with the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company is not currently subject to income tax audits in any U.S. or state jurisdictions for any tax year. 
 Tax Receivable Agreement 
 BRP makes an election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations thereunder (the Code effective for each taxable year in which a redemption or exchange of LLC Units and corresponding Class B common stock for shares of Class A common stock occurs. Exchanges result in tax basis adjustments to the assets of BRP, which produce favorable tax attributes and reduce the amount of tax that BRP Group is required to pay. The Company has determined that it is more likely than not that these benefits will not be realized. 
 BRP Group entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement with BRP s LLC Members that provides for the payment by BRP Group to BRP s LLC Members of of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that BRP Group actually realizes as a result of (i) any increase in tax basis in BRP assets resulting from (a) previous acquisitions by BRP Group of BRP s LLC Units from BRP s LLC Members, (b) the acquisition of LLC Units from BRP s LLC Members using the net proceeds from any future offering, (c) redemptions or exchanges by BRP s LLC Members of LLC Units and the corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock for shares of Class A common stock or cash or (d) payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, and (ii) tax benefits related to imputed interest resulting from payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement. 
 This payment obligation is an obligation of BRP Group and not of Baldwin Risk Partners, LLC. For purposes of the Tax Receivable Agreement, the cash tax savings in income tax will be computed by comparing the actual income tax liability of BRP Group (calculated with certain assumptions) to the amount of such taxes that BRP Group would have been required to pay had there been no increase to the tax basis of the assets of Baldwin Risk Partners, LLC as a result of the redemptions or exchanges and had BRP Group not entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement. Estimating the amount of payments that may be made under the Tax Receivable Agreement is by its nature imprecise, insofar as the calculation of amounts payable depends on a variety of factors. While the actual increase in tax basis, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of redemptions or exchanges, the price of shares of our Class A common stock at the time of the redemption or exchange, the extent to which such redemptions or exchanges are taxable and the amount and timing of our income. The Company accounts for the effects of these increases in tax basis and associated payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement arising from future redemptions or exchanges as follows: 
 records an increase in deferred tax assets for the estimated income tax effects of the increases in tax basis based on enacted federal and state tax rates at the date of the redemption or exchange; 
 to the extent it is estimated that the Company will not realize the full benefit represented by the deferred tax asset, based on an analysis that will consider, among other things, our expectation of future earnings, the Company reduces the deferred tax asset with a valuation allowance; and 
 records of the estimated realizable tax benefit (which is the recorded deferred tax asset less any recorded valuation allowance) as an increase to the liability due under the Tax Receivable Agreement and the remaining of the estimated realizable tax benefit as an increase to additional paid-in capital. 
 All of the effects of changes in any of our estimates after the date of the redemption or exchange will be included in net income. Similarly, the effect of subsequent changes in the enacted tax rates will be included in net income.

Level 2 Assets Level 3 Contingent earnout liabilities Level 3 Liabilities 
 The fair value of interest rate caps was million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The fair value of interest rate caps is determined using the market standard methodology of discounting the future expected cash receipts that would occur if variable interest rates rise above the strike rate of the caps. The variable interest rates used in the calculation of projected receipts on the cap are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves and volatilities. 
 Methodologies used for liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy at December 31, 2022 and 2021 are based on limited unobservable inputs. These methods may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of the net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. 
 The fair value of the contingent earnout liabilities is based on sales projections for the acquired entities, which are reassessed each reporting period. Based on the Company s ongoing assessment of the fair value of its contingent earnout liability, the Company recorded a net increase in the estimated fair value of such liabilities of million, million and million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company has assessed the maximum estimated exposure to the contingent earnout liabilities to be million at December 31, 2022. 
 The Company measures contingent earnout liabilities at fair value at each reporting period using significant unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company uses a probability weighted value analysis as a valuation technique to convert future estimated cash flows to a single present value amount. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements are sales projections over the earnout period, and the probability outcome percentages assigned to each scenario. Significant increases or decreases to either of these inputs would result in a significantly higher or lower liability with a higher liability capped by the contractual maximum of the contingent earnout liabilities. Ultimately, the liability will be equivalent to the amount settled, and the difference between the fair value estimate and amount settled will be recorded in earnings for business combinations, or as a reduction of the cost of the assets acquired for asset acquisitions. Refer to Note 3 for additional information regarding contingent earnout consideration recorded in connection with business acquisitions. 
 The fair value of the contingent earnout liabilities is based on Monte Carlo simulations that measure the present value of the expected future payments to be made to Partners in accordance with the provisions outlined in the respective purchase agreements, which is a Level 3 fair value measurement. In determining fair value, the Company estimates the Partner s future performance using financial projections developed by management for the Partner and market participant assumptions that were derived for revenue growth, the number of rental units tracked or the insured value of sourced homeowners insurance. Revenue growth rates generally ranged from to at December 31, 2022 and from to at December 31, 2021. The Company estimates future payments using the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement and these financial projections. These payments are discounted to present value using a risk-adjusted rate that takes into consideration market-based rates of return that reflect the ability of the Partner to achieve the targets. These discount rates generally ranged from to at December 31, 2022 and from to at December 31, 2021. Changes in financial projections, market participant assumptions for revenue growth and profitability, or the risk-adjusted discount rate, would result in a change in the fair value of contingent consideration.

 Legal 
 The Company is involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. A liability is recorded when a loss is considered probable and is reasonably estimable in accordance with GAAP. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company entered into negotiations to settle one or more disputes relating to alleged restrictive covenant violations on the part of certain of its Risk Advisors.

 ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2022. 
 Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. 
 Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Management s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management, acting under authority delegated to them by the Board, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 
 Management's annual evaluation of internal control over financial reporting did not include an assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting of three Partnerships (Westwood Insurance Agency, Venture Captive Management, LLC and National Health Plans Benefits Agency, LLC) that were acquired in purchase business combinations during the year ended December 31, 2022. The three Partnerships collectively represent less than 1 of our consolidated total assets (the calculation excludes the goodwill and intangible assets of those acquired Partnerships as the goodwill and intangible assets were subject to management s assessment of internal control over financial reporting) and approximately 8 of total revenues as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Remediation of Prior Year Material Weaknesses 
 In our 2021 Annual Report, filed on March 1, 2022, management identified three material weaknesses existing as of December 31, 2021 related to (i) a lack of a sufficient number of personnel with an appropriate level of accounting knowledge, training and experience to appropriately analyze, record and disclose accounting matters timely and accurately; (ii) insufficient policies and procedures to achieve complete and accurate financial accounting, reporting and disclosures; and (iii) failure to design and maintain controls over the operating effectiveness of information technology IT general controls. 
 Management, with the oversight of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, has invested considerable time and resources over the last three years and has completed remediation of these material weaknesses, in each case as further described below. 
 Lack of Sufficient Accounting Personnel 
 To remediate the material weakness associated with the lack of sufficient personnel with an appropriate level of accounting knowledge, training and experience commensurate with our financial reporting requirements to appropriately analyze, record and disclose accounting matters timely and accurately, we have (i) hired personnel with the appropriate knowledge, experience, certification, training and education for all of the key positions in the financial reporting and accounting function, including a Chief Accounting Officer, Director of Technical Accounting and Director of Financial Reporting; (ii) improved accountability in the accounting organization with expanded policies and procedures; (iii) improved communication through weekly meetings conducted by the Chief Accounting Officer with her direct reports and monthly town hall meetings held by the accounting and finance functions; (iv) conducted routine staff training; (v) hired a Director of Internal Audit and a Director of Internal Controls to deliver in-house expertise to all of our Colleagues on designing and operating an effective control environment; (vi) designed and implemented entity level controls to support the overall control environment; and (vii) designed and implemented effective segregation of duties controls and sustained our controls over a period that is appropriate in order to conclude that the controls are operating effectively. 
 Financial Accounting, Reporting and Disclosures 
 To remediate the material weakness associated with insufficient policies and procedures necessary to achieve complete and accurate financial accounting, reporting and disclosures, we have: (i) purchased, designed, and implemented a new general ledger and account reconciliation tool to automate and standardize certain procedures; (ii) established policies and procedures to govern the completion and review of account reconciliations, including independent review; (iii) established policies and procedures to govern the posting and review of journal entries to our general ledger; (iv) designed and implemented new controls and enhancements to existing controls over the preparation, analysis and review of manual journal entries, significant account reconciliations and closing adjustments; (v) established policies and procedures regarding the preparation and review of financial statements and disclosures, including review by the Chief Accounting Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the Audit Committee; (vi) designed and implemented controls to test the completeness and accuracy of data and key reports; and (vii) sustained operation of our controls over a period that is appropriate in order to conclude that the controls are operating effectively. 
 Information Technology General Controls 
 To remediate the material weakness associated with failure to design and maintain controls over the operating effectiveness of IT general controls, we have (i) hired IT personnel with an appropriate level of knowledge and technical experience to design and maintain IT general controls, including hiring a Chief Digital Information Officer; (ii) established policies and procedures for the design and operation of IT general controls; (iii) implemented an IT general controls framework; (iv) implemented a single-sign-on application to centralize system provisioning and de-provisioning; (v) designed, implemented and documented IT general controls supporting financial systems relevant to our financial reporting processes; and (vi) sustained operation of our controls over a period that is appropriate in order to conclude that the controls are operating effectively. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, which were identified in connection with management s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 For purposes of this description, references to the Company, BRP Group, us, we or our refer to BRP Group, Inc. and not any of its subsidiaries. 
 
 Description of BRP Group Common Stock 
 
 The following is a summary of the material terms of our capital stock and the provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (our charter and Amended and Restated By-laws (our by-laws and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the charter and by-laws, each of which is incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this exhibit is a part. It also summarizes some relevant provisions of the Delaware General Business Corporation Law, which we refer to as Delaware law or DGCL and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the DGCL. Since the terms of our charter, by-laws, and Delaware law are more detailed than the general information provided below, you should only rely on the actual provisions of those documents and Delaware law. 
 
 Authorized Capital Stock 
 
 Our authorized capital stock consists of 300,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, par value 0.01 per share, 100,000,000 shares of Class B common stock, par value 0.0001 per share, and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value 0.01 per share. Unless our board of directors determines otherwise, we will issue all shares of our capital stock in uncertificated form. 
 
 Class A Common Stock 
 
 Holders of shares of our Class A common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters on which stockholders are entitled to vote generally, including the election or removal of directors. The holders of our Class A common stock do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors. 
 
 Holders of shares of our Class A common stock are entitled to receive dividends when and if declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available therefor, subject to any statutory or contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends and to any restrictions on the payment of dividends imposed by the terms of any outstanding preferred stock. 
 
 Upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up and after payment in full of all amounts required to be paid to creditors and to the holders of preferred stock having liquidation preferences, if any, the holders of shares of our Class A common stock will be entitled to receive pro rata our remaining assets available for distribution. 
 
 All shares of our Class A common stock that are outstanding are fully paid and non-assessable. The Class A common stock are not subject to further calls or assessments by us. The rights powers and privileges of our Class A common stock are subject to those of the holders of any shares of our preferred stock or any other series or class of stock we may authorize and issue in the future. 
 
 Dividends 
 
 The DGCL permits a corporation to declare and pay dividends out of surplus or, if there is no surplus, out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and or the preceding fiscal year. 

Surplus is defined as the excess of the net assets of the corporation over the amount determined to be the capital of the corporation by its board of directors. The capital of the corporation is typically calculated to be (and cannot be less than) the aggregate par value of all issued shares of capital stock. Net assets equals the fair value of the total assets minus total liabilities. The DGCL also provides that dividends may not be paid out of net profits if, after the payment of the dividend, remaining capital would be less than the capital represented by the outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets. Declaration and payment of any dividend will be subject to the discretion of our board of directors. 
 
 Stockholder meetings 
 
 Our charter and our by-laws provide that annual stockholder meetings will be held at a date, time and place, if any, as exclusively selected by our board of directors. Our charter provides that special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by or at the direction of the board of directors, the chairman of our board or the chief executive officer. To the extent permitted under applicable law, we may conduct meetings by remote communications, including by webcast. 
 
 Transferability, Redemption and Exchange 
 
 There are no limitations in the Third Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Baldwin Risk Partners, LLC BRP (the Amended LLC Agreement on the number of limited liability company units LLC Units issuable in the future by BRP, and we are not required to own a majority of LLC Units outstanding at any time. Under the Amended LLC Agreement, the holders of LLC Units have the right (subject to the terms of the Amended LLC Agreement), to require BRP to redeem all or a portion of their LLC Units for, at our election, newly-issued shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis or a cash payment equal to the three-day volume weighted average market price of one share of our Class A common stock for each LLC Unit redeemed (subject in either case to customary adjustments, including for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassifications) in accordance with the terms of the Amended LLC Agreement. Additionally, in the event of a redemption request by a holder of LLC Units, we may, at our option, effect a direct exchange of cash or Class A common stock for LLC Units in lieu of such a redemption. Shares of Class B common stock will be cancelled on a one-for-one basis if we, following a redemption request of a holder of LLC Units, redeem or exchange LLC Units of such holder of LLC Units pursuant to the terms of the Amended LLC Agreement. 
 
 Except for transfers to us pursuant to the Amended LLC Agreement or to certain permitted transferees, the holders of LLC Units are not permitted to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any LLC Units or shares of Class B common stock. 
 
 Other Provisions 
 
 Neither the Class A common stock nor the Class B common stock has any preemptive or other subscription rights. 
 
 There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the Class A common stock or Class B common stock. Further, our Stockholders Agreement provides that, for so long as owners of LLC Units of BRP prior to our initial public offering and their permitted transferees (collectively, the Holders beneficially hold at least 10 of the aggregate number of outstanding shares of our common stock (the Substantial Ownership Requirement ), the Holders have approval rights over certain transactions and actions taken by us as further described in our Stockholders Agreement. 
 
 At such time when no LLC Units remain redeemable or exchangeable for shares of our Class A common stock, our Class B common stock will be cancelled. 
 
 Certain Charter, By-laws and Statutory Provisions 

Our charter provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the doctrine of corporate opportunity will only apply against our directors and officers and their respective affiliates for competing activities related to insurance brokerage activities. 
 
 Anti-Takeover Effects of our Charter, Stockholders Agreement and By-laws 
 
 Our charter and by-laws contains certain provisions that are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of our board of directors and that may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a future takeover or change in control of the Company unless such takeover or change in control is approved by our board of directors. These provisions include 
 
 No cumulative voting. Under Delaware law, the right to vote cumulatively does not exist unless the charter specifically authorizes cumulative voting. Our charter does not authorize cumulative voting. Therefore, stockholders holding a majority in voting power of the shares of our common stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors will be able to elect all our directors. 
 
 Election and removal of directors . Our charter provides that our board shall consist of not less than three nor more than 13 directors. Our charter also provides that, subject to the rights granted to one or more series of preferred stock then outstanding, any vacancies on our board will be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors, even if less than a quorum. Our Stockholders Agreement provides that, until the Substantial Ownership Requirement is no longer met, the Holders may designate the nominees for a majority of the members of our board of directors, including the Chairman of our board of directors. In addition, our Stockholders Agreement provides that, until the Substantial Ownership Requirement is no longer met, any action to change the number of directors on our board of directors requires approval of the Holders. 
 
 In addition, our charter provides that our board of directors is divided into three classes of directors, with each class as equal in number as possible, serving staggered three-year terms. Directors may only be removed for cause and by the affirmative vote of holders of 75 of the total voting power of our outstanding shares of common stock, voting together as a single class. This requirement of a super-majority vote to remove directors for cause could enable a minority of our stockholders to exercise veto power over any such removal. 
 
 Action by written consent . Our charter provides that stockholder action can be taken only at an annual or special meeting of stockholders and cannot be taken by written consent in lieu of a meeting provided, that any action required or permitted to be taken by the holders of Class B Common Stock, voting separately as a class, may be effected by the consent in writing of the holders of a majority of the total voting power of the Class B Common Stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class in lieu of a duly called annual or special meeting of holders of Class B Common Stock. 
 
 Advance notice procedures . Our by-laws establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to the board of directors. Stockholders at an annual meeting will only be able to consider proposals or nominations specified in the notice of meeting or brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the board of directors or by a stockholder who was a stockholder of record on the record date for the meeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who has given our Secretary timely written notice, in proper form, of the stockholder s intention to bring that business before the meeting. Although the by-laws do not give our board of directors the power to approve or disapprove stockholder nominations of candidates or proposals regarding other business to be conducted at a special or annual 
 meeting, the by-laws may have the effect of precluding the conduct of certain business at a meeting if the proper procedures are not followed or may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect its own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company. 
 
 Super-majority approval requirements . The DGCL generally provides that the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the total voting power of the shares entitled to vote on any matter is required to 

amend a corporation s charter or by-laws, unless either a corporation s charter or by-laws require a greater percentage. Our Stockholders Agreement provides that, until the Substantial Ownership Requirement is no longer met, any amendment to our charter or by-laws must be approved by the Holders. Our charter and by-laws provide that the affirmative vote of holders of 75 of the total voting power of our outstanding common stock eligible to vote in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, will be required to amend, alter, change or repeal specified provisions, including those relating to actions by written consent of stockholders, calling of special meetings of stockholders, election and removal of directors, business combinations and amendment of our charter and by-laws. This requirement of a super-majority vote to approve amendments to our charter and by-laws could enable a minority of our stockholders to exercise veto power over any such amendments. 
 
 Authorized but unissued shares . The authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock are available for future issuance without stockholder approval, subject to any limitations imposed by the listing rules of the Nasdaq. The existence of authorized but unissued and unreserved common stock and preferred stock could make more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise. 
 
 Business combinations with interested stockholders . In general, Section 203 of the DGCL prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination, such as a merger, with a person or group owning 15 or more of the corporation s voting stock for a period of three years following the date the person became an interested stockholder, unless (with certain exceptions) the business combination or the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder is approved in a prescribed manner. We are governed by the business combination provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL provided, that it shall only apply to a person who is an interested stockholder (each as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL). Further, our Stockholders Agreement provides that, until the Substantial Ownership Requirement is no longer met, any business combination resulting in a merger, consolidation or sale of all, or substantially all, of our assets, and any acquisition or disposition of any asset or business having consideration in excess of 5 of our total assets, must be approved by the Holders. 
 
 Exclusive forum provision. Our charter provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, and (iv) any action asserting a claim against us governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This choice of forum provision does not preclude or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for any actions brought under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act ). Accordingly, our exclusive forum provision does not apply to claims arising under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act and does not relieve us of our duties to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and our stockholders are not deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations.

The parties to the Voting Agreement beneficially owned approximately 29.8 of the voting power of our common stock as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 Directors Liability Indemnification of Directors and Officers 
 
 Our charter limits the liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by the DCGL and provides that we will provide them with customary indemnification. We enter into customary indemnification 

agreements with each of our executive officers and directors that provide them, in general, with customary indemnification in connection with their service to us or on our behalf.
