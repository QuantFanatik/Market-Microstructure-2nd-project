and those reports, statements, information and announcements address activities, events or developments that Indoor Harvest, Corp. (hereinafter
referred to as we, us, our, our Company or Indoor Harvest expects
or anticipates, will or may occur in the future. Any statements in this document about expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions
or future events or performance are not historical facts and are forward-looking statements. These statements are often, but not always,
made through the use of words or phrases such as may, should, could, predict, 
 potential, believe, will likely result, expect, will continue, 
 anticipate, seek, estimate, intend, plan, projection, 
 would and outlook, and similar expressions. Accordingly, these statements involve estimates, assumptions
and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in them. Any forward-looking statements
are qualified in their entirety by reference to the factors discussed throughout this document. All forward-looking statements concerning
economic conditions, rates of growth, rates of income or values as may be included in this document are based on information available
to us on the dates noted, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. It is important to note that our
actual results may differ materially from those in such forward-looking statements due to fluctuations in interest rates, inflation,
government regulations, economic conditions and competitive product and pricing pressures in the geographic and business areas in which
we conduct operations, including our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions and other factors discussed elsewhere in this Report. 

Certain
risk factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations and cause actual results
or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us, and you should not place undue reliance
on any such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made and we do not undertake
any obligation to update any forward-looking statement or statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such
statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. The risks and uncertainties we currently face are not the only
ones we face. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict which will arise. There may be additional
risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial to our business. In addition, we cannot assess the impact
of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially
from those contained in any forward-looking statements. If any such risks occur, our business, operating results, liquidity and financial
condition could be materially affected in an adverse manner. Under such circumstances, you may lose all or part of your investment. 

The
industry and market data contained in this report are based either on our management s own estimates or, where indicated, independent
industry publications, reports by governmental agencies or market research firms or other published independent sources and, in each
case, are believed by our management to be reasonable estimates. However, industry and market data is subject to change and cannot always
be verified with complete certainty due to limits on the availability and reliability of raw data, the voluntary nature of the data gathering
process and other limitations and uncertainties inherent in any statistical survey of market shares. We have not independently verified
market and industry data from third-party sources. In addition, consumption patterns and customer preferences can and do change. As a
result, you should be aware that market share, ranking and other similar data set forth herein, and estimates and beliefs based on such

PART
I 

Item
1. Business. 

Organization 

Indoor
Harvest Corp (the Company is a Texas corporation formed on November 23, 2011. Our principal executive office was located
at 7401 W. Slaughter Lane #5078, Austin, Texas 78739 for the year ended 2019. From inception until about August 4, 2017, in summary,
the Company pursued a business of certain engineering, procurement and construction related services as to the indoor and vertical farming
industry and production platforms, mechanical systems and custom designed build outs for both Controlled Environment Agriculture CEA and Building Integrated Agriculture BIA ), for two unique industries, produce and cannabis. 

In
mid-2016, the Company began efforts to separate its produce and cannabis related pursuits due to ongoing feedback from both clients and
potential institutional investors. It was determined that the Company s involvement in the cannabis industry was creating conflicts
for clients and potential institutional investors wishing to work with the Company from the produce industry due to the public perception
and political issues surrounding the cannabis industry. By late-2016, the Company had decided to cease actively selling its products
and services to the vertical farming industry and to focus on utilizing the Company s developed technology and methods for the
cannabis industry. 

On
August 3, 2017, we formed Alamo Acquisition, LLC, a wholly owned Texas limited liability company Alamo Acquisition Sub ).
On August 4, 2017, the Company ceased actively supporting business development of vertical farms for produce production and consummated
a business acquisition (the Alamo Acquisition pursuant to which Alamo Acquisition Sub acquired all of the outstanding
membership interests of Alamo CBD, LLC Alamo CBD ), a Texas limited liability company. Upon closing of the Alamo Acquisition,
the membership interests of Alamo CBD were exchanged for 7,584,008 shares of Indoor Harvest s common stock, the parent company
of Alamo Acquisition Sub. Alamo CBD continued as our surviving wholly-owned subsidiary, and Alamo Acquisition Sub ceased to exist. 

On
August 14, 2019, the Company established a wholly owned subsidiary, IHC Consulting, Inc. IHC ), in the State of New York
of the United States of America. IHC Consulting will provide consulting and other services to the Company and others on a contracted
basis. 

Description
of Business 

Indoor
Harvest, through its brand name Indoor Harvest , was focused on leveraging technology and planning on Vertical Farming, Building
Integrated Agriculture, Controlled Environment Agriculture and Aeroponic Cultivation technology with other synergistic enterprises in
the Cannabis industry prior to 2020.. 

The
2022 business strategy is to position the Company as an integrated consolidation platform for plant-based industry companies focused
on hemp, other hemp-related products, CBD, and other plant-based companies with the potential to be part of a bigger opportunity while
sharing intellectual capital, technology, expanded business networks, along with access to new capital markets and liquidity for investors. 

Our
operational expenditures will be focused on our plans to create shareholder value through an M A and strategic partnership strategy,
while managing the necessary costs related to being a fully reporting company with the SEC. 

COVID-19 

A
novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was first identified in December 2019, and subsequently declared a global pandemic by the World
Health Organization on March 11, 2020. As a result of the outbreak, many companies have experienced disruptions in their operations and
in markets served. The Company has instituted some and may take additional temporary precautionary measures intended to help ensure the
well-being of its managers and minimize business disruption. The Company considered the impact of COVID-19 on the assumptions and estimates
used and determined that there were no material adverse impacts on the Company s results of operations and financial position at
September30, 2020. The full extent of the future impacts of COVID-19 on the Company s operations is uncertain. A prolonged outbreak
could have a material adverse impact on financial results and business operations of the Company, including the timing and ability of
the Company to develop its business plan.

Industry
and Regulatory Overview 

The
United States federal government regulates drugs through the CSA (21 U.S.C. 811), which places controlled substances, including
cannabis, in a schedule. Cannabis is classified as a Schedule I drug, which is viewed as highly addictive and having no medical value.
The United States Federal Drug Administration FDA has not approved the sale of cannabis for any medical application.
Doctors may not prescribe cannabis for medical use under federal law, however, they can recommend its use under the First Amendment.
In 2010, the United States Veterans Affairs Department clarified that veterans using medicinal cannabis will not be denied services or
other medications that are denied to those using illegal drugs. 

State
legalization efforts conflict with the CSA, which makes cannabis use and possession illegal on a national level. On August 29, 2013,
the U.S. Department of Justice DOJ issued a memorandum (the Cole Memo providing that where states and
local governments enact laws authorizing cannabis-related use, and implement strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems,
the federal government will rely upon states and local enforcement agencies to address cannabis activity through the enforcement of their
own state and local narcotics laws. 

On
January 4, 2018, the DOJ suspended the Cole Memo and replaced it with a new Memorandum titled with the subject Marijuana Enforcement 
from Attorney General Jeff Sessions which provides that each U.S. Attorney has the discretion to determine which types of cannabis-related
cases should be federally prosecuted, thus ending the broad safe harbor provided under the Cole Memo. 

In
November 2018, Attorney General Sessions resigned and left the DOJ. As a nominee, Attorney General William Barr testified before the
U.S. Senate and wrote to Congress that, as Attorney General, he would not seek to prosecute cannabis companies that relied on the Cole
Memo and are complying with state law. 

As
of April 25, 2019, 34 states, the District of Columbia and Guam allow their citizens to use medical cannabis through de-criminalization.
Within this list of jurisdictions, voters in the States of Alaska, California, Colorado, D.C., Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon,
Vermont, and Washington have legalized cannabis for adult recreational use. 

The
Company continues to follow and monitor the actions and statements of the Trump administration, the DOJ and Congress positions
on federal law and cannabis policy. As the possession and use of cannabis is illegal under the CSA, we could be deemed to be aiding and
abetting illegal activities through the equipment we intend to sell in the U.S. and directly violating federal law if we should begin
producing cannabis under State law. Under federal law, and more specifically the CSA, the possession, use, cultivation, and transfer
of cannabis is illegal. Our equipment could be used by persons or entities engaged in the business of possession, use, cultivation, and/or
transfer of cannabis. 

As
a result, law enforcement authorities, in their attempt to regulate the illegal use of cannabis, could seek to bring an action or actions
against us, including, but not limited to, a claim of aiding and abetting another s criminal activities or directly violating the
CSA. The federal aiding and abetting statute provides that anyone who commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets,
counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal (18 U.S.C. 2(a).) Enforcement of federal
law regarding cannabis would likely result in the Company being unable to proceed with our business plans, could expose us to potential
criminal liability and could subject our properties to civil forfeiture which could lead to an entire loss of any investment in the Company.
Any changes in banking, insurance or other business services may also affect our ability to operate our business. 

Although
the Company, from 2020 and going forward, intends to focus on plant-based opportunities, hemp businesses, and other ancillary industry
companies, changes in the regulatory and legal environment could impact banking, financial, and other business services crucial to the
operations of the business. 

Nothing
herein is a legal opinion or a complete or up to date statement on laws, regulations, or policies, especially given the shifting legal
and regulatory landscape. 

Changes
in Business Operations 

2022
was a continuation of our 2020 restructuring, reorganizing, and repositioning of the business. The Company believes it is positioned
to start executing its business strategy and leveraging the public company to create shareholder value. The recent long-term commitments
of the new management team coupled with a robust business network to support our business initiatives have laid the foundation for the
future. We will be working on branding and continuing to build our team in 2022, once we have our new plans funded. 

The
current business strategy is to position the Company as an integrated consolidation platform for plant-based industry companies focused
on hemp, other hemp-related products, CBD, and other plant-based companies with the potential to be part of a bigger opportunity while
sharing intellectual capital, technology, expanded business networks, along with access to new capital markets and liquidity for investors. 

On
February 14, 2022, the Company announced a non-binding letter of intent with Electrum Partners, LLC (EP) to acquire certain assets of
EP for an aggregate payment at closing and of a purchase price that will be mutually agreed by the parties based on an independent valuation
of the purchased assets. 

On
March 1, 2023, the Company announced an Asset Purchase agreement to acquire certain business assets, including the rights to further
develop business opportunities in various stages of due diligence from EP. 

The
Company is subject to risks, no assurance exists of ability to raise sufficient capital on good terms or our ability to become profitable. 

5 

Intellectual
Property 

The
Company relies on a strategy of a combination of patent law, trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and other contractual
provisions to protect our proprietary rights, which are primarily our brand names, product designs and marks. This does not mean these
efforts are up to date or fully effective. The following summarizes certain filings. The Company is currently studying the legal aspects
of these, including recent and past communications from counsel and the patent office, and makes no promise or representation as to this
information which is subject to correction and update. 

The
Company s primary trademark is Indoor Harvest. This trademark was registered (Registration Number 4,795,471) in the
United States on August 18, 2015. 

The
Company filed a patent application (Serial Number 14/120,275) with the United States patent office related to an invention titled: modular
aeroponic system and related methods. The inventor is Chad Sykes, who assigned the patent application to the Company. 

We
will research the status of our filings and restructure or update as needed this year. 

Plan
of Expanded Operations 

The
current business strategy is to position the Company as an integrated consolidation platform for plant-based industry companies focused
on hemp, other hemp-related products, CBD, and other plant-based companies with the potential to be part of a bigger opportunity while
sharing intellectual capital, technology, expanded business networks, along with access to new capital markets and liquidity for investors. 

6 

Sales
and Marketing 

We
will be working on branding and building our team in 2022, once we have our new plans funded. 

Competition
and Market Position 

The
current business strategy is to position the Company as an integrated consolidation platform for plant-based industry companies focused
on hemp, other hemp-related products, CBD, and other plant-based companies with the potential to be part of a bigger opportunity while
sharing intellectual capital, technology, expanded business networks, along with access to new capital markets and liquidity for investors.
This may be done by asset acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures, or other strategic initiatives. 

OTC
Markets 

OTC
Markets offer small companies almost comparable benefits of the NYSE or Nasdaq markets, a liquid, secondary trading market, visibility,
access to capital, a public market valuation and the ability for small companies to build their brand and reputation across the network,
at nearly half the cost of an NYSE listing. 

We
are positioning to compete with other plant-based and hemp related science and consumer product companies trading on the OTC Markets. 

Employees 

As
of December 31, 2022, we have 2 full-time employees and use a variety of advisors and consultants. 

Governmental
Regulation and Certification 

Except
as set forth below, we are not aware of any material governmental regulations or approvals for any of our products or services. 

7 

As
the possession and use of cannabis is illegal under the CSA, we could be deemed to be aiding and abetting illegal activities through
the equipment we intend to sell, lease and license in the U.S. to grow cannabis. Additionally, we would be violating federal law should
we begin to manufacture and dispense cannabis under the TCUP. Under federal law, and more specifically the CSA, the possession, use,
cultivation, and transfer of cannabis is illegal. Our equipment could be used by persons or entities engaged in the business of possession,
use, cultivation, and/or transfer of cannabis. As a result, law enforcement authorities, in their attempt to regulate the illegal use
of cannabis, could seek to bring an action or actions against us, including, but not limited, to a claim of aiding and abetting another s
criminal activities or directly violating federal law by manufacturing or distributing cannabis. The federal aiding and abetting statute
provides that anyone who commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures
its commission, is punishable as a principal. However, we do not believe that our plans to license and sell technology as described
herein violates federal law and we believe that we would prevail if any such action were brought against us although there can be no
assurance of this. 

Cannabis
is a Schedule-I controlled substance and is illegal under federal law. Even in such states that have legalized the use of cannabis, its
use remains a violation of federal law. Since federal law criminalizing the use of cannabis preempts state laws that legalize its use,
strict enforcement of federal law regarding cannabis would likely result in our inability to proceed with our business plan, notably
with respect to our plans for cannabis cultivation, production and research. In addition, our assets, including real property, cash,
equipment and other goods, could be subject to asset forfeiture because cannabis is still illegal at the federal level should we begin
to manufacture and distribute cannabis under the TCUP. 

In
February 2017, the Trump administration made announcements that there could be greater enforcement of federal laws regarding
cannabis. To this end, on January 4, 2018, the DOJ suspended certain Obama era protections set forth previously in the Cole Memo, as
such term is defined above, which was replaced with a new Memorandum titled with the subject Marijuana Enforcement from
Attorney General Jeff Sessions which provides that each U.S. Attorney has the discretion to determine which types of cannabis-related
cases should be federally prosecuted, thus ending the broad safe harbor provided under the Cole Memo. Any such enforcement actions could
have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In November 2018, Attorney General Sessions resigned and left
the DOJ. As a nominee, Attorney General William Barr testified before the U.S. Senate and wrote to Congress that, as Attorney General,
he would not seek to prosecute cannabis companies that relied on the Cole Memo and are complying with state law. The Company plans to
continue to follow and monitor the actions and statements of the Trump administration, the DOJ and Congress positions on federal
law and cannabis policy. 

The
regulatory environment on a Federal, State, and Local level remains opaque and ever changing. This aspect of business risk is in flux
and our disclosure should not be deemed a legal opinion or interpreted as fully addressing the myriad regulatory challenges inherent
in the industry. 

Emerging
Growth Company Status 

We
are an emerging growth company as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business
Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting
requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited
to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act ), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions
from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute
payments not previously approved. We intend to take advantage of all of these exemptions. 

In
addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended
transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards, and delay
compliance with new or revised accounting standards until those standards are applicable to private companies. We have elected to take
advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 

We
could be an emerging growth company until the last day of the first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our first common equity
offering, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier if our annual revenues exceed 1.0 billion, if we issue more
than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt in any three-year period or if we become a large accelerated filer as defined
in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act.

Trading
History 

Our
common stock is quoted on the OTCMarkets under the symbol INQD . As of December 31, 2022, there were 2,693,190,084 outstanding
shares of common stock and approximately 98 shareholders of record. The number of record holders was determined from the records of our
transfer agent and does not include beneficial owners of common stock whose shares are held in the names of bank, brokers and other nominees. 

Dividends 

We
have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock to date. Any future decisions regarding dividends will be made by our Board of Directors.
We do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future but expect to retain earnings to finance the growth of our business.
Our Board of Directors has complete discretion on whether to pay dividends. Even if our Board of Directors decides to pay dividends,
the form, frequency and amount will depend upon our future operations and earnings, capital requirements and surplus, general financial
condition, contractual restrictions and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant. 

There
are no restrictions in our articles of incorporation or bylaws that prevent us from declaring dividends. The Texas Statutes, however,
prohibit us from declaring dividends where, after giving effect to the distribution of the dividend: 

We
 would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business; or 

Our
 total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed to satisfy the rights of stockholders
 who have preferential rights superior to those receiving the distribution, unless otherwise permitted under our articles of incorporation.

Securities
Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans 

We
do not have in effect any compensation plans under which our equity securities are authorized for issuance. 

Common
Stock 

As
of December 31, 2022, there were 2,693,190,084 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. 

The
holders of our common stock have equal ratable rights to dividends from funds legally available if and when declared by our Board of
Directors and are entitled to share ratably in all of our assets available for distribution to holders of common stock upon liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of our affairs. Our common stock does not provide the right to a preemptive, subscription or conversion rights
and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions or rights. Our common stockholders are entitled to one non-cumulative vote per
share on all matters on which stockholders may vote. 

All
shares of common stock now outstanding are fully paid for and non-assessable. We refer you to our certificate of incorporation, bylaws
and the applicable statutes of the State of Texas for a more complete description of the rights and liabilities of holders of our securities. 

Holders
of shares of our common stock do not have cumulative voting rights, which means that the holders of more than 50 of the outstanding
shares, voting for the election of directors, can elect all of the directors to be elected, if they so choose, and, in that event, the
holders of the remaining shares will not be able to elect any of our directors. 

Holders
of Common Stock 

We
have 104 shareholders of record for our common stock, as of December 31, 2022. 

Preferred
Stock 

The
Company has designated 15,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock with a par value of 0.01. 

The
stated value of each issued share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shall be deemed to be 1.00, as the same may be equitably adjusted
whenever there may occur a stock dividend, stock split, combination, reclassification or similar event affecting the Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock. There are no dividends payable on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. Each holder of outstanding shares of Series
A Convertible Preferred Stock shall be entitled to cast the number of votes for the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock in an amount
equal to the number of whole shares of common stock into which the shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock held by such holder
are convertible as of the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote on such matter 

The
Series A Preferred Stock also had a down-round protection feature provided to the investors if the Company subsequently
issued or sold any shares of common stock, stock options, or convertible securities at a price less than the conversion price of 1.00
per common share. The conversion price was automatically adjustable down to the price of the instrument being issued. As a result of
conversions during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Series A Preferred Stock conversion price was reset to 0.00006 per share. 

As
of December 31, 2020, the 13 preferred shareholders holding 750,000 preferred shares can convert to 12.5 billion shares of common stock,
which was significantly more than the outstanding common stock at that time. As of December 31, 2020, there are currently 2,401,396,041
shares outstanding. The Company has increased its authorized shares to 10 billion shares in May of 2020, addressing the potential Company
control issue if conversion of all the preferred shares were to occur at the same time. 

Upon
any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company under Texas law, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of the shares
of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shall be paid an amount equal to the aggregate stated value of their shares of Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock, before any payment shall be paid to the holders of common stock, or any other stock ranking on liquidation junior to
the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, an amount for each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock held by such holder equal
to the sum of the Stated Value thereof. 

As
at December 31, 2020, there were 750,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding. 

On
August 27, 2021, Indoor Harvest Corp (the Company completed an initiative when it entered into a Modification Agreement
(the Modification in cooperation with the current Series A Preferred shareholders to modify their conversion privileges
to align and support current management team initiatives and shareholder interests. The modification agreement provides the Preferred
shareholders the ability to convert into common shares at a conversion price at the lower of 0.40 (per the original agreement), or the
subsequent per share pricing of a future equity raise greater than Five Hundred Thousand 500,000) Dollars. This Modification is forecasted
to support anti- dilutive measures potentially to the benefit of our shareholders and may allow the Company to proceed with plans relating
to funding needs. 

On
November 8, 2021, the Company finalized a Supplemental agreement with the Series A Preferred shareholders to convert their holdings into
common shares of the Company at 0.0125 in alignment and support of the current management team s initiatives with the goal of
benefiting shareholders. This agreement was pursued for the benefit of the Company s common shareholders to mitigate the potential
risk of diluting their shareholding in the event that the Company undertakes additional financing transactions to fund the Company s
expansion initiatives. 

Pursuant
to the Preferred Shareholder s Supplemental Agreement dated November 8, 2021 (the Supplemental Agreement by and
between the Company and holders of its Series A Preferred shares, under which holders of the Series A Preferred shares agreed to convert
all of the Series A Preferred shares into common shares of the Company effective November 8, 2021, the Company has issued an aggregate
of sixty (60) million restricted common shares. The restricted common shares issued are subject to Rule 144 required holding periods.

Overview 

The
current business strategy continues to be to position the Company as an integrated consolidation platform for plant-based industry companies
focused on hemp, other hemp-related products, CBD, and other plant-based businesses with the potential to be part of a bigger opportunity
while sharing intellectual capital, technology, expanded business networks, along with access to new capital markets and liquidity for
investors. 

The
company spent the majority of 2021 reorganizing, restructuring, and repositioning the business. In 2022, those efforts have allowed the
company to begin moving forward on its business strategy of developing and acquiring operating businesses, beginning with the letter
of intent announced with Electrum Partners, LLC. 

The
Company was funded through a convertible note structure from 2017 into 2019, that allowed the Company to keep being active while we restructure,
reposition and recapitalize the company. We continue to seek funding from other capital sources as we position the company for future
growth. 

As
part of the restructuring and recapitalization effort, the Company plans to regularly increases the number of shares of common stock
the Company is authorized to issue. We believe this will enable the Company to raise additional capital by allowing funding sources to
be able to convert debt to shares, a common form of funding, and to utilize shares as currency for future M A transactions or related
strategic initiatives. 

Raising
new capital is critical to the Company going forward and is a primary focus to support the current acquisition and growth strategy.

due diligence costs, as well as the necessary costs related to being a fully reporting company with the SEC.

and disclosure rules. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under
Section 102(b)(2) of the JOBS Act, that allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective
dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. Because of this election, our financial statements
may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.

9A Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The
Company s Chief Executive Officer (the principal executive officer and principal financial officer) have evaluated the effectiveness
of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of
December 31, 2022. Based upon such evaluation, Chief Executive Officer (the principal executive officer and principal financial officer)
have concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (the principal executive officer
and principal financial officer), we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2022, based on the framework stated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission s 2013
Framework. 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. Because of inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
may become inadequate due to change in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Based
on its evaluation as of December 31, 2022, our management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective
as of December 31, 2022 due to the material weaknesses set forth below. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of control
deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of
the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

Because
of the Company s limited resources, there are limited controls over financial information processing. The Company determined that
its internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2022. The basis for the conclusions that such internal
control was ineffective included the following considerations: 

We
 currently have insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements
 and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements. 

Additionally,
 there is a lack of formal process and timeline for closing the books and records at the end of each reporting period and such weaknesses
 restrict the Company s ability to timely gather, analyze and report information relative to the financial statements. 

Our
 Company s management is composed of a small number of individuals resulting in a situation where limitations on segregation
 of duties exist. 

Material
risks associated with the above issues include the following: 

Because
 the Company currently has insufficient written policies and procedures with regard to financial reporting, this could cause the Company
 to be inefficient and potentially encounter errors in preparing its financial reports due to the lack of a written policy for the
 company to follow. 

Because
 there is a lack of formal process and timeline, this cold lead the Company not to be able to timely prepare its financial statements
 and could cause it to either file a report late or to a file a report which may contain some errors. 

Because
 the Company s management is composed of a small number of persons, there is a lack of segregation of duties. 

This
report does not include an attestation report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal
control over financial reporting. We were not required to have, nor have we, engaged the Company s independent registered public
accounting firm to perform an audit of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange
Commission that permit us to provide only management s report in this annual report.

Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

There
has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph
(d) of Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that has materially affected
or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

any expenses and the payment of profits arising from the purchase and sale Mr. Weadock of securities in violation of Section 16(b) of
the Securities Exchange Act, or any similar successor statute; provided, further that, that the Company shall not be obligated to indemnify

The
following table sets forth the ownership, as of the this date of our common stock by each person known by us to be the beneficial owner
of more than 5 of our outstanding common stock, our director, and our executive officer and director as a group. To the best of our
knowledge, the persons named have sole voting and investment power with respect to such shares, except as otherwise noted. There are
no pending or anticipated arrangements that may cause a change in control.

The
information presented below regarding beneficial ownership of our voting securities has been presented in accordance with the rules of
the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not necessarily indicative of ownership for any other purpose. Under these rules, a person
is deemed to be a beneficial owner of a security if that person has or shares the power to vote or direct the voting of
the security or the power to dispose or direct the disposition of the security. A person is deemed to own beneficially any security as
to which such person has the right to acquire sole or shared voting or investment power within 60 days through the conversion or exercise
of any convertible security, warrant, option or other right. More than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same
securities. The percentage of beneficial ownership by any person as of a particular date is calculated by dividing the number of shares
beneficially owned by such person, which includes the number of shares as to which such person has the right to acquire voting or investment
power within 60 days, by the sum of the number of shares outstanding as of such date plus the number of shares as to which such person
has the right to acquire voting or investment power within 60 days. Consequently, the denominator used for calculating such percentage
may be different for each beneficial owner. Except as otherwise indicated below and under applicable community property laws, we believe
that the beneficial owners of our common stock listed below have sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares shown. The
business address of the shareholders is 7401 W. Slaughter Lane #5078, Austin, Texas 78739.

of our annual financial statements and review of financial statements included in our Form 10-K, or for services that are normally provided
by the accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for those fiscal years; (ii) audit-related

Under
applicable SEC rules, the Audit Committee is required to pre-approve the audit and non-audit services performed by the independent auditors
in order to ensure that they do not impair the auditors independence. The SEC s rules specify the types of non-audit services
that an independent auditor may not provide to its audit client and establish the Audit Committee s responsibility for administration
of the engagement of the independent auditors. Until such time as we have an Audit Committee in place, the Board of Directors will pre-approve
the audit and non-audit services performed by the independent auditors. 

Consistent
with the SEC s rules, the Audit Committee Charter requires that the Audit Committee review and pre-approve all audit services and
permitted non-audit services provided by the independent auditors to us or any of our subsidiaries. The Audit Committee may delegate
pre-approval authority to a member of the Audit Committee and if it does, the decisions of that member must be presented to the full
Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To: 
 The Board of Directors and Stockholders of 

Indoor Harvest Corp 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Indoor Harvest Corp and its subsidiaries (the Company as
of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income, changes in stockholders 
equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred
to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year
period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Emphasis
of Matter Going Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As of December 31, 2021,
the Company had incurred substantial losses, and had an accumulated deficit and had net cash outflows in operating activities which gave
rise to substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. As of December 31, 2022, the Company s
had a positive net working capital position indicating an improvement in the Company s financial position as the result of funds
raised in the issuance of common stock and warrants for cash proceeds during the year ended December 31, 2022; however, as discussed
in Note 2 to the financial statements, during the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company continued to incur substantial losses and
net cash outflows in operating activities; accordingly, the substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as going
concern was not alleviated and still exists; however, management is closely monitoring the situation; its plan to address this substantial
doubt in set forth in Note 2. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and
(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there were no critical audit matters.

TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

shares of Indoor Harvest s common stock, the parent company of Alamo Acquisition Sub, and Alamo CBD continued as our surviving
wholly-owned subsidiary, and Alamo Acquisition Sub ceased to exist. Pursuant to ASC 805 Business Combinations, the
Company determined the Alamo Acquisition was an asset purchase. 

From
inception until August 4, 2017, the Company provided full service, state of the art design-build, engineering, procurement and construction
services to the indoor and vertical farming industry. The Company provided production platforms, mechanical systems and complete custom
designed build outs for both Controlled Environment Agriculture CEA and Building Integrated Agriculture BIA ),
for two unique industries, produce and cannabis. In mid-2016, the Company began efforts to separate its produce and cannabis related
operations due to ongoing feedback from both clients and potential institutional investors. It was determined that the Company s
involvement in the cannabis industry was creating conflicts for clients and potential institutional investors wishing to work with the
Company from the produce industry due to the public perception and political issues surrounding the cannabis industry. By late-2016,
the Company had decided to cease actively selling its products and services to the vertical farming industry and to focus on utilizing
the Company s developed technology and methods for the cannabis industry. On August 4, 2017, the Company ceased actively supporting
business development of vertical farms for produce production. 

On
August 14, 2019, the Company established a wholly owned subsidiary, IHC Consulting, Inc. IHC ), in the State of New York
of the United States of America. IHC Consulting will provide consulting and other services to the Company and others on a contracted
basis.

and has an accumulated
deficit of , for the year ended December 31, 2022. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. 

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on Management s plans which include potential asset acquisitions,
mergers or business combinations with other entities, further implementation of its business plan and continuing to raise funds through
debt or equity financings. The Company will likely rely upon related party debt or equity financing in order to ensure the continuing
existence of the business. 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction
of liabilities in the normal course of business. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of
the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going
concern.
