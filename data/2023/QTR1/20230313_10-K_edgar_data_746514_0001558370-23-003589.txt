 NEW ENGLAND REALTY ASSOCIATES LIMITED PARTNERSHIP PART I ITEM 1. BUSINES S General New England Realty Associates Limited Partnership NERA or the Partnership ), a Massachusetts Limited Partnership, was formed on August 12, 1977 as the successor to five real estate limited partnerships (collectively, the Colonial Partnerships ), which filed for protection under Chapter XII of the Federal Bankruptcy Act in September 1974. The bankruptcy proceedings were terminated in late 1984. In July 2004, the General Partner extended the termination date of the Partnership until 2057, as allowed in the Partnership Agreement. The authorized capital of the Partnership is represented by three classes of partnership units Units ). There are two categories of limited partnership interests Class A Units and Class B Units and one category of general partnership interests (the General Partnership Units ). The Class A Units were initially issued to creditors and limited partners of the Colonial Partnerships and have been registered under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Each Class A Unit is exchangeable for 30 publicly traded depositary receipts Receipts ), which are currently listed on the NYSE American and are registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act. The Class B Units were issued to the original general partners of the Partnership. The General Partnership Units are held by the current general partner of the Partnership, NewReal, Inc. (the General Partner or New Real ). The Class A Units represent an 80 ownership interest, the Class B Units represent a 19 ownership interest, and the General Partnership Units represent a 1 ownership interest. The Partnership is engaged in the business of acquiring, developing, holding for investment, operating and selling real estate. The Partnership, directly or through 29 subsidiary limited partnerships or limited liability companies, owns and operates various residential apartments, condominium units and commercial properties located in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. As used herein, the Partnership s subsidiary limited partnerships and limited liabilities companies are each referred to as a Subsidiary Partnership and are collectively referred to as the Subsidiary Partnerships. The Partnership owns between a 99.67 and 100 interest in each of the Subsidiary Partnerships, except in seven limited liability companies (the Investment Properties or Joint Ventures in which the Partnership has between a 40 and 50 ownership interest. The majority shareholder of the General Partner indirectly owns between 47.6 and 59 , and five other current and past employees of Hamilton own collectively between 0 and 2.4 , respectively of the Joint Ventures. The Partnership s interest in the Investment Properties is accounted for on the equity method in the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements Principles of Consolidation. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures for a description of the properties and their operations. Of those Subsidiary Partnerships not wholly owned by the Partnership, except for the Investment Properties, the remaining ownership interest is held by an unaffiliated third party. In each such case, the third party has entered into an agreement with the Partnership, pursuant to which any benefit derived from its ownership interest in the applicable Subsidiary Partnerships will be returned to the Partnership. The long-term goals of the Partnership are to manage, rent and improve its properties and to acquire additional properties with income and capital appreciation potential as suitable opportunities arise. When appropriate, the Partnership may sell or refinance selected properties. Proceeds from any such sales or refinancing will be used to reduce debt, reinvest in acquisitions of other properties, distribute to the partners, repurchase equity interests, or use for operating expenses or reserves, as determined by the General Partner. Operations of the Partnership The Trustees of the estate of Harold Brown currently hold voting control over the NewReal shares. The Trustees are currently Sally Michael and David Reier.

Table of Contents 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Partnership was managed by the General Partner, NewReal, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation wholly owned by the estate of Harold Brown and Ronald Brown. The General Partner has engaged The Hamilton Company, Inc. (the Hamilton Company or Hamilton to perform general management functions for the Partnership s properties in exchange for management fees. The Hamilton Company is wholly owned by JPB Real Estate LLC and Maisie Brown LLC, entities controlled by Jameson Brown and Harley Brown respectively. The Partnership, Subsidiary Partnerships, and the Investment Properties currently contract with the management company for 53 individuals at the Properties and 11 individuals at the Joint Ventures who are primarily involved in the supervision and maintenance of specific properties. The General Partner has no employees . As of February 1, 2023, the Partnership and its Subsidiary Partnerships owned 2,892 residential apartment units in 25 residential and mixed-use complexes (collectively, the Apartment Complexes ). The Partnership also owns 19 condominium units in a residential condominium complex, all of which are leased to residential tenants (collectively referred to as the Condominium Units ). The Apartment Complexes, the Condominium Units and the Investment Properties are located primarily in the metropolitan Boston area of Massachusetts. As of February 1, 2023, the Subsidiary Partnerships also owned two commercial shopping centers in Framingham, Massachusetts, one commercial building in Newton and one in Brookline, Massachusetts and commercial space in mixed-use buildings in Boston, Brockton and Newton, Massachusetts. These properties are referred to collectively as the Commercial Properties. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included as a part of this Form 10-K. Additionally, as of February 1, 2023, the Partnership owned a 40-50 interest in 7 residential and mixed use complexes, the Investment Properties, with a total of 688 residential units, one commercial unit, and a 50 car parking lot. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these investments. The Apartment Complexes, Investment Properties, Condominium Units and Commercial Properties are referred to collectively as the Properties. The Brown family entities, and, in certain cases, Ronald Brown, and officers and employees of the Hamilton Company own or have owned interests in certain of the Properties, Subsidiary Partnerships and Joint Ventures. See Item 13. Certain Relationships, Related Transactions and Director Independence. The leasing of real estate in the metropolitan Boston area of Massachusetts is highly competitive. The Apartment Complexes, Condominium Units and the Investment Properties must compete for tenants with other residential apartments and condominium units in the areas in which they are located. The Commercial Properties must compete for commercial tenants with other shopping malls and office buildings in the areas in which they are located. Thus, the level of competition at each Property depends on how many other similarly situated properties are in its vicinity. In addition to Item 1A, Risk Factors, See Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Factors that May Affect Future Results. The Second Amended and Restated Contract of Limited Partnership of the Partnership (the Partnership Agreement authorizes the General Partner to acquire real estate and real estate related investments from or in participation with either or both of the Brown family related entities and Ronald Brown, or their affiliates, upon the satisfaction of certain terms and conditions, including the approval of the Partnership s Advisory Committee and limitations on the price paid by the Partnership for such investments. The Partnership Agreement also permits the Partnership s limited partners and the General Partner to make loans to the Partnership, subject to certain limitations on the rate of interest that may be charged to the Partnership. Except for the foregoing, the Partnership does not have any policies prohibiting any limited partner, General Partner or any other person from having any direct or indirect pecuniary interest in any investment to be acquired or disposed of by the Partnership or in any transaction to which the Partnership is a party or has an interest in or from engaging, for their own account, in business activities of the types conducted or to be conducted by the Partnership. The General Partner is not limited in the number or amount of mortgages which may be placed on any Property, nor is there a policy limiting the percentage of Partnership assets which may be invested in any specific Property.

On March 10, 2015, the General Partner authorized an increase in the Repurchase Program to 2,000,000 Depository Receipts and extended the Program for an additional five years from March 31, 2015 until March 31, 2020.

In connection with this refinancing, there were closing costs of approximately 136,000. During 2022, the Partnership and its Subsidiary Partnerships completed improvements to certain of the Properties at a total cost of approximately 5,981,000. These improvements were funded from cash reserves and, to some extent, escrow accounts established in connection with the financing or refinancing of the applicable Properties. These sources have been adequate to fully fund improvements. The most significant improvements were made at Hamilton Oaks, Westside Colonial, 1144 Commonwealth, Captain Parker, Hamilton Green, and River Drive Apartments, at a cost of 1,193,000, 636,000, 566,000, 507,000, 390,000, and 294,000 respectively. The Partnership plans to invest approximately 12,500,000 in capital improvements in 2023. Line of Credit On July 31, 2014, the Partnership entered into an agreement for a 25,000,000 revolving line of credit. The term of the line was for three years with a floating interest rate equal to a base rate of the greater of (a) the Prime Rate (b) the Federal Funds Rate plus one-half of one percent per annum, or (c) the LIBOR Rate for a period of one month plus 1 per annum, plus the applicable margin of 2.5 . The agreement originally expired on July 31, 2017, and was extended until October 31, 2020. The costs associated with the line of credit extension were approximately 128,000. Prior to the line s expiration in 2020, the Partnership exercised its option for a one-year extension until October 31, 2021. The Partnership paid an extension fee of approximately 37,500 in association with the extension. On October 29, 2021, t he Partnership closed on the modification of its existing line of credit. The agreement extended the credit line for three years until October 29, 2024. The commitment amount was for 25 million but is restricted to 17 million during the modification period. The modification period covers the current period and phased out on December 31, 2022. During this period, the loan covenants were modified from a minimum consolidated debt service ratio of 1.60 to a ratio of 1.35 until September 30, 2022; from a minimum tangible net worth requirement of 200 million to a net worth of 175 million until September 30, 2022; from a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 65 to a ratio of 70 until September 30, 2022 and from a minimum debt yield of 9.5 to a yield of 8.5 until September 30, 2022 and a yield of 9.0 until December 31, 2022. Once the financial performance of the Partnership meets the original covenant tests for the trailing 12-month period, the commitment amount will return to 25 million. The portfolio s debt yield fell below the minimum of 9.0 to 8.3 . Consequently, as of December 31, 2022, the Partnership did not comply with the debt yield financial covenant. As such, the Partnership is restricted to draw down any amount from the line of credit until the Partnership meets the required financial covenants. The interest rate for the new term is LIBOR plus 300 basis points. The costs associated with the modification and renewal of the line of credit is approximately 179,000 . On December 3, 2021, the Partnership paid off the outstanding balance of 17,000,000 on the Line of Credit. The line of credit may be used for acquisition, refinancing, improvements, working capital and other needs of the Partnership. The line may not be used to pay dividends, make distributions or acquire equity interests of the Partnership.

 The line of credit is collateralized by varying percentages of the Partnership s ownership interest in 23 of its subsidiary properties and joint ventures. Pledged interests range from 49 to 100 of the Partnership s ownership interest in the respective entities. Advisory Committee As of December 31, 2022, the Advisory Committee members were limited partners Robert Nahigian and David Ross. These Advisory Committee members are not affiliated with the General Partner.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTOR S We are subject to certain risks and uncertainties as described below. These risks and uncertainties may not be the only ones we face; there may be additional risks that we do not presently know of or that we currently consider immaterial. All of these risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our ability to pay distributions on, and the market price of, our equity securities may be adversely affected if any of such risks are realized. All investors should consider the following risk factors before deciding to purchase or sell securities of the Partnership. We are subject to risks inherent in the ownership of real estate. We own and manage multifamily apartment complexes and commercial properties that are subject to varying degrees of risk generally incident to the ownership of real estate. Our financial condition, the value of our properties and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders will be dependent upon our ability to operate our properties in a manner sufficient to generate income in excess of operating expenses and debt service charges, which may be affected by the following risks, some of which are discussed in more detail below: changes in the economic climate in the markets in which we own and manage properties, including interest rates, the overall level of economic activity, the availability of consumer credit and mortgage financing, unemployment rates and other factors; a lessening of demand for the multifamily and commercial units that we own; competition from other available multifamily residential and commercial units and changes in market rental rates; development by competitors of competing multi-family communities; increases in property and liability insurance costs; 
 7 

Table of Contents 
 changes in real estate taxes and other operating expenses (e.g., cleaning, utilities, repair and maintenance costs, insurance and administrative costs, security, landscaping, pest control, staffing, snow removal and other general costs); changes in laws and regulations affecting properties (including tax, environmental, zoning and building codes, and housing laws and regulations); weather and other conditions that might adversely affect operating expenses; expenditures that cannot be anticipated, such as utility rate and usage increases, unanticipated repairs and real estate tax valuation reassessments or mileage rate increases; our inability to control operating expenses or achieve increases in revenues; the results of litigation filed or to be filed against us; risks related to our joint ventures; risks of personal injury claims and property damage related to mold claims because of diminished insurance coverage; catastrophic property damage losses that are not covered by our insurance; risks associated with property acquisitions such as environmental liabilities, among others; changes in market conditions that may limit or prevent us from acquiring or selling properties; the perception of tenants and prospective tenants as to the attractiveness, convenience and safety of our properties or the neighborhoods in which they are located; and 
 We are dependent on rental income from our multifamily apartment complexes and commercial properties. If we are unable to attract and retain tenants or if our tenants are unable to pay their rental obligations, our financial condition and funds available for distribution to our shareholders will be adversely affected. S ecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer . Although we employ a number of measures to prevent, detect and mitigate cybersecurity attacks, our business is at risk from and may be impacted by such attacks as there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a cyber-attack. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks, and there can be no assurance that our actions, security measures, and controls designed to prevent, detect, or respond to intrusion; to limit access to data; to prevent loss, destruction, alteration, or exfiltration of business information; or to limit the negative impact from such attacks can provide absolute security against a cybersecurity incident. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disruption to our operations, increased cybersecurity insurance premiums and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business. Our multifamily apartment complexes and commercial properties are subject to competition. Our properties and joint venture investments are located in developed areas that include other properties. The properties also compete with other rental alternatives, such as condominiums, single and multifamily rental homes, owner occupied single and multifamily homes, and commercial properties in attracting tenants. This competition may affect our ability to attract and retain residents and to increase or maintain rental rates. The properties we own are concentrated in Eastern Massachusetts and Southern New Hampshire. Our performance, therefore, is linked to economic conditions and the market for available rental housing and commercial

Table of Contents 
 space in these states. A decline in the market for apartment housing and/or commercial properties may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and ability to make distributions to our shareholders. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover certain risks. There are certain types of risks, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as earthquakes, floods, windstorms, act of war and terrorist attacks that may be uninsurable, or are not economically insurable, or are not fully covered by insurance. Moreover, certain risks, such as mold and environmental exposures, generally are not covered by our insurance. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could lose our equity in the affected property as well as the anticipated future cash flow from that property. Any such loss could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Debt financing could adversely affect our performance. The vast majority of our assets are encumbered by project specific, non-recourse, non-cross-collateralized mortgage debt. There is a risk that these properties will not have sufficient cash flow from operations for payments of required principal and interest. We may not be able to refinance these loans at an amount equal to the loan balance and the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness. If we are unable to make required payments on indebtedness that is secured by a mortgage, the Partnership will either invest additional money in the property or the property securing the mortgage may be foreclosed with a consequent loss of income and value to us. We may be adversely affected by the potential discontinuation of LIBOR. In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the FCA announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. As a result, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized the Alternative Reference Rates Committee which identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR as its preferred alternative to USD-LIBOR. We are not able to predict when LIBOR will cease to be published or precisely how SOFR will be calculated and published. Any changes adopted by the FCA or other governing bodies in the method used for determining LIBOR may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported LIBOR. If that were to occur, our interest payments could change. In addition, uncertainty about the extent and manner of future changes may result in interest rates and/or payments that are higher or lower than if LIBOR were to remain available in its current form. We have contracts that are indexed to LIBOR and are monitoring and evaluating the related risks, which include interest amounts on our variable rate debt, our unconsolidated joint ventures variable rate debt and the swap rate for our unconsolidated joint ventures interest rate swaps. In the event that LIBOR is discontinued, the interest rates will be based on an alternative variable rate specified in the applicable documentation governing such debt or swaps or as otherwise agreed upon. Such an event would not affect our ability to borrow or maintain already outstanding borrowings or swaps, but the alternative variable rate could be higher and more volatile than LIBOR prior to its discontinuance. Certain risks arise in connection with transitioning contracts to an alternative variable rate, including any resulting value transfer that may occur. The value of loans, securities, or derivative instruments tied to LIBOR could also be impacted if LIBOR is limited or discontinued. For some instruments, the method of transitioning to an alternative rate may be challenging, as they may require substantial negotiation with each respective counterparty. If a contract is not transitioned to an alternative variable rate and LIBOR is discontinued, the impact is likely to vary by contract. If LIBOR is discontinued or if the method of calculating LIBOR changes from its current form, interest rates on our current or future indebtedness may be adversely affected. While we expect LIBOR to be available in substantially its current form until June 30, 2023, it is possible that LIBOR will become unavailable prior to that point. This could result, for example, if sufficient banks decline to make submissions to the LIBOR administrator. In that case, the risks associated with the transition to an alternative variable rate will be accelerated and magnified. We are obligated to comply with financial covenants in our indebtedness that could restrict our range of operating activities. The mortgages on our properties contain customary negative covenants, including limitations on our ability, without prior consent of the lender and other items. Failure to comply with these covenants could cause a default under the agreements and, in certain circumstances; our lenders may be entitled to accelerate our debt obligations.

 Defaults under our debt agreements could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Real estate investments are generally illiquid, and we may not be able to sell our properties when it is economically or strategically advantageous to do so. Real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly, and our ability to sell properties may be affected by market conditions. We may not be able to diversify or vary our portfolio promptly in accordance with our strategies or in response to economic or other conditions. Our access to public debt markets is limited. Substantially all of our debt financings are secured by mortgages on our properties because of our limited access to public debt markets. Litigation may result in unfavorable outcomes. Like many real estate operators, we may be involved in lawsuits involving premises liability claims, housing discrimination claims and alleged violations of landlord-tenant laws, which may give rise to class action litigation or governmental investigations. Any material litigation not covered by insurance, such as a class action, could result in substantial costs being incurred. Our financial results may be adversely impacted if we are unable to sell properties and employ the proceeds in accordance with our strategic plan. Our ability to pay down debt, reduce our interest costs, repurchase Depositary Receipts and acquire properties is dependent upon our ability to sell the properties we have selected for disposition at the prices and within the deadlines we have established for each respective property. The costs of complying with laws and regulations could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions to our shareholders. Our properties must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (the ADA to the extent that they are public accommodations or commercial facilities as defined in the ADA. The ADA does not consider apartment complexes to be public accommodations or commercial facilities, except for portions of such properties that are open to the public. In addition, the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (the FHAA requires apartment complexes first occupied after March 13, 1990, to be accessible to the handicapped. Other laws also require apartment communities to be handicap accessible. Noncompliance with these laws could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. We may be subject to lawsuits alleging violations of handicap design laws in connection with certain of our developments. If compliance with these laws involves substantial expenditures or must be made on an accelerated basis, our ability to make distributions to our shareholders could be adversely affected. Under various federal, state and local laws, an owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in the property. This liability may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the substances. Other laws impose on owners and operators certain requirements regarding conditions and activities that may affect human health or the environment. Failure to comply with applicable requirements could complicate our ability to lease or sell an affected property and could subject us to monetary penalties, costs required to achieve compliance and potential liability to third parties. We are not aware of any material noncompliance, liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or other environmental matters in connection with any of our properties. Nonetheless, it is possible that material environmental contamination or conditions exist, or could arise in the future, in the apartment communities or on the land upon which they are located. We are subject to the risks associated with investments through joint ventures. Seven of our properties are owned by joint ventures in which we do not have a direct controlling interest. We may enter into joint ventures, including joint ventures that we do not control, in the future. Any joint venture investment involves risks such as the possibility that the co-venturer may seek relief under federal or state insolvency laws or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals. While the bankruptcy or insolvency of our co-venturer generally should not disrupt the operations of the joint venture, we could be forced to purchase the co-venturer s interest in the joint venture or the interest could be sold to a third party. We also may guarantee the indebtedness of our joint ventures. If we do not have control over a joint venture, the value of our investment may be affected adversely by a third party that may have different goals and capabilities than ours.

 We are subject to risks associated with development, acquisition and expansion of multifamily apartment complexes and commercial properties. Development projects and acquisitions and expansions of apartment complexes are subject to a number of risks, including: availability of acceptable financing; competition with other entities for investment opportunities; failure by our properties to achieve anticipated operating results; construction costs of a property exceeding original estimates; delays in construction; and expenditure of funds on, and the devotion of management time to, transactions that may not come to fruition. 
 We are subject to control by our directors and officers. The directors and executive officers of the General Partner and members of their families and related entities owned approximately 34 of our depositary receipts as of December 31, 2022. Additionally, management decisions rest with our General Partner without limited partner approval. Competition for skilled personnel could increase our labor costs. We and our management company compete with various other companies in attracting and retaining qualified and skilled personnel who are responsible for the day- to-day operations of our properties. Competitive pressures may require that we enhance our pay and benefits package to compete effectively for such personnel. We may not be able to offset such added costs by increasing the rates we charge our tenants. If there is an increase in these costs or if we fail to attract and retain qualified and skilled personnel, our business and operating results could be harmed. We depend on our key personnel. Our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contribution of key members of the management company, who may be difficult to replace. The loss of services of these executives could have a material adverse effect on us. There can be no assurance that the services of such personnel will continue to be available to us. We do not hold key-man life insurance on any of our key personnel. Changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our Depositary Receipts. As with other publicly traded equity securities, the value of our depositary receipts depends on various market conditions, which may change from time to time. Among the market conditions that may affect the value of our depositary receipts are the following: the extent of investor interest in us; the general reputation of real estate companies and the attractiveness of our equity securities in comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued by other real estate companies; our financial performance; and general stock and bond market conditions. 
 The market value of our depositary is based primarily upon the market s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions. Consequently, our depositary receipts may trade at prices that are higher or lower than our net asset value per depositary receipt. We face possible risks associated with the physical effects of climate change. We cannot predict with certainty whether climate change is occurring and, if so at what rate. However, the physical effects of climate change could have a material effect on our properties, operations, and business. To the extent climate change causes changes in 
 11 

Table of Contents 
 weather patterns, our markets could experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea levels. Over time, these conditions could result in declining demand for our buildings or the inability of us to operate the buildings at all. Climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of (or making unavailable) property insurance on terms we find acceptable, increasing the cost of energy and increasing the cost of snow removal at our properties. Proposed federal legislation to address climate change could increase utility and other costs of operating our properties which, if not offset by rising rental income, would reduce our net income. There can be no assurance that climate change will not have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations or business. Risk of changes in the tax law applicable to real estate partnerships. Since the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Treasury Department and Congress frequently review federal income legislation, we cannot predict whether, when or to what extent new federal tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will be adopted. Any such legislative action may prospectively or retroactively modify our tax treatment and therefore, may adversely affect taxation to us, and/or our partners. If the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns for tax years beginning after December 31, 2019, it may assess and collect any taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) resulting from such audit adjustment directly from us, in which case our cash available for distribution to our unitholders might be reduced. Pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, if the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns, it may assess and collect any taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) resulting from such audit adjustments directly from the Partnership. If, as a result of any such audit adjustment, we are required to make payments of taxes, penalties and interest, our cash available for distribution to our partners might be substantially reduced. These rules are not applicable to us for tax years beginning on or prior to December 31, 2017. Some of our costs, such as operating and general and administrative expenses, interest expense, and real estate acquisition and construction costs, are subject to inflation. A portion of our operating expenses is sensitive to inflation. These include expenses for property-related contracted services such as janitorial and engineering services, utilities, repairs and maintenance, and insurance. Property taxes are also impacted by inflationary changes as taxes are regularly reassessed based on changes in the fair value of our properties. Additionally, inflationary pricing may have a negative effect on real estate acquisitions and the construction costs necessary to complete our renovation, development and redevelopment projects, including, but not limited to, costs of construction materials, labor, and services from third-party contractors and suppliers. Our commercial leases have fixed rent increases which may not increase in line with inflation, thus causing our net operating income to decrease. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, as well as our ability to pay dividends, could be adversely affected over time. Revenue associated with residential properties may be limited in the future if current rent restriction proposals are adopted by the City of Boston. On February 13, 2023, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu submitted a home rule petition to the Boston City Council that would allow the City to limit how much landlords can increase rent on returning tenants each year to the lower of 10 or the Consumer Price Index for the Boston metropolitan area plus six percentage points. The petition, as currently stated, would apply to any properties with six or more units, and in order to be enacted, the petition needs to be approved by both local and state policymakers.The Boston City Council approved the submission of the petition to the state legislature on March 8, 2023. If such petition were to be passed by state legislatures, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, as well as our ability to pay dividends, could be adversely affected over time. Recent City of Boston regulations impose new energy performance standards and fines that may increase utilities and administrative costs in order to comply with disclosure and energy reduction requirements. The City of Boston has implemented a Building Emissions Reduction and Disclosure Ordinance that sets specific requirements for large buildings to reduce energy use with the goal of targeting zero emissions for large buildings by 2050. The ordinance restricts emissions standards to certain units that begin phasing in during 2025 with such limits decreasing over time according to specific thresholds based upon building use type. Non-compliance with either disclosure requirements or emission limits may result in the imposition of penalties for such time as non-compliance remains in effect. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, as well as our ability to pay dividends, could be adversely affected over time.

 Current free rent concessions would result in an average reduction in unit rents of approximately 9.84 per month per unit. Free rent expense amortized in 2022 was approximately 344,000 compared to approximately 1,119,000 in 2021. On November 30, 2021, New England Realty Associates Limited Partnership (the Partnership ), entered into a Master Credit Facility Agreement (the Facility Agreement with KeyBank National Association KeyBank dated as of November 30, 2021, with the initial advance in the amount of 156,000,000, at a fixed interest rate of 2.97 .

 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULT S OF OPERATIONS Forward Looking Statements Certain information contained herein includes forward looking statements, which are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Liquidation Reform Act of 1995 (the Act ). Forward looking statements in this report, or which management may make orally or in written form from time to time, reflect management s good faith belief when those statements are made, and are based on information currently available to management. Caution should be exercised in interpreting and relying on such forward looking statements, the realization of which may be impacted by known and unknown risks and uncertainties, events that may occur subsequent to the forward looking statements, and other factors which may be beyond the Partnership s control and which can materially affect the Partnership s actual results, performance or achievements for 2022 and beyond. Should one or more of the risks or uncertainties mentioned below materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to update our forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on past forward looking statements, which are based on results and trends at the time they are made, to anticipate future results or trends. Along with risks detailed in Item 1A and from time to time in the Partnership s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, some factors that could cause the Partnership s actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward looking statements include but are not limited to the following: The Partnership depends on the real estate markets where its properties are located, primarily in Eastern Massachusetts, and these markets may be adversely affected by local economic market conditions, which are beyond the Partnership s control. The Partnership is subject to the general economic risks affecting the real estate industry, such as dependence on tenants financial condition, the need to enter into new leases or renew leases on terms favorable to tenants in order to generate rental revenues and our ability to collect rents from our tenants. The Partnership is also impacted by changing economic conditions making alternative housing arrangements more or less attractive to the Partnership s tenants, such as the interest rates on single family home mortgages and the availability and purchase price of single family homes in the Greater Boston metropolitan area. The Partnership is subject to significant expenditures associated with each investment, such as debt service payments, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs, which are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in revenues from a property. The Partnership is subject to increases in heating and utility costs that may arise as a result of economic and market conditions and fluctuations in seasonal weather conditions. Civil disturbances, earthquakes and other natural disasters may result in uninsured or underinsured losses. Actual or threatened terrorist attacks may adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and the value of our properties. Financing or refinancing of Partnership properties may not be available to the extent necessary or desirable, or may not be available on favorable terms.

 The Partnership properties face competition from similar properties in the same market. This competition may affect the Partnership s ability to attract and retain tenants and may reduce the rents that can be charged. Given the nature of the real estate business, the Partnership is subject to potential environmental liabilities. These include environmental contamination in the soil at the Partnership s or neighboring real estate, whether caused by the Partnership, previous owners of the subject property or neighbors of the subject property, and the presence of hazardous materials in the Partnership s buildings, such as asbestos, lead, mold and radon gas. Management is not aware of any material environmental liabilities at this time. Insurance coverage for and relating to commercial properties is increasingly costly and difficult to obtain. In addition, insurance carriers have excluded certain specific items from standard insurance policies, which have resulted in increased risk exposure for the Partnership. These include insurance coverage for acts of terrorism and war, and coverage for mold and other environmental conditions. Coverage for these items is either unavailable or prohibitively expensive. Market interest rates could adversely affect market prices for Class A Partnership Units and Depositary Receipts as well as performance and cash flow. Changes in income tax laws and regulations may affect the income taxable to owners of the Partnership. These changes may affect the after-tax value of future distributions. The Partnership may fail to identify, acquire, construct or develop additional properties; may develop or acquire properties that do not produce a desired or expected yield on invested capital; may be unable to sell poorly- performing or otherwise undesirable properties quickly; or may fail to effectively integrate acquisitions of properties or portfolios of properties. Risk associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments. Competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties. Any weakness identified in the Partnership s internal controls as part of the evaluation being undertaken could have an adverse effect on the Partnership s business. Ongoing compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 may require additional personnel or systems changes. 
 The foregoing factors should not be construed as exhaustive or as an admission regarding the adequacy of disclosures made by the Partnership prior to the date hereof or the effectiveness of said Act. The Partnership expressly disclaims any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Over the past year, the Partnership took advantage of the low interest rate environment and refinanced fifteen properties, increased their loan balances, and raised approximately 130,000,000. With interest rates rising, and a threat of an economic slowdown, the Partnership increased the debt level and built cash reserves to acquire additional properties when opportunities become available. Currently, approximately 88,000,000 of these reserves are invested in short-term US Treasury bills maturing in 6 months or less with interest rates between 2.74 and 4.60 . Since the Partnership s long-term goals include the acquisition of additional properties, a portion of the proceeds from the refinancing and sale of properties is reserved for this purpose. If available acquisitions do not meet the Partnership s investment criteria, the Partnership may purchase additional depositary receipts. The Partnership will consider refinancing existing properties if the Partnership s cash reserves are insufficient to repay existing mortgages or if the Partnership needs additional funds for future acquisitions.

The Note is guaranteed by the Partnership pursuant to a Guaranty Agreement dated March 31, 2020. Brookside Apartments used the proceeds of the loan to pay off an outstanding loan of approximately 2,390,000, with the remaining portion of the proceeds added to cash reserves. In connection with this refinancing, there were closing costs of approximately 136,000. On July 31, 2014, the Partnership entered into an agreement for a 25,000,000 revolving line of credit. The term of the line is three years with a floating interest rate equal to a base rate of the greater of (a) the Prime Rate (b) the Federal Funds Rate plus one-half of one percent per annum, or (c) the LIBOR Rate for a period of one month plus 1 per annum, plus an applicable margin of 2.5 . The agreement originally expired on July 31, 2017, and was subsequently extended until October 31, 2020.The costs associated with the line of credit extension were approximately 128,000. On October 29, 2021, t he Partnership closed on the modification of its existing line of credit. The agreement extends the credit line for three years until October 29, 2024. The commitment amount is for 25 million but is restricted to 17 million during the modification period. The modification period covers the current period and phases out by December 31, 2022. During this period, the loan covenants are modified from a minimum consolidated debt service ratio of 1.60 to a ratio of 1.35 until September 30, 2022; from a minimum tangible net worth requirement of 200 million to a net worth of 175 million until September 30, 2022; from a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 65 to a ratio of 70 until September 30, 2022 and from a minimum debt yield of 9.5 to a yield of 8.5 until September 30, 2022 and a yield of 9.0 until December 31, 2022. Once the financial performance of the Partnership meets the original covenant tests for the trailing 12-month period, the commitment amount will return to 25 million. The portfolio s debt yield fell below the minimum of 9.0 to 8.3 . Consequently, as of December 31,2022, the Partnership did not comply with the debt yield financial covenant. As such, the Partnership is restricted from drawing down any amount from the

 line of credit until the Partnership meets the required financial covenants. The Stock Repurchase Program that was initiated in 2007 has purchased 1,488,460 Depositary Receipts through December 31, 2022, or approximately 34 of the outstanding Class A Depositary Receipts. The Partnership purchased 54,271 Depositary Receipts in 2022. In March of 2020, the Board of Advisors and Board of Directors unanimously approved an extension of the Repurchase Program until March 31, 2025. Management believes that the 25,000,000 line of credit, net cash flow from operations and cash on hand have put the Partnership in position to capitalize on investment opportunities should they reveal themselves in the near future. As always, Management continues to weigh investment alternatives of stock repurchase, new property acquisitions and dispositions when considering its cash balances and performance of the portfolio. Given the economic uncertainty caused by the coronavirus issue, as of April 15, 2020, the Partnership elected to temporarily suspend the repurchase program, With the improving economic outlook and the return of students to universities in the Greater Boston area in the fall of 2021, the repurchase program was reinstated in November of 2021. The Partnership has retained The Hamilton Company Hamilton to manage and administer the Partnership s and Joint Ventures Properties. Hamilton is a full-service real estate management company, which has legal, construction, maintenance, architectural, accounting and administrative departments. The Partnership s properties represent approximately 44 of the total properties and 50 of the residential properties managed by Hamilton. Substantially all of the other properties managed by Hamilton are owned, wholly or partially, directly or indirectly, by the Brown Family related entities. The Partnership s Second Amended and Restated Contract of Limited Partnership (the Partnership Agreement expressly provides that the general partner may employ a management company to manage the properties, and that such management company may be paid a fee of up to 4 of rental receipts for administrative and management services (the Management Fee ). The Partnership pays Hamilton the full annual Management Fee, in monthly installments. In addition to the Management Fee, the Partnership Agreement further provides for the employment of outside professionals to provide services to the Partnership and allows NewReal to charge the Partnership for the cost of employing professionals to assist with the administration of the Partnership s properties. Additionally, from time to time, the Partnership pays Hamilton for repairs and maintenance services, legal services, construction services and accounting services. The costs charged by Hamilton for these services are at the same hourly rate charged to all entities managed by Hamilton, and management believes such rates are competitive in the marketplace. In 2022, tenant renewals were approximately 69 with an average rental increase of approximately 6.3 , new leases accounted for approximately 31 with rental rate increases of approximately 15.4 . In 2022, leasing commissions were approximately 334,000 compared to approximately 835,000 in 2021, a decrease of approximately 501,000 (60.0 from 2021. Tenant concessions were approximately 50,000 in 2022 compared to approximately 50,000 in 2021.Tenant improvements were approximately 2,333,000 in 2022 compared to approximately 1,991,000 in 2021, an increase of approximately 342,000 (17.2 ). Hamilton accounted for approximately 2.3 of the repair and maintenance expense paid for by the Partnership in the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2.2 in the year ended December 31, 2021. Of the funds paid to Hamilton for this purpose, the great majority was to cover the cost of services provided by the Hamilton maintenance department, including plumbing, electrical, carpentry services, and snow removal for those properties close to Hamilton s headquarters. Several of the larger Partnership properties have their own maintenance staff. Those properties that do not have their own maintenance staff and are located more than a reasonable distance from Hamilton s headquarters in Allston, Massachusetts are generally serviced by local, independent companies. Hamilton s legal department handles most of the Partnership s eviction and collection matters. Additionally, it prepares most long-term commercial lease agreements and represents the Partnership in selected purchase and sale transactions. Overall, Hamilton provided approximately 70.7 and 67.4 of the legal services paid for by the Partnership during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Additionally, as described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, The Hamilton Company receives similar fees from the Investment Properties.

 The Partnership requires that three bids be obtained for construction contracts in excess of 15,000. Hamilton may be one of the three bidders on a particular project and may be awarded the contract if its bid and its ability to successfully complete the project are deemed appropriate. For contracts that are not awarded to Hamilton, Hamilton charges the Partnership a construction supervision fee equal to 5 of the contract amount. Hamilton s architectural department also provides services to the Partnership on an as-needed basis. In 2022, Hamilton provided the Partnership approximately 114,000 in construction and architectural services, compared to 581,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021.

In 2022, Hamilton charged the Partnership 125,000 per year 31,250 per quarter) for bookkeeping and accounting services. For more information on related party transactions, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of the consolidated financial statements, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, requires the Partnership to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The Partnership regularly and continually evaluates its estimates, including those related to acquiring, developing and assessing the carrying values of its real estate properties and its investments in and advances to joint ventures. The Partnership bases its estimates on historical experience, current market conditions, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. The Partnership s critical accounting policies are those which require assumptions to be made about such matters that are highly uncertain. Different estimates could have a material effect on the Partnership s financial results. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and estimates may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions and circumstances. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Principles of Consolidation. Revenue Recognition: Rental income from residential and commercial properties is recognized over the term of the related lease. For residential tenants, amounts 60 days in arrears are charged against income. The commercial tenants are evaluated on a case by case basis. Certain leases of the commercial properties provide for increasing stepped minimum rents, which are accounted for on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Concessions made on residential leases are also accounted for on the straight-line basis. Above-market and below-market lease values for acquired properties are initially recorded based on the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the differences between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (ii) management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed-rate renewal options for below-market leases . The capitalized above-market lease amounts are accounted for as a reduction of base rental revenue over the remaining term of the respective leases, and the capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to base rental revenue over the remaining initial terms plus the terms of any below-market fixed-rate renewal options of the respective leases. Under this standard, the Partnership evaluates the non-lease components (lease arrangements that include common area maintenance services) with related lease components (lease revenues). If both the timing and pattern of transfer are the same for the non-lease component and related lease component, the lease component is the predominant component. The Partnership elected an allowed practical expedient. For (i) operating lease arrangements involving real estate that include common area maintenance services and (ii) all real estate arrangements that include real estate taxes and insurance costs, we present these amounts within lease revenues in our consolidated statements of income. We record amounts reimbursed by the lessee in the period in which the applicable expenses are incurred. Rental Property Held f or sale: When assets are identified by management as held for sale, the Partnership discontinues depreciating the assets and estimates the sales price, net of selling costs, of such assets. The Partnership generally considers assets to be held for sale when the transaction has received appropriate corporate authority, and there 
 30 

Table of Contents 
 are no significant contingencies relating to the sale. If, in management s opinion, the estimated net sales price, net of selling costs, of the assets which have been identified as held for sale is less than the carrying value of the assets, a valuation allowance is established. If circumstances arise that previously were considered unlikely and, as a result, the Partnership decides not to sell a property previously classified as held for sale, the property is reclassified as held and used. A property that is reclassified is measured and recorded individually at the lower of (a) its carrying value before the property was classified as held for sale, adjusted for any depreciation (amortization) expense that would have been recognized had the property been continuously classified as held and used, or (b) the fair value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell. Rental Properties: Rental properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred; improvements and additions are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost of the asset and related accumulated depreciation is eliminated from the accounts, and any gain or loss on such disposition is included in income. Fully depreciated assets are removed from the accounts. Rental properties are depreciated by both straight-line and accelerated methods over their estimated useful lives. Upon acquisition of rental property, the Partnership estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and improvements, and identified intangible assets and liabilities assumed, generally consisting of the fair value of (i) above and below market leases, (ii) in-place leases and (iii) tenant relationships. The Partnership allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values. The Partnership records goodwill or a gain on bargain purchase (if any) if the net assets acquired/liabilities assumed exceed the purchase consideration of a transaction. In estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired, the Partnership considers information obtained about each property as a result of its due diligence and marketing and leasing activities, and utilizes various valuation methods, such as estimated cash flow projections utilizing appropriate discount and capitalization rates, estimates of replacement costs net of depreciation, and available market information. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. Investments in Treasury Bills: Investments in Treasury Bills are recorded at amortized cost and classified as held to maturity as the Partnership has the intent and the ability to hold them until they mature. The carrying value of the Treasury Bills are adjusted for accretion of discounts over the remaining life of the investment. Income related to the Treasury Bills is recognized in interest income in the Partnership s consolidated statement of income. Intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values above and below market leases and tenant relationship values, which are based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and the Partnership s overall relationship with the respective tenant. Factors to be considered by management in its analysis of in-place lease values include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, management considers leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses. Characteristics considered by management in valuing tenant relationships include the nature and extent of the Partnership s existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals. The value of in- place leases are amortized to expense over the remaining initial terms of the respective leases. The value of tenant relationship intangibles are amortized to expense over the anticipated life of the relationships. In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a rental property may be impaired, an analysis of the value is prepared. The estimated future undiscounted cash flows are compared to the asset s carrying value to determine if a write-down to fair value is required. Impairment: On an annual basis management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the Partnership s rental properties may be impaired. A property s value is impaired only if management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property. The Partnership s estimates of aggregate future cash flows expected to be generated by each property are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, among others, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates, 
 31 

Table of Contents 
 and costs to operate each property. As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter management s assumptions, the future cash flows estimated by management in its impairment analysis may not be achieved. Investments in Joint Ventures: The Partnership accounts for its 40 -50 ownership in the Investment Properties under the equity method of accounting, as it exercises significant influence over, but does not control these entities. These investments are recorded initially at cost, as Investments in Joint Ventures, and subsequently adjusted for the Partnership s share in earnings, cash contributions and distributions. Under the equity method of accounting, our net equity is reflected on the consolidated balance sheets, and our share of net income or loss from the Partnership is included on the consolidated statements of income. Generally, the Partnership would discontinue applying the equity method when the investment (and any advances) is reduced to zero and would not provide for additional losses unless the Partnership has guaranteed obligations of the venture or is otherwise committed to providing further financial support for the investee. If the venture subsequently generates income, the Partnership only recognizes its share of such income to the extent it exceeds its share of previously unrecognized losses. The authoritative guidance on consolidation provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights variable interest entities or VIEs and the determination of which business enterprise, if any, should consolidate the VIE (the primary beneficiary ). Generally, the consideration of whether an entity is a VIE applies when either (1) the equity investors (if any) lack one or more of the essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest, (2) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that equity s activities without additional subordinated financial support or (3) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportionate to their economic interests and the activities of the entity involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor with a disproportionately small voting interest. The primary beneficiary is defined by the entity having both of the following characteristics: (1) the power to direct the activities that, when taken together, most significantly impact the variable interest entity s performance; and (2) the obligation to absorb losses and rights to receive the returns from VIE that would be significant to the VIE. With respect to investments in and advances to the Investment Properties, the Partnership looks to the underlying properties to assess performance and the recoverability of carrying amounts for those investments in a manner similar to direct investments in real estate properties. An impairment charge is recorded if management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property. Legal Proceedings: The Partnership is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise, from time to time, in the ordinary course of business. These matters are frequently covered by insurance. If it is determined that a loss is likely to occur, the estimated amount of the loss is recorded in the financial statements. Both the amount of the loss and the point at which its occurrence is considered likely can be difficult to determine.

Factors which contributed to the increase were an increase in Repairs and Maintenance expense of approximately 1,201,000 (11.9 ), primarily due to an increase in apartment units turnover costs, an increase in Operating expenses of approximately 853,000 (13.2 ), primarily due to an increase in snow removal and utility expense, and an increase in Administrative expense of approximately 255,000 (10.3 ), partially due to an increase in professional fees, offset in part by a decrease in Depreciation and Amortization expense of approximately 298,000 (1.8 ), due to fully depreciated assets. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2022, was approximately 1,055,000 compared to approximately 0 for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of approximately 1,055,000. The increase is due to investments in Treasury Bills which mature over a period less than 180 days, with interest rates between 2.74 to 4.6 . Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 was approximately 15,045,000 compared to approximately 13,629,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of approximately 1,416,000 (10.4 ), The increase is due to the refinancing of properties, increasing the amount of debt, which increased the interest expense for the period.

As described in Note 5, Mortgage Notes Payable, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on November 30, 2021, New England Realty Associates Limited Partnership (the Partnership ), entered into a Master Credit Facility Agreement the Facility Agreement with KeyBank National Association KeyBank dated as of November 30, 2021, with the initial advance in the amount of 156,000,000. Interest only on the debt at a fixed interest rate of 2.97 is payable on a monthly basis through December 31, 2031. The Partnership used the proceeds to pay down approximately 65,305,000 of existing debt secured by 11 properties, along with approximately 2,700,000 in prepayment penalties, which is included in other expenses, resulting in a charge to other expense.

The Partnership Properties with the largest increases in rental income include Hamilton Green, Hamilton Oaks, and Clovelly Apartments, with increases of approximately 227,000, 169,000, and 100,000, respectively. These are offset by certain properties with the largest decreases in rental income which include 62 Boylston, 1144 Commonwealth, and Woodland Park with decreases of approximately 1,003,000, 329,000, and 146,000, respectively.

Factors which contributed to the increase were an increase in Repairs and Maintenance expense of approximately 1,288,000, (14.7 ), primarily due to a increase in appliance and pool repairs, an increase in Operating expenses of approximately 705,000 (12.2 ), primarily due to an increase in utility expense, and an increase in Renting expense of approximately 377,000 (43.6 ), partially due to an increase in leasing commission expense, offset in part by a decrease in Depreciation and Amortization expense of approximately 1,740,000 (9.4 ), due to fully depreciated assets. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was approximately 13,629,000 compared to approximately 13,705,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of approximately 76,000 (0.6 ), primarily due to a decrease in interest expense on the line of credit of approximately 143,000.

Line of Credit On July 31, 2014, the Partnership entered into an agreement for a 25,000,000 revolving line of credit. The term of the line was for three years with a floating interest rate equal to a base rate of the greater of (a) the Prime Rate (b) the Federal Funds Rate plus one-half of one percent per annum, or (c) the LIBOR Rate for a period of one month plus 1 per annum, plus the applicable margin of 2.5 . The agreement originally expired on July 31, 2017, and was extended until October 31, 2020. The costs associated with the line of credit extension were approximately 128,000. Prior to the line s expiration in 2020, the Partnership exercised its option for a one-year extension until October 31, 2021. The Partnership paid an extension fee of approximately 37,500 in association with the extension. On October 29, 2021, t he Partnership closed on the modification of its existing line of credit. The agreement extends the credit line for three years until October 29, 2024. The commitment amount is for 25 million but is restricted to 17 million during the modification period. The modification period covers the current period and phased out on December 31, 2022. During this period, the loan covenants were modified from a minimum consolidated debt service ratio of 1.60 to a ratio of 1.35 until September 30, 2022; from a minimum tangible net worth requirement of 200 million to a net worth of 175 million until September 30, 2022; from a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 65 to a ratio of 70 until September 30, 2022 and from a minimum debt yield of 9.5 to a yield of 8.5 until September 30, 2022 and a yield of 9.0 until December 31, 2022. Once the financial performance of the Partnership meets the original covenant tests for the trailing 12-month period, the commitment amount will return to 25 million. The portfolio s debt yield fell below the minimum of 9.0 to 8.3 . Consequently, as of December 31, 2022, the Partnership did not comply with the debt yield financial covenant. As such, the Partnership is restricted to draw down any amount from the line of credit. until the Partnership meets the required financial covenants. The interest rate for the new term is LIBOR plus 300 basis points. The costs associated with the modification and renewal of the line of credit is approximately 179,000 . On December 3, 2021, the Partnership paid off the outstanding balance of 17,000,000 on the Line of Credit. The line of credit may be used for acquisition, refinancing, improvements, working capital and other needs of the Partnership. The line may not be used to pay dividends, make distributions or acquire equity interests of the Partnership. The line of credit is collateralized by varying percentages of the Partnership s ownership interest in 23 of its subsidiary properties and joint ventures. Pledged interests range from 49 to 100 of the Partnership s ownership interest in the respective entities. The Partnership paid fees to secure the line of credit. Any unused balance of the line of credit, prior to the extension on October 29, 2021, was subject to a fee ranging from 15 to 20 basis points per annum. The Partnership, under the current modification, is no longer subject to this fee. The Partnership anticipates that cash from operations and interest bearing accounts will be sufficient to fund its current operations, pay distributions, make required debt payments and to finance current improvements to its properties. The Partnership may also sell or refinance properties. The Partnership s net income and cash flow may fluctuate dramatically from year to year as a result of the sale or refinancing of properties, increases or decreases in rental income or expenses, or the loss of significant tenants.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Joint Venture Indebtedness As of December 31, 2022, the Partnership had a 40 -50 ownership interest in seven Joint Ventures, which all have mortgage indebtedness except Hancock 1025, and Hamilton Essex Development. We do not have control of these partnerships and therefore we account for them using the equity method of consolidation. At December 31, 2022, our proportionate share of the non-recourse debt before unamortized deferred financing costs related to these investments was approximately 70,807,000. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2022, we are subject to contractual payment obligations as described in the table below. 

Payments due by period 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Total Contractual Obligations Long -term debt Mortgage debt 2,705,500 2,860,908 3,613,415 25,080,732 23,251,421 356,613,257 414,125,233 Total Contractual Obligations 2,705,500 2,860,908 3,613,415 25,080,732 23,251,421 356,613,257 414,125,233 We have various standing or renewable service contracts with vendors related to our property management. In addition, we have certain other contracts we enter into in the ordinary course of business that may extend beyond one year. These contracts are not included as part of our contractual obligations because they include terms that provide for cancellation with insignificant or no cancellation penalties. See Notes 5 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of mortgage notes payable. The Partnership has no other material contractual obligations to be disclosed. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RIS K Market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates and equity prices. In pursuing its business plan, the primary market risk to which the Partnership is exposed is interest rate risk. Changes in the general level of interest rates prevailing in the financial markets may affect the spread between the Partnership s yield on invested assets and cost of funds and, in turn, its ability to make distributions or payments to its investors. As of December 31, 2022, the Partnership, its Subsidiary Partnerships and the Investment Properties collectively have approximately 580,739,000 in long-term debt, substantially all of which require payment of interest at fixed rates. Accordingly, the fair value of these debt instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates. This long term debt matures through 2035. Including the line of credit, the Partnership, its Subsidiary Partnerships and the Investment Properties collectively have variable rate debt of 10,000,000 as of December 31, 2022 ranged from LIBOR plus 218 basis points to LIBOR plus 300 basis points. Assuming interest rate caps are not in effect, if market rates of interest on the Partnership s variable rate debt increased or decreased by 100 basis points, then the increase or decrease in interest costs on the Partnership s variable rate debt would be approximately 50,000 annually and the increase or decrease in fair value of the Partnership s fixed rate debt as of December 31, 2022 would be approximately 25,545,000. For information regarding the fair value and maturity dates of these debt obligations, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements Mortgage Notes Payable, Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements Fair Value Measurements and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures .

 ITEM 8. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DAT A The financial statements of the Partnership appear on pages F-4 through F-39 of this Form 10-K and are indexed herein under Item 15(a)(1). ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTIN G AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The effectiveness of the Partnership s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) have been evaluated as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on that evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Hamilton Company, Inc. (the Management Company ), Management has concluded that IT control and related procedures that support financial reporting were not effective during the period ending December 31, 2022 due to material weaknesses described below that prevented the recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by the Partnership in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act. On October 3, 2022, the Management Company was the target of a ransomware attack. The Partnership did not incur any monetary damage nor any loss of financial data due to the incident. After becoming aware of the incident, the Management Company conducted an internal investigation into their digital environment and discovered that all on premise computer systems were encrypted by an outside party. The Partnership, along with the Management Company, worked with independent third-party cybersecurity specialists to help with the restoration of the environment and to return operations securely. Off-site data backups, which were verified to have not been compromised by the ransomware attack, were utilized to restore the data that had been encrypted. The Partnership, along with the Management Company, has successfully recovered the impacted files and rebuilt its computer systems. However, Management determined that the inordinate amount of time to recover this data and rebuild the financial reporting system prevented the Partnership from filing the Quarterly Report as of September 30, 2022 on a timely basis. Management identified control deficiencies in our Information Technology general controls that prevented a timely filing of the Quarterly Report as of September 30, 2022 and developed a remediation plan for each weakness. The Partnership has been committed to remediating such control deficiencies in our Information Technology general controls in a timely manner. With the assistance of cybersecurity specialists, the Partnership and the Management Company added additional security features designed to protect its systems and data from future attacks including multifactor authentication for domain sign-on, restricted server access, enhanced security awareness training, and updated multi-location secure backup with regular recovery testing. Specifically, the Partnership and the Management Company worked with a third-party service provider to implement least privileged access and restricted Super User/Administrative access across the production environment and to implement a modern antivirus solution. In addition to these steps already taken, remediation will also include the documentation and testing of the additional IT procedures implemented. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the internal control system are met.

 Changes in Internal Control Except for the above noted material weaknesses and the remediation activities that have since been completed, there were no other changes in the Management Company s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rule 13a-15 that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Management Company s internal control over financial reporting. The material weaknesses did not result in any identified misstatements to the financial statements, and there were no changes to previously released financial results. The Partnership s independent registered public accounting firm, Miller Wachman LLP, has issued an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting for the period ending December 31, 2022, which appears in Item 9A of this Form 10-K. REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Partners New England Realty Associates Limited Partnership Adverse Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited New England Realty Associates Limited Partnership s (the Partnership s) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described in the following paragraph on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Partnership has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Partnership s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weakness has been identified and included in management s assessment. 
 Management had identified material weaknesses in Information Technology general controls related to a ransomware attack of the Management Company which occurred on October 3, 2022, whereby on-premise computer systems were encrypted by an outside party. Management had identified material deficiencies in its Information Technology general controls that prevented a timely recovery from the ransomware attack resulting in a late filing of its Quarterly Report as of September 30, 2022. 
 These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2022 financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated March 13, 2023, on those financial statements. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, partners capital, and cash flows of the Partnership, and our report dated March 13, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion. Basis for Opinion The Partnership s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Partnership in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

Table of Contents 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Miller Wachman LLP Boston, MA March 13, 2023 ITEM 9B.

 and Exchange Commission reports of ownership changes and changes in ownership of the Partnership.

REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE The Audit Committee of NewReal Inc., which is the General Partner of New England Realty Associates Limited Partnership, is currently comprised of David Aloise, and Martina Alibrandi, each of whom is an independent director of NewReal. The Audit Committee operates under a written charter. In March 2022 that charter was amended to clarify that the Audit Committee may consist of two members if a two member committee is permitted under applicable securities laws and the listing standards of the exchange on which the Partnership s securities are listed. The listing rules of the NYSE MKT Exchange permit smaller reporting companies such as the Partnership to maintain an audit committee with two members. The Partnership s management, which consists of NERA s General Partner, is responsible for the preparation of the Partnership s financial statements and for maintaining an adequate system of internal controls and processes for that purpose. Miller Wachman LLP Miller Wachman acts as the Partnership s independent auditor and is responsible for conducting an independent audit of the Partnership s annual financial statements and the effectiveness of the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), and issuing a report on the results of their audit. The Audit Committee is responsible for providing independent, objective oversight of both of these processes. The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 with management of the Partnership and with representatives of Miller Wachman, including the potential impact, if any, of the material weaknesses in Information Technology general controls described by Miller Wachman in its Report of Independent Registered Accounting Firm included in Section 9A of this Annual Report. As a result of these discussions, the Audit Committee believes that NERA maintains an effective system of accounting controls that allow it to prepare financial statements that fairly present the Partnership s financial position and results of its operations. Discussions with Miller Wachman also included the matters required by Statement on Auditing Standard No. 16 (Communications with Audit Committee). In addition, the Audit Committee reviewed the independence of Miller Wachman. We received written disclosures and a letter from Miller Wachman regarding its independence as required by Independent Standards Board Standards No. 1 and discussed this information with Miller Wachman. Based on the foregoing, the Audit Committee has recommended that the audited financial statements of the Partnership for the year ended December 31, 2022 be included in the Partnership s annual report on form 10-K to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Partners New England Realty Associates Limited Partnership We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of New England Realty Associates Limited Partnership (the Partnership) as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, partners capital, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Partnership as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated March 13, 2023, expressed an adverse opinion. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Partnership s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Partnership s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Impairment of Investment Properties As described in footnote 1, the Partnership reviews the carrying value of investment properties on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible impairment. Events or circumstances that may prompt a review of the carrying value of investment properties may include a significant decrease in the anticipated market price of the investment property, an adverse change to the extent or manner in which an asset may be used, or a significant change in its physical condition or damage due to catastrophic event. The Partnership reviews its investment properties for potential impairment through an analysis of net operating income. In the event that any impairment indicators are present, the Partnership undertakes additional analyses utilizing expected undiscounted future cash flows, expected disposition proceeds for a given asset and anticipated rates of return for its recent acquisitions. Forecasting of cash flows requires management to make estimates and assumptions about such variables as the anticipated holding period, rental revenues and operating expenses during the holding period, capital expenditures and

 rates of return. In 2022, the Partnership s net operating income analysis resulted in two properties requiring additional analysis. No impairments were identified in 2022 as a result of the Partnership s analysis. The principal consideration for our determination that the impairment of investment properties is a critical audit matter is that it involves a high degree of subjectivity in evaluating management s estimates used in determining the undiscounted cash flow estimates. We performed the following procedures, among others, in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We tested management s internal controls over the identification of potential investment property impairments, such as controls over the Partnership s annually analysis of net operating income, as well management review controls to identify potential events which could indicate impairment. We examined and evaluated the Partnership s net operating income trend analysis and its assessment of other events, and if additional analysis was necessary, we evaluated the significant assumptions and methods used in developing the undiscounted cash flow estimates. When the net operating income analysis indicated that additional analysis was required, we assessed whether the significant assumptions, including estimated holding period, rental revenues and operating expenses during the holding period, capital expenditures and rates of return used in determining the future undiscounted cash flows were reasonable. Evaluation of the identification of related parties and related party transactions As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, The General Partner engages The Hamilton Company, Inc. to manage the properties of the Partnership and its Joint Ventures. The Hamilton Company, Inc. is wholly owned by Brown family related entities. In addition, The Partnership shares ownership of seven of its Joint Ventures with the Brown family related entities. Each of these entities is a related party. The Partnership has entered a number of transactions with the Hamilton Company, Inc. including property management services and other professional services such as legal, accounting and construction. These fees are permitted by the Partnership Agreement. We identified the evaluation of the identification of related parties and related party transactions as a critical audit matter. Auditor judgment was involved in assessing the sufficiency of the procedures performed to identify related parties and related party transactions of the Partnership. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Partnership s related party process, including controls over the identification of the Partnership s related party relationships and transactions. We read agreements and contracts between the Partnership and related parties; queried the accounts payable system for transactions with related parties; evaluated the Partnership s reconciliation of its applicable accounts to the related parties records of transactions and balances; read the Partnership s minutes from meetings of the Board of Directors and related committees; inquired with executive officers, key members of management, and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors regarding related party transactions; and read public filings, external news and research sources for information related to transactions between the Partnership and related parties. /s/ 

We have served as the Partnership s auditor since 1993. March 13, 2023

These properties total apartment units, condominium units and square feet of commercial space. Additionally, the Partnership also owns a - interest in residential and mixed use properties consisting of apartment units, square feet of commercial space and a car parking lot. The properties are located in Eastern Massachusetts and Southern New Hampshire. to ownership interest in each subsidiary except for the limited liability companies (the Investment Properties or Joint Ventures in which the Partnership has a - ownership interest. The consolidated group is referred to as the Partnership . Minority interests are not recorded, since they are insignificant. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The Partnership accounts for its investment in the above-mentioned Investment Properties using the equity method of consolidation. (See Note 15: Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures). The Partnership accounts for its investments in joint ventures using the equity method of accounting. These investments are recorded initially at cost, as Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions. Generally, the Partnership would discontinue applying the equity method when the investment (and any advances) is reduced to and would not provide for additional losses unless the Partnership has guaranteed obligations of the venture or is otherwise committed to providing further financial support for the investee. If the investment subsequently generates income, the Partnership only recognizes its share of such income to the extent it exceeds its share of previously unrecognized losses. In 2013 and beyond, the carrying values of certain investments fell below zero. We intend to fund our share of the investments future operating deficits should the need arise. However, we have legal obligation to pay for any of the liabilities of such investments nor do we have any legal obligation to fund operating deficits. (See Note 14: Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures.) The authoritative guidance on consolidation provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights variable interest entities or VIEs and the determination of which business enterprise, if any, should consolidate the VIE (the primary beneficiary ). Generally, the consideration of whether an entity is a VIE applies when either (1) the equity investors (if any) lack one or more of the essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest, (2) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that equity s activities without additional subordinated financial support or (3) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportionate to their economic interests and the activities of the entity involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor with a disproportionately small voting interest. The primary beneficiary is defined by the entity having both of the following characteristics: (1) the power to direct the activities that, when taken together, most significantly impact the

Certain leases of the commercial properties provide for increasing stepped minimum rents, which are accounted for on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Contingent rent for commercial properties are received from tenants for certain costs as provided in the lease agreement. The costs generally include real estate taxes, utilities, insurance, common area maintenance and recoverable costs. Rental concessions are also accounted for on the straight-line basis. Above-market and below-market lease values for acquired properties are initially recorded based on the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the differences between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (ii) management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed-rate renewal options for below-market leases. The capitalized above-market lease values for acquired properties are amortized as a reduction of base rental revenue over the remaining term of the respective leases, and the capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to base rental revenue over the remaining initial terms plus the terms of any below-market fixed-rate renewal options of the respective leases.

Derivative Instruments: The Partnership measures derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, at fair value and records them as an asset or liability, depending upon the Partnership s rights or obligations under the applicable derivative contract. For derivatives designated and qualifying as fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item are recorded in earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the derivative are reported in other comprehensive income OCI and are subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedging and ineffective portions of hedges are recognized in earnings in the affected period. provision for income taxes have been recorded (See Note 13).

 HAMILTON PARK TOWERS LLC (Unconsolidated Significant Joint Venture) NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2022 (unaudited), 2021 (audited), and 2020 (unaudited) NOTE 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Line of Business: Hamilton Park Towers LLC, (the Joint Venture or the Property or the Partnership ), was organized in Massachusetts in 2009. The Joint Venture owns and operates 409 residential apartment units located in Brookline, Massachusetts. The Joint Venture is owned 40 by New England Realty Associates Limited Partnership NERA as of and for the year ended December 31,2021, and was a significant unconsolidated subsidiary under Rule 3-09 of Regulation S-X requiring separated financial statements. The Joint Venture is no longer considered a significant subsidiary in 2022. Basis of Preparation: The preparation of the financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. The Partnership regularly and continually evaluates its estimates, including those related to acquiring, developing and assessing the carrying values of its real estate properties and its investments in and advances to joint ventures. The Partnership bases its estimates on historical experience, current market conditions, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. The Partnership s critical accounting policies are those which require assumptions to be made about such matters that are highly uncertain. Different estimates could have a material effect on the Partnership s financial results. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and estimates may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions and circumstances. Revenue Recognition: Rental income from residential and commercial properties is recognized over the term of the related lease. For residential tenants, amounts 60 days in arrears are charged against income. The commercial tenants are evaluated on a case by case basis. Certain leases of the commercial properties provide for increasing stepped minimum rents, which are accounted for on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Concessions made on residential leases are also accounted for on the straight-line basis. Above-market and below-market lease values for acquired properties are initially recorded based on the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the differences between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (ii) management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed-rate renewal options for below-market leases . The capitalized above-market lease amounts are accounted for as a reduction of base rental revenue over the remaining term of the respective leases, and the capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to base rental revenue over the remaining initial terms plus the terms of any below-market fixed-rate renewal options of the respective leases. Under this standard, the Partnership evaluates the non-lease components (lease arrangements that include common area maintenance services) with related lease components (lease revenues). If both the timing and pattern of transfer are the same for the non-lease component and related lease component, the lease component is the predominant component. The Partnership elected an allowed practical expedient. For (i) operating lease arrangements involving real estate that include common area maintenance services and (ii) all real estate arrangements that include real estate taxes and insurance costs, we present these amounts within lease revenues in our consolidated statements of income. We record amounts reimbursed by the lessee in the period in which the applicable expenses are incurred. Rental Properties: Rental properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred; improvements and additions, which improve or extend the life of assets, are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost of the asset and related accumulated depreciation is eliminated from the accounts, and any gain or loss on such disposition is included in income. Fully depreciated assets are removed from the accounts. Rental properties are depreciated by both straight-line and accelerated methods over their estimated useful lives. Significant acquisitions with long term leases are evaluated to determine if a portion of the purchase price is allocable to intangibles such as non-market rate rents. 
 5 

 Upon acquisition of rental property, the Joint Venture estimated the fair value of acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and improvements, and identified intangible assets and liabilities assumed, generally consisting of the fair value of (i) above and below market leases, (ii) in-place leases and (iii) tenant relationships. The Joint Venture allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values. The Joint Venture records goodwill or a gain on bargain purchase (if any) if the net assets acquired/liabilities assumed exceed the purchase consideration of a transaction. In estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired, the Joint Venture considers information obtained about each property as a result of its due diligence and marketing and leasing activities, and utilizes various valuation methods, such as estimates cash flow projections utilizing appropriate discount and capitalization rates, estimates of replacement costs net of depreciation, and available market information. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values and tenant relationship values, which are based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and the Joint Venture s overall relationship with the respective tenant. Factors to be considered by management in its analysis of in-place lease values include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, management includes real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, management considers leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses. Characteristics considered by management in valuing tenant relationships include the nature and extent of the Joint Venture s existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals. The value of in-place leases are amortized to expense over the remaining initial terms of the respective leases. The value of tenant relationship intangibles are amortized to expense over the anticipated life of the relationships. In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a rental property may be impaired, an analysis of the value is prepared. The estimated future undiscounted cash flows are compared to the asset s carrying value to determine if a write-down to fair value is required. Leasing Fees: Leasing fees are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the related lease. Unamortized balances are expensed when the corresponding fee is no longer applicable. Deferred Financing Costs: Costs incurred in obtaining financing are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related indebtedness. Deferred financing costs are presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the debt liability to which they relate. In all cases, amortization of such costs is included in interest expense and was approximately 65,000 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. Income Taxes: The financial statements have been prepared on the basis that the joint venture is entitled to tax treatment as a partnership. Accordingly, no provision for income taxes has been recorded. (See note 10) Cash Equivalents: The Joint Venture considers cash equivalents to be all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less. Comprehensive Income: Comprehensive income is defined as changes in members equity, exclusive of transactions with owners (such as capital contributions and dividends). The Joint Venture did not have any comprehensive income items in 2022, 2021, or 2020 other than net income as reported. Concentration of Credit Risks and Financial Instruments: The Joint Venture property is located in Brookline, Massachusetts, and is subject to the general economic risks related thereto. No single tenant accounted for more than 5 of the revenues in 2022, 2021 or 2020. The Joint Venture makes its temporary cash investments with high-credit-quality financial institutions. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively approximately 3,616,000 and 3,235,000 of cash and cash equivalents, and security deposits included in prepaid expenses and other assets exceeded federally insured amounts. Advertising Expense: Advertising is expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was approximately 23,000 in 2022, 39,000 in 2021 and 59,000 in 2020. Interest Capitalized: The Joint Venture follows the policy of capitalizing interest as a component of the cost of rental property when the time of construction exceeds one year. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 there was no capitalized interest. Reclassifications: Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts in order to conform to current period presentation.

Rents receivable are approximately net of allowances for doubtful accounts of 21,000 and 29,000 at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. NOTE 9. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Fair Value Measurements on a Recurring Basis At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we do not have any significant financial assets or financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis in our financial statements. 
 8 

 Financial Assets and Liabilities not Measured at Fair Value At December 31, 2022 and 2021 the carrying amounts of certain of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and note payable, accounts payable and accrued expenses were representative of their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments or, the recent acquisition of these items. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we estimated the fair value of our mortgage payable based upon quoted market prices for the same (Level 1) or similar (Level 2) issues when current quoted market prices are available. We estimated the fair value of our secured mortgage debt that does not have current quoted market prices available by discounting the future cash flows using rates currently available to us for debt with similar terms and maturities (Level 3). The differences in the fair value of our debt from the carrying value are the result of differences in interest rates and/or borrowing spreads that were available to us at December 31, 2022 and 2021, as compared with those in effect when the debt was issued or acquired. The secured mortgage debt contain pre-payment penalties or yield maintenance provisions that could make the cost of refinancing the debt at lower rates exceed the benefit that would be derived from doing so. The following table reflects the carrying amounts and estimated fair value of our debt. 

Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value Mortgage Note Payable At December 31, 2022 124,649,959 114,298,474 At December 31, 2021 124,520,713 135,497,173 
 
 Net of unamortized deferred financing costs Disclosure about fair value of financial instruments is based on pertinent information available to management as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Although management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the fair value amounts, such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of these financial statements since December 31, 2022 and current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein. NOTE 10. TAXABLE INCOME AND TAX BASIS The Joint Venture is not subject to income taxes as it files a partnership tax return whereby its income or loss is reportable by the members. Taxable income or loss is different than financial statement income because of intangible assets, accelerated depreciation, different tax lives, and timing differences related to prepaid rents and allowances. The Partnership share of the taxable income is approximately 178,000 more than statement income for the year ended December 31, 2022. The cumulative tax basis of the Joint Venture real estate allocated to the Partnership at December 31, 2022 is approximately 1,700,000 more than the statement basis primarily due to the purchase price allocation to intangible assets at Hamilton Park Towers and accelerated depreciation. The Joint Venture adopted the amended provisions related to uncertain tax provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes. As a result of the implementation of the guidance, the Joint Venture recognized no material adjustments regarding its tax accounting treatment. The Joint Venture expects to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions, if any, as income tax expense, which would be included in general and administrative expense. In the normal course of business the Joint Venture is subject to examination by federal, state and local jurisdictions in which it operates, where applicable. As of December 31, 2022, the tax years that remain subject to examination by the major tax jurisdictions under the statute of limitations is from the year 2020 forward. NOTE 11. IMPACT OF RECENTLY-ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS There have been no new accounting pronouncements applicable to the Partnership that would have a material impact on the Partnership s consolidated financial statements.
