PART I 

Item 1. Business. 

Overview 

KludeIn I Acquisition Corp.
is a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on September 24, 2020 for the purpose of effecting an initial business combination.
While we may pursue a business combination in any sector or geography, we are focusing our efforts on completing a business combination
with a high-quality software or technology-enabled growth business serving consumers or enterprises in the United States with an enterprise
value between 500 million and 1.5 billion. 

Our management team has extensive
experience in both the private and public equity markets, and believes our team s skill and experience makes us well positioned
to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns by identifying and executing a business combination with one or more attractive targets. 

We leverage our extensive
network in the venture capital and private equity industries as well as our network among the Indian diaspora, the latter of which we
believe has permeated the global technology landscape in the form of entrepreneurs, chief executives and specialist talent pools. We believe
our deep connections, and relationships with these networks provides us with access to a differentiated pool of potential target businesses
and management teams, and will facilitate a successful business combination transaction. 

Initial Public Offering 

On January 11, 2021, we consummated
our initial public offering of 17,250,000 units, including 2,250,000 units sold upon the exercise of the underwriters over-allotment
option in full. Each unit consists of one share of Class A common stock, and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company, with each
whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock for 11.50 per whole share. The units were sold
at a price of 10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of 172,500,000. 

Simultaneously with the closing
of the initial public offering, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 5,200,000 warrants to our sponsor at a purchase price
of 1.00 per private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds of 5,200,000. 

A total of 172,500,000, comprised
of 169,050,000 of the proceeds from the initial public offering and 3,450,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the private placement warrants
was placed in the trust account maintained by Continental, acting as trustee. 

The past performance of our
management team, or their respective affiliates, is not a guarantee either (i) of success with respect to any business combination
we may consummate or (ii) that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination, including the
Near Business Combination. No member of our management team has been an officer or director of a SPAC in the past. You should not rely
on the historical record of our management team s or their respective affiliates performance as indicative of our future
performance. 

Members of our management
team may become an officer or director of another SPAC with a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act even before we have
entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business combination.

Stock Purchase Agreement. Near is obligated under the Common Stock Purchase Agreement and the CF Registration Rights Agreement to file

The Company will not have the
right to commence any sales of common stock to CF under the Common Stock Purchase Agreement until the Commencement (as defined in the

stock to CF set forth in the Common Stock Purchase Agreement have been satisfied, including that a registration statement relating to
the common stock is filed and declared effective by the SEC. 

After the Commencement, Near
will have the right from time to time at its sole discretion until the first day of the month next following the 36-month period from
and after the Commencement, to direct CF to purchase up to a specified maximum amount of shares of Common Stock as set forth in the Common
Stock Purchase Agreement by delivering written notice to CF prior to the commencement of trading on any trading day. Near will control
the timing and amount of any sales of the Common Stock to CF. Actual sales of shares of the Common Stock to CF under the Common Stock
Purchase Agreement will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by Near from time to time, including, among other things, market
conditions, and the trading price of the Common Stock. 

The purchase price of the shares of Common Stock that Near elects to
sell to CF pursuant to the Common Stock Purchase Agreement will be the volume weighted average price of the Common Stock during the applicable
purchase date on which Near has timely delivered written notice to CF directing it to purchase the shares of Common Stock under the Common

prior written notice. Additionally, CF will have the right to terminate the Common Stock Purchase Agreement upon three days prior
written notice to the Company if there is a Material Adverse Effect or a Fundamental Transaction (as defined in the Common Stock Purchase

on the Nasdaq is suspended. No termination of the Common Stock Purchase Agreement will affect the registration rights provisions contained
in the CF Registration Rights Agreement.

of the Common Stock Purchase Agreement, Near will issue to CF shares of Common Stock in an amount equal to 2,000,000 at a per share price

the shares of Common Stock upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Common Stock Purchase Agreement. 

Other than as specifically
discussed, this Report does not assume the closing of the Near Business Combination. 

Combination Period and Extensions 

Shortly following entering into the Near Merger Agreement, we and Near
discussed the timing of consummating the Closing and determined that additional time likely would be needed to complete regulatory review
for the proposed Near Business Combination. Accordingly, on May 24, 2022, we and Near agreed that the Company should seek approval from
its stockholders for an extension of up to six months to close the Near Business Combination extending the period for completing the Near
Business Combination from July 11, 2022 to January 11, 2023, the First Extension. In connection with seeking stockholder approval of this
First Extension, it was also determined that, in order to incentivize the Company s public stockholders to support the extension,
approximately 0.03 per public share per month should be deposited into the trust account for each public share that was not redeemed
in connection with the stockholder meeting to approve the First Extension. The Company initially requested that Near provide extension
funding for several reasons, primarily to minimize stockholder concerns about the ability to consummate an extension, because the funding
was pre-committed, and more importantly to demonstrate that Near was committed to the business combination. Additionally, Near, which
had already invested a significant amount of time and resources into preparing for a public listing via the proposed Near Business Combination,
believed that the opportunity cost of terminating the proposed business combination was higher than the incremental financing to support
the extension. As such, Near was willing to loan to the Company the cash needed solely to fund 0.03 per public share per month through
January 11, 2023 not redeemed, to deposit into the trust account, and to be repaid upon the consummation of the Company s initial
business combination. 

While
Near was willing to fund the 0.03 per public share per month in connection with the First Extension, Near s debt instruments included
covenants that prohibited the release of such funds in the form of a loan to the Company to be deposited into the trust account. Upon
discussion and an understanding of the situation, the sponsor agreed to fund the extension funds. 

9 

On
July 7, 2022, the Company s stockholders approved the First Extension, extending the date by which the Company must consummate
its initial business combination from July 11, 2022 to January 11, 2023 (or such earlier date, subject to certain conditions
of the Near Merger Agreement, as determined by the board of directors). Because the Near Business Combination still had not closed by
late November, the parties agreed to seek a further extension, and on January 6, 2023, the Company sought stockholder approval of,
and the Company s stockholders approved, the Second Extension, extending the date by which the Company must consummate its initial
business combination from January 11, 2023 to April 11, 2023 (or such earlier date as determined by the board of directors).
If the Company s initial business combination, such as the Near Business Combination, is not consummated by April 11, 2023,
then the Company s existence will terminate, and the Company will distribute the amounts in the trust account as provided in the
Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation. In connection with the First Extension, the Company s stockholders
holding 6,845,606 public shares exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account.
As a result, 68,488,348 (approximately 10.00 per share) was removed from the trust account to pay such holders. In connection with the
First Extension, on July 7, 2022, the Company issued a promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of up to 2,060,070 (the
 First Extension Funds to the sponsor, pursuant to which the sponsor agreed to provide the Company with equal installments
of 343,345, to be deposited into the trust account for each month in which the date by which the Company must consummate its initial
business combination is extended, from July 11, 2022 until January 11, 2023, up to an amount in the aggregate equal to the First
Extension Funds. 

On
November 23, 2022, following certain accommodations under Near s debt instruments, Near was able to, and agreed to, fund the
extension funds starting November 2022. Near committed to loan certain of the Extension Funds to the Company, and the Company issued a
promissory note, dated as of November 18, 2022, in the aggregate principal amount of up to 686,690, to Near (the Near Extension
Note ). The Near Extension Note relates to the final two payments of the First Extension Funds of 343,345 each. As of January 17,
2023, an aggregate of 2,060,070 has been drawn down on the First Extension Funds and the Near Extension Note and deposited into the trust
account to cover the six months paid in connection with the First Extension. 

In
connection with the Second Extension, stockholders holding 9,786,530 public shares exercised their right to redeem their shares for a
pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account. As a result, approximately 101 million (approximately 10.32 per public share)
was removed from the trust account to pay such holders and approximately 6.376 million remained in the trust account. Following
redemptions, the Company has 617,864 public shares outstanding. 

Our Opportunity 

We are pursuing a business
combination, such as the Near Business Combination, with a high-quality software or technology-enabled growth business serving
consumers or enterprises in the United States with an enterprise value between 500 million and 1.5 billion. We are searching
for a target company that will generate value to its customers and rely on differentiated software for customer acquisition, efficiency
gains, process improvement or customer retention and service. While the private capital markets for technology companies have seen a significant
influx of capital in recent years, causing companies to remain private longer, we believe there are advantages to being a public company,
including increased access to capital, strong brand awareness and increased liquidity for shareholders. 

We believe that our intended
target companies will benefit from becoming publicly-held companies following a business combination with our company. We are targeting
growth-oriented companies, such as Near, with a strong and experienced management team that we believe can realize the longer term
benefits of being a public company. 

Our Value Proposition 

Our team collectively has
made over 100 investments in both public and private markets in the consumer consumer technology, IT services enterprise software,
financial services financial technology, healthcare technology and electrical vehicle sectors, which has led to deep domain expertise
and industry relationships. We believe our experience in both the private and public markets are a value-add to identifying prospective
target companies, primarily high-quality software or technology-enabled growth businesses serving consumers or enterprises in
the United States with an enterprise value between 500 million and 1.5 billion.

Our approach to identifying
and evaluating potential target companies combines our team s extensive investing experience with our application of data science
and our ability to access management teams through the Indian diaspora network. 

We believe our network within
the Indian diaspora provides access to a differentiated set of target companies. According to research from the Kauffman Foundation, 33 
of all immigrant-founded companies in the United States have Indian founders, a significantly higher percentage than any other ethnicity.
From 2012 through 2017, 14 of the 261 private companies with valuations in excess of 1 billion (so-called unicorns had Indian co-founders, and 17 companies with Indian co-founders conducted initial public offerings and commanded a market cap in
excess of 26 billion. In addition to the network advantage, we believe our connections to the Indian diaspora provides access to
a great talent pool. 

Our Competitive Advantage 

Extensive Investment Experience: Our team members have 75 years of combined investment experience in both private and public markets and have made 100 investments through a variety of investment climates and technology trends. We believe this experience provides us a valuable perspective on potential target businesses. 

Operational Experience: Our team is comprised of former entrepreneurs who have founded companies, sold companies and taken companies public. Our team members sit on the boards of directors of a number of high-profile private and public companies in both India and the United States. 

Strong Network of CXOs and Advisory Board: We have an extensive network of experienced Chief Experience Officer operators that we believe will add significant value to companies through technological, operational and strategic advice. We believe this network makes us an attractive suitor to potential business combination targets. 

Complete Spectrum: Our management team has extensive experience investing across the various phases of a company s lifecycle. Our team members have collectively sourced, structured and invested in transactions ranging from venture-stage to late-stage growth companies. We understand how companies across the growth spectrum can efficiently use capital to create value. 

Experience in Taking a Company Public: Our team includes managers who have not only invested in public companies but taken companies public. We understand how to guide a company through the transition from private to public. 

Data Science: Our data science approach involves deep and fundamental analysis of key operating metrics, initial public offering performance and sub-sector movements, which we believe provides reliable predictions of target company performance in public markets. 

M A Experience: Our team has decades of combined experience executing mergers and acquisition transactions on both the buy and sell side as entrepreneurs, bankers and investors. 

Due Diligence: We apply a thorough and focused method for conducting due diligence on both private and public companies. We understand what generates value in public markets and what to look for in terms of company fundamentals and company culture.

Business Strategy and Acquisition Criteria 

We believe our team s
skill and experience makes us well positioned to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns by identifying and executing a business
combination with one or more attractive targets. 

Our business strategy is to
leverage our management team s extensive industry knowledge, strategic vision and operational capabilities to deliver attractive
risk-adjusted returns by identifying and executing a business combination with one or more attractive targets. We focus on targets
with the following attributes: 

Size: We target entities whose enterprise value is between 500 million and 1.5 billion. 

Geographic Location: We are focusing our search on companies primarily operating in the United States. 

Industry: We are focusing our search on high-quality software or technology-enabled growth businesses serving Consumers or Enterprises in the United States. 

Management Team: We seek companies that are backed by strong management teams. We want to have a supporting and catalyzing role to existing management and encourage the pursuit of value creation strategies. 

Operational Maturity: We are pursuing prospective target companies that have sufficient financial and operational data enabling investment decisions to be made with a high degree of confidence. We seek target companies with a proven ability to scale and execute on a quarterly cadence and outperform peers. 

Cash Flow: We seek prospective target companies that have the potential to generate strong operating cash flows. We analyze a target company s financial statements, unit economics and management plan to understand the path to cash flow generation, and we do not make speculative bets where the path to cash flow generation is too risky. 

Growth Potential and Execution Capacity: We seek prospective target companies that we believe will generate long term value from their growth potential and execution capability rather than valuation arbitrage or financial leverage. 

Differentiation: We seek prospective target companies that demonstrate differentiation that can evolve into a sustainable competitive advantage. We believe this differentiation may exist through an exceptional value proposition, customer contracts, superior execution or product or brand advantage. 

Benefit from Being Public: We seek prospective target companies that will benefit from, and adhere to the complexities of, being a public company. 

Appropriate Valuation: We use rigorous valuation analyses as well as other data science approaches to ensure that our business combination is fairly priced with significant upside potential. We are disciplined in regard to preservation of capital and seek a margin of safety to manage risk. 

Partners for Long-Term
 Growth: We seek prospective target companies where we can remain partners on a long-term basis and add significant
 value to the business. We believe our business interests and financial interests ought to align with the target business and its
 management team.

Sourcing of Potential Initial Business Combination
Targets 

Our management team and sponsor
have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships. This network has been developed through their experience in sourcing,
acquiring, operating, developing, growing, financing and selling businesses; reputations for integrity and fair dealing with sellers,
capital providers and target management teams; and experience in executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions.
This network has provided our management team and sponsor with a flow of referrals that have resulted in numerous transactions. We believe
that the network of contacts and relationships of our management team and sponsor provides us with an important source of business combination
opportunities, such as the proposed Near Business Combination. In addition, if necessary, we anticipate that target business candidates
will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment banking firms, private equity firms, consultants,
accounting firms and other business enterprises. 

We are not prohibited from
pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors, or completing
the initial business combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, executive officers or directors.
While Near is not affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors, in the event we do not consummate the Near Business Combination
and seek to complete an initial business combination with a target that is affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors,
we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent
entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, stating that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial
point of view. 

If any of our executive officers
or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she
has then-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity
to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Certain of our executive officers currently have certain
relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us. We believe, however, that the fiduciary
duties or contractual obligations of our officers and directors will not materially affect our ability to complete our initial business
combination, if such opportunities have arisen. 

Initial Business Combination 

Nasdaq rules require that
we must consummate an initial business combination with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at
least 80 of the net assets held in the trust account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes, if permitted,
and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting commissions). If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the
fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another
independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely
that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination,
it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant
amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target s assets or prospects. Additionally, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any initial business
combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors. If we are no longer listed on Nasdaq, we would not be required
to satisfy the above-referenced fair market value test. Based on the valuation analysis of our management and board of directors, we have
determined that the fair market value of Near was substantially in excess of 80 of the funds in the trust account and that the 80 test
was therefore satisfied. 

13 

We anticipate structuring
our initial business combination, such as the Near Business Combination, so that the post-transaction company in which our public
stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100 of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. However, if we
do not consummate the Near Business Combination in the structure currently contemplated, we may structure our initial business combination,
including, if determined necessary or advisable, the Near Business Combination, in such a way so that the post-transaction company
owns or acquires less than 100 of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management
team or stockholders, or for other reasons. However, we will only complete an initial business combination if the post-transaction company
owns or acquires 50 or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target
sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company
owns or acquires 50 or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the initial business combination may collectively
own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business
combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the
outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100 controlling interest in the target. However, as a result
of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own
less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100 of the equity interests
or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business
or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of Nasdaq s 80 of net assets test. If we
do not consummate the Near Business Combination as currently contemplated and the initial business combination involves more than one
target business, the 80 of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions and we will treat the target
businesses together as our initial business combination for purposes of seeking stockholder approval or conducting a tender offer, as
applicable. 

The net proceeds of our initial
public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants released to us from the trust account upon the closing of our initial business
combination may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete our initial business combination.
If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, as proposed for the Near Business Combination, or not
all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination
or used for redemption of our public shares, we may use the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account following the closing
for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction businesses, the payment
of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies
or for working capital. In addition, we may be required to obtain additional financing in connection with the closing of our initial business
combination to be used following the closing for general corporate purposes as described above. There is no limitation on our ability
to raise funds through the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities or through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection
with our initial business combination, including pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements into which we may enter.
Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our
initial business combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to
raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise. None of our sponsor, officers, directors or stockholders is
required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our initial business combination. We may also obtain financing prior
to the closing of our initial business combination to fund our working capital needs and transaction costs in connection with our search
for and completion of our initial business combination. On January 21, 2022, we issued a working capital loan (the Working Capital
Loan in the principal amount of up to 1,500,000 to our sponsor. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides
that, prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we are prohibited from issuing additional securities that would entitle
the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote as a class with our public shares (a) on any
initial business combination or (b) to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to (x) extend
the time we have to consummate a business combination beyond April 11, 2023, approximately 27 months from the closing of our initial
public offering or (y) amend the foregoing provisions, unless (in connection with any such amendment to our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation) we offer our public stockholders the opportunity to redeem their public shares. 

For more information on the
Near Business Combination and the equity financing arrangements associated therewith, please see Near Business Combination 
and Combination Period and Extensions above. 

14 

Our Business Combination Process 

In evaluating prospective
business combinations, such as the Near Business Combination, we conduct a due diligence review process that encompasses, among other
things, a review of historical and projected financial and operating data, meetings with management and their advisors and, as applicable,
on-site inspection of facilities and assets, discussion with customers and suppliers, legal reviews and other reviews as we deem
appropriate. We also utilize the expertise of our management team and board of directors in analyzing companies and evaluating operating
projections, financial projections and determining the appropriate return expectations given the risk profile of the target business. 

Members of our management
team directly and indirectly own our common stock and warrants, and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether
a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our
officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or
resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial
business combination. 

Our sponsor and members of
our management team are, in the ordinary course of business, continuously made aware of potential acquisition or investment opportunities,
one or more of which we may desire to pursue for an initial business combination, should the Near Business Combination not be consummated. 

Each of our officers and directors
presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which
such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or
directors become aware of a business combination opportunity that is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary
or contractual obligations to present the opportunity to such entity, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations
to present such opportunity to such entity. We believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers
or directors will not materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination, as we believe any such opportunities
presented would be smaller than what we are interested in, in different fields than what we would be interested in, or that such fiduciary
duties or contractual obligations are to entities that are not themselves in the business of engaging in business combinations. Our amended
and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director
or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company
and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue,
and to the extent the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation. 

Our Management Team 

Members of our management
team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they devote as much of their time as they deem necessary
to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that any member of our management team will
devote in any time period will vary based on the initial business combination process. 

We believe our management
team s operating and transaction experience and relationships with companies will provide us with a substantial number of potential
business combination targets. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team have developed a broad network of contacts
and corporate relationships. This network has grown through the activities of our management team sourcing, acquiring and financing businesses,
our management team s relationships with sellers, financing sources and target management teams and the experience of our management
team in executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions. 

15 

Status as a Public Company 

We believe our structure makes
us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses, such as Near. As a public company, we offer a target business an alternative
to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination with us. Following an initial business combination,
we believe the target business would have greater access to capital and additional means of creating management incentives that are better
aligned with stockholders interests than it would as a private company. A target business can further benefit by augmenting its
profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. In a business combination transaction with
us, the owners of the target business may, for example, exchange their shares of stock in the target business for our shares of Class A
common stock (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our shares of Class A common stock and cash, allowing us
to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. 

Although there are various
costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a more expeditious and
cost-effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. The typical initial public offering
process takes a significantly longer period of time than the typical business combination transaction process, and there are significant
expenses and market and other uncertainties in the initial public offering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions,
marketing and road show efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with an initial business combination with us. 

Furthermore, once a proposed
initial business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering
is always subject to the underwriters ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay
or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Following an initial business combination, we believe
the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with
stockholders interests and the ability to use its shares as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further
benefits by augmenting a company s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. 

While we believe that our
structure and our management team s backgrounds will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may
view our status as a blank check company, such as our lack of an operating history and our ability to seek stockholder approval of any
proposed initial business combination, negatively. 

We are an emerging
growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to
take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging
growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements
and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of
any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be
a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 

In addition, Section 107
of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B)
of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the
adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage
of the benefits of this extended transition period. 

We will remain an emerging
growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following January 11, 2026, (b) in which we
have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.235 billion or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which
means the market value of our Class A common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the prior June
30 and (2) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior
three-year period. References herein to emerging growth company will have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.

Financial Position 

With funds available for an
initial business combination in the amount of 6,470,354 as of March 14, 2023, assuming no redemptions and excluding payment of up to
 6,037,500 of deferred underwriting fees, before estimated offering and working capital expenses, we offer a target business a variety
of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations
or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt or leverage ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination
using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination
that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. On January 21, 2022, we
issued the Working Capital Loan in the principal amount of up to 1,500,000 to our sponsor. On January 31, 2022, April 1, 2022, June 30,
2022, September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022, 350,000, 112,500, 250,000, 360,000 and 152,500 were drawn on the Working Capital
Loan, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the total Working Capital Loan amount outstanding was 1,225,000 and has been included (at
its then current fair value) in Working Capital Loan on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. 

See Combination Period and Extension above for a discussion
regarding the two promissory notes issued to the sponsor and Near in connection with the payment of the Extension Funds with an aggregate
amount outstanding of 2,060,070 as of March 14, 2023. 

Effecting Our Initial Business Combination 

We are not presently engaged
in, and we will not engage in, any operations other than the pursuit of our business combination until we consummate our initial business
combination, such as the Near Business Combination. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds
of our initial public offering and the private placement of the private placement warrants, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in
connection with our initial business combination (pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements into which we may enter),
shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing.
We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages
of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses. 

If our initial business combination
is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration
in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemption of our public shares, we may use the balance of the cash released
to us from the trust account following the closing for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations
of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. 

We may seek to raise additional
funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, and
we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust
account. In addition, we are targeting businesses with enterprise values that are greater than we could acquire with the net proceeds
of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, and, as a result, if the cash portion of the purchase price
exceeds the amount available from the trust account, net of amounts needed to satisfy any redemptions by public stockholders, we may be
required to seek additional financing to complete such proposed initial business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities
laws, we would expect to complete such financing only simultaneously with the completion of our initial business combination. In the case
of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our proxy materials or tender offer documents
disclosing the initial business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek stockholder
approval of such financing. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities
or through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with our initial business combination, including pursuant to forward purchase
agreements or backstop agreements into which we may enter. None of our sponsor, officers, directors or stockholders is required to provide
any financing to us in connection with or after our initial business combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
provides that, prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we are prohibited from issuing additional securities that
would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote as a class with our public shares
(a) on any initial business combination or (b) to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
to (x) extend the time we have to consummate a business combination beyond April 11, 2023 or (y) amend the foregoing provisions,
unless (in connection with any such amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation) we offer our public stockholders
the opportunity to redeem their public shares. 

See Near Business Combination 
above for more information on the proposed structure and financing associated with the planned Near Business Combination. 

17 

Sources of Target Businesses 

Target business candidates,
such as Near, are brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers and investment professionals.
Target businesses are also brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us by calls or mailings.
These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many
of these sources will have read the prospectus of our initial public offering and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our
officers and directors, as well as our sponsor and its affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they
become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending
trade shows, conferences or conventions. In addition, we have received a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not
otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors and our sponsor and their
respective industry and business contacts as well as their affiliates. We may engage the services of professional firms or other individuals
that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, in which event we may pay a finder s fee, consulting fee, advisory
fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage
a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be
available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our
best interest to pursue. Payment of finder s fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee
will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. In no event, however, will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors,
or any entity with which our sponsor or officers are affiliated, be paid any finder s fee, reimbursement, consulting fee, monies
in respect of any payment of a loan or other compensation by the Company prior to, or in connection with any services rendered for any
services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction
that it is). Although none of our sponsor, executive officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, will be allowed to
receive any compensation, finder s fees or consulting fees from a prospective business combination target in connection with a contemplated
initial business combination, we do not have a policy that prohibits our sponsor, executive officers or directors, or any of their respective
affiliates, from negotiating for the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses by a target business. Some of our officers and directors
may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-transaction company following our initial business combination.
The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an initial business
combination candidate. 

We are not prohibited from
pursuing an initial business combination with an initial business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or
directors or making the initial business combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, officers
or directors. While Near is not affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors, in the event we do not consummate the Near
Business Combination and we seek to complete our initial business combination with an initial business combination target that is affiliated
with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment
banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that such an initial business combination is fair
to our company from a financial point of view. 

If any of our officers or
directors becomes aware of an initial business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he
or she has then-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity
to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Our officers and directors currently have certain relevant
fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us. 

18 

Selection of a Target Business and Structuring
of our Initial Business Combination 

Nasdaq rules require that
we must consummate an initial business combination with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at
least 80 of the net assets held in the trust account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes, if permitted,
and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting commissions). The fair market value of our initial business combination will be
determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted
cash flow valuation, a valuation based on trading multiples of comparable public businesses or a valuation based on the financial metrics
of M A transactions of comparable businesses. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value
of our initial business combination (including with the assistance of financial advisors), we will obtain an opinion from an independent
investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such
criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair
market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of
a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target s assets or prospects. We do
not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination. Subject to this
requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses,
although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company
with nominal operations. 

In any case, we will only
complete an initial business combination in which we own or acquire 50 or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or
otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under
the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100 of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses,
the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be taken into
account for purposes of Nasdaq s 80 of net assets test. There is no basis for our investors to evaluate the possible merits or
risks of any target business with which we may complete our initial business combination. 

To the extent we effect our
initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth
we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks
inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors. 

In evaluating a prospective
business target, we conduct a due diligence review, which encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent ownership, management
and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and
other information that will be made available to us. 

Any costs incurred with respect
to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our initial business combination
is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. 

Lack of Business Diversification 

For an indefinite period of
time after the completion of our initial business combination, such as the Near Business Combination, the prospects for our success may
depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations
with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and
mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our
lack of diversification may: 

subject
us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular
industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and 

cause
us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services. 

19 

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target s
Management Team 

Although we closely scrutinize
the management of a prospective target business, including the management team of Near, when evaluating the desirability of effecting
our initial business combination with that business and plan to continue to do so if the Near Business Combination is not consummated
and we seek other business combination opportunities, our assessment of the target business management may not prove to be correct.
In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore,
the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination
as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial
business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following
our initial business combination, such as Mini Krishnamoorthy remaining as a director after the Near Business Combination, it is unlikely
that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure
you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target
business. 

Although the current plan
is to have Mini Krishnamoorthy, our Chief Financial Officer and a director, remain as a director after the Near Business Combination,
we cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The
determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business
combination. 

Following our initial business
combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure
you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge
or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management. 

Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve
Our Initial Business Combination 

We may conduct redemptions
without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required
by law or applicable stock exchange rule (as is the case in the Near Business Combination, as currently contemplated), or we may decide
to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of
initial business combinations we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such
transaction. 

Type of Transaction 
 
 Whether 
Stockholder 
Approval is 
Required 
 
 Purchase of assets 
 
 No 

Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company 
 
 No 

Merger of target into a subsidiary of the company 
 
 No 

Merger of the company with a target 
 
 Yes 

Under Nasdaq s listing
rules, stockholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example: 

we issue shares of Class A common stock that will be equal to or in excess of 20 of the number of shares of our Class A common stock then outstanding; 

20 

any of our directors, officers or substantial security holders (as defined by Nasdaq rules) has a 5 or greater interest, directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired and if the number of shares of common stock to be issued, or if the number of shares of common stock into which the securities may be convertible or exercisable, exceeds either (a) 1 of the number of shares of common stock or 1 of the voting power outstanding before the issuance in the case of any of our directors and officers or (b) 5 of the number of shares of common stock or 5 of the voting power outstanding before the issuance in the case of any substantial security holders; 

the issuance or potential
 issuance of common stock will result in our undergoing a change of control; or 

i n connection with the Second Extension, stockholders
 holding 9,786,530 public shares exercised their right to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the trust
 account. As a result, approximately 101 million (approximately 10.32 per public share) was removed from the trust account to pay
 such holders and approximately 6.376 million remained in the trust account. Following the redemptions, the Company has 617,864
 public shares outstanding. 

We may also elect to seek
to further extend the deadline by which we must consummate our initial business combination. Such an extension requires the approval of
our public stockholders to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, who will be provided the opportunity at that time
to redeem all or a portion their shares (which would likely have a material adverse effect on the amount held in our trust account and
other adverse effects on our Company, such as our ability to maintain our listing on Nasdaq). 

Permitted Purchases of Our Securities 

If we seek stockholder approval
of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase public shares
or public warrants in privately-negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our
initial business combination. There is no limit on the number of shares or warrants our initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors
or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and Nasdaq rules. However, they have
no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information
not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate
that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction
subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases
that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant
to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements. None
of the funds held in the trust account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions prior to completion of
our initial business combination. 

The purpose of any such purchases
of shares could be to vote such shares in favor of the initial business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder
approval of the initial business combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have
a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement
would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding
or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination.
Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been
possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public float of our shares of Class A common stock or warrants
may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain
the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. 

Our sponsor, officers, directors
and/or any of their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom our sponsor, officers, directors or their
affiliates may pursue privately-negotiated purchases by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption
requests tendered by stockholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the
extent that our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact
only potential selling stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust
account or vote against our initial business combination, whether or not such stockholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to
our initial business combination. Such persons would select the stockholders from whom to acquire shares based on the number of shares
available, the negotiated price per share and such other factors as any such person may deem relevant at the time of purchase. The price
per share paid in any such transaction may be different than the amount per share a public stockholder would receive if it elected to
redeem its shares in connection with our initial business combination. Our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates
will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws. 

21 

Any purchases by our sponsor,
officers, directors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will be made
only to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation
under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that
must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates
will not make purchases of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act.
Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchases are
subject to such reporting requirements. 

See Near Business Combination 
above for more information regarding such purchases in the Near Business Combination. 

Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders upon
Completion of our Initial Business Combination 

We will provide our
public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion
of our initial business combination, such as the Near Business Combination, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the
aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business
combination including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes,
divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. As of December 31, 2022,
interest in the aggregate amount of 579,359 had been drawn to pay tax obligations. The amount in the trust account, as of March 14,
2023, was 10.47 per public share (prior to any additional permitted withdrawals to pay taxes). The per-share amount we will
distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the
underwriters. Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed
to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the
completion of our initial business combination. 

See Near Business Combination 
above for more information on the additional agreements entered into in connection with the Near Business Combination. 

Manner of Conducting Redemptions 

We will provide our public
stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination
either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the initial business combination, as currently contemplated
for purposes of the Near Business Combination, or (ii) without a stockholder vote by means of a tender offer, if the Near Business
Combination is not consummated or is otherwise restructured. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed
initial business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of
factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under
applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements. 

Asset acquisitions and stock
purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions
where we issue more than 20 of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would
require stockholder approval. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on Nasdaq, we will be required to comply
with Nasdaq s stockholder approval rules. 

The requirement that we provide
our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares by one of the two methods listed above are contained in provisions
of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and apply whether or not we maintain our registration under the Exchange Act
or our listing on Nasdaq. Such provisions may be amended if approved by holders of 65 of our common stock entitled to vote thereon. 

22 

If we provide our public stockholders
with the opportunity to redeem their public shares in connection with a stockholder meeting, we will: 

conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and 

file proxy materials with the SEC. 

If we seek stockholder approval,
as we currently contemplate seeking for the Near Business Combination, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority
of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the initial business combination. A quorum for such meeting will
consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the Company representing a majority of
the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our initial stockholders
will count towards this quorum and, pursuant to the letter agreement, our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to vote their founder
shares and any public shares purchased during or after our initial public offering (including in open market and privately-negotiated transactions)
in favor of our initial business combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding shares of common stock
voted, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained. As a result of
the aggregate redemptions of public shares in connection with the First Extension and the Second Extension and the number of outstanding
founder shares held by our initial stockholders, we do not require the vote of the holders of any of the public shares sold in our initial
public offering to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have our initial business combination approved, as
the founder shares constitute more than a majority of the total outstanding shares of common stock. We intend to give not less than 10 days 
nor more than 60 days prior written notice of any such meeting, if required, at which a vote shall be taken to approve our
initial business combination. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our initial stockholders, may make it more
likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares irrespective
of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or whether they were a stockholder on the record date for the stockholder
meeting held to approve the proposed transaction. 

If a stockholder vote is not
required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will: 

conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and 

file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination, which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. 

In the event we conduct
redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with
Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration
of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified
number of public shares, which number will be based on the requirement that we will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such
redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least 5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business
combination and after payment of deferred underwriter s fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC s penny
stock rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement that may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial
business combination. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and
not complete the initial business combination. 

Upon the public announcement
of our initial business combination, if we elect to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, we or our sponsor will terminate
any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our Class A common stock in the open market,
in order to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act. 

23 

We intend to require our public
stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in street name, 
to, at the holder s option, either deliver their stock certificates to our transfer agent or deliver their shares to our transfer
agent electronically using the DWAC system, prior to the date set forth in the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable.
In the case of proxy materials, this date may be up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the initial business
combination. In addition, if we conduct redemptions in connection with a stockholder vote, we intend to require a public stockholder seeking
redemption of its public shares to also submit a written request for redemption to our transfer agent two business days prior to the vote
in which the name of the beneficial owner of such shares is included. The proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, that
we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring
public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. We believe that this will allow our transfer agent to efficiently process any
redemptions without the need for further communication or action from the redeeming public stockholders, which could delay redemptions
and result in additional administrative cost. If the proposed initial business combination is not approved and we continue to search for
a target company, we will promptly return any certificates or shares delivered by public stockholders who elected to redeem their shares. 

Our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation provides that we will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be
at least 5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of deferred
underwriter s fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC s penny stock rules) or any greater
net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example,
the proposed initial business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash
to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy
other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed initial business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration
we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required
to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed initial business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available
to us, we will not complete the initial business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of Class A common stock submitted
for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. 

See Near Business Combination 
above for more information on the additional agreements entered into in connection with the Near Business Combination and Combination
Period and Extensions above for more information on the redemptions in connection with the extensions. 

Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of
our Initial Business Combination if we Seek Stockholder Approval 

Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business
combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder,
together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a group 
(as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an
aggregate of 15 of the shares sold in our initial public offering (the Excess Shares ). Such restriction shall also be applicable
to our affiliates. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts
by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed initial business combination as a means to
force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable
terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15 of the shares sold in our initial public offering
could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium
to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders ability to redeem no more than
15 of the shares sold in our initial public offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group
of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection
with an initial business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares)
for or against our initial business combination. 

24 

Delivering Stock Certificates in Connection
with the Exercise of Redemption Rights 

As described above, we intend
to require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in
 street name, to, at the holder s option, either deliver their stock certificates to our transfer agent or deliver
their shares to our transfer agent electronically using the DWAC system, prior to the date set forth in the proxy materials or tender
offer documents, as applicable. In the case of proxy materials, this date may be up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal
to approve the initial business combination. In addition, if we conduct redemptions in connection with a stockholder vote, we intend to
require a public stockholder seeking redemption of its public shares to also submit a written request for redemption to our transfer agent
two business days prior to the vote in which the name of the beneficial owner of such shares is included. The proxy materials or tender
offer documents, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination
will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public stockholder would
have up to two business days prior to the vote on the initial business combination if we distribute proxy materials, or from the time
we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, as applicable, to submit or tender its shares if it
wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. In the event that a stockholder fails to comply with these or any other procedures disclosed
in the proxy or tender offer materials, as applicable, its shares may not be redeemed. Given the relatively short exercise period, it
is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares. 

There is a nominal cost associated
with the above-referenced process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer
agent will typically charge the broker submitting or tendering shares a fee and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this
cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise
redemption rights to submit or tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless
of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. 

Any request to redeem such
shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable.
Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently
decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return
the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing
to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination. 

If our initial business combination
is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be
entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return
any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares. 

If the Near Business Combination
is not completed, we may continue to try to complete an initial business combination with a different target by April 11, 2023, or a later
date if we decide to extend the Combination Period. 

Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation
if no Initial Business Combination 

Our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation provides that we will have only until April 11, 2023 to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to
complete our initial business combination within the Combination Period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose
of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at
a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned
on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution
expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders 
rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably
possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve,
subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable
law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail
to complete our initial business combination within the Combination Period. 

On August 16, 2022, the Inflation
Reduction Act of 2022 (the IR Act was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for, among other things, a new U.S.
federal 1 excise tax on certain repurchases (including redemptions) of stock by publicly traded domestic (i.e., U.S.) corporations and
certain domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself,
not its stockholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1 of the fair market value of the shares
repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted
to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable
year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury has been
given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax. The IR Act
applies only to repurchases that occur after December 31, 2022. 

Any redemption or other repurchase
that occurs after December 31, 2022, in connection with an extension, a business combination or otherwise, may be subject to the excise
tax. Whether and to what extent we would be subject to the excise tax in connection with the Second Extension or the Near Business Combination
would depend on a number of factors, including (i) the fair market value of the redemptions and repurchases in connection with the Second
Redemption or the Near Business Combination, (ii) the structure of the Near Business Combination, (iii) the nature and amount of any PIPE 
or other equity issuances in connection with the Near Business Combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with the Second Extension but issued within the same taxable year of the Near Business Combination) and (iv) the content of regulations and other
guidance from the Treasury. In addition, because the excise tax would be payable by us and not by the redeeming holder, the mechanics
of any required payment of the excise tax have not been determined. The foregoing could cause a reduction in the cash available on hand
to complete the Near Business Combination and in our ability to complete the Near Business Combination. 

25 

Our sponsor, officers and
directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from
the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by them if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the Combination
Period. However, if our sponsor, officers or directors acquire public shares, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from
the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the Combination Period. 

Our sponsor, officers and
directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation to (A) modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection
with an initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within
the Combination Period or (B) with respect to any other provisions relating to stockholders rights or pre-initial business
combination activity, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of Class A common stock
upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust
account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by
the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net
tangible assets will be at least 5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after
payment of deferred underwriter s fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC s penny stock 
rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy
the net tangible asset requirement (described above), we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public
shares at such time. 

We expect to use the amounts
held outside the trust account 101,161 as of December 31, 2022) to pay for all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan
of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, if we do not complete an initial business combination within the Combination Period
although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. We will depend on sufficient interest being earned
on the proceeds held in the trust account to pay any tax obligations we may owe. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the
costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust
account not required to pay taxes on interest income earned on the trust account balance, we may request the trustee to release to us
an additional amount of up to 100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses. 

If we were to expend all of
the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the
trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received
by stockholders upon our dissolution would be approximately 10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become
subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you
that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than 10.00. Under Section 281(b)
of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made
in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our
remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient
to pay or provide for all creditors claims. 

Although we seek to have all
vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving
any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders,
such parties may not execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements, they may not be prevented from bringing claims against
the trust account, including, but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as
well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain advantage with respect to a claim against our
assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to enter into an agreement waiving such claims to the
monies held in the trust account, our management will consider whether competitive alternatives are reasonably available to the Company,
and will only enter into an agreement with such third party if our management believes that such third party s engagement would
be in the best interests of the Company under the circumstances. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that
refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed
by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management
is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. Marcum and the underwriters of our initial public offering will not
execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. 

26 

In addition, there is no guarantee
that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts
or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Upon redemption of our public shares, if we
are unable to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed timeframe, or upon the exercise of a redemption right in
connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived
that may be brought against us within the 10 years following redemption. Accordingly, the per-share redemption amount received
by public stockholders could be less than the 10.47 per share held in the trust account as of March 14, 2023, due to claims of such creditors.
Pursuant to the letter agreement, our sponsor agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for
services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent,
confidentiality or similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below the lesser
of (i) 10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation
of the trust account, if less than 10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable; provided that
such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights
to the monies held in the trust account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity
of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However,
we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor
has sufficient funds to satisfy their indemnity obligations, and believe that our sponsor s only assets are securities of our company.
Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully
made against the trust account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than
 10.00 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser
amount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims
by third parties, including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. 

In the event that the proceeds
in the trust account are reduced below (i) 10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust
account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the
amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations
or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take
legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors
would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent
directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so if, for example, the cost of such legal action is deemed by the
independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or if the independent directors determine that a favorable outcome
is not likely. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations and we cannot assure you that our sponsor
would be able to satisfy those obligations, and believe that our sponsor s only assets are securities of our company. Accordingly,
we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than 10.00
per public share. 

We seek to reduce the possibility
that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers,
prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest
or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity
of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We may
have access to use the amounts held outside the trust account 101,161 as of December 31, 2022, net of accrued offering costs) to pay
any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more
than approximately 100,000) but these amounts may be spent on expenses incurred as a result of being a public company or due diligence
expenses on prospective business combination candidates. In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve
for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by
creditors 

27 

Under the DGCL, stockholders
may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution.
The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in
the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the Combination Period may be considered a liquidating distribution
under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that
it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims
can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional
150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect
to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder s pro rata share of the claim or the amount
distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. 

Furthermore, if the pro
rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we
do not complete our initial business combination within the Combination Period, is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware
law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful (potentially due to the imposition of legal proceedings that a party may
bring or due to other circumstances that are currently unknown), then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations
for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of
a liquidating distribution. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the Combination Period, we will: (i) cease
all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter,
redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account,
including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to 100,000
of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish
public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as
promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors,
liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements
of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following our 27th month
and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims
to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary
of such date. 

Because we will not be complying
with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will
provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent
10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to
searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment
bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement,
we seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements
with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result of this obligation,
the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability
extending to the trust account is remote. Further, our sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in
the trust account are not reduced below (i) 10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust
account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the
amount of interest released to us to pay taxes and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our
initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver
is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. 

28 

If we file a bankruptcy petition
or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject
to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over
the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to
return 10.00 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition
is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor
and/or bankruptcy laws as either a preferential transfer or a fraudulent conveyance. As a result, a bankruptcy
court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having
breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of
punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you
that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. 

Our public stockholders will
be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the completion of our initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend any provisions
of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to (A) modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the
redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not
complete our initial business combination within the Combination Period or (B) with respect to any other provisions relating to stockholders 
rights or pre-initial business combination activity, and (iii) the redemption of all of our public shares if we are unable to
complete our business combination within the Combination Period, subject to applicable law. In no other circumstances will a stockholder
have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial
business combination, a stockholder s voting in connection with the initial business combination alone will not result in a stockholder s
redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised
its redemption rights as described above. These provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, like all provisions
of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, may be amended with a stockholder vote. 

We may, however, elect to
seek to further extend the deadline by which we must consummate our initial business combination. Such an extension requires the approval
of our public stockholders, who will be provided the opportunity to at that time to redeem all or a portion their shares (which would
likely have a material adverse effect on the amount held in our trust account and other adverse effects on our Company, such as our ability
to maintain our listing on Nasdaq). Our sponsor may also explore transactions under which it would sell its interest in our Company to
another management team. 

Competition 

In identifying, evaluating
and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, such as Near, we encounter competition from other entities having
a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public
companies and operating businesses seeking strategic business combinations. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive
experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess
greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by
our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the initial business combination of
a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights
may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they
potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive
disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination. 

29 

Indemnity 

Our sponsor has agreed that
it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective
target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or similar agreement or business combination
agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) 10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount
per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less than 10.00 per share due to
reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable; provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third
party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the trust account (whether or not
such waiver is enforceable), nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against
certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification
obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations, and believe
that our sponsor s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to
satisfy those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties, including, without limitation,
claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. 

Employees 

We have four officers. These
individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they devote as much of their time as they deem
necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they devote in any time period varies
based on the stage of the initial business combination process we are in. 

Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 

We have registered our units,
Class A common stock and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual,
quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports contain financial
statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. 

We will provide stockholders
with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the proxy solicitation materials, such as the Near Registration
Statement, or tender offer documents sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial
statements will need to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, GAAP or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical
financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements
may limit the pool of potential targets we may conduct an initial business combination with because some targets may be unable to provide
such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination
within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential business combination
candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or that the potential target business will be able to prepare
its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may
not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates, we do
not believe that this limitation will be material. 

We are required to evaluate
our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event
we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be
required to have our internal control procedures audited by our independent registered public accounting firm. A target company may not
be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of
the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary
to complete any such business combination. We have filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register
our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the
Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act
prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination. 

We will remain an emerging
growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) ending after January 11, 2026, (b) in which
we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.235 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer,
which means the market value of our shares of Class A common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million
as of the prior June 30, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during
the prior three-year period.

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

As a smaller reporting company
under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to include risk factors in this Report. However, below is a partial list of
material risks, uncertainties and other factors that could have a material effect on the Company and its operations: 

we are a blank check company with no revenue or basis to evaluate our ability to select a suitable business target; 

we may not be able to select an appropriate target business or businesses and complete our initial business combination in the prescribed time frame, including the Near Business Combination; 

our expectations around the performance of a prospective target business or businesses, such as Near, may not be realized; 

we may not be successful in retaining or recruiting required officers, key employees or directors following our initial business combination; 

our officers and directors may have difficulties allocating their time between the Company and other businesses and may potentially have conflicts of interest with our business or in approving our initial business combination; 

we may not be able to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination, including the Near Business Combination, or reduce the number of shareholders requesting redemption; 

we may issue our shares to investors in connection with our initial business combination at a price that is less than the prevailing market price of our shares at that time; 

you may not be given the opportunity to choose the initial business target or to vote on the initial business combination; 

trust account funds may not be protected against third party claims or bankruptcy; 

an active market for our public securities may not develop and you will have limited liquidity and trading; 

the availability to us of funds from interest income on the trust account balance may be insufficient to operate our business prior to the business combination; 

our financial performance following a business combination with an entity may be negatively affected by their lack of an established record of revenue, cash flows and experienced management; 

risks and uncertainties related to the software and technology industries; 

there may be more competition to find an attractive target for an initial business combination, which could increase the costs associated with completing our initial business combination and may result in our inability to find a suitable target; 

changes in the market for directors and officers liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate and complete an initial business combination; 

our ability to consummate an initial business combination, such as the Near Business Combination, may be adversely affected by economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets; 

31 

we may engage one or more of our underwriters or one of their respective affiliates to provide additional services to us after the initial public offering, which may include acting as a financial advisor in connection with an initial business combination or as placement agent in connection with a related financing transaction. Our underwriters are entitled to receive deferred underwriting commissions that will be released from the trust account only upon a completion of an initial business combination. These financial incentives may cause them to have potential conflicts of interest in rendering any such additional services to us after the initial public offering, including, for example, in connection with the sourcing and consummation of an initial business combination; 

we may attempt to complete our initial business combination with a private company, such as Near, about which little information is available, which may result in a business combination with a company that is not as profitable as we suspected, if at all; 

our warrants are accounted for as derivative liabilities and are recorded at fair value upon issuance with changes in fair value each period reported in earnings, which may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock or may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination; 

since our initial stockholders will lose their entire investment in us if our initial business combination is not completed (other than with respect to any public shares they may acquire during or after the initial public offering), and because our sponsor, officers and directors may profit substantially even under circumstances in which our public stockholders would experience losses in connection with their investment, a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular business combination target is appropriate for our initial business combination; 

changes in laws or regulations or how such laws or regulations are interpreted or applied, or a failure to comply with any laws or regulations, may adversely affect our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination, and results of operations; 

the value of the founder shares following completion of our initial business combination is likely to be substantially higher than the nominal price paid for them, even if the trading price of our common stock at such time is substantially less than 10.00 per share; 

resources could be wasted in researching acquisitions that are not completed, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business. If we have not completed our initial business combination within the Combination Period, our public stockholders may receive only approximately 10.00 per share, or less than such amount in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless; 

in March 2022, the SEC issued proposed rules relating to certain activities of SPACs. Certain of the procedures that we, a potential business combination target, or others may determine to undertake in connection with such proposals may increase our costs and the time needed to complete our initial business combination and may constrain the circumstances under which we could complete an initial business combination. The need for compliance with such proposals may cause us to liquidate the funds in the trust account or liquidate the Company at an earlier time than we might otherwise choose; 

if we are deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we would be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities would be severely restricted. As a result, in such circumstances, unless we are able to modify our activities so that we would not be deemed an investment company, we may abandon our efforts to complete an initial business combination and instead liquidate the Company; 

to mitigate the risk that we might be deemed to be an investment company
for purposes of the Investment Company Act, on January 11, 2023, we liquidated the investments held in the trust account and
instead hold the funds in the trust account in an interest bearing demand deposit account until the earlier of the consummation of our
initial business combination or our liquidation. As a result, following the liquidation of investments in the trust account,
we likely will receive less interest on the funds held in the trust account, which would likely reduce the dollar amount our public stockholders
would receive upon any redemption or liquidation of the Company; 

we may potentially be subject to U.S. foreign investment regulations which may impose conditions on or limit certain investors ability to purchase our securities or otherwise participate in the Business Combination, potentially making the securities less attractive to investors. Our future investments in U.S. companies may also be subject to U.S. foreign investment regulations; 

32 

we may not be able to complete an initial business combination with certain potential target companies, including Near, if a proposed transaction with the target company may be subject to review or approval by regulatory authorities pursuant to certain U.S. or foreign laws or regulations, including the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States; 

recent increases in inflation and interest rates in the United States and elsewhere could make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination; 

military conflict in Ukraine or elsewhere may lead to increased price volatility for publicly traded securities, which could make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination; 

a 1 U.S. federal excise tax may be imposed on us in connection with our redemptions of shares in connection with a business combination or other stockholder vote pursuant to which stockholders would have a right to submit their shares for redemption; 

there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and 

we have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. If we are unable to develop and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. 

We currently
maintain all of our working capital cash and cash equivalents with one financial institution and, therefore, our cash and cash
equivalents could be adversely affected if the financial institution in which we hold our cash and cash equivalents
fails. 

We currently maintain
all of our working capital cash and cash equivalents with one financial institution. At the current time, our cash balance with such
financial institution is below the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance FDIC Insurance limit. As a result
of the recent inability of certain businesses with accounts at Silicon Valley Bank to gain access to their deposits and the greater
focus on the concerns of potential failures of other financial institutions, in the future, we may consider diversifying a portion
of our cash and cash equivalents with other financial institutions in order to reduce the risks associated with maintaining all of
our cash and cash equivalents at one financial institution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure of one or more of the
financial institutions in which our cash and cash equivalents are held, the resulting inability for us to obtain the return of our
funds from any of those financial institutions, or any other adverse condition suffered by any of those financial institutions,
could impact access to our cash or cash equivalents and could adversely impact our operating liquidity and financial
performance. 

For the complete list of risks
relating to our operations, see the section titled Risk Factors contained in our IPO Registration Statement,(ii) Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as filed with the SEC on April 12, 2022, 
(iii) Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2022, as filed with the SEC on May 16, 2022, (iv) Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2022, as filed with the SEC on August 16, 2022, and (v) the Definitive Proxy Statement on
Schedule 14A filed in connection with the Second Extension, as filed with the SEC on December 19, 2022. Any of these factors could result
in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risks could arise that may
also affect our business or ability to consummate an initial business combination. We may disclose changes to such risk factors or disclose
additional risk factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC.

and the Near Business Combination, please see the Near Registration Statement.

 Market Information 

Our units, public shares and
public warrants are each traded on Nasdaq under the symbols INKAU, INKA and INKAW, respectively. Our units commenced public trading on
January 7, 2021, and our public shares and public warrants commenced separate public trading on March 1, 2021. 

(b) 
 Holders 

On March 14, 2023, there was
1 holder of record of our units, 1 holder of record of our shares of Class A common stock, 4 holders of record of our shares of Class
B common stock and 2 holders of record of our warrants. 

(c) 
 Dividends 

We have not paid any cash dividends on our common
stock to date and do not intend to pay cash dividends prior to the completion of our initial business combination. The payment of cash
dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial condition
subsequent to completion of our initial business combination. The payment of any cash dividends subsequent to our initial business combination
will be within the discretion of our board of directors at such time. In addition, our board of directors is not currently contemplating
and does not anticipate declaring any stock dividends in the foreseeable future. Further, if we incur any indebtedness in connection with
our initial business combination, our ability to declare dividends may be limited by restrictive covenants we may agree to in connection
therewith. Following the consummation of the Near Business Combination, in the event that Near has or incurs any indebtedness, the terms
of such indebtedness may limit our ability to issue dividends in the future.

Cautionary
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

All
statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Report including, without limitation, statements in this section
regarding our financial position, business strategy and the plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward- looking
statements. When used in this Report, words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, 
 intend and similar expressions, as they relate to us or our management, identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking
statements are based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management.
Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors detailed
in our filings with the SEC. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf
are qualified in their entirety by this paragraph. 

The following discussion and
analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements
and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Report. 

Overview 

We are a blank check company
formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on September 24, 2020, for the purpose of effecting a business combination with one or
more businesses. We intend to effectuate our business combination using cash from the remaining proceeds of the initial public offering
and the sale of the private placement warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt. 

We expect to continue to incur
significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete a business combination will
be successful. 

Results of Operations 

We have neither engaged
in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities from September 24, 2020 (inception) through December 31,
2022 were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the initial public offering and subsequent to the initial public
offering, identifying a target company for a business combination and subsequent to entering into the Merger Agreement, pursuing the
completion of the Near Business Combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after
the completion of our business combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income and unrealized gains on
marketable securities held in a trust account, and gains or losses from the change in fair value of the warrant liabilities and the
Working Capital Loan. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and
auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. 

For the year ended December 31,
2022, we had net income of 5,032,569, which consists of change in fair value of the warrant liabilities of 7,205,710, change in fair
value of the Working Capital Loan of 341,057, and interest earned on marketable securities held in the trust account of 1,760,120, partially
offset by formation and operational costs of 3,900,302 and provision for income taxes of 374,016. 

For the year ended December 31,
2021, we had a net loss of 406,026, which consists of the change in fair value of the warrant liabilities of 1,642,290, unrealized gain
on marketable securities held in trust account of 2,211 and interest earned on marketable securities held in the trust account of 78,398,
offset by formation and operational costs of 1,605,912 and transaction costs allocated to warrant liabilities of 523,013.

Near Business Combination

On May 18, 2022, we entered
into the Near Merger Agreement with Near, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2. Near, a global leader in privacy-led data intelligence, curates
one of the world s largest sources of intelligence on people, places and products. Near processes data from over 1.6 billion unique
user IDs, in over 70 million places across 44 countries to empower marketing and operational data leaders to confidently reach, understand
and market to consumers and optimize their business results. Near has offices in Los Angeles, Silicon Valley, Paris, Bangalore, Singapore,
Sydney and Tokyo. Near serves major enterprises in retail, real estate, restaurants, tourism, technology, marketing and other industries.
Pursuant to the Near Merger Agreement, at the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Near Merger Agreement, (i) Merger Sub
1 and Near will consummate the First Merger (as defined in the Near Merger Agreement), pursuant to which Merger Sub 1 will be merged with
and into Near, with Near continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, as a result of which all
of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Near will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and will cease to
exist in exchange for the right to receive the Merger Consideration (as defined in the Near Merger Agreement), and (ii) Near, as
the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company after the First Merger, will merge with and into Merger Sub 2,
with Merger Sub 2 continuing as the surviving entity, as a result of which all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Near will
no longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and will cease to exist and each membership interest of Merger Sub 2 will
remain outstanding as a membership interest of the surviving entity. Following the Near Business Combination, the Company will change
its name to Near Intelligence, Inc. , or such other name as may be mutually agreed to by the Company and Near. 

For a full description of the
Near Merger Agreement and the proposed Near Business Combination, please see Item 1. Business. 

Extensions 

On
July 7, 2022, the Company s stockholders approved the First Extension, extending the date by which the Company must consummate
its initial business combination from July 11, 2022 to January 11, 2023 (or such earlier date, subject to certain conditions
of the Near Merger Agreement, as determined by the board of directors). In connection with the First Extension, the Company issued two
promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of up to 2,060,070, pursuant to which the sponsor and Near loaned the Company an aggregate
of 2,060,070 and deposited into the trust account to cover the six months of extension payments (each in the amount of 343,345)
paid in connection with the First Extension. 

On January 6, 2023, the
Company s stockholders approved the Second Extension, extending the date by which the Company must consummate its initial business
combination from January 11, 2023 to April 11, 2023 (or such earlier date as determined by the board of directors). If the Company s
initial business combination, such as the Near Business Combination, is not consummated by April 11, 2023, then the Company s
existence will terminate, and the Company will distribute the remaining amounts in the trust account as provided in the Company s
amended and restated certificate of incorporation. 

In connection with the First
Extension, the Company s stockholders holding 6,845,606 public shares exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata
portion of the funds in the trust account. As a result, 68,488,348 (approximately 10.00 per share) was removed from the trust account
to pay such holders. In connection with the Second Extension, stockholders holding 9,786,530 public shares exercised their right to redeem
their shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account. As a result, approximately 101 million (approximately 10.32
per public share) was removed from the trust account to pay such holders and approximately 6.376 million remained in the trust account.
Following redemptions, the Company has 617,864 public shares outstanding as of the date of this Annual Report. 

For
a full description of the First Extension and Second Extension, please see Item 1. Business. 

Liquidity and Going Concern 

On January 11, 2021, we consummated
the initial public offering of 17,250,000 units, at a price of 10.00 per unit, which included the full exercise by the underwriters of
their over-allotment option in the amount of 2,250,000 units, generating gross proceeds of 172,500,000. Simultaneously with the closing
of the initial public offering, we consummated the sale of 5,200,000 private placement warrants to the sponsor at a price of 1.00 per
private placement warrant generating gross proceeds of 5,200,000. 

36 

Following the initial public
offering, the full exercise of the over-allotment option, and the sale of the private placement warrants, a total of 172,500,000 was
placed in the trust account. We incurred 14,303,235 in transaction costs, including 3,450,000 of underwriting fees, 6,037,500 of deferred
underwriting fees, 4,411,238 of fair value of the Founder Shares attributable to the anchor investor and 404,497 of other offering costs. 

For the year ended December
31, 2022, net cash used in operating activities was 2,103,271. Net income of 5,032,569 was affected by change in fair value of the warrant
liabilities of 7,205,710, change in fair value of the Working Capital Loan of 341,057, deferred tax provision of 71,622 and interest
earned on marketable securities held in the trust account of 1,760,120. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided 2,099,425
of cash for operating activities primarily because of the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses. 

For the year ended December
31, 2021, net cash used in operating activities was 970,669. Net loss of 406,026 was affected by change in fair value of the warrant
liabilities of 1,642,290, interest earned on marketable securities held in the trust account of 78,398, transaction costs allocated
to warrants of 523,013 and an unrealized gain on marketable securities held in trust account of 2,211. Changes in operating assets and
liabilities provided 635,243 of cash for operating activities. 

At December 31, 2022, we had
cash and marketable securities held in the trust account of 107,332,749 (including approximately 1,228,739 of interest income, including
unrealized loss) consisting of U.S. treasury bills with a maturity of 185 days or less. Interest income on the balance in the trust account
may be used by us to pay taxes. Through December 31, 2022, we had withdrawn 579,359 of interest earned from the trust account to pay
for the Company s previously unpaid and accrued tax obligations. 

We intend to use substantially
all of the funds held in the trust account and any additional funds available under the financing arrangement described in Note 5 to the
accompanying consolidated financial statements, including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account (less deferred
underwriting commissions and income taxes payable), to complete our business combination. To the extent that our capital stock or debt
is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the trust account
will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our
growth strategies. 

At December 31, 2022, we had
cash of 101,161 and borrowing capacity under the Working Capital Loan of 275,000. As of December 31, 2022, 1,225,000 was borrowed
under the Working Capital Loan. The fair value of the note as of December 31, 2022 was 421,900. We intend to use the funds held outside
the trust account and this borrowing capacity primarily for completing the Company s business combination. 

Subsequent to December 31,
2022, the Sponsor advanced the Company 275,000. 

The Company s liquidity
needs prior to the consummation of the initial public offering were satisfied through the proceeds of 25,000 from the sale of Founder
Shares, and loans from the sponsor of approximately 89,000. The loan was repaid in full on January 11, 2021. Subsequent to the consummation
of the initial public offering, the Company s liquidity has been satisfied through the net proceeds received from the consummation
of the initial public offering, the sale of private placement warrants, and the Working Capital Loan. 

In order to fund working capital
deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain
of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, make Working Capital Loans. Such Working Capital Loans would be evidenced
by promissory notes. If we complete a business combination, we may repay the notes out of the proceeds of the trust account released to
us. In the event that a business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account
to repay the notes, but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. On January 21, 2022, we issued a promissory
in the principal amount of up to 1,500,000 to our sponsor. The note is non-interest bearing and payable upon the consummation of a business
combination or may be convertible into warrants of the post-business combination entity at a price of 1.00 per warrant at the option
of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants (see Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial
statements). As of December 31, 2022, the Company had drawn 1,225,000 on the Working Capital Loan and had 275,000 available to draw. 

37 

As indicated in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements, at December 31, 2022, the Company had 101,161 in cash, 107,332,749 in cash and marketable securities
held in the trust account to be used for a business combination or to repurchase or redeem its common stock in connection therewith and
working capital deficit of 4,570,315, which excludes 125,394 of interest earned on the trust account which is available to pay Delaware
franchise taxes payable and income taxes payable. As of December 31, 2022, 1,228,739 of the amount on deposit in the trust account represented
interest income, which is available to pay the Company s tax obligations. 

Until the consummation of
a business combination, the Company has used and will be using the funds not held in the trust account and any additional funds available
under the financing arrangement described below for completing the Company s business combination. 

In connection with the Company s
assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with FASB s ASC Subtopic 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements
 Going Concern, the Company has until April 11, 2023, to consummate an initial business combination. It is uncertain that
the Company will be able to consummate an initial business combination by this time. If an initial business combination is not consummated
by this date, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution of the Company. Additionally, the Company may not have
sufficient liquidity to fund the working capital needs of the Company through one year from the issuance of these consolidated financial
statements. Management has determined that the liquidity condition and mandatory liquidation, should an initial business combination not
occur, and potential subsequent dissolution raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate after April
11, 2023. 

Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements 

We have no obligations, assets
or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2022. We do not participate in transactions
that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which
would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet
financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any
non-financial assets. 

Contractual Obligations 

We do not have any capital
lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities. 

The underwriters are entitled
to a deferred fee of 0.35 per unit, or 6,037,500 in the aggregate. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the
amounts held in the trust account solely in the event that we complete a business combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting
agreement. 

On January 21, 2022, the Company issued a promissory note with respect
to the Working Capital Loans in the principal amount of up to 1,500,000 to the Sponsor. The Working Capital Loan is non-interest bearing
and payable upon the consummation of a Business Combination or may be convertible into warrants of the post-Business Combination entity
at a price of 1.00 per warrant at the lender s discretion. As of December 31, 2022, 1,225,000 was borrowed under the Working Capital
Loan. The fair value of the promissory note as of December 31, 2022 was 421,900. 

On July 7, 2022, the Company
issued an unsecured promissory note to the Sponsor for up to an aggregate principal amount of 2,060,070 to be deposited into the Trust
Account in connection with the Extension. The Company was to deposit up to six equal installments of the Extension Funds, or 343,345,
into the Trust Account on a monthly basis for each month of the Extension and such amount will be distributed either to: (i) all
of the holders of the Public Shares upon the Company s liquidation or (ii) holders of Public Shares who elect to have their
shares redeemed in connection with the consummation of the Company s initial Business Combination. The Extension Funds note is not
convertible and bears no interest and is due and payable upon the earlier of the date on which the Company consummates its initial Business
Combination or the date of the liquidation of the Company. As of December 31, 2022, an aggregate of 1,373,380 has been drawn down on
the Extension Funds and deposited into the Trust Account to cover the first four months of the extension. 

On November 23, 2022, the
Company issued a promissory note (the Near Extension Note ), dated as of November 18, 2022, in the aggregate principal amount
of up to 686,690, to Near. The Near Extension Note relates to the final two payments of the Company s extension funds of 343,345
each to be deposited into the Trust Account for each month in which the date by which the Company must consummate its initial business
combination is extended, from July 11, 2022 until January 11, 2023. As of December 31, 2022, the full amount of 686,690 has been drawn
down on the Near Extension Note and deposited into the Trust Account. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The preparation of consolidated
financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. 

38 

Warrant Liabilities 

The Company does not
use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. The Company accounts for warrants as
either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant s specific terms and
applicable authoritative guidance in FASB ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 and ASC
815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 ). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding
financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480 and meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet
all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company s
own shares of common stock, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of
professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the
warrants are outstanding. 

For issued or modified
warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of
additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity
classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet
date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of
operations. For the private placement warrants, the fair value was estimated using a binomial lattice model incorporating the
Cox-Rss-Rubenstein methodology at the closing date of the initial public offering and as of December 31, 2021. For the public
warrants, the fair value was estimated using a binomial lattice model incorporating the Cox-Rss-Rubenstein methodology at the
closing date of the initial public offering and the level 1 quoted prices in an active market as of December 31, 2022. 

Class A Common Stock Subject to Possible
Redemption 

We account for our common
stock subject to possible conversion in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. 
Class A common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and measured at fair value. Conditionally
redeemable common stock (including common stock that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject
to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times,
common stock is classified as stockholders equity. Our Class A common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered
to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, all shares of Class A common stock subject
to possible redemption are presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders equity section of our
balance sheets. 

Net Loss Per Share of Common Stock 

Net loss per share of common
stock is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. The Company
applies the two-class method in calculating loss per share of common stock. Re-measurement associated with the redeemable shares of Class A
common stock is excluded from loss per common share as the redemption value approximates fair value. Net income or loss is allocated among
the classes of ordinary shares based on weighted average shares outstanding. 

The calculation of diluted
loss per share of common stock does not consider the effect of the warrants issued in connection with the (i) initial public offering,
and (ii) the private placement since the exercise of the warrants is contingent upon the occurrence of future events. The warrants
are exercisable to purchase 13,825,000 shares of Class A common stock in the aggregate. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the
Company did not have any other dilutive securities or other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into common stock
and then share in the earnings of the Company. As a result, diluted net loss per common share is the same as basic net loss per common
share for the periods presented. 

39 

Convertible Instruments 

The Company evaluated the
accounting for its promissory notes that feature conversion options in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging Activities ASC 815 ). ASC 815 requires companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as
freestanding derivative financial instruments according to certain criteria. The criteria includes circumstances in which (a) the economic
characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and
risks of the host contract, (b) a promissory note that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is
not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable GAAP with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a
separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument. However, the
Company has elected to account for its Working Capital Loan at fair value, as described in Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial
statements. 

Recent Accounting Standards 

Management does not believe
that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our consolidated
financial statements. 

Factors That May Adversely
Affect our Results of Operations 

Our
results of operations and our ability to complete an initial business combination may be adversely affected by various factors that could
cause economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets, many of which are beyond our control. Our business could be impacted
by, among other things, downturns in the financial markets or in economic conditions, increases in oil prices, inflation, increases in
interest rates, supply chain disruptions, declines in consumer confidence and spending, the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,
including resurgences and the emergence of new variants, and geopolitical instability, such as the military conflict in Ukraine. We cannot
at this time fully predict the likelihood of one or more of the above events, their duration or magnitude or the extent to which they
may negatively impact our business and our ability to complete an initial business combination. 

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 

We are a smaller reporting
company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this Item. 

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 

Reference is made to pages
F-1 through F-25 comprising a portion of this Report, which are incorporated herein by reference. 

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. 

None. 

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls and procedures
are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (together, the Certifying Officers ), or persons performing similar functions,
as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Certifying Officers, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.
Based on the foregoing, our Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end
of the period covered by this Report, due solely to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to
the Company s accounting for complex financial instruments. 

40 

In
light of this material weakness, we have enhanced our processes to identify and appropriately apply applicable accounting requirements
to better evaluate and understand the nuances of the complex accounting standards that apply to our consolidated financial statements
including making greater use of third-party professionals with whom we consult regarding complex accounting applications. The elements
of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time, and we can offer no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have
the intended effects. We believe our efforts will enhance our controls relating to accounting for complex financial transactions, but
we can offer no assurance that our controls will not require additional review and modification in the future as industry accounting practice
may evolve over time. 

We
do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and
procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure
controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all
our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions. 

Management s Annual Report on Internal
Controls over Financial Reporting 

As
required by SEC rules and regulations implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for
external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that: 

(1) 
 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of our company, 

(2) 
 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors, and 

(3) 
 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect errors or misstatements in our financial
statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making these assessments, management used
the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated
Framework (2013). Based on our assessments and those criteria, management determined that we did not maintain effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. 

Management
has implemented remediation steps to improve our internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, we expanded and improved our
review process for complex securities and related accounting standards. We plan to further improve this process by enhancing access to
accounting literature, identification of third-party professionals with whom to consult regarding complex accounting applications and
consideration of additional staff with the requisite experience and training to supplement existing accounting professionals. 

This
Report does not include an attestation report of our internal controls from our independent registered public accounting firm due to our
status as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

Other than as discussed above,
there have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 that materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Family Relationship 

Ms. Krishnamoorthy, our
Chief Financial Officer and Director, is the wife of Mr. Raghavan, our Co-President. There are no other family relationships among
any of our directors or executive officers that are required to be disclosed by Regulation S-K. 

43 

Number and Terms of Office of Officers and
Directors 

We have five directors. Our
board of directors is divided into two classes with only one class of directors being elected in each year and each class (except
for those directors appointed prior to our first annual meeting of stockholders) serving a two-year term. 

The term of office of the
first class of directors, consisting of Messrs. Rajagopalan, Rangaswami and Bailey, will expire at our first annual meeting of stockholders.
The term of office of the second class of directors, consisting of Mr. Ramachandran and Ms. Krishnamoorthy, will expire at the second
annual meeting of stockholders. 

Our officers are appointed
by the board of directors and serve at the discretion of the board of directors, rather than for specific terms of office. Our board of
directors is authorized to appoint persons to the offices set forth in our bylaws as it deems appropriate. Our bylaws provide that our
officers may consist of Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, one or more Presidents, Secretary, Treasurer,
Assistant Secretaries and such other offices as may be determined by the board of directors. 

Committees of the Board of Directors 

Our board of directors has
two standing committees: an audit committee and a compensation committee. 

Audit Committee 

We have established an audit
committee of the board of directors. Messrs. Rajagopalan, Rangaswami and Bailey serve as members of our audit committee, and Mr. Bailey
chairs the audit committee. Under the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have at least three members
of the audit committee, all of whom must be independent. Each of Messrs. Rajagopalan, Rangaswami and Bailey meets the independent director
standard under Nasdaq listing standards and under Rule 10-A-3(b)(1) of the Exchange Act. 

Each member of the audit committee
is financially literate and our board of directors has determined that Mr. Bailey qualifies as an audit committee financial
expert as defined in applicable SEC rules. 

We have adopted an audit committee
charter, which details the principal functions of the audit committee, including: 

the appointment, compensation, retention, replacement, and oversight of the work of the independent registered public accounting firm engaged by us; 

pre-approving all audit and permitted non-audit services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm engaged by us, and establishing pre-approval policies and procedures; 

setting clear hiring policies for employees or former employees of the independent registered public accounting firm, including but not limited to, as required by applicable laws and regulations; 

setting clear policies for audit partner rotation in compliance with applicable laws and regulations; 

obtaining and reviewing a report, at least annually, from the independent registered public accounting firm describing (i) the independent registered public accounting firm s internal quality-control procedures, (ii) any material issues raised by the most recent internal quality-control review, or peer review, of the audit firm, or by any inquiry or investigation by governmental or professional authorities within the preceding five years respecting one or more independent audits carried out by the firm and any steps taken to deal with such issues and (iii) all relationships between the independent registered public accounting firm and us to assess the independent registered public accounting firm s independence; 

reviewing and approving any related party transaction required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC prior to us entering into such transaction; and 

reviewing with management, the independent registered public accounting firm, and our legal advisors, as appropriate, any legal, regulatory or compliance matters, including any correspondence with regulators or government agencies and any employee complaints or published reports that raise material issues regarding our financial statements or accounting policies and any significant changes in accounting standards or rules promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. 

44 

Compensation Committee 

We have established a compensation
committee of the board of directors. Messrs. Rajagopalan and Bailey serve as members of our compensation committee. Under the Nasdaq listing
standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have at least two members of the compensation committee, all of whom must be independent.
Messrs. Rajagopalan and Bailey are independent and Mr. Rajagopalan chairs the compensation committee. 

We have adopted a compensation
committee charter, which details the principal functions of the compensation committee, including: 

reviewing and approving on an annual basis the corporate goals and objectives relevant to our Chief Executive Officer s compensation, if any is paid by us, evaluating our Chief Executive Officer s performance in light of such goals and objectives and determining and approving the remuneration (if any) of our Chief Executive Officer based on such evaluation; 

reviewing and approving on an annual basis the compensation, if any is paid by us, of all of our other officers; 

reviewing on an annual basis our executive compensation policies and plans; 

implementing and administering our incentive compensation equity-based remuneration plans; 

assisting management in complying with our proxy statement and annual report disclosure requirements; 

approving all special perquisites, special cash payments and other special compensation and benefit arrangements for our officers and employees; 

if required, producing a report on executive compensation to be included in our annual proxy statement; and 

reviewing, evaluating and recommending changes, if appropriate, to the remuneration for directors. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing,
other than the reimbursement of expenses, no compensation of any kind, including finders, consulting or other similar fees, has been or
will be paid to any of our existing stockholders, officers, directors or any of their respective affiliates, prior to, or for any services
they render in order to effectuate the consummation of an initial business combination. Accordingly, it is likely that prior to the consummation
of an initial business combination, the compensation committee will only be responsible for the review and recommendation of any compensation
arrangements to be entered into in connection with such initial business combination. 

The charter also provides
that the compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant, legal counsel or
other adviser and will be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any such adviser. However,
before engaging or receiving advice from a compensation consultant, external legal counsel or any other adviser, the compensation committee
will consider the independence of each such adviser, including the factors required by Nasdaq and the SEC. 

Code of Ethics 

We have adopted a Code of
Ethics applicable to our directors, officers and employees. We have filed a copy of our Code of Ethics and our audit and compensation
committee charters as exhibits to the IPO Registration Statement. You are able to review these documents by accessing our public filings
at the SEC s web site at www.sec.gov. In addition, a copy of the Code of Ethics will be provided without charge upon request
from us. We intend to disclose any amendments to or waivers of certain provisions of our Code of Ethics in a Current Report on Form 8-K. 

45 

Item 11. Executive Compensation. 

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 

None of our officers has received
any cash compensation for services rendered to us. No compensation of any kind, including any finder s fee, reimbursement, consulting
fee or monies in respect of any payment of a loan, has been or will be paid by us to our officers and directors prior to, or in connection
with any services rendered in order to effectuate, the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction
that it is). However, these individuals are reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf
such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. We do not have a policy
that prohibits our sponsor, executive officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, from negotiating for the reimbursement
of out-of-pocket expenses by a target business. Our audit committee reviews on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our sponsor,
officers or directors, or our or their affiliates. Any such payments prior to an initial business combination are made using funds held
outside the trust account. Other than quarterly audit committee review of such payments, we do not expect to have any additional controls
in place governing our reimbursement payments to our directors and executive officers for their out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection
with identifying and consummating an initial business combination. 

After the completion of our
initial business combination, directors or members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting or management fees
from the combined company. All of these fees will be fully disclosed to stockholders, to the extent then known, in the proxy solicitation
materials or tender offer documents furnished to our stockholders in connection with a proposed initial business combination. We have
not established any limit on the amount of such fees that may be paid by the combined company to our directors or members of management.
It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of the proposed initial business combination, because the directors
of the post-combination business will be responsible for determining officer and director compensation. Any compensation to be paid to
our officers will be determined, or recommended to the board of directors for determination, either by a compensation committee constituted
solely by independent directors or by a majority of the independent directors on our board of directors. 

We do not intend to take any
action to ensure that members of our management team maintain their positions with us after the consummation of our initial business combination,
including with respect to the Near Business Combination (other than Mini Krishnamoorthy remaining as a director), although it is possible
that some or all of our officers and directors may negotiate employment or consulting arrangements to remain with us after our initial
business combination. The existence or terms of any such employment or consulting arrangements to retain their positions with us may influence
our management s motivation in identifying or selecting a target business but we do not believe that the ability of our management
to remain with us after the consummation of our initial business combination will be a determining factor in our decision to proceed with
any potential business combination. We are not party to any agreements with our officers and directors that provide for benefits upon
termination of employment. 

Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters. 

The following table sets forth
information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of March 14, 2023 based on information obtained from the persons
named below, with respect to the beneficial ownership of common stock, by: 

each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5 of our outstanding common stock; 

each of our executive officers and directors that beneficially owns our common stock; and 

all our executive officers and directors as a group.

ownership is based on 4,930,364 shares of our common stock, consisting of (i) 617,864 shares of our Class A common stock and (ii) 4,312,500
shares of our Class B common stock, issued and outstanding as of March 14, 2023. On all matters to be voted upon, except for the election
of directors of the board, holders of the shares of Class A common stock and shares of Class B common stock vote together as a single
class. Currently, all of the shares of Class B common stock are convertible into Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis.

interest in an aggregate of 635,625 founder shares at the original purchase price that our sponsor paid for the founder shares. Our sponsor
has agreed to distribute such founder shares to the anchor investor after the completion of a business combination (such as the Near Business
Combination). The Company estimated the aggregate fair value of the founder shares attributable to the anchor investor to be 4,411,238,
or 6.94 per share. The fair value of the founder shares was estimated using the income approach. The excess of the fair value of the
founder shares was determined to be an offering cost in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5A and a capital contribution
from the sponsor in accordance with Topic 5T. Accordingly, the offering cost was allocated to the separable financial instruments
issued in our initial public offering using the with-and-without method, compared to total proceeds received. Offering costs related to
the founder shares amounted to a contribution to additional paid-in capital 4,411,238, of which 158,805 were expensed to the statements
of operations and included in transaction costs attributable to warrant liabilities and the remaining 4,252,433 recorded as an additional
offering cost as a reduction of temporary equity, and re-measured to accumulated deficit upon recording temporary equity at redemption
value. 

We currently utilize office
space at 1096 Keeler Avenue, Berkeley CA 94708. Our executive offices are provided to us by an affiliate of Arjun Divecha, our Special
Advisor, at no charge, until such time as we may enter into a lease for office space with an unaffiliated third party. 

On January 21, 2022,
we issued a promissory note in the principal amount of up to 1,500,000 for working capital expenses. The Working Capital Loan is non-interest
bearing and payable upon the consummation of a business combination, such as the Near Business Combination, or may be convertible into
warrants of the Company following a business combination (such as the Near Business Combination) at a price of 1.00 per warrant at the
lender s discretion. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, an aggregate of 1,225,000 was drawn on the Working Capital
Loan and is included (at its then current fair value) in Working Capital Loan on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December
31, 2022. The Working Capital Loan was valued using the fair value method. The discounted cash flow method was used to value the debt
component of the Working Capital Loan and the black scholes option pricing model (the Black Scholes Option Pricing Model was used to value the debt conversion option. The Working Capital Loan is required to be recorded at its initial fair value on the date
of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the notes are recognized as a non-cash gain
or loss on the condensed statements of operations. The initial fair value of the Working Capital Loan draw on January 31, 2022 was 264,900,
which resulted in a contribution of 85,100 to stockholders deficit. The initial fair value of the Working Capital Loan draws on
April 1, 2022, June 30, 2022, September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022 were 83,396, 184,807, 177,331 and 52,522, which resulted in
a contribution of 29,104, 65,193, 182,669 and 99,977 to stockholders deficit, respectively. The fair value of the Working Capital
Loan as of December 31, 2022 was 421,900, which resulted in a change in fair value of the Working Capital Loan of 341,057 recorded in
the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

On July 7, 2022, our
stockholders approved the First Extension, pursuant to which the original date by which we were required to consummate our initial business
combination was extended from July 11, 2022 to January 11, 2023. In connection with that First Extension, our stockholders then
holding 6,845,606 public shares exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds then in the trust account.
As a result, 68,488,348 (approximately 10.00 per share) was removed from the trust account to pay such holders. In connection with the
First Extension, on July 7, 2022, we issued a promissory note to the sponsor in the aggregate principal amount of up to 2,060,070,
pursuant to which the sponsor agreed to provide us with equal monthly installments of such funds, or 343,345 to be deposited into the
trust account for each month in which the date by which we were originally required to consummate our initial business combination is
extended, from July 11, 2022 until January 11, 2023. As of December 31, 2022, an aggregate of 1,373,380 had been drawn down
on the First Extension Funds and deposited into the trust account to cover the first four months of the extension.

On November 23, 2022, Near
agreed to fund the extension funds starting November 2022. Near committed to loan certain of the extension funds to us in connection with
the First Extension, and we issued the Near Extension Note, dated as of November 18, 2022, in the aggregate principal amount of up
to 686,690, to Near. The Near Extension Note relates to the final two payments of the extension funds of 343,345 each. As of December
31, 2022, an aggregate of 686,690 has been drawn down on the Near Extension Note and deposited into the trust account to cover the last
two months of the extension. 

As of January 17, 2023,
an aggregate of 2,060,070 has been drawn down on the First Extension Funds and Near Extension Note and deposited into the trust account
to cover the six months paid in connection with the First Extension. 

On January 6, 2023,
our stockholders approved the Second Extension, extending the date by which the Company must consummate its initial business combination
from January 11, 2023 to April 11, 2023 (or such earlier date as determined by the board of directors). In connection with
the Second Extension, stockholders holding 9,786,530 public shares exercised their right to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion
of the funds in the trust account. As a result, approximately 101 million (approximately 10.32 per public share) was removed from
the trust account to pay such holders and approximately 6.376 million remained in the trust account. Following redemptions, the
Company has 617,864 public shares outstanding. 

Except as otherwise disclosed
in the Near Registration Statement, no compensation of any kind, including finder s and consulting fees, will be paid by us to the
sponsor, our executive officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered prior to or in connection
with the completion of our initial business combination (including the Near Business Combination). However, these individuals will be
reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses
and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that
were made to the sponsor, officers, directors or us or our affiliates. 

We engaged Cantor as a financial
advisor in connection with the Near Business Combination and the transactions contemplated by the Near Merger Agreement and agreed to
pay a customary financial advisory fee in an amount that constitutes a market standard financial advisory fee for comparable transactions. 

After our initial business
combination (such as the Near Business Combination), members of our management team who remain with the surviving company may be paid
consulting, management or other fees from the surviving company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to stockholders, to the
extent then known. The amount of such compensation will be up to the directors of the surviving company to determine executive and director
compensation.

agreements entered into in connection with the Near Business Combination, please see Item 1. Business . 

Director Independence 

Nasdaq listing standards require
that a majority of our board of directors be independent. An independent director is defined generally as a person other
than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship which in the opinion of the
company s board of directors, would interfere with the director s exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities
of a director. Our board of directors has determined that Messrs. Rajagopalan, Rangaswami and Bailey are independent directors 
as defined in the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules. Our independent directors have regularly scheduled meetings at which
only independent directors are present.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of 

KludeIn I Acquisition Corp. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets of KludeIn I Acquisition Corp. (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related
consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit and cash flows for each of the two years in the period
ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion,
the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and
2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Explanatory Paragraph Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 1, the Company has until April 11,
2023 to complete a Business Combination or the Company will cease all operations except for the purpose of liquidating. Further, the Company s
cash and working capital as of December 31, 2022 are not sufficient to complete its planned activities for a reasonable period of time,
which is considered to be one year from the issuance date of the financial statements. These conditions raise substantial doubt about
the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We
are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

We have served as the Company s auditor since 2020.

excise
tax on certain repurchases of stock by publicly traded U.S. domestic corporations and certain U.S. domestic subsidiaries of publicly
traded foreign corporations occurring on or after January 1, 2023. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself,
not its stockholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally of the fair market value of the
shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are
permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same
taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax.

Whether and to what extent the Company would be subject to the excise tax in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote
or otherwise would depend on a number of factors, including (i) the fair market value of the redemptions and repurchases in
connection with the Business Combination, extension or otherwise, (ii) the structure of a Business Combination, (iii) the nature and
amount of any PIPE or other equity issuances in connection with a Business Combination (or otherwise issued not in
connection with a Business Combination but issued within the same taxable year of a Business Combination) and (iv) the content of
regulations and other guidance from the Treasury. In addition, because the excise tax would be payable by the Company and not by the
redeeming holder, the mechanics of any required payment of the excise tax have not been determined. The foregoing could cause a
reduction in the cash available on hand to complete a Business Combination and in the Company s ability to complete a Business
Combination.
