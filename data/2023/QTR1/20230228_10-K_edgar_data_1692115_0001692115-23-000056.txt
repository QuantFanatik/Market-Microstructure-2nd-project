 PART I 
 
 Item 1. BUSINESS 
 Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is a holding company headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada, which either on its own or together with its subsidiaries is referred to herein as the Company. Through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Southwest Gas Corporation Southwest or the natural gas distribution segment), Centuri Group, Inc. Centuri or the utility infrastructure services segment), and prior to the closing of the MountainWest Sale (as defined below) on February 14, 2023, MountainWest Pipelines Holding Company MountainWest, or the pipeline and storage segment), the Company operated three business segments: natural gas distribution operations, utility infrastructure services, and pipeline and storage. Following the sale of MountainWest, the Company operates two business segments. Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. is incorporated in Delaware and Southwest Gas Corporation is incorporated in California. 
 In December 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors (the Board unanimously determined to take strategic actions to simplify the Company s portfolio of businesses. These actions included entering into a definitive agreement to sell all of the equity interests in MountainWest in an all-cash transaction to Williams Partners Operating LLC Williams for 1.5 billion in total enterprise value, subject to certain adjustments (collectively, the MountainWest Sale ). Additionally, the Company determined it will pursue a spin-off of Centuri Centuri Spin-Off to form a new independent publicly traded utility infrastructure services company. The Centuri Spin-Off together with the MountainWest Sale reflect the Separation Transactions. As indicated above, the MountainWest Sale closed on February 14, 2023. As such, limited information with respect to MountainWest is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Centuri Spin-Off is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2023 or the first quarter of 2024 and to be tax free to the Company and its stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Centuri Spin-Off will be subject to, among other things, finalization of the transaction structure, final approval by the Board, approval by the Arizona Corporation Commission (the ACC ), the receipt of a favorable Internal Revenue Service private letter ruling relating to the tax-free nature of the transaction, and the effectiveness of a registration statement that will be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). 
 Southwest and its subsidiaries provide regulated natural gas delivery services to customers in portions of Arizona, Nevada, and California. Public utility rates, practices, facilities, and service territories of Southwest are subject to regulatory oversight. The timing and amount of rate relief can materially impact results of operations. Natural gas purchases and the timing of related recoveries can materially impact liquidity. Results for the natural gas distribution segment are higher during winter periods due to the seasonality incorporated in its regulatory rate structures. 
 MountainWest, which was part of our operations in 2022, but sold in February 2023, owns and operates over 2,000 miles of highly contracted regulated interstate natural gas pipelines and storage facilities in the Rocky Mountain region, providing service in Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado, with non-regulated businesses primarily providing analytical and measurement services, and natural gas gathering. MountainWest s primary operations are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the FERC ), including regulated plant, tariff rates, and services performed. MountainWest s revenues are primarily derived from reservation charges for firm transportation and storage services as provided for in their FERC-approved tariffs. The profitability of MountainWest s primary pipeline businesses is dependent on its ability, through the rates it is permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable return on its capital investments. Variability in earnings results from changes in operating and maintenance expenditures, as well as changes in rates and the demand for services, which are dependent on weather, changes in commodity prices, and the economy. This variability is separate from that which relates to strategic events, such as post-2021 acquisition integration costs or losses/impairment upon being reclassified as held for sale during the fourth quarter of 2022. 
 Centuri is a strategic utility infrastructure services company dedicated to partnering with North America s electric and gas providers to build and maintain the energy network that powers millions of homes across the United States U.S. and 
 1 

Canada. Centuri s skilled workforce delivers a comprehensive and integrated array of solutions through its primary operating companies: NPL Construction Co. NPL ), NPL Canada Ltd. NPL Canada ), New England Utility Constructors, Inc. Neuco ), Linetec Services, LLC Linetec ), and Riggs Distler Company, Inc. Riggs Distler ). Centuri has strategically expanded its geographic reach and service offerings through organic and inorganic growth to better meet diverse customer needs across both electric and gas infrastructure, including growing customer attention to achieving environmental objectives. Utility infrastructure services activity is seasonal in most of Centuri s operating areas. Peak periods are the summer and fall months in colder climate areas, such as the northeastern and midwestern U.S. and in Canada. In warmer climate areas, such as the southwestern and southeastern U.S., utility infrastructure services activity continues year round. The availability of customer-provided materials, input costs, nature of specific customer contracts, and timing of incorporation of costs in change orders, if at all, can materially impact results. 
 Financial information concerning the Company s business segments is included in Note 13 - Segment Information of the notes to consolidated financial statements, which is included in the 2022 Annual Report to Stockholders and incorporated herein by reference.

NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION 
 
 General Description 
 Southwest is subject to regulation by the ACC, the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada (the PUCN ), and the California Public Utilities Commission (the CPUC ). These commissions regulate public utility rates, practices, facilities, and service territories in their respective states. The CPUC also regulates the issuance of all debt securities by Southwest, with the exception of short-term borrowings. Certain accounting practices, transmission facilities, and rates are subject to regulation by the FERC. Centuri, by contrast, is not rate regulated by the state utilities commissions or by the FERC in any of its operating areas. 
 As of December 31, 2022, Southwest purchased and distributed or transported natural gas to 2,197,000 residential, commercial, and industrial customers in geographically diverse portions of Arizona, Nevada, and California. Southwest added 41,000 new customers during 2022. 
 The table below lists the percentage of operating margin (operating revenues less net cost of gas) by major customer class for the years indicated: 
 Distribution For the Year Ended December 31, Residential and 
 Small Commercial 
 Other Sales 
 Customers 
 Transportation 2022 85 4 11 2021 85 4 11 2020 85 3 12 
 Southwest is not dependent on any one or a few customers such that the loss of any one or several would have a significant adverse impact on earnings or cash flows. 
 Transportation of customer-secured gas to end-users accounted for 42 of total system throughput in 2022, but represents only 11 of operating margin as shown in the table above. Customers who utilized this service transported 93 million dekatherms in 2022, 95 million dekatherms in 2021, and 98 million dekatherms in 2020. 
 The demand for natural gas is seasonal, with greater demand in the colder winter months and decreased demand in the warmer summer months. It is the opinion of management that comparisons of earnings for interim periods do not reliably reflect overall trends and changes in operations due to this seasonality. The decoupled rate mechanisms in place in the three state service territories, as described below, are structured with seasonal variations. Also, earnings for interim, or any, periods can be significantly affected by the timing of general rate relief. 
 
 Rates and Regulation 
 Rates that Southwest is authorized to charge its distribution system customers are determined by the ACC, PUCN, and CPUC in general rate cases and are derived using rate base, cost of service, and cost of capital experienced in an historical test year, as adjusted in Arizona and Nevada, and projected for a future test year in California. The FERC regulates the northern Nevada transmission and liquefied natural gas LNG storage facilities of Great Basin Gas Transmission Company Great Basin ), a wholly owned subsidiary, and the rates it charges for transportation of gas directly to certain end-users and to various local distribution companies LDCs ). The LDCs transporting on the Great Basin system are: NV Energy (serving Reno and Sparks, Nevada) and Southwest (serving Truckee, South and North Lake Tahoe in California, and various locations throughout northern Nevada). 
 Rates charged to customers vary according to customer class and rate jurisdiction and are set at levels that are intended to allow for the recovery of all commission-approved costs, including a return on rate base sufficient to pay interest on debt as well as a reasonable return on common equity. Rate base consists generally of the original cost of utility plant in service, net of amounts associated with costs borne by third parties, plus certain other assets such as working capital and inventories, less accumulated depreciation on utility plant in service, net deferred income tax liabilities, and certain other deductions. 
 Rate structures in all service territories allow Southwest to separate or decouple the recovery of operating margin from natural gas consumption, though decoupled structures (alternative revenue programs) vary by state. In California, authorized operating margin levels vary by month. In Nevada and Arizona, the decoupled rate structures apply to most customer classes on the basis of margin per customer, which varies by month. Collectively, these mechanisms provide stability in annual operating margin. 
 Rate schedules in all service areas contain deferred energy or purchased gas adjustment provisions, which allow Southwest to file for rate adjustments as the cost of purchased gas changes. Deferred energy and purchased gas adjustment (collectively PGA rate changes affect cash flows, but have no direct impact on profit margin. Filings to change rates in accordance with PGA clauses are subject to audit by the appropriate state regulatory commission staff.

 Demand for Natural Gas 
 Deliveries of natural gas by Southwest are made under a priority system established by state regulatory commissions. The priority system is intended to ensure that the gas requirements of higher-priority customers, primarily residential customers and other customers who use 500 therms or less of gas per day, are fully satisfied on a daily basis before lower-priority customers, primarily electric utility and large industrial customers able to use alternative fuels, are provided any quantity of gas or capacity. 
 Demand for natural gas is greatly affected by temperature. On cold days, use of gas by residential and commercial customers can be as much as seven times greater than on warm days because of increased use of gas for space heating. To fully satisfy this increased high-priority demand, gas is withdrawn from storage in certain service areas, or peaking supplies are purchased from suppliers. If necessary, service to interruptible lower-priority customers may be curtailed to provide the needed delivery system capacity. Southwest maintains no significant backlog on its orders for gas service. 
 Natural Gas Supply 
 Southwest is responsible for acquiring and arranging delivery of natural gas to its system in sufficient quantities to meet its sales customers needs. Southwest s primary natural gas procurement objective is to ensure that adequate supplies of natural gas are available at a reasonable cost. Southwest acquires natural gas from a wide variety of sources with a mix of purchase provisions, which includes spot market and firm supplies. The purchases may have terms from one day to several years and utilize both fixed and indexed pricing. During 2022, Southwest acquired natural gas from 36 suppliers. Southwest regularly monitors the number of suppliers, their performance, and their relative contribution to the overall customer supply portfolio. New suppliers are contracted when possible, and solicitations for supplies are extended to the largest practicable list of suppliers, taking into account each supplier s creditworthiness. Competitive pricing, flexibility in meeting Southwest s requirements, and demonstrated reliability of service are instrumental to any one supplier s inclusion in Southwest s portfolio. The goal of this practice is to mitigate the risk of nonperformance by any one supplier and ensure competitive prices in the portfolio. 
 Balancing reliability with supply cost results in a continually changing mix of purchase provisions within the supply portfolios. To address the unique requirements of its various market areas, Southwest assembles and administers a separate natural gas supply portfolio for each of its jurisdictional areas. Southwest facilitates most natural gas purchases through competitive bid processes. 
 To mitigate customer exposure to short-term market price volatility, during 2022 Southwest sought to fix the price on a portion of its forecasted annual normal-weather volume requirement (up t o 25 in the California jurisdiction and to a limited extent, in the Arizona jurisdiction), primarily using firm, fixed-price purchasing arran gements that are secured periodically throughout the year. Southwest s price volatility mitigation program previously included the use of financial derivatives, in the form of fixed-for-floating-index-price swaps combined with indexed-price physical purchases, to secure a portion of the fixed-price portfolio, most recently, for the Arizona rate jurisdiction. The combination of fixed-price contracts and financial derivatives was designed to increase flexibility for Southwest and increase supplier diversification. The cost of such financial derivatives combined with the associated indexed-price physical purchases has been recoverable from customers through the PGA mechanism. For periods beyond October 2020, Southwest has not and does not plan at this time to make fixed-price term purchases broadly in other than California (as set forth above), nor engage in swap transactions for any of its territories. 
 For the 2022/2023 heating season, firm fixed-price physical commodity purchases ranged from approximate ly 4.59 to approximately 9.89 per dekatherm. Southwest makes natural gas purchases, not covered by firm fixed-price contracts, under variable-price contracts with firm quantities or on the spot market. Prices for these contracts are determined at the beginning of 
 4 

each month to reflect that month s published first-of-month index price or based on a published daily price index. These monthly or daily index prices are not published or known until the purchase period begins. 
 The baseload firm natural gas supply arrangements are structured such that Southwest must nominate a stated volume of natural gas and the supplier must confirm that nomination. Contracts provide for fixed or market-based penalties to be paid by the non-performing party. 
 Storage availability may influence the average annual price of natural gas, as storage may allow a company to purchase natural gas quantities during the off-peak season and store it for use in high demand periods when prices may be greater or supplies/capacity, tighter. Dependent upon the rate jurisdiction, Southwest has some access to storage services, but overall there are small quantities of storage services available for Southwest s use. For available storage services, Southwest purchases natural gas for injection during the off-peak period for use in the high demand months; however, since storage is limited, its impact is also limited in regard to Southwest s annual average price of natural gas. Additionally, Southwest utilizes most available storage services for operational purposes to meet customer demand and not for economic purposes. This also limits the influence the available storage services have on Southwest s average annual price of natural gas. 
 Southwest currently has no market area storage service availability in its southern Nevada rate jurisdiction; however, in 2022, Southwest began receiving supply area storage services from Spire Storage West that will likely be used for the southern Nevada rate jurisdiction but could also be used to service the northern Nevada or northern California rate jurisdictions, as described below. Southwest generally has limited market area storage services availability for the southern and northern California, northern Nevada, and Arizona rate jurisdictions. The following summarizes Southwest s access to storage services for those rate jurisdictions. 
 Southwest has a storage services contract with Southern California Gas Company for use only within Southwest s southern California rate jurisdiction. 
 Southwest contracts for storage services from Great Basin s above-ground LNG facility. This storage service generally provides vaporization and injection, as well as peaking capability only for the northern Nevada and northern California rate jurisdictions. 
 Southwest also has interruptible st orage contracts with Northwest Pipeline Corporation NWPL for the northern Nevada and northern California rate jurisdictions. NWPL has the discretion to limit Southwest s ability to inject or withdraw from this interruptible storage, which consequently limits Southwest s use of this interruptible storage capacity. As such, this storage provides limited operational flexibility to adjust daily flowing supplies to meet demand. 
 For the Arizona rate jurisdiction, Southwest operate s a 233,000 dekatherm above-ground LNG facility in southern Arizona. This facility is intended to enhance service reliability and flexibility in natural gas deliveries in the area by providing a local storage option that is operated by Southwest and connected directly to its distribution system. 
 Natural gas supplies for Southwest s southern system (Arizona, southern Nevada, and southern California properties) are primarily obtained from producing regions in Colorado and New Mexico (San Juan basin), Texas (Permian basin), and Rocky Mountain areas. For its northern system (northern Nevada and northern California properties), Southwest primarily obtains natural gas from Rocky Mountain producing areas and from Canada. 
 The landscape for national natural gas supply is continuously changing, including impacts related to governmental policies. Advanced drilling techniques continue to provide access to abundant and sustainable natural gas supplies. The natural gas market has responded to the abundant supply of natural gas at prices that are competitive with other forms of energy; however, the market price of natural gas has spiked in recent periods as a result of numerous market forces, including historically low storage levels, upstream maintenance events, and cold weather conditions across the central United States in December 2022 and regional pricing dislocation on the west coast in January 2023. In early 2021, winter storms in the central U.S. also led to unprecedented price spikes over a number of days. As a result of this increase in pricing, Southwest has undertaken incremental borrowing in order to fund the higher cost, including recently, when it entered into a million term loan in January 2023 in order to fund increased supply costs. Southwest may be required to incur additional indebtedness in connection with future spikes in natural gas prices as a result of extreme weather events, or otherwise. Forecasts show that an ample and diverse natural gas supply continues to be available to Southwest s customers at a competitive price when compared to competing energy forms. 
 Southwest arranges for transportation of natural gas to its Arizona, Nevada, and California service territories through the pipeline systems of El Paso Natural Gas Company El Paso ), Kern River Gas Transmission Company Kern River ), Transwestern Pipeline Company Transwestern ), NWPL, Tuscarora Gas Pipeline Company Tuscarora ), Southern California Gas Company, Great Basin, and Ruby Pipeline LLC Ruby ), costs for which are recovered from Southwest s customers through the PGA mechanism. Southwest regularly monitors short- and long-term supply and pipeline capacity availability to ensure the reliability of service to its customers. Southwest currently receives firm transportation service, both on a short- and long-term basis, for all its service territories on the pipeline systems noted above. Southwest also contracts for firm natural gas supplies that are delivered to Southwest s city gates to supplement its firm capacity on the interstate pipelines and to 
 5 

meet projected peak-day demands. Southwest could also utilize its interruptible contracts on the interstate pipelines for the transportation of additional natural gas supplies. 
 Southwest believes that the current levels of contracted firm interstate capacity and delivered purchases are sufficient to serve each of its service territories forecasted peak-day requirements. As the need arises to acquire additional capacity on one of the interstate pipeline transmission systems and to secure additional supply, primarily due to customer growth, Southwest will continue to consider available options to obtain that capacity (either through the use of firm contracts with a pipeline company or by purchasing capacity on the open market), and will also consider options for the purchase of additional firm delivered natural gas supplies. 
 
 Competition 
 Electric utilities are the principal competitors of Southwest for the residential and small commercial markets throughout its service areas. Competition for space heating, general household, and small commercial energy needs generally occurs at the initial installation phase when the customer/builder typically makes the decision as to which type of equipment to install and operate. The customer will generally continue to use the chosen energy source for the life of the equipment. Southwest interfaces directly with the various home builders and commercial property developers in its service territories to ensure that natural gas appliances are considered in new developments and commercial centers. As a result of its efforts, Southwest has continued to experience growth in the new construction market among residential and small commercial customer classes. In 2022 , Southwest provided natural gas to a large majority of the new homes constructed during the year in the major metropolitan markets composing our service territories. 
 Certain large commercial, industrial, and electric generation customers have the capability to switch to alternative energy sources. To date, Southwest has been successful in retaining most of these customers by setting rates (subject to conditions of the respective state tariffs) at levels competitive with commercially available alternative energy sources such as electricity and fuel oils. However, high natural gas prices or policies surrounding electrification could impact Southwest s ability to retain some of these customers. Reducing fossil fuel use has gained momentum in governmental policy overall in recent years. Southwest has taken steps to align with these efforts by supporting energy efficiency in our jurisdictions, being part of greenhouse gas protocols and initiatives in California, partnering on hydrogen blending innovation, and creating new biogas and renewable natural gas RNG tariff schedules in Arizona, California, and Nevada. See also Environmental Matters below. While certain forms of renewable energy initiatives compete with natural gas, the abundance, low cost, resiliency, and reliability of natural gas, as well as the convenience and comfort it provides to our customers, result in competitive advantages across our portfolio of customers. Overall, management does not anticipate any material adverse impact on operating margin from fuel switching or alternative energy initiatives over the near term. 
 Southwest competes with interstate transmission pipeline companies, such as El Paso, Kern River, Transwestern, Tuscarora, and Ruby to provide service to certain large end-users. End-use customers located in proximity to these interstate pipelines pose a potential bypass threat. Southwest closely monitors each customer situation and provides competitive service in order to retain the customer. Southwest has remained competitive through the use of negotiated transportation contract rates (subject to conditions of the respective state tariffs), special long-term contracts with electric generation and cogeneration customers, and other tariff programs. These competitive response initiatives have mitigated the loss of operating margin earned from large customers. 
 
 Environmental Matters 
 Federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment have a direct impact upon Southwest. Environmental efforts, with respect to matters such as storm water management, emissions of air pollutants, hazardous material management, and protection of endangered species and archaeological resources, directly impact the complexity and time required to obtain pipeline rights-of-way and construction permits. There have also been a number of federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives proposed in recent years in an attempt to control or limit the effects of global warming and overall climate change, including greenhouse gas emissions GHGs ), such as methane. The adoption of this type of legislation by Congress or similar legislation by state governments mandating a substantial reduction in GHGs, or decarbonization generally, could have significant impacts on the energy industry in the future. Such new legislation or regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions on our business, affect the demand for natural gas, or impact the prices we charge our customers. At this time, we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws or regulations, if adopted, on our future business, financial condition, or results. However, increased environmental legislation and regulation can also be beneficial to the natural gas industry. Natural gas is more environmentally friendly than many other fuels currently available and its use can help energy users comply with stricter environmental air quality standards. While transportation is typically cited as the leading source of carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S., natural gas for residential consumption/use is cited as accounting for less than 6 of total U.S. GHG emissions.

Southwest remains committed to providing customers with safe, reliable, sustainable, and affordable natural gas service and continues to work with policy makers and regulators to support and adopt renewable initiatives and expanded use of RNG and compressed natural gas CNG as a transportation fuel. Additionally, Southwest is investigating blending hydrogen into its gas supply. Southwest is not only supporting a regional transportation customer in Nevada with its fleet s RNG and CNG needs, but Southwest also received favorable cost recovery regarding the conversion of part of its own vehicle fleet to CNG, in support of the state s GHG emission reduction goals. In recent years, regulatory activity in Arizona, California, and Nevada led to provisions allowing for the development of RNG projects. In addition, proposals were previously made in all three states to allow Southwest to purchase RNG as part of its gas supply portfolio; in the California and Nevada jurisdictions, those proposals have been accepted by regulators or legislative bodies. 
 The United States Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA and State of California Environmental Protection Agency (the Cal/EPA regulations require the reporting of GHGs from large sources and suppliers in order to facilitate the development of policies and programs to reduce GHGs. Southwest reports required information to the EPA and Cal/EPA under respective rules, including the volumes of natural gas that it receives for distribution to LDC customers, and the GHG emissions that result from the operation of its LDC pipelines. 
 California legislation and regulations promulgated by the California Air Resources Board (the CARB require Southwest to comply with the California GHG Emissions Reporting Program and the California Cap and Trade Program, which play an important role in the state s goal of reducing GHG em issions to 40 below 1990 levels by 2030. Southwest must report annual GHGs each year. The CARB annually allocates to Southwest a certain number of allowances based on Southwest s reported 2011 GHGs. Of those allocated allowances, Southwest must consign a certain percentage to the CARB for auction. Southwest can use any allocated allowances that remain after consignment, along with allowances it can purchase through CARB auctions or reserve sales, or through over the counter OTC purchases with other market participants, to meet its compliance obligations. 
 As part of this program, there are ongoing three-year compliance periods established. The current compliance period ends in 2023. Southwest successfully met its earlier compliance obligations by surrendering a sufficient number of allowances prior to the required date, the most recent of which was November 1, 2021. Southwest will meet the 2023 compliance obligation by surrendering a sufficient number of allowances prior to November 1, 2024, or may surrender carbon offsets to meet a portion of the 2023 compliance obligation. In 2022, Southwest purchased carbon offsets that will partially meet the 2023 compliance obligation. Carbon offsets can only be used to satisfy a portion of the 2023 compliance obligation, and those combined with ongoing allowance purchases will support compliance years through 2023. The CPUC previously issued a decision that provides for the regulatory treatment of the program costs. The decision also implemented the California Climate Credit in October 2018, representing a return of auction proceeds, which is updated annually each April. There is no expected direct impact on earnings. 
 
 UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES 
 Centuri is a strategic utility infrastructure services company dedicated to partnering with North America s gas and electric providers to build and maintain the energy network that powers millions of homes across the U.S. and Canada. Centuri s skilled workforce delivers a comprehensive and integrated array of solutions through its operating companies. Centuri derives revenue primarily from installation, replacement, repair, and maintenance of energy networks. The primary focus of Centuri operations is the replacement of natural gas distribution pipelines and electric service lines, as well as new infrastructure installations. Centuri has formalized a service offering for emergency utility system restoration services to bring customers above-ground utility infrastructure back online following regional storms and other extreme weather events. Utility infrastructure services work varies from relatively small projects to the installation of infrastructure for entire residential communities or business parks. Centuri seeks to build long-term relationships with customers to meet their needs across geographies and across both gas and electric infrastructure. Utility infrastructure services activity is seasonal in many of Centuri s operating areas. Peak periods are the summer and fall months in colder climate areas, such as the northeastern and midwestern U.S. and Canada. In warmer climate areas, such as the southwestern and southeastern U.S., utility infrastructure services activity typically continues year round. 
 During recent years, various factors resulted in an increase in large multi-year utility system replacement programs and expanded protocols. The U.S. Energy Policy Act of 2005 established mandatory electric grid reliability standards and incentivized investments in transmission and distribution systems. The U.S. Department of Transportation s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration PHMSA instituted Distribution Integrity Management Programs DIMP effective February 2010, which required operators of gas distribution pipelines to develop and implement integrity management programs to enhance safety by identifying and reducing pipeline integrity risks. FERC Order No. 1000, issued in July 2011, established transmission planning requirements to encourage development of electric transmission infrastructure projects. In 2020, PHMSA issued its final Mega Rule, including requirements for reconfirming transmission pipeline maximum allowable operating pressure and verification of pipeline materials, in addition to expanding assessments and requirements for work in moderate consequence areas, among other things. Then, in March 2022, and August 2022, PHMSA issued rules

amending federal pipeline safety regulations applicable to valve installation and minimum rupture detection standards for transmission pipelines, and amendments applicable to transmission pipeline integrity management, effective in October 2022 and May 2023, respectively. Likewise, there has been significant attention placed on electric grid modernization through national infrastructure legislation and related initiatives. The recently passed Inflation Reduction Act includes a number of provisions to accelerate the deployment of clean energy technologies, including incentives for the buildout of necessary infrastructure. The Department of Energy estimates more than 70 of the nation s grid transmission lines and power transformers are over 25 years old, creating vulnerability exacerbated by seasonal storm and extreme weather events. Centuri s services also support customers environmental goals, such as reducing methane emissions from pipeline leaks through pipe repair and replacement. Centuri is well positioned to support growing customer attention in achieving environmental objectives through infrastructure construction and maintenance. Additionally, Centuri s acquisition of Riggs Distler in 2021 positions Centuri to benefit from the necessary development of onshore infrastructure to support offshore wind and power development. 
 Centuri s contract terms with utility customers generally specify unit-price or time-and-materials T M terms under master service agreements, and occasionally, fixed-price arrangements for bid work. Unit-price contracts establish prices for all of the various services to be performed during the contract period. These contracts often have annual pricing reviews that provide an opportunity for Centuri to reflect anticipated increases in labor costs. Centuri customers supply materials required for building and maintenance services under the majority of Centuri s contracts, and thus, increased costs of materials generally do not present a direct material risk to Centuri. During 2022, approximately 82 of revenue was earned under unit-price and T M contracts. Storm restoration services are often contracted under T M rates and generally involve a higher number of hours worked per day given the emergency response nature of the work performed. Backlog represents the dollar amount of revenue Centuri expects to recognize in the future from contracts awarded and in progress as of the end of the reporting period. Reported backlog differs from the concept of remaining performance obligations as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. U.S. GAAP and is not a measure of contract profitability. As of December 31, 2022, backlog of approximately 441 million existed with respect to outstanding fixed-priced contracts. Centuri maintains an average customer relationship tenure of more than 20 years, supported by its unwavering commitments to safety, quality, community engagement, and workforce development. 
 Materials used by Centuri in its utility infrastructure service activities are typically specified, purchased, and supplied by Centuri s customers. Contracts with customers also contain provisions which make customers generally liable for remediating environmental hazards encountered during the construction process. Such hazards might include digging in an area that was contaminated prior to construction, finding endangered animals, digging in historically significant sites, etc. Otherwise, Centuri s operations have limited environmental impact (dust control, normal waste disposal, handling harmful materials, etc.). 
 Competition within the industry has traditionally been limited to several regional and numerous local competitors in what has been a largely fragmented industry. Some national competitors also exist within the industry. Centuri operates in over 73 primary locations across 45 states and provinces in the U.S. and Canada, with its corporate headquarters located in Phoenix, Arizona. During 2022, Centuri served over 400 customers. Southwest accounted for approximately 5 of total revenue. Two additional customers accounted for approximately 18 of total revenue. No other customers individually accounted for 5 or more of total revenue. 
 Centuri is not directly affected by regulations promulgated by the ACC, PUCN, CPUC, or FERC. Centuri is an unregulated subsidiary of the Company. However, because Centuri performs work for Southwest, its associated costs are subject indirectly to prudency reviews like any other capital work performed by third parties or directly by Southwest. However, these reviews do not bring Centuri under the regulatory jurisdiction of any of the commissions noted above. 
 
 PIPELINE AND STORAGE 
 As described above, on February 14, 2023, the Company completed the sale of all of the equity interests in MountainWest. MountainWest s operations are comprised of over 2,000 miles of highly-contracted FERC-regulated interstate natural gas pipelines providing transportation and underground storage services in Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado. MountainWest includes two wholly owned, FERC-regulated businesses (referred to herein as MountainWest Pipeline and MountainWest Overthrust Pipeline), and another FERC-regulated pipeline held as a 50 interest in White River Hub WRH ). WRH is a variable interest entity of which MountainWest is not the primary beneficiary; therefore, WRH is not consolidated with MountainWest and is, instead, accounted for under the equity method of accounting. 
 Collectively, MountainWest has fewer than one hundred customers, which include storage customers, marketers, end-users, power generators, or utilities. The two largest customers comprise nearly half of their expected revenues. 
 MountainWest s operations are primarily in the midstream, including 56 billion cubic feet Bcf of storage capacity that has, in the recent past, been at or near full contracting.

HUMAN CAPITAL 
 Throughout our collective operations, employees are critical to our success. Their talent and dedication are what allows us to provide safe and reliable service to customers and explore new opportunities that align with our strategies, while carrying out organizational core values related to safety, quality, and stewardship, among others. The Board oversees matters relating to our vision, values, and culture where employee health and safety; diversity, equity, and inclusion; and human and workplace rights are priorities. The Board receives regular reports from management and subject matter experts in these areas, and in turn provides guidance on current and future initiatives. The Board also assists management in integrating responsibility and sustainability into strategic activities to create long-term customer and shareholder value. 
 Our Company and the Board are committed to a culture of continuous improvement over the safety of our employees and the communities we serve every day. Employees and contract workers receive initial safety orientation training to learn practices, procedures, and policies established by our businesses. New and recurring safety training occurs at regular intervals thereafter. Frontline safety strategies, developed with executive leadership, contribute to the improvement of our safety management systems. Safety metrics also form part of incentive compensation programs for leaders of all the Company s business segments, reinforcing our top priority to safeguard our communities, our employees, and our assets. At Southwest, such metrics include Damages per 1,000 Tickets and Incident Response Time; at Centuri, they include Total Recordable Incident Rate and Days Away/Restricted/Transferred DART ). In each case, the measures are widely used in the respective industries comprising our businesses. All segments maintain additional behavioral-based programs and extensive employee training initiatives to promote safe work. 
 At December 31, 2022, Southwest had 2,351 regular full-time equivalent employees. Southwest believes that a skilled, highly trained workforce is a key to success in the utility industry, and a driver of Southwest s safety performance and high customer satisfaction ratings. Southwest believes it has a good relationship with its employees and that compensation, benefits, and working conditions are comparable to those generally found in the utility industry. In recent years, employee engagement surveys have been deployed to gauge the extent to which employees feel connected and valued. Flexible working arrangements are available to employees, which support work-life balance. No Southwest employees are represented by a labor union. A stable workforce has been important to knowledge transfer and succession processes, with the average tenure of Southwest employees being approximately 11 years. Germane to attracting and retaining employees are our compensation and benefits programs, which are regularly reviewed. For employees hired on or before December 31, 2021, Southwest offers an employee pension and employer matching contributions to the employee defined contribution plan. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2022 do not participate in the employee pension plan, but receive non-elective employer contributions and increased employer matching contributions to the employee defined contribution plan. The health and wellness of our workforce are supported by group insurance programs, incentive programs in support of total health, and related employee programs. Southwest also offers a tuition assistance program. Regular succession planning helps ensure that talent is identified, and existing and prospective leaders are developed in order to build their skills and be prepared for future roles. 
 At December 31, 2022, Centuri had 11,008 regular full-time equivalent employees working in over 45 states and provinces throughout the U.S. and Canada. Employee counts fluctuate between seasonal periods, normally heaviest in the summer and fall. Typical of the segment s industry, a majority of Centuri employees are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements. Centuri maintains a market-based total rewards strategy to attract, retain, motivate, and develop employees. Additionally, Centuri has a scholarship program, which awards more than half of the grants to minority students who are dependents of Centuri employees. Similar employee engagement and succession planning protocols to those existing at Southwest are deployed at Centuri. 
 As of December 31, 2022, MountainWest had 255 full-time employees across Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado. MountainWest is comprised of a highly skilled workforce which provides gas transportation and underground storage services in the midstream space. MountainWest does not have a unionized workforce. The MountainWest workforce transferred with the business as part of the sale to Williams in February 2023. Upon close, the Company is to provide certain services to Williams under a transition services agreement for a brief period, generally not beyond six months. 
 Collectively, we embrace a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion to not only protect employees under laws designed to do so regardless of protected status, but to reinforce the value that diversity brings to the workplace. We strive to have a workforce that reflects the communities we serve, and engage experts from time to time to update management on the trends and benefits of diverse backgrounds, cultures, and perspectives. Our belief is that adherence to these principles forms the genesis of a workforce that is both diverse and inclusive. Southwest and Centuri have several programs, including employee resource groups, diversity councils, a diversity ambassadors (champions) network, educational outreach programs, and other initiatives designed to attract and retain a diverse workforce. We commit to creating a safe and respectful workplace by encouraging employees to value diversity through unconscious bias training, and by inviting them to engage in meaningful conversations about diversity, equity, and inclusion topics. Through these and other efforts, we place value in our people and nurture their development, while ensuring that all employees have an equitable opportunity for success.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 Described below (and in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk of this report) are risk factors that we have identified that may have a negative impact on our future financial performance or affect whether we achieve the goals or expectations expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements contained herein. References below to we, us, and our should be read to refer to Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. and any combination of its subsidiaries, including Southwest Gas Corporation and Centuri Group, Inc. 
 Operational Risks 
 Southwest relies on having access to interstate pipelines transportation capacity. If these pipelines and related transportation capacity were not available, it could impact Southwest s ability to meet customers full requirements. 
 Southwest must acquire both sufficient natural gas supplies and interstate pipeline capacity to meet customer requirements. We must contract for reliable and adequate delivery capacity for our distribution system, while considering the dynamics of the interstate pipeline capacity market, our own on-system resources, as well as the characteristics of our customer base. Interruptions to or reductions of interstate pipeline service caused by physical constraints, excessive customer usage, or other force majeure could reduce our normal supply of gas. Restrictions placed on pipelines or the extractive and mid-stream industries could disrupt our business and reduce cash flows and earnings. A prolonged interruption or reduction of interstate pipeline service or availability of natural gas in any of our jurisdictions, particularly during the winter heating season, would reduce cash flow and earnings. 
 Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified employee workforce could adversely affect our collective operations. 
 Our ability to implement our business strategy and serve our customers is dependent upon our continuing ability to attract and retain talented professionals and a technically skilled workforce, and impacts our ability to transfer the knowledge and expertise of our workforce to new employees as our aging employees retire. Failure to attract, hire, and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor could adversely affect our ability to manage and operate our business. 
 In particular, the productivity of Centuri s labor force and its ongoing relationship with clients is largely dependent on those serving in foreman, general foreman, regional, and executive level management positions. The ability to retain these individuals, due in large part to the competitive nature of the utility infrastructure service business, is necessary for the ongoing success and growth of Centuri. Further, the competitive environment within which Centuri performs work creates pricing pressures, specifically when its unionized business segment is bidding against non-union competitors. This workforce competition, including that which exists for resources across our businesses, could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Loss of one or more significant customers at Centuri could adversely affect results. 
 During 2022, over half of utility infrastructure services revenues were generated from ten customers. This concentration of risk could impact operating results if construction work slowed or halted with one or more of these customers, if competition for work increased, or if existing contracts were not replaced or extended. 
 Certain of our costs, such as operating expenses (including labor, fuel, and materials) at Southwest and Centuri, and interest and general and administrative expenses at both segments and the Company could be adversely impacted by periods of heightened inflation, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. 
 Throughout 2022, the consumer price index increased substantially and may continue to remain at elevated levels for an extended period of time. Federal policies and recent global events, such as the volatility in prices of oil and natural gas, and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, may have exacerbated, and may continue to exacerbate, increases in the consumer price index. In addition, during periods of rising inflation, variable interest rates and the interest rates of any debt securities we, Southwest, or Centuri issue will likely be higher than more recent debt issuances, which will further tend to reduce returns to our stockholders. A sustained or further increase in inflation could have a material adverse impact on our operating expenses incurred in connection with, among others, the cost of natural gas supply, labor, products, and services required for operations, maintenance and capital improvements at Southwest, and fuel, labor, and materials costs at Centuri, as well as general administrative expenses for both segments. 
 With regard to Southwest, rate schedules in each of its service territories contain purchased gas adjustment clauses which permit Southwest to file for rate adjustments to recover increases in the cost of purchased gas. Increases in the cost of purchased gas have no direct impact on our profit margins but do affect cash flows and can therefore impact the amount of our capital resources. In order to help cope with the effects of inflation on its operations, Southwest may file requests for rate increases to cover the increased cost of purchased gas or other types of expenditures noted above. However, there can be no assurance that Southwest will be able to obtain adequate and timely rate relief to offset the effects of inflation and any non-recovery of costs or 
 10 

regulatory lag will reduce our cash flows and earnings. As a result, during periods in which the inflation rate exceeds the rate increases applicable to purchased gas, or other types of expenditures, we may not adequately mitigate the impact of inflation, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Additionally, inflationary pricing has had and may continue to have a negative effect on the construction costs necessary to complete projects at Centuri, particularly with respect to fuel, labor, and subcontractor costs discussed above. Centuri is experiencing pressures on fuel, materials, and certain labor costs as a result of the inflationary environment and current general labor shortage, which has resulted in increased competition for skilled labor and wage inflation. Centuri has not been able to (except in limited circumstances), and may not be able to, fully adjust its contract pricing to compensate for these cost increases, which has affected, and may continue to affect, Centuri s profitability and cash flows. Inflationary pressures and related recessionary concerns in light of governmental and central bank efforts to mitigate inflation could also cause uncertainty for Centuri s customers and affect the level of their project activity, which could also adversely affect Centuri s profitability and cash flows. Furthermore, inflationary pressures may also influence Southwest s customers in remitting payments on their utility bills, which may adversely affect Southwest s cash flows and associated reserves for uncollectible accounts in earnings. 
 As inflation persists, the Board of Governors of the United States Federal Reserve Bank has raised and has indicated that it intends to continue to raise benchmark interest rates into 2023 and 2024, which likely will cause our borrowing costs to increase over time. As a result of the inflationary factors discussed above affecting the Company, Southwest, and Centuri, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity could be adversely affected over time. 
 Fixed-price contracts at Centuri are subject to potential losses that could adversely affect results of operations. 
 Centuri enters into a variety of types of contracts customary in the underground utility construction industry. These contracts include unit-priced contracts (including unit-priced contracts with revenue caps), time and material (cost plus) contracts, and fixed-price (lump sum) contracts. Contracts with caps and fixed-price arrangements can be susceptible to constrained profits, or even losses, especially those contracts that cover an extended-duration performance period. This is due, in part, to the necessity of estimating costs far in advance of the completion date (at bid inception). Unforeseen inflation, or other costs unanticipated at inception, can detrimentally impact profitability for these types of contracts. 
 The nature of our operations presents inherent risks of loss that could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Our natural gas distribution and pipeline and storage operations are subject to inherent hazards and risks such as gas leaks, fires, natural disasters, catastrophic accidents, explosions, pipeline ruptures, and other hazards and risks that may cause unforeseen interruptions, personal injury, or property damage. Our utility infrastructure services operations are reliant on skilled personnel who are trained and qualified to install utility infrastructure under established safety protocols and operator qualification programs, and in conformance with mandated engineering design specifications. Lapses in judgment or failure to follow protocol could lead to warranty and indemnification liabilities or catastrophic accidents, causing property damage or personal injury. Additionally, our facilities, machinery, and equipment, including our pipelines, are subject to third-party damage from construction activities, vandalism, or acts of terrorism. Such incidents could result in severe business disruptions, significant decreases in revenues, and/or significant additional costs to us. Any such incident could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, earnings, and cash flows. In addition, any of these or similar events could result in legal claims against us, cause environmental pollution, personal injury or death claims, damage to our properties or the properties of others, or loss of revenue by us or others. 
 The Company maintains liability insurance that covers Southwest for some, but not all, risks associated with the operation of our natural gas pipelines and facilities, and the utility infrastructure services we provide. In connection with these liability insurance policies, each entity is responsible for an initial deductible or self-insured retention amount per incid ent, after which the insurance carriers would be responsible for amounts up to the policy limits. Liability insurance policies at Southwest require us to be responsible for the first 1 million (self-insured retention) of each incident plus the first 4 million in total claims above our self-insured retention in the policy year; while Centuri s self-insured retention amount is 750,000 per occurrence. We cannot predict the likelihood that any future event will occur which will result in a claim exceeding these amounts; however, a large claim for which we were deemed liable would reduce our earnings up to and including these self-insurance maximums. 
 Weather conditions in our operating areas can adversely affect operations, financial position, and cash flows. 
 Centuri s results of operations, financial position, and cash flows can be significantly impacted by changes in weather that affect the ability of Centuri to provide utility companies with contracted-for trenching, installation, and replacement of underground pipes, as well as maintenance services for energy distribution systems. Generally, Centuri s revenues are lowest during the first quarter of the year due to less favorable winter weather conditions. These conditions also require certain areas to scale back their workforce at times during the winter season, presenting challenges associated with maintaining an adequately skilled labor force when it comes time to re-staff its work crews following the winter layoffs. 
 Conversely, Southwest s revenues are highest during the first and fourth quarters of the year during the winter months as customer consumption increases. While Southwest has decoupling mechanisms in place in all three states in which it operates, 
 11 

warmer than normal weather can reduce the amount of billed revenue, as well as amounts collected or returned related to regulatory tracking mechanisms under various programs, thereby impacting cash flows. Weather extremes such as drought and high temperature variations are common occurrences in the southwest U.S. and could impact our growth and results of operations. Deviations from normal weather conditions, even those occurring outside of our service territories, as well as the seasonal nature of our businesses can create fluctuations in short-term cash requirements of both Southwest and Centuri, and earnings, primarily related to Centuri. For example, the market price of natural gas spiked as a result of cold weather conditions across the central United States in December 2022 and regional pricing dislocation on the west coast in January 2023. As a result of this increase in pricing, Southwest entered into a 450 million term loan in January 2023 in order to fund the incremental cost. Southwest may be required to incur additional indebtedness in connection with future spikes in natural gas prices as a result of extreme weather events. 
 A cybersecurity incident has the potential to disrupt normal business operations, expose sensitive information, and/or lead to physical damages, and may result in legal claims or damage to our reputation. 
 As a utility provider, midstream service provider, and infrastructure services provider, maintaining business operations is critical for our customers, business partners, suppliers, and our employees. A disruption in service could adversely impact our reputation, ability to provide services for our customers, and the media used to communicate and exchange information both internally and externally. 
 We process and store sensitive information, including personal identifiable information PII ), intellectual property, and business proprietary information as part of normal business operations. A cybersecurity breach of this information could expose us to monetary and other damages from customers, suppliers, business partners, government agencies, and others. The federal and state legislative and regulatory environment surrounding PII, information security, and data privacy is evolving and is likely to become increasingly demanding. For example, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, which became effective on January 1, 2020 and requires covered businesses to, among other things, provide disclosures to California consumers regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of such consumers PII and afford such consumers new rights, including the right to opt out of certain sales of PII. Additional states are also considering new laws and regulations that further protect the confidentiality, privacy, and security of personal information. Should the Company experience a breach and/or become subject to additional regulation, it could face substantial compliance costs, reputational damage, and uncertain litigation risks. 
 Physical damage due to a cybersecurity incident or acts of cyber terrorism could impact utility, transmission, storage, and related services provided to customers and could lead to material liabilities. The Company has taken the initiative in fortifying the core infrastructure that supports the provision of these services. While these measures provide layers of defense to mitigate these risks, there can be no assurance that the measures will be effective against any particular cyber attack. Even though we have insurance coverage in place for cyber-related risks, if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur, the Company s operations and financial results could be adversely affected to the extent not fully covered by such insurance. 
 Reliance on third-party suppliers and subcontractors. 
 While Centuri maintains oversight of those third-party suppliers and subcontractors it utilizes to assist with certain aspects of the work it performs for clients, any delay or failure by these parties in the completion of their portion of a given project may result in delays in the overall progress of the project or cause us to incur additional costs, thereby potentially impacting Centuri s overall profitability. Furthermore, if Centuri s relationship with its third-party suppliers and subcontractors were to be damaged, it may be difficult to replace them in a cost-effective manner. 
 Reliance on similar services, and their availability, may also impact the ability of Southwest to execute on its objectives for projects undertaken. 
 Challenges relating to current supply chain constraints have negatively impacted Centuri s work mix and volumes and could adversely impact our results of operations overall. 
 Due to increased demand across a range of industries, the global supply market for certain customer-provided components, including, but not limited to, electric transformers and gas risers needed to complete customer projects at Centuri, has experienced isolated performance constraint and disruption in recent periods in support of a few customers. This constrained supply environment has adversely affected, and could further affect, customer-provided component availability, lead times and cost, and could increase the likelihood of unexpected cancellations or delays of supply of key components to customers, thereby leading to delays in Centuri s ability to timely deliver projects to customers. In an effort to mitigate these risks, Centuri has redirected efforts to projects whereby the customer has provided necessary materials, but delays in materials and redirecting workforces can lead to inefficiencies in absorption of fixed costs, higher labor costs for teams waiting to be deployed, and delays in pivoting to projects where necessary materials are available. Centuri s efforts to adapt quickly or redeploy to other projects may fail to reduce the impact of these adverse supply chain conditions on Centuri s business. 
 Despite these mitigation efforts, the constrained supply conditions may adversely impact Centuri s revenues and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic, labor market, and conflict in Ukraine have also contributed to and exacerbated this strain

within and outside the U.S., and there can be no assurance that these impacts on the supply chain will not continue, or worsen, in the future, negatively impacting any of our business segments and their results. The current supply chain challenges could also result in increased use of cash, engineering design changes, and delays in the completion of customer or other capital projects, each of which could adversely impact our business and results of operations for Centuri or Southwest. In the event these supply chain challenges persist for the foreseeable future, these conditions could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition over an extended period. 
 Disruptions in labor relations with Centuri s employees could adversely affect results of operations. 
 The majority of Centuri s labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements with labor unions, which is typical of the utility infrastructure services industry. Labor disruptions, boycotts, strikes, or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases at Centuri, whether due to employee turnover or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on Centuri s business and results of operations and cash flows. 
 Changing and uncertain work environment and conditions at Centuri. 
 Centuri performs work in a variety of geographic locations, each presenting unique environmental, surface, and subsurface conditions. As a consequence of work being performed under change orders when unexpected conditions are encountered, Centuri periodically experiences delays relating to billing and payment under these altered conditions. 
 Risks Related to Previously Announced Strategic Transactions 
 We may encounter challenges in executing our plan to spin-off Centuri into a standalone, independent public company, or in completing this transaction within the timeframe we anticipate, and we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the Separation Transactions. 
 In December 2022, we announced the Separation Transactions in order to better position MountainWest, Centuri, and Southwest to deliver long-term growth and create value for customers, investors, and employees. The MountainWest Sale closed on February 14, 2023. The Centuri Spin-Off will be subject to the satisfaction of a number of customary conditions, including, among others, final approvals by the Board, approval by the ACC, receipt of tax rulings in certain jurisdictions and/or tax opinions from external counsel, the filing with the SEC and effectiveness of a Form 10 registration statement and satisfactory completion of financing. The failure to satisfy all of the required conditions for the Centuri Spin-Off could delay the completion of the Centuri Spin-Off for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring at all. Additionally, the Centuri Spin-Off is complex in nature, and unanticipated developments or changes may affect our ability to complete the Centuri Spin-Off as currently expected, within the anticipated timeframe or at all. These or other developments could cause us not to realize some or all of the expected benefits of the Separation Transactions, or to realize them on a different timeline than expected. If we are unable to complete the Centuri Spin-Off, we will have incurred costs without realizing the anticipated benefits of such transaction. In addition, the terms and conditions of the required regulatory authorizations and consents that are granted, if any, may impose requirements, limitations or costs, or place restrictions on the conduct of Centuri following the spin-off. Although we intend for the Centuri Spin-Off to be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes to both the Company and its stockholders, there can be no assurance that the transaction will qualify as tax-free for U.S. purposes. If the Centuri Spin-Off were ultimately determined to be taxable, we would incur a significant tax liability for which the newly independent Centuri may, depending on the circumstances, be required to indemnify us. In certain circumstances the distributions to the Company s stockholders also could become taxable. Furthermore, if the Centuri Spin-Off is completed, it cannot be assured that we and Centuri will be successful as separate companies. 
 Whether or not both Separation Transactions are completed, our business may face material challenges in connection with these transactions, including, without limitation, the diversion of management s attention from ongoing business concerns and impact on the business of the Company; maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees at Southwest and Centuri; retaining existing or attracting new business and operational relationships, including with customers, suppliers, employees, and other counterparties; and potential negative reactions from the financial markets. Each of Southwest and Centuri will also incur ongoing costs, including costs of operating as separate companies, that the separated businesses will no longer be able to share. Additionally, we cannot predict whether the market value of our common stock and the common stock of Centuri after the Centuri Spin-Off will be, in the aggregate, less than, equal to, or greater than the market value of our common stock prior to the Separation Transactions. If the Centuri Spin-Off is completed, investors holding our common stock may sell the common stock of Centuri if it does not match their investment strategies, which may cause a decline in the market price of such common stock. 
 If the Centuri Spin-Off is completed, our and Centuri s operational and financial profiles will change and each will be a less diversified company than Southwest Gas Holdings as it exists today. 
 The Centuri Spin-Off will result in us and Centuri being less diversified companies with more limited businesses concentrated in their respective industries. As a result, each company may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, the diversification of 
 13 

revenues, costs, and cash flows will diminish, such that each company s results of operations, cash flows, working capital, effective tax rate, and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility and its ability to fund capital expenditures and investments, pay dividends and service debt may be diminished. It is anticipated that the effective tax rate for each separate company will differ from the Southwest Gas Holdings consolidated effective tax rate. 
 If the Centuri Spin-Off is completed, there may be changes in our stockholder base, which may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate . 
 Investors holding our common stock may hold our common stock because of a decision to invest in a company that operates in multiple markets with a diversified portfolio. If the Centuri Spin-Off is completed, shares of our common stock will represent an investment in a business concentrated in the natural gas distribution industry, and shares of the common stock of Centuri will represent an investment in the strategic utility infrastructure business. This change may not match some stockholders investment strategies, which could cause them to sell their shares of our common stock or the common stock of Centuri, and excessive selling pressure could cause the market price to decrease following the consummation of the Centuri Spin-Off. Additionally, we cannot predict whether the market value of our common stock and the common stock of Centuri after the Centuri Spin-Off will be, in the aggregate, less than, equal to, or greater than the market value of our common stock prior to the Centuri Spin-Off. 
 Our goodwill and other assets have been subject to impairment and may be subject to further impairment in the future. 
 The Company recorded a goodwill impairment loss in connection with the MountainWest Sale of 449.6 million, plus an additional loss on sale of 5.8 million for estimated costs to sell. We assess long-lived assets, including intangible assets associated with acquisitions, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that an asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable. To the extent that circumstances change, there may be additional goodwill impairment and losses on sale that could have a material impact on our results of operations. We cannot predict the amount and timing of any future impairments, if any. Any future impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets could have an adverse effect on results of operations, as well as the trading price of our common stock. 
 Financial, Economic, and Market Risks 
 As a holding company, Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. depends on operating subsidiaries to meet financial obligations. 
 Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. has no significant assets other than the stock of operating subsidiaries and is not expected to have significant operations on its own. Southwest Gas Holdings ability to pay dividends to stockholders is dependent on the ability of its subsidiaries to generate sufficient net income and cash flows to service debt and pay upstream dividends. Because of the relative size of subsidiary operations, and their relative impacts to net income and cash flows, substantial dependency on the utility operations of Southwest Gas Corporation and the infrastructure services of Centuri Group, Inc. exists. The ability of Southwest Gas Holdings subsidiaries to pay upstream dividends and make other distributions are subject to relevant debt covenant restrictions of subsidiaries and applicable state law. 
 Utility infrastructure segment clients budgetary constraints, regulatory support or decisions, and financial condition could adversely impact work awarded. 
 The majority of Centuri s clients are regulated utilities, whose capital budgets are influenced significantly by the various public utility commissions. As a result, the timing and volume of work performed by Centuri is largely dependent on the regulatory environment in its operating areas and related client capital constraints. If budgets of Centuri s clients are reduced, or regulatory support for capital projects and programs is diminished, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and cash flows. Additionally, the impact of new regulatory and compliance requirements could result in productivity inefficiencies and adversely impact Centuri s results of operations and cash flows, or timing delays in their realization. 
 Southwest s liquidity, and in certain circumstances our earnings, may be reduced from historical amounts or expectations during periods in which natural gas prices are rising significantly or are more volatile. 
 Increases in the cost of natural gas may arise from a variety of factors, including weather, changes in demand, the level of production and availability of natural gas, transportation constraints, transportation capacity cost increases, federal and state energy and environmental regulation and legislation, the degree of market liquidity, natural disasters, wars and other catastrophic events, national and worldwide economic and political conditions, the price and availability of alternative fuels, and the success of our strategies in managing price risk. 
 Rate schedules in each of Southwest s service territories contain purchased gas adjustment clauses which permit Southwest to file for rate adjustments to recover increases in the cost of purchased gas. Increases in the cost of purchased gas have no direct impact on our profit margins, but do affect cash flows and can therefore impact the amount of our capital resources. Southwest has used short-term borrowings in the past to temporarily finance increases in purchased gas costs, and we expect to do so during 2023, if the need again arises. 
 14 

Southwest may file requests for rate increases to cover the rise in the cost of purchased gas. Due to the nature of the regulatory process, there is a risk of disallowance of full recovery of these costs during any period in which there has been a substantial run-up of these costs or our costs are more volatile. Any disallowance of purchased gas costs would reduce cash flows and earnings. 
 Southwest s earnings may be materially impacted due to volatility in the cash surrender value of our company-owned life insurance policies during periods in which stock market changes are significant. 
 Southwest has life insurance policies on members of management and other key employees to indemnify ourselves against the loss of talent, expertise, and knowledge, as well as to provide indirect funding for certain nonqualified benefit plans. Cash surrender values are directly influenced by the investment portfolio underlying the insurance policies. This portfolio includes both equity and fixed income (mutual fund) investments. As a result, the cash surrender value (but not the net death benefits) moves up and down consistent with the movements in the broader stock and bond markets. Current tax regulations provide for tax-free treatment of life insurance (death benefit) proceeds. Therefore, changes in the cash surrender value components of company-owned life insurance policies, as they progress towards the ultimate death benefits, are also recorded without tax consequences. Currently, we intend to hold the company-owned life insurance policies for their duration. Changes in the cash surrender value of company-owned life insurance policies, except as related to the purchase of additional policies, affect our earnings but not our cash flows. 
 The cost of providing pension and postretirement benefits is subject to changes in pension asset values, changing demographics, and actuarial assumptions which may have an adverse effect on our financial results. 
 Southwest provides pension and postretirement benefits to eligible employees. The costs of providing such benefits are subject to changes in the market value of our pension fund assets, changing demographics, life expectancies of beneficiaries, current and future legislative changes, and various actuarial calculations and assumptions. The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, withdrawal rates, interest rates, and other factors. These differences may result in a significant impact on the amount of pension expense or other postretirement benefit costs recorded in future periods. For example, lower than assumed returns on investments and/or reductions in bond yields could result in increased contributions and higher pension expense which would have a negative impact on our cash flows and reduce net income. 
 Uncertain economic conditions may affect Southwest s ability to finance capital expenditures. 
 Southwest s business is capital intensive. Our ability to finance capital expenditures and other matters will depend upon general economic conditions in the capital markets. Declining interest rates are generally believed to be favorable to utilities while rising interest rates are believed to be unfavorable because of the high capital costs of utilities. In addition, our authorized rate of return is based upon certain assumptions regarding interest rates. If interest rates are lower than assumed rates, our authorized rate of return in the future could be reduced. If interest rates are higher than assumed rates, it will be more difficult for us to earn our currently authorized rate of return. Furthermore, declines in our stock price resulting from economic downturns or otherwise could impact our ability to finance our operations as planned. Historically, we have frequently used our at-the-market equity offering program ATM Program to fund certain liquidity requirements. During 2022, we did not use our ATM program at the same levels that we have in prior years. As a result, we have been required to find alternative sources of capital primarily through the issuance of additional debt at the Company and Southwest. We do not expect our ATM program to be sufficient to meet all of our capital needs in 2023. As a result, we will continue to explore alternative financing sources, which may not be available to us on attractive terms or at all. Future issuances of securities could be more expensive than ATM issuances and may dilute stockholders. 
 Continued increases in market interest rates may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. 
 One of the factors that investors may consider in deciding whether to buy or sell our common stock is our dividend yield, which is our dividend rate as a percentage of the share price of our common stock, relative to market interest rates. If market interest rates continue to increase, prospective investors may desire a higher dividend yield on our common stock or may seek securities paying higher dividends or interest. As a result, interest rate fluctuations and capital market conditions may affect the market price of our common stock and such effects could be significant. For instance, if interest rates rise without an increase in our dividend rate, the market price of our common stock could decrease because potential investors may require a higher dividend yield on our common stock as market rates on interest-bearing securities, such as bonds, rise. 
 Regulatory, Legislative, and Legal Risks 
 The Company is currently subject to, and may in the future be subject to, litigation or threatened litigation, which may result in liability exposure that could have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations. 
 We are currently subject to, and may be subject in the future, to litigation or threatened litigation, including claims brought by stockholders and otherwise in the ordinary course of business. In particular, we are subject to ongoing stockholder litigation 
 15 

and are subject to a risk of additional stockholder litigation in the future. Although we believe that adequate insurance coverage is maintained to protect against risk exposure, it is difficult to predict with absolute certainty the costs associated with litigation, indemnity obligations, or other claims asserted in any given year. Moreover, it is possible that not all liabilities and costs experienced will be covered by third-party insurance and potential further claims against us may result in significant additional defense costs and potentially significant judgments against us, some of which may not be, or cannot be, insured against. Additionally, whether or not any dispute actually proceeds to litigation, we may be required to pay damages or expenses, which may be significant, or involve our agreement with terms that restrict the operation of our business. Resolution of these types of matters against us may result in our having to pay significant fines, judgments, or settlements, which, if in excess of insured levels, could adversely impact our earnings and cash flows, thereby having an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and our ability to pay dividends on, and the per share trading price of, our common stock. As a consequence, liability exposure could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations to the extent it is not fully mitigated by such insurance coverage. For more information about our ongoing legal proceedings, see Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies included in the consolidated financial statements of the 2022 Annual Report to Stockholders. 
 Governmental policies and regulatory actions can reduce Southwest s earnings or cash flows. 
 Regulatory commissions set our utility customer rates and determine what we can charge for our rate-regulated services. Our ability to obtain timely future rate increases depends on regulatory discretion. Governmental policies and regulatory actions, including those of the ACC, CPUC, PUCN, and FERC relating to allowed rates of return, rate structure, purchased gas and investment recovery, operation and construction of facilities, present or prospective wholesale and retail competition including electrification or decarbonization policies or proposed policies by governmental entities or other parties, changes in tax laws and policies (including regulatory recovery or refunds thereof), and changes in and compliance with environmental and safety laws, including state or federal EPA or PHMSA regulations, and regulations placed on us or our customers regarding the product we deliver in meeting customer energy needs could reduce our earnings. Risks and uncertainties relating to delays in obtaining, or failure to obtain, regulatory approvals, conditions imposed in regulatory approvals, and determinations in regulatory investigations can also impact financial performance. The timing and amount of rate relief can materially impact results of operations. The timing and amount associated with the recovery of regulatory assets and associated with the return of regulatory liabilities can materially impact cash flows. 
 In general, we are unable to predict what types of conditions might be imposed on Southwest or what types of determinations might be made in pending or future regulatory proceedings or investigations. We nevertheless believe that it is not uncommon for conditions to be imposed in regulatory proceedings, for our regulated operations to agree to conditions as part of a settlement of a regulatory proceeding, or for determinations to be made in regulatory investigations that reduce our earnings and liquidity. For example, we may request recovery of a particular operating expense in a general rate case filing that a regulator disallows, negatively impacting our earnings if the expense continues to be incurred. Southwest records regulatory assets in the consolidated financial statements to reflect the ratemaking and regulatory decision-making authority of the regulators, or expected ratemaking treatment to be upheld, as allowed by U.S. GAAP. The creation of a regulatory asset allows for the deferral of costs which, absent a mechanism to recover such costs from customers in rates approved by regulators, would be charged to expense in the consolidated income statement in the period incurred. If there was a change in regulatory positions surrounding the collection of these deferred costs, there could be a material impact on financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Southwest may not be able to rely on rate decoupling to maintain stable financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Management has worked with regulatory commissions in designing rate structures that strive to provide affordable and reliable service to our customers while mitigating the volatility in prices to customers and stabilizing returns to investors. Rate structures in all service territories allow Southwest to separate or decouple the recovery of operating margin from natural gas consumption, though decoupled structures vary by state. In California, authorized operating margin levels vary by month. In Nevada and Arizona, the decoupled rate structures apply to most customer classes on the basis of margin per customer, which varies by month. Collectively, these mechanisms provide stability in annual operating margin. Significantly warmer-than-normal weather conditions in our service territories and other factors, such as climate change and alternative energy sources, may result in decreased cash flows attributable to lower natural gas sales and delays in recovering regulatory asset balances. Furthermore, continuation of the decoupled rate designs currently in place is subject to regulatory discretion, and if unfavorably modified or discontinued, could adversely impact Southwest s financial position and results of operations. 
 16 

Southwest may be subject to increased costs related to the operation of natural gas pipelines under recent regulations concerning natural gas pipeline safety, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and/or cash flows. 
 We are committed to consistently monitoring and maintaining our distribution and transmission systems and storage operations to ensure that natural gas is acquired, stored, and/or delivered safely, reliably, and efficiently. Due to the combustible nature of our (or our customers product, we anticipate that the natural gas industry could be the subject of increased federal, state, and local regulatory oversight over time. We continue to work diligently with industry associations and federal, state, and local regulators to ensure compliance with any applicable laws. We expect there to be increased costs associated with compliance (and potential penalties for any non-compliance) with applicable laws. If these costs are not recoverable in our customer rates, or if there are delays in recoverability due to regulatory lag, they could have a negative impact on our operating costs and financial results, including against our expectations. 
 Our delivery and related systems require numerous permits and other approvals from various federal, state, and local governmental agencies, and others to operate its business, including for pipeline expansion or infrastructure development; any failure to obtain or maintain required permits or approvals, or other factors that could prevent or delay planned development, could negatively affect our business and results of operations. 
 Southwest s existing and planned development projects require multiple permits and approvals. The acquisition, ownership and operation of natural gas pipelines and storage facilities require numerous permits, rights-of-way, approvals and certificates from federal, state, and local governmental agencies or others. Various factors may prevent or delay us from completing such projects or may make completion more costly, including the inability to obtain approval, public opposition to the project, regulatory opposition to one or more projects or related programs or their delayed recovery and returns thereon, inability to obtain adequate financing, competition for labor and materials, construction delays, cost overruns, and inability to negotiate acceptable agreements relating to rights-of-way, construction, or other material development components. Once received, approvals may be subject to litigation, and projects may be delayed or approvals reversed. If there is a delay in obtaining any required approvals, or if we fail to obtain or maintain any required approvals, easements or rights of way, or to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, we may not be able to construct or operate our facilities, may not be able to adequately service existing customers or support customer growth, or such conditions could cause us to incur additional costs. These circumstances could negatively impact our earnings. 
 General Risks 
 The Company s operating results may be adversely impacted by an economic downturn. 
 If an economic slowdown occurs, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected. Fluctuations and uncertainties in the economy make it challenging for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and to identify risks that may affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. However, current global economic events such as the war in Ukraine, rising inflation, and increasing interest rates may cause the global economy to enter a period of economic slowdown or recession. We cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any future economic slowdown or recession. If the economy or the markets in which we operate decline from present levels, it may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 A significant reduction in Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. and Southwest s credit ratings could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 We cannot be certain that any of our current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. Our credit ratings are subject to change at any time in the discretion of the applicable ratings agencies. Numerous factors, including many which are not within our control, are considered by the ratings agencies in connection with assigning credit ratings. 
 Any downgrade could increase our future borrowing costs, which would diminish our financial results. We would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in certain current, as well as future, financings, and our potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease. A downgrade could require additional support in the form of letters of credit or cash or other collateral and otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 We may be unable to successfully integrate business acquisitions into our business and realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions. 
 Business acquisitions are expected to result in various benefits, including, among other things, being accretive to earnings in future periods. The achievement of the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the businesses are integrated efficiently and effectively. Failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of acquisitions could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues generated, and the potential diversion of management s time and energy, all of which could have an adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, results of 
 17 

operations, cash flows, credit ratings, or market price of our common stock. Acquisitions may also cause us to issue equity securities which would dilute our existing stockholders percentage of ownership. 
 Natural disasters, public health crises and epidemic or pandemic related illness (including COVID-19), war, or terrorist activities and other extreme events could adversely affect the Companies business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and/or cash flows. 
 Local or national natural disasters, pandemic illness (including COVID-19), actual or threatened acts of war or terrorist activities, including the political and economic disruption and uncertainty related to Russia's military invasion of Ukraine, catastrophic failure of pipeline systems and other extreme events are a threat to our assets and operations. Our service territories may face a heightened risk due to exposure to acts of terrorism that could target or impact our natural gas distribution, transmission, and storage facilities and disrupt our operations and ability to meet customer requirements. In addition, the threat of terrorist activities could lead to increased economic instability and volatility in the price of natural gas that could affect our operations. Natural disasters, political unrest or actual or threatened terrorist activities may also disrupt capital markets and our ability to raise capital or may impact our suppliers or our customers directly. A local disaster or pandemic illness (including COVID-19) could result in part of our workforce being unable to operate or maintain our infrastructure or perform other tasks necessary to conduct our business. In addition, these risks could result in loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental damage, impairment of our operations and substantial loss to the Company. Our regulators may not allow us to recover from our customers part or all of the increased cost related to the foregoing events, which could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 A slow or inadequate response to events that could cause business interruption may have an adverse impact on operations and earnings. We may be unable to obtain sufficient insurance to cover all risks associated with local and national disasters, pandemic illness, terrorist activities, catastrophic failure of the pipeline system and other events, which could increase the risk that an event adversely affects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS 
 None. 
 
 Item 2. PROPERTIES 
 The plant investment of Southwest consists primarily of transmission and distribution mains, compressor stations, peak shaving/storage facilities, service lines, meters, and regulators, which comprise the pipeline systems and facilities located in and around the communities served. Southwest also includes other properties such as land, buildings, furnishings, work equipment, vehicles, and software systems in utility plant. The northern Nevada and northern California properties of Southwest are referred to as the northern system; the Arizona, southern Nevada, and southern California properties are referred to as the southern system. Total gas plant at December 31, 2022 was 9.7 billion at Southwest, including construction work in progress. It is the opinion of management that the properties of Southwest are suitable and adequate for its purposes. 
 Substantially all gas main and service lines are constructed across property owned by others under right-of-way grants obtained from the record owners thereof, under the streets and on the grounds of municipalities under authority conferred by franchises or otherwise, or beneath public highways or public lands under authority of various federal and state statutes. None of the numerous county and municipal franchises are exclusive, and some are of limited duration. These franchises are renewed regularly as they expire, and Southwest anticipates no serious difficulties in obtaining future renewals. 
 With respect to the right-of-way grants, Southwest generally has had continuous and uninterrupted possession and use of such rights-of-way, and the associated gas mains and service lines, commencing with the initial stages of construction of such facilities. Permits have been obtained from public authorities and other governmental entities in certain instances to cross or to lay facilities along roads and highways. These permits typically are revocable at the election of the grantor, and Southwest occasionally must relocate its facilities when requested to do so by the grantor. Permits have also been obtained from railroad companies to cross over or under railroad lands or rights-of-way, which in some instances require annual or other periodic payments and are revocable at the election of the grantors. 
 Southwest, through two subsidiaries, operates two primary pipeline transmission systems: 
 a system (including an LNG storage facility) owned by Great Basin extending from the Idaho-Nevada border to the Reno, Sparks, and Carson City areas and communities in the Lake Tahoe area in both California and Nevada and other communities in northern and western Nevada; and 
 a system extending from the Colorado River at the southern tip of Nevada to the Las Vegas distribution area. 
 Southwest provides natural gas service in parts of Arizona, Nevada, and California. Service areas in Arizona include most of the central and southern areas of the state, including Phoenix, Tucson, Yuma, and surrounding communities. Service areas in northern Nevada include Carson City, Yerington, Fallon, Lovelock, Winnemucca, Elko and Spring Creek. Service areas in southern Nevada include the Las Vegas valley (including Henderson and Boulder City), Laughlin, and Mesquite. Service areas 
 18 

in southern California include Barstow, Big Bear, Needles, and Victorville. Service areas in northern California include the Lake Tahoe area and Truckee. 
 MountainWest, which was part of our operations and properties in 2022, but sold in February 2023, provides over 2,000 miles of interstate natural gas pipelines and storage facilities in Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado. Plant investment primarily consists of transmission mains, storage facilities, and gas gathering and processing property. Substantially all property is constructed across property owned by others under right-of-way grants, similar to Southwest, with regular renewal, and no serious difficulty is currently expected in obtaining future renewals. MountainWest s system is located in the Rocky Mountains near large reserves of natural gas in six major producing areas, including the Greater Green River, Uinta, and Piceance basins. MountainWest transports gas from these areas to other major pipeline systems for delivery to markets in the west and midwest including the Dominion Energy local distribution system serving natural gas utility customers in Utah, southwest Wyoming, and southern Idaho. MountainWest owns and operates the Clay Basin storage facility located on the Wyoming-Utah border, an underground storage reservoir in the Rocky Mountain Region. Through wholly-owned subsidiaries, MountainWest owns and operates MountainWest Overthrust Pipeline, LLC in southwestern Wyoming. MountainWest also operates and owns 50 of the White River Hub, LLC providing transportation and hub services through interconnections with six interstate pipeline systems and a major processing plant near Meeker, Colorado. 
 Information on properties of Centuri can be found in this Form 10-K under Utility Infrastructure Services under Part I, which by this reference is incorporated herein. 
 
 Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 The Company maintains liability insurance for various risks associated with the operation of its natural gas pipelines and facilities. In August 2021, a natural gas pipe operated by Southwest was involved in an explosion that injured four individuals and damaged property. The explosion was caused by a leak in the pipe, and is under investigation. Individuals that were injured have each brought legal claims against Southwest and other parties. As of December 31, 2022, Southwest s earnings exposure was deemed to be limited to its maximum self-insured retention level of 5 million. Based on our insurance policies, amounts incurred above the self-insured retention amounts that are indemnifiable by insurance companies are recorded on the balance sheet, but do not impact our earnings. An estimate of actual losses greater than that which has been recognized in these financial statements cannot be estimated as of the date these financial statements are issued. 
 In addition, the Company and Southwest are named as a defendant in various other legal proceedings. The ultimate dispositions of these proceedings are not presently determinable; however, it is the opinion of management that none of this litigation individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse impact on the Company s or Southwest s financial position or results of operations. See Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies for a discussion on ongoing litigation, including litigation filed by certain stockholders and by funds managed by Carl Icahn.

 Item 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 
 The principal market on which the common stock of the Company is traded is the New York Stock Exchange and the ticker symbol of the stock is SWX. At February 15, 2023, there were 10,711 holders of record of common stock, and the market price of the common stock was 64.98. The dividends on, and information relating to, the Company s common stock required by this item are included in the 2022 Annual Report to Stockholders filed as an exhibit hereto and incorporated herein by reference. 
 Dividends are payable on the Company s common stock at the discretion of the Board. In setting the dividend rate, the Board considers, among other factors, current and expected future earnings levels, our ongoing capital expenditure plans and expected external funding needs, our payout ratio, and our ability to maintain strong credit ratings and liquidity. The Company has paid dividends on its common stock since 1956. The quarterly dividend was 0.62 in 2022, and in February 2023, the Board determined to retain the quarterly dividend at 0.62 per share effective with the June 2023 payment. Although no assurances can be provided on our future dividend payments, the Board currently intends to reevaluate the dividend upon the completion of the Centuri spin-off, and it is anticipated that we will pay a dividend consistent with industry peers.

 Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Information required by this item is included in the 2022 Annual Report to Stockholders and is incorporated herein by reference. 
 
 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are exposed to various forms of market risk, including commodity price risk, rate design risk, interest rate risk, and foreign currency exchange rate risk. The following describes our exposure to these risks. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 In managing its natural gas supply portfolios, Southwest has historically entered short duration (generally one year or less) fixed-price contracts for its California rate jurisdictions, as well as variable-price contracts (firm and spot) for all its rate jurisdictions. Southwest has experienced price volatility over the past several years and such volatility is expected to continue into 2023 and beyond. 
 Southwest is protected financially from commodity price risk by deferred energy or purchased gas adjustment (collectively PGA mechanisms in each of its jurisdictions. These mechanisms generally allow Southwest to defer over- or under-collections of gas costs to PGA balancing accounts. With regulatory approval, Southwest can either refund amounts over-collected, or recoup amounts under-collected in future periods. In addition to the PGA mechanism, Southwest has historically utilized a Volatility Mitigation Program attempting to further reduce price volatility for its California rate jurisdiction customers. During 2022, Southwest continued to fix the price on a portion of its California natural gas portfolios using fixed-price contracts. For periods beyond October 2020, Southwest does not currently plan to make fixed-price term or swap purchases broadly for the Arizona or Nevada jurisdictions; however, it will continue to make fixed-price purchases for the California jurisdictions. 
 Southwest s natural gas purchasing practices are subject to prudence reviews by the various regulatory bodies in each jurisdiction. PGA changes affect cash flows and potentially short-term borrowing requirements, but do not directly impact profit margin. 
 Rate Design Risk 
 Rate design is th e primary mechanism available to Southwest to mitigate weather risk. All of Southwest s service territories have decoupled rate structures which mitigate weather risk. In California, CPUC regulations allow Southwest to decouple operating margin from usage and offset weather risk based on monthly margin levels. In Nevada and Arizona, a decoupled rate structure applies to most customer classes based on monthly margin per customer benchmarks. All such mechanisms provide stability in annual operating margin by insulating us from variations in customer usage associated with abnormal weather conditions (including margin protection during warm weather and limits on margin during cold weather). Southwest is not assured that decoupled rate structures will continue to be supported in future rate cases.

Similarly, Southwest has in place ongoing infrastructure replacement protocol for certain pipe replacement activity. These programs are designed to mitigate the financial attrition associated with pipe replacement activity between rate cases by providing for the recovery of and return on expenditures. The programs have included the replacement of Early Vintage Plastic Pipe, Vintage Steel Pipe, and Customer-Owned Yard Lines, in addition to the conversion of master-metered mobile home parks to individually metered mobile homes. Southwest is not assured that currently approved programs will continue to be supported in future regulatory proceedings. 
 Great Basin s regulated rate design, similar to that which was in place for MountainWest in 2022, is under the jurisdiction of the FERC, and provides for a substantial portion of its rate structures based on fixed reservations and storage charges and it is not assured that currently approved structures will continue to be approved by the FERC in future filings or proceedings. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Changes in interest rates could adversely affect earnings or cash flows. The primary interest rate risks for the Company are the risk of increasing interest rates on variable-rate obligations and the risk of increasing interest rates between the time of an anticipated debt offering and the time of actual issuance. Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure this risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interest rates. In Nevada, fluctuations in interest rates on 150 million of variable-rate tax-exempt Industrial Development Revenue Bonds IDRBs are tracked and recovered from customers through a variable interest expense recovery mechanism, which mitigates risk to earnings and cash flows from interest rate fluctuations on these IDRBs. The following table represents the variable rate debt as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and interest rate sensitivity analysis for a hypothetical 1 change in interest rates, assuming a constant outstanding balance in such debt over the next twelve months: 
 (Millions of dollars) 2022 (1)

 (1) Excludes the IDRBs noted above. 
 
 A sensitivity analysis at a different date may provide a higher or lower result, including relative to the amount of debt then outstanding. For instance, after the most recent balance sheet date of December 31, 2022, Corporate debt was substantially reduced in conjunction with the sale of MountainWest to Williams, when closing proceeds of 1.075 billion were used to substantially pay down amounts due under a 364-day Term Loan Facility, thereby reducing the amount due to 72 million compared to 1.15 billion included in the Corporate balance in the table above as of the end of 2022. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 Centuri owns infrastructure services businesses that operate in Canada. Due to these operations, the Company is exposed to market risk associated with currency exchange rate fluctuations between the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency translation risk is the risk that exchange rate gains or losses arise from translating foreign entities statements of income and balance sheets from their functional currency (the Canadian Dollar) to our reporting currency (the U.S. Dollar) for consolidation purposes. During 2022, translation adjustments due to fluctuations in exchange rates were not significant. We do not have significant exposure to other foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Management of Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. and Southwest Gas Corporation has established disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in their respective reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to management of each company, including each respective Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or management override of the control. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected. 
 Based on the most recent evaluation, as of December 31, 2022, management of Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc., including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective at attaining the level of reasonable assurance noted above.

Haller (the Executive ). 
 
 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Holdings (the Board recognizes that the continuing possibility of a change in control of Southwest or Holdings is unsettling to the Executive and other officers of the Company and 
 
 WHEREAS, the Board wishes to assure a continuing dedication by the Executive to her duties to the Company, notwithstanding the occurrence or potential occurrence of a change in control of Southwest or Holdings and 
 
 WHEREAS, the Board believes it is important, should the Company receive proposals from third parties with respect to its future, to enable the Executive, without being influenced by the uncertainties of her own situation, to assess and advise the Board whether such proposals would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and to take such other action regarding such proposals as the Board might determine to be appropriate and 
 
 WHEREAS, the Board wishes to demonstrate to officers of the Company that the Company is concerned with the welfare of its officers and intends to see that loyal officers are treated fairly and 
 
 WHEREAS, Southwest and Holdings previously entered into a change in control agreement with the Executive, and the Company and Executive wish to amend and restate such agreement in its entirety pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. 
 
 NOW, THEREFORE, the Company and the Executive agree as follows 
 
 1. TERM 
 
 The term of this Agreement shall continue in effect until the Company s termination of this Agreement by providing Executive with written notice of such termination at least twelve (12) months prior to the proposed termination date, provided that such termination notice shall be deemed to be null and void (and this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect) if prior to such proposed termination date a Change in Control occurs or another event, including but not limited to the signing of a definitive agreement that would result in a Change in Control, occurs that is expected to result in a Change in Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement shall not terminate during the Protection Period or the Severance Period, in each case as defined below. 

2. DEFINITIONS 

As used in this Agreement 
 
 (a) Cause means (i) a material act of theft, misappropriation, or conversion of corporate funds committed by the Executive or (ii) the Executive s demonstrably willful, deliberate and continued failure to follow reasonable directives of the Board which are within the Executive s ability to perform. The Executive shall not be deemed to have been terminated for Cause unless and until (x) there shall have been delivered to the Executive a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the Board in good faith at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice to the Executive and an opportunity for the Executive, together with her counsel, to be heard before the Board) finding that the Executive was guilty of conduct set forth above and specifying the particulars thereof in reasonable detail and (y) if the Executive contests such finding (or a conclusion that she has failed to timely cure the performance in response thereto), the arbitrator, by final determination in an arbitration proceeding pursuant to Section 5 hereof, has concluded that the Executive s conduct met the standard for termination for Cause above and that the Board s conduct met the standards of good faith and satisfied the procedural and substantive conditions of this Section 2(a) (collectively, the Necessary Findings ). The Executive s costs of the arbitration shall be advanced by the Company and shall be repaid to the Company if the arbitrator makes the Necessary Findings. 
 
 If within sixty (60) days after receipt by the Executive of the resolution referred to in the preceding paragraph, the Executive notifies the Company that a dispute exists concerning the termination, the termination date of the Executive shall be the date as finally determined by mutual written agreement of the parties or by a final and binding arbitration award. During the period until the dispute is finally resolved, the Company will, in accordance with its regular payroll procedures, continue to pay the Executive her full compensation in effect when the notice giving rise to the dispute was given (including, but not limited to, base salary) and continue the Executive as a participant in all compensation, employee benefit, health and welfare and insurance plans, programs, arrangements and perquisites in which the Executive was participating or to which she was entitled when the notice giving rise to the dispute was given, until the dispute is finally resolved. Amounts paid under this Section 2(a) shall be repaid to the Company or be offset against or reduce any other amounts due the Executive under this Agreement, if appropriate, only upon the final resolution of the dispute. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Executive is a specified employee within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and the related Treasury Regulations and guidance thereunder Section 409A on the date of termination of the Executive s employment with the Company, during the six- (6-) month period following the Executive s termination of employment with the Company, payments to the Executive under this Section 2(a) (other than reimbursements and in-kind amounts described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v), or any successor provision thereto) that constitute non-qualified deferred compensation under Section 409A shall be delayed and paid to the Executive on the first regularly scheduled Company executive pay date that occurs in the seventh (7th) calendar month following the calendar month in which the Executive s termination of employment occurs thereafter, any additional payments owed to the Executive under this Section 2(a) shall be paid to the Executive ratably on the following regularly scheduled Company executive pay dates.

 (ii) Consummation of a merger or consolidation, or other reorganization, with or into one (1) or more entities that are not Subsidiaries, as a result of which less than 50 of the outstanding voting securities of the surviving or resulting entity immediately after such reorganization are, or shall be, owned, directly or indirectly, by stockholders of Holdings immediately before such reorganization (assuming for purposes of such determination that there is no change in the record ownership of Holdings securities from the record date for such approval until such reorganization and that such record owners hold no securities of the other parties to such reorganization, but including in such determination any securities of the other parties to such reorganization held by affiliates of Holdings) 
 
 (iii) Consummation of the sale of substantially all of Holdings business and or assets to a person or entity which is not a Subsidiary 
 
 (iv) Any person (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), but excluding any person described in and satisfying the conditions of Rule 13d-1(b)(1) thereunder), becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of Holdings representing more than 30 of the combined voting power of Holdings then outstanding securities entitled to then vote generally in the election of directors of Holdings or 
 
 (v) During any period not longer than two (2) consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such period constituted the Board cease to constitute at least a majority thereof, unless the election, or the nomination for election by Holdings stockholders, of each new Board member was approved by a vote of at least three-fourths (3 4) of the Board members then still in office who were Board members at the beginning of such period (including for these purposes, new members whose election was so approved). 
 
 Change in Control under this Agreement shall, in addition to the enumerated events set forth above involving Holdings, the common stock of Holdings, or the board of directors of Holdings, include the events enumerated in items (i) through (iv) above with respect to Southwest.

The parties hereto agree that (i) the Reorganization did not constitute a Change in Control under this Agreement or any predecessor agreement with Southwest and (ii) in no event will this Agreement be construed so that the Executive becomes entitled to duplicate severance benefits from Southwest and Holdings.

 (v) the failure by the Company to continue at levels materially not less than those in existence immediately prior to such Change in Control the Executive s participation in any thrift, incentive or compensation plan, or any pension plan, in which the Executive participated immediately prior to such Change in Control, provided that the Company may provide for participation in substantially similar plans that provide benefits at levels materially not less than those in existence immediately prior to the later of (i) Executive s termination date or (ii) a Change in Control 
 
 (vi) the failure by the Company to provide for the Executive s participation in any welfare, life insurance, health, and accident or disability plan on the same basis as those provided to executives of the Company who are similarly situated to the Executive 
 
 (vii) the taking of any action by the Company which would materially adversely affect the Executive s participation in or materially reduce her benefits under any single such plan or all such plans, when taken together, or deprive her of any material fringe 

benefit enjoyed by her immediately prior to the later of (i) Executive s termination date or (ii) a Change in Control (except for the acceleration of the termination dates of stock options, restricted stock units, performance shares and other awards and rights, if applicable, as contemplated by this Agreement), provided that the taking of any action by the Company that reduces the economic value attributable to such participation, benefits or fringe benefit by ten (10) percent or more shall be sufficient but not necessary to constitute a materially adverse effect, material reduction or deprivation, as applicable 
 
 (viii) the assignment to the Executive without her consent to a new work location which would require an increase in the round-trip commute to work from the Executive s residence immediately prior to the later of (i) Executive s termination date or (ii) a Change in Control of more than 40 miles per day or 
 
 (ix) any material breach of any material provision of this Agreement. 
 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive shall not be entitled to terminate her employment with the Company for Good Reason unless the following process is followed with respect to such termination.

Such reimbursement shall only be made for outplacement services directly related to such termination. Such expenses must be incurred not later than the end of the second calendar year following the calendar year of such termination. Such expense must be submitted by the Executive to the Company as promptly as practicable, and in no event later than required by the Company in order for the Company to make such reimbursement no later the last day of the third calendar year following the calendar year in which such termination occurs. In no event shall the Company make any such reimbursement later than the last day of the third calendar year following the calendar year in which such termination occurs. 
 
 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3, if the Executive is a specified employee within the meaning of Section 409A, during the six- (6-) month period following the Executive s termination of employment with the Company, payments to the Executive under this Section 3 (other than reimbursements and in-kind amounts described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v) or any successor provision thereto) that constitute non-qualified deferred compensation under Section 409A shall be delayed and paid to the Executive on the first regularly scheduled Company executive pay date that occurs in the seventh (7th) calendar month following the calendar month in which the Executive s termination of employment occurs thereafter, any additional payments owed to the Executive under this Section 3 shall be paid to the Executive in the manner otherwise specified in this Section 3. With respect to any payment delayed pursuant to this Section 3(e), the Company shall pay the Executive, on the day on which such delayed payment is made to the Executive, interest on such delayed payment for the period of such delay at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 1274(d) of the Code for the month in which such delayed payment otherwise would have been made. 
 
 (f) For purposes of this Agreement, the Executive will be deemed to not have terminated employment with the Company unless the Executive has incurred a Separation from Service. Separation from Service means the termination of the Executive s employment by the Company if the Executive dies, retires or otherwise has a termination of employment with the Company provided that the Executive s employment relationship is treated as continuing intact while on military leave, sick leave or other bona fide leave of absence if the period of such leave does not exceed six (6) months or longer, if the Executive s right to reemployment is provided either by statute or by contract. A leave of absence constitutes a bona fide leave of absence only if there is a reasonable expectation that the Executive will return to perform services for the Company. If the period of leave exceeds six (6) months and the Executive does not retain a right to reemployment under an applicable statute or by contract, the employment relationship is deemed to terminate on the first date immediately following such six- (6-) month period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where a leave of absence is due to any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than six (6) months, where such impairment causes the Executive to be unable to perform the duties of her position of employment, or any substantially similar position of employment, a twenty-nine (29-) month period of absence may be substituted 

for such six- (6-) month period. For purposes of this paragraph, the term Company includes all other organizations that together with the Company are part of a control group of organizations under Section 414(b) and Section 414(c) of the Code. Whether an Executive has incurred a Separation from Service shall be determined based in accordance with Section 409A. Additionally, if the Executive ceases to work as an employee, but is retained to provide services as an independent contractor of the Company, the determination of whether the Executive has incurred a Separation from Service shall be determined based in accordance with Section 409A. 
 
 4. CERTAIN REDUCTION OF PAYMENTS BY THE COMPANY 
 
 In the event that it is determined that any payment or distribution by the Company to the Executive or for the Executive s benefit, whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or pursuant to or by reason of any other agreement, policy, plan, program or arrangement, including without limitation any stock option or restricted stock or similar right, or the lapse or termination of any restriction on or the vesting or exercisability of any of the foregoing (a Payment ), would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (or any successor provision thereto), by reason of being considered contingent on a change in the ownership or effective control of the Company, within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code (or any successor provision thereto) or to any similar tax imposed by state or local law, or any interest or penalties with respect to such tax (such tax or taxes, together with any such interest and penalties, being hereafter collectively referred to as the Excise Tax ), then the Payment shall be reduced by the Company in a manner determined by the Company to be 1.00 less than three (3) times the Executive s base amount (as defined in Section 280G of the Code) so that no portion of the Payment shall be subject to the Excise Tax, provided that the Company shall make such reduction only if such reduction would effect, on an after-tax basis, a Payment that is greater than the Payment that would be made if no such reduction were effected. The Executive shall be permitted to provide the Company with written notice specifying which of the Payments will be subject to reduction or elimination provided, however, that to the extent that the Executive s ability to exercise such authority would cause any Payment to become subject to any taxes or penalties pursuant to Section 409A, or if the Executive does not provide the Company with any such written notice, the Company shall reduce or eliminate the Payments by first reducing or eliminating the portion of the Payments that are payable in cash and then by reducing or eliminating the non-cash portion of the Payments, in each case in reverse order beginning with payments or benefits which are to be paid the farthest in time. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, any notice given by the Executive pursuant to the preceding sentence shall take precedence over the provisions of any other plan, arrangement or agreement governing the Executive s rights and entitlements to any benefits or compensation. 
 
 The Company may withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement all federal, state, local and foreign taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation. 
 
 5. ARBITRATION AND LITIGATION 
 
 Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in respect to this Agreement (or its validity, interpretation or enforcement) or the subject matter hereof must be submitted to and settled by arbitration conducted before a single arbitrator or, at the election of the Company or 

the Executive, a panel of arbitrators (chosen from a list of arbitrators provided by the American Arbitration Association with each party hereto taking alternate strikes and the remaining arbitrator or arbitrators, as applicable, hearing the dispute). 
 
 By agreeing to arbitrate all disputes related to this Agreement, the Company and the Executive acknowledge, among other things, that they are waiving the right to have the dispute heard by a court of law or equity and the right to a jury trial. 
 
 The arbitration will be conducted in Clark County, Nevada, in accordance with the then current rules of the American Arbitration Association or its successor. The arbitration of such issues, including the determination of any amount of damages suffered, will be final and binding upon the parties to the maximum extent permitted by law. The decision of the arbitrator or the panel, as applicable, shall be in writing and signed by the arbitrator. A copy of the arbitrator s or the panel s decision, as applicable, will be provided to each party. The arbitrator or panel, as applicable, in such action will not be authorized to change or modify any provision of this Agreement. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator or the panel, as applicable, may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof. The parties consent to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of Nevada and of the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada for all purposes in connection with arbitration, including the entry of judgment of any award. 
 
 The Company shall advance the arbitrator s or the panel s fees, as applicable, subject to the provisions of Section 2(a), however, the arbitrator or the panel, as applicable, will award reasonable legal fees and expenses (including arbitration costs) to the prevailing party upon application therefor. The non-prevailing party may thus incur greater expenses under arbitration than under traditional court litigation. 
 
 Except as may be necessary to enter judgment upon the award or to the extent required by applicable law, all claims, defenses and proceedings (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the existence of the controversy and the fact that there is an arbitration proceeding) shall be treated in a confidential manner by the arbitrator or the panel, as applicable, the parties and their counsel, and each of their agents and employees, and all others acting on behalf or in concert with them. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no one shall divulge to any third party or person not directly involved in the arbitration, the contents of the pleadings, papers, orders, hearings, trials, or awards in the arbitration, except as may be necessary to enter judgment upon an award as required by applicable law. Any court proceedings relating to the arbitration hereunder, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to prevent or compel arbitration to perform, correct, vacate or otherwise enforce an arbitration award, shall be filed under seal with the court, to the extent permitted by law. 
 
 6. BENEFITS AND BINDING EFFECT 
 
 This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Company, its successors and assigns, including but not limited to any corporation, person or other entity which may acquire all or substantially all of the assets and business of the Company or any corporation with or into which the Company may be consolidated or merged, and the Executive, her heirs, executors, administrators and legal representatives, provided that the obligations of the Executive hereunder may not be delegated. 

7. OTHER AGREEMENTS 
 
 The Executive represents that the execution and performance of this Agreement will not result in a breach of any of the terms and conditions of any employment or other agreement between the Executive and any third party. 
 
 Provided that the Company duly performs all of its obligations (if any) arising by virtue of a termination of employment of the Executive, the Executive will not publicly disparage the Company or its officers, directors, employees or agents and will refrain from any action which could reasonably be expected to cause material adverse public relations or embarrassment to the Company or to any of such persons. Similarly, the Company (including its officers, directors, employees and agents) will not disparage the Executive and will refrain from any action which could reasonably be expected to result in embarrassment to the Executive or to materially and adversely affect her opportunities for employment. The preceding two (2) sentences shall not apply to disclosures required by applicable law, regulation or order of a court or governmental agency.

 SECTION 1.11 Rates 
 
 . The interest rate on LIBOR Rate Loans and Base Rate Loans (when determined by reference to clause

The London interbank offered rate is intended to represent the rate at which contributing banks may obtain short-term borrowings from each other in the London interbank market. On March 5, 2021, ICE Benchmark Administration IBA ), the administrator of the London interbank offered rate, and the Financial Conduct Authority (the FCA ), the regulatory supervisor of IBA, announced in public statements (the Announcements that the final publication or representativeness date for the London interbank offered rate for Dollars for (a) 1-week and 2-month tenor settings will be December 31, 2021 and (b) overnight, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month tenor settings will be June 30, 2023.

There is no assurance that the dates set forth in the Announcements will not change or that IBA or the FCA will not take further action that could impact the availability, composition or characteristics of any London interbank offered rate. Public and private sector industry initiatives have been and continue, as of the date hereof, to be underway to implement new or alternative reference rates to 
 
 56 
 146960219_6 
 165457743_4 

be used in place of the London interbank offered rate. In the event that the London interbank offered rate or any other then-current Benchmark is no longer available or in certain other circumstances set forth in Section 5.8(c), such Section 5.8(c) provides a mechanism for determining an alternative rate of interest. The Administrative Agent will notify Centuri, pursuant to Section 5.8(c), of any change to the reference rate upon which the interest rate on LIBOR Rate Loans and Base Rate Loans (when determined by reference to clause (c) of the definition of Base Rate) is based. However, the Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to, (i) the continuation of, administration of, submission of, calculation of or any other matter related to the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Adjusted Terms SOFR, Term SOFR, the London interbank offered rate or other rates in the any such definition of LIBOR or with respect to any alternative, successor or replacement rate thereto (including any then-current Benchmark or any Benchmark Replacement), including whether the composition or characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement rate (including any Benchmark Replacement), as it may or may not be adjusted pursuant to Section 5.8(c), will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, LIBOR or any other Benchmark, or have the same volume or liquidity as did the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Adjusted Term SOFR, Term SOFR or the London interbank offered rate or any other Benchmark prior to its discontinuance or unavailability, or (ii) the effect, implementation or composition of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes. The Administrative Agent and its Affiliates or other related entities may engage in transactions that affect the calculation of a the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Adjusted Term SOFR, Term SOFR, any other Benchmark , or any alternative, successor or replacement rate (including any Benchmark Replacement) or any relevant adjustments thereto and such transactions may be adverse to the Borrowers. The Administrative Agent may select information sources or services in its reasonable discretion to ascertain the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Adjusted Term SOFR, Term SOFR, or any other Benchmark, any component definition thereof or rates referenced in the definition thereof, in each case pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and shall have no liability to the Borrowers, any Lender or any other person or entity for damages of any kind, including direct or indirect, special, punitive, incidental or consequential damages, costs, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise and whether at law or in equity), for any error or calculation of any such rate (or component thereof) provided by any such information source or service.

 165457743_4 

Issuing Lender in connection with such payment.

Each Borrower also agrees that the applicable Issuing Lender and the L C Participants shall not be responsible for, and such Borrower s Reimbursement Obligation under Section 3.5 shall not be affected by, among other things, the validity or genuineness of documents or of any endorsements thereon, even though such documents shall in fact prove to be invalid, fraudulent or forged, or any dispute between or among such Borrower and any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any other party to which such Letter of Credit may be transferred or any claims whatsoever of such Borrower against any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit or any such transferee. No Issuing Lender shall be liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Letter of Credit issued by it, except for errors or omissions caused by such Issuing Lender s gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final nonappealable judgment. Each Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by any Issuing Lender under or in connection with any Letter of Credit issued by it or the related drafts or documents, if done in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct shall be binding on such Borrower and shall not result in any liability of such Issuing Lender or any L C Participant to any Borrower.

 SECTION 5.7 Administrative Agent s Clawback. 
 
 (1) Funding by Lenders Presumption by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender (i) in the case of Base Rate Loans, not later than 12 00 noon on the date of any proposed borrowing, (ii) in the case of Canadian Revolving Credit Loans, not later than 12 00 noon one (1) Business Day before the date of any proposed borrowing and (iii) otherwise, prior to the proposed date of any borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender s share of such borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Sections 2.3(b) and 4.2 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the applicable Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, (1) with respect to any Loan denominated in Dollars, at the greater of (x) the daily average Federal Funds Rate and (y) a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (2) with respect to any Loan denominated in Canadian Dollars, at the greater of (x) a rate equal to the Administrative Agent s aggregate marginal cost (including the cost of maintaining any required reserves or deposit insurance and of any fees, penalties, overdraft charges or other costs or expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent as a result of the failure to deliver funds hereunder) of carrying such amount and (y) a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by such Borrower, (1) with respect to any Loan denominated in Dollars, the Base Rate and (2) with respect to any Loan denominated in Canadian Dollars, the Canadian Base Rate. If the applicable Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to such Borrower the amount of such interest paid by such Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Loan included in such borrowing. Any payment by any Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim such Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent. 
 
 (2) Payments by the Borrowers Presumptions by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the applicable Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, any Issuing Lender or any Swingline Lender hereunder that the applicable Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and 
 
 80 
 146960219_6 
 165457743_4 

may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders, such Issuing Lender or such Swingline Lender, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the applicable Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders, each Issuing Lender or each Swingline Lender, as the case maybe, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender, Issuing Lender or Swingline Lender, with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, 
 (i) with respect to any Extension of Credit (other than any Canadian Revolving Credit Loan, any Canadian Swingline Loan and, to the extent applicable, any Incremental Term Loan made to the Canadian Borrowers), at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (ii) with respect to any Canadian Revolving Credit Loan, any Canadian Swingline Loan and, to the extent applicable, any Incremental Term Loan made to the Canadian Borrowers, at a rate equal to the Administrative Agent s aggregate marginal cost (including the cost of maintaining any required reserves or deposit insurance and of any fees, penalties, overdraft charges or other costs or expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent as a result of the failure to deliver funds hereunder) of carrying such amount. 
 
 (3) Nature of Obligations of Lenders Regarding Extensions of Credit. The obligations of the Lenders under this Agreement to make the Loans and issue or participate in Letters of Credit and to make payments under this Section, Section 5.11(e), Section 11.11, Section 12.3(c) or Section 12.7, as applicable, are several and are not joint or joint and several. The failure of any Lender to make available its Commitment Percentage of any Loan requested by any Borrower shall not relieve it or any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Commitment Percentage of such Loan available on the borrowing date, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make its Commitment Percentage of such Loan available on the borrowing date.

 e. in the case of any assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, the applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent.

Exhibit 13.01 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 About Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. 
 Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. is a holding company that owns all of the shares of common stock of Southwest Gas Corporation Southwest or the natural gas distribution segment), all of the shares of common stock of Centuri Group, Inc. Centuri or the utility infrastructure services segment), and as of December 31, 2022, all of the shares of common stock of MountainWest Pipelines Holding Company MountainWest or pipeline and storage segment). Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the Company. 
 In December 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors (the Board unanimously determined to take strategic actions to simplify the Company s portfolio of businesses. These actions included entering into a definitive agreement (the MountainWest Purchase Agreement to sell 100 of MountainWest in an all-cash transaction to Williams Partners Operating LLC Williams for 1.5 billion in total enterprise value, subject to certain adjustments. Additionally, the Company determined it will pursue a spin-off of Centuri (the Centuri spin-off ), to form a new independent publicly traded utility infrastructure services company. The MountainWest transaction closed on February 14, 2023. The Company is to provide certain services to Williams under a transition services agreement for a brief period, generally not beyond six months. As a result of entry into the agreement, the Company recorded a loss, composed of a goodwill impai rment of 449.6 million plus 5.8 million in estimated selling costs. A customary post-closing true-up will occur but is not currently expected to be material to the financial statements as a whole . The Centuri spin-off is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2023 or the first quarter of 2024 and to be tax free to the Company and its stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Centuri spin-off will be subject to, among other things, finalizing the transaction structure, final approval by the Board, approval by the Arizona Corporation Commission, the receipt of a favorable Internal Revenue Service private letter ruling relating to the tax-free nature of the transaction, and the effectiveness of a registration statement that will be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. See Note 15 - Acquisitions and Dispositions for additional information. 
 As described in Note 1 - Background, Organization, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , on May 6, 2022, the Company entered into a Cooperation Agreement Cooperation Agreement with Carl C. Icahn and the persons and entities named therein (the Icahn Group ). Pursuant to the Initial Cooperation Agreement, the Company, among other things, made certain previously disclosed changes to the Board and management team. On October 24, 2022, the Company and the Icahn Group entered into the Amended Cooperation Agreement, which amended, restated, superseded, and replaced in its entirety the Initial Cooperation Agreement. Under the Amended Cooperation Agreement, certain of the standstill provisions in the Initial Cooperation Agreement were extended, the Icahn Group s governance rights were amended, and the Company agreed to certain actions in connection with the 2023 Annual Meeting. Additional information about the Amended Cooperation Agreement can be found in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on October 26, 2022. 
 Our business includes Southwest, which is engaged in the business of purchasing, distributing, and transporting natural gas for customers in portions of Arizona, Nevada, and California. Southwest is the largest distributor of natural gas in Arizona and Nevada, and distributes and transports natural gas for customers in portions of California. Additionally, through its subsidiaries, Southwest operates two regulated interstate pipelines serving portions of the northern territories of Nevada and California. 
 As of December 31, 2022, Southwest had 2,197,000 residential, commercial, industrial, and other natural gas customers, of which 1,176,000 customers were located in Arizona, 816,000 in Nevada, and 205,000 in California. In January 2022, approximately 5,300 customers became part of Southwest s gas distribution operations that were formerly served by Graham County Utilities. First-time meter sets were approximately 41,000 in 2022, compared to 37,000 in 2021. Residential and commercial customers represented over 99 of the total customer base. During 2022, 54 of operating margin (gas operating revenues less the net cost of gas sold) was earned in Arizona, 34 in Nevada, and 12 in California. During this same period, Southwest earned 85 of its operating margin from residential and small commercial customers, 4 from other sales customers, and 11 from transportation customers. These general patterns are expected to remain materially consistent for the foreseeable future. 
 Southwest recognizes operating revenues from the distribution and transportation of natural gas (and related services) to customers. Operating margin is a financial measure defined by management as Regulated operations revenues less the net cost of gas sold. However, operating margin is not specifically defined in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP ). Thus, operating margin is considered a non-GAAP measure. Management uses this financial measure because Regulated operations revenues include the net cost of gas sold, which is a tracked cost that is passed through to customers without markup under purchased gas adjustment PGA mechanisms. Fluctuations in the net cost of gas sold impact revenues on a dollar-for-dollar basis, but do not impact operating margin or operating income. Therefore, management believes operating margin provides investors and other interested parties with useful and relevant information to analyze Southwest s financial performance in a rate-regulated environment. The principal factors affecting changes in operating margin 

1 

are general rate relief (including impacts of infrastructure program recoveries) and customer growth. Commission decisions on the amount and timing of relief may impact our earnings. Refer to the Summary Operating Results table below for a reconciliation of gross margin to operating margin, and refer to Rates and Regulatory Proceedings in this Management s Discussion and Analysis for details of various rate proceedings. 
 The demand for natural gas is seasonal, with greater demand in the colder winter months and decreased demand in the warmer summer months. All of Southwest s service territories have decoupled rate structures (alternative revenue programs), which are designed to eliminate the direct link between volumetric sales and revenue, thereby mitigating the impacts of weather variability and conservation on operating margin, allowing Southwest to pursue energy efficiency initiatives. 
 Centuri is a strategic infrastructure services company that partners with regulated utilities to build and maintain the energy network that powers millions of homes and businesses across the United States U.S. and Canada. With an unwavering commitment to serve as long-term partners to customers and communities, Centuri s employees enable regulated utilities to safely and reliably deliver natural gas and electricity, as well as achieve their goals for environmental sustainability. Centuri operates in 73 primary locations across 45 states and provinces in the U.S. and Canada. Centuri operates in the U.S., primarily as NPL, Neuco, Linetec, and Riggs Distler, and in Canada, primarily as NPL Canada . 
 Utility infrastructure services activity can be impacted by changes in infrastructure replacement programs of utilities, weather, and local and federal regulation (including tax rates and incentives). Utilities continue to implement or modify system integrity management programs to enhance safety pursuant to federal and state mandates. These programs have resulted in multi-year utility system replacement programs throughout the U.S. Generally, Centuri revenues are lowest during the first quarter of the year due to less favorable winter weather working conditions. Revenues typically improve as more favorable weather conditions occur during the summer and fall months. In cases of severe weather, such as following a regional storm, Centuri may be engaged to perform restoration activities related to above-ground utility infrastructure, and related results impacts are not solely within the control of management. In addition, in certain circumstances, such as with large bid contracts (especially those of a longer duration), or unit-price contracts with revenue caps, results may be impacted by differences between costs incurred and those anticipated when the work was originally bid. Work awarded, or failing to be awarded, by individual large customers can impact operating results. 
 MountainWest is an interstate natural gas transmission pipeline company that provides transportation and underground storage services to customers in Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado. A substantial portion of its revenue results from reservation charges, but variable rates are also included as part of its primarily rate-regulated rate structures. 
 All of our businesses may be impacted by economic conditions that impact businesses generally, such as inflationary impacts on goods and services consumed in the business, rising interest rates, labor markets and costs (including in regard to contracted or professional services), and the availability of those resources. Certain of these impacts may be more predominant in certain of our operations, such as with regard to fuel costs for work equipment and skilled/trade labor costs at Centuri.

 Results of Natural Gas Distribution 
 Year Ended December 31, (Thousands of dollars) 2022 2021 2020 Regulated operations revenues 1,935,069 1,521,790 1,350,585 Net cost of gas sold 789,216 430,907 342,837 Operating margin 1,145,853 1,090,883 1,007,748 Operations and maintenance expense 491,928 438,550 406,382 Depreciation and amortization 263,043 253,398 235,295 Taxes other than income taxes 83,197 80,343 63,460 Operating income 307,685 318,592 302,611 Other income (deductions) (6,884) (4,559) (6,590) Net interest deductions 115,880 97,560 101,148 Income before income taxes 184,921 216,473 194,873 Income tax expense 30,541 29,338 35,755 Contribution to consolidated results 154,380 187,135 159,118 
 2022 vs. 2021 
 Contribution to consolidated net income from natural gas distribution operations decreased 33 million between 2022 and 2021. The decline was primarily due to increases in Operations and maintenance expense, Depreciation and amortization, and Net interest deductions, offset by an increase in Operating margin and Other income. 
 Operating margin increased 55 million between years. Customer growth provided approximately 17 million as 41,000 first-t ime meter sets were added in 2022, and combined rate relief provided approximately 14 million of incremental operating margin during the current year. Also contributing to the increase were customer late fees that were 4.4 million greater in the current year due to the lifting, in 2021, of a moratorium on such fees. Approved revenue in Arizona related to recoveries associated with Vintage Steel Pipe and Customer-Owned Yard Line programs also contributed to the improvements between periods 22 million). Offsetting these increases were lower recoveries associated with other regulatory programs 4 million ), for which the effects are mitigated by a comparable decrease in amortization expense between periods (discussed below). 
 Operations and maintenance expense increased 53 million , or 12 , between 2022 and 2021. While management worked to mitigate the impacts of historic inflation and labor market challenges, specific increases in costs were nonetheless experienced, including, among others, pipeline integrity, reliability, line location and engineering services costs 8 million), an increase in the reserve for customer accounts deemed uncollectible following the 2021 lifting of the moratorium on disconnections and inflation/economic conditions on our customers 7 million), employee labor (including incremental overtime pay) 7 million), travel, training, recruitment, and medical screening costs 6 million), legal and claim-related costs 5 million), temporary/contractor services for customer support 4 million) and division operations 2 million), increased cost of fuel used in our operations 4 million), and pension-related service cost 3 million), as well as higher allocated corporate/Board costs 1 million). 

4 

Depreciation and amortization expense increased 10 million , or 4 , between years primarily due t o a 537 million, or 6 , increase in average gas plant in service for the current year, offset by a reduction 4 million) in amortization of regulatory account balances, as discussed in regard to Operating margin above. The increase in gas plant was attributable to p ipeline capacity reinforcement work, franchise requirements, scheduled pipe replacement activities, and new infrastructure. 
 Taxes other than income taxes increased 2.9 million, or 4 , between 2022 and 2021 primarily due to an increase in property taxes in Arizona, and to a lesser extent, in Nevada. 
 Other inc ome decreased 2 million b etween 2022 and 2021. Non-service-related components of employee pension and postretirement benefit cost in this category decreased 13 million between years. The current year also includes an 11 million increase in interest income compared to the prior year, including related to carrying charges associated with regulatory account balances, including the Purchased Gas Adjustment PGA mechanisms. Interest income is earned when these balances are in asset positions and interest expense is incurred when balances are in liability positions. Offsetting these impacts was a 14 million decline in COLI results between years, a 9 million reserve for a software project deemed non-recoverable from utility operations, and a 3 million market adjustment on other property in 2022. 
 Net interest deductions increased 18.3 million bet ween 2022 and 2021, primarily due to increased interest associated with 300 million of Senior Notes issued in August 2021 and 600 million of Senior Notes issued in March 2022. Other impacts include increased interest associated with a higher amount of short-term debt in 2022 compared to 2021. Equity financing from Southwest s parent entity, which often occurs, did not occur during 2022. 
 Tax amounts include the amortization of Excess Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes EADIT ), which following 2017 U.S. tax reform, reduces income tax expense as amounts are returned to customers. 
 
 Results of Utility Infrastructure Services 
 Year Ended December 31, (Thousands of dollars) 2022 2021 2020 Utility infrastructure services revenues 2,760,327 2,158,661 1,948,288 Operating expenses: Utility infrastructure services expenses 2,529,318 1,955,467 1,729,429 Depreciation and amortization 155,353 117,643 96,732 Operating income 75,656 85,551 122,127 Other income (deductions) (887) 1,067 (207) Net interest deductions 61,371 20,999 9,269 Income before income taxes 13,398 65,619 112,651 Income tax expense 5,727 18,776 31,128 Net income 7,671 46,843 81,523 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 5,606 6,423 6,661 Contribution to consolidated results 2,065 40,420 74,862 
 2022 vs. 2021 
 Contribution to consolidated net income from utility infrastructure services decreased 38.4 million in 2022 compared to 2021. While top-line revenues increased substantially in 2022 compared to 2021, Centuri s performance overall was impacted by inflation, customer supply chain challenges affecting mix of work, and increased amortization and interest related to Riggs Distler, which was acquired in August 2021. 
 Utility infrastructure services revenues increased 601.7 million, or 28 , including 440.2 million related to Riggs Distler, which was acquired by Centuri on August 30, 2021. Revenues from electric infrastructure services increased 252.9 million in 2022 when compared to the prior year, of which 172.4 million was associated with Riggs Distler. Included in electric infrastructure services revenues overall during 2022 was 69.7 million from emergency restoration services performed by Linetec, Riggs Distler, and National Powerline following storm damage to customers above-ground utility infrastructure in and around the Gulf Coast and eastern regions of the U.S. and Canada, compared to 65.3 million in the prior year. Centuri s revenues derived from storm-related services vary from period to period due to the unpredictable nature of weather-related events, and when this type of work is performed, it typically generates a higher profit margin than core infrastructure services, due to improved operating efficiencies related to equipment utilization and absorption of fixed costs. The current year also includes approximately 229.5 million in incremental revenues, including 47.6 million from Riggs Distler, and from continued growth with gas infrastructure services customers under master service and bid agreements. Other revenues increased 

5 

119.3 million, primarily due to 94.2 million of offshore wind revenue at Riggs Distler. This is stemming from two multi-year jobs that began in 2022 whereby Riggs Distler provides materials, subcontracted manufacturing, fabrication, and assembly of secondary steel components on shore, with delivery at a port facility for the offshore projects. Centuri revenues from contracts with Southwest totaled 134.7 million in 2022 and 102.3 million in 2021. Centuri accounts for services provided to Southwest at contractual prices. 
 Utility infrastructure services expenses increased 573.9 million, or 29 , between 2022 and 2021. The overall increase includes 405.1 million from Riggs Distler, and incremental costs related to the higher volume of work otherwise. Changes in mix of work caused in part by customers supply chain challenges, as well as inflation, led to higher input costs including fuel and subcontractor expenses, as well as increased project-related travel and equipment rental costs incurred to fulfill electric infrastructure services. Fuel costs alone increased 32.7 million, including 7.3 million related to Riggs Distler, and project-related travel expenses increased 12.7 million in 2022. A loss of 7.5 million was incurred on a gas infrastructure bid project during the year due to higher costs than anticipated and scheduling delays. This project is anticipated to reach substantial completion in the first quarter of 2023. Also included in total Utility infrastructure services expenses were general and administrative costs, which increased approximately 4 million between years, primarily attributable to higher costs incurred by Riggs Distler of 7 million, in addition to strategic review and severance costs of 6.1 million (combined), as well as other administrative costs due to the continued growth in the business. These were partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs in 2022 and 14 million in professional fees in connection with the acquisition of Riggs Distler in 2021, which did not recur. Gains on sale of equipment (reflected as an offset to Utility infrastructure services expenses) were approximately 6.4 million and 6.9 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 37.7 million between 2022 and 2021, of which 34.9 million relates to Riggs Distler. The remaining increase was attributable to equipment and computer systems purchased to support the growing volume of infrastructure work overall. Depreciation expense, relative to the revenues recorded, was generally consistent during 2022 compared to 2021. 
 The increase in net interest deductions of 40.4 million was primarily due to incremental outstanding borrowings in connection with the 2021 acquisition of Riggs Distler under Centuri s 1.445 billion amended and restated secured revolving credit and term loan facility, in addition to higher interest rates on outstanding variable-rate borrowings. 
 Income tax expense decreased 13 million between 2022 and 2021, primarily due to reduced profitability in 2022. 
 
 Results of Pipeline and Storage 
 Year Ended December 31, (Thousands of dollars) 2022 Regulated operations revenues 264,613 Operating expenses: Net cost of gas sold 9,843 Operations and maintenance expense 100,263 Depreciation and amortization 52,059 Taxes other than income taxes 10,186 Goodwill impairment 449,606 Operating loss (357,344) Other income 2,128 Net interest deductions 18,185 Loss before income taxes (373,401) Income tax benefit (89,668) Contribution to consolidated results (283,733) 
 The pipeline and storage entities of MountainWest were part of an acquisition on December 31, 2021, which have since been sold to Williams (closed on February 14, 2023). Operating results for the Pipeline and Storage segment during 2022 included rate-regulated transmission and subscription storage revenues of 248.3 million. Results include a goodwill impairment loss of 449.6 million as a result of the sale of MountainWest at a price less than the equity interests in MountainWest. Operating expenses also include approximately 26 million related to the stand-up of processes and systems which, following the earlier 

6 

acquisition, were under a Transition Services Agreement with the previous seller, in addition to certain employee retention payments. 
 
 Rates and Regulatory Proceedings 
 Southwest is subject to the regulation of the Arizona Corporation Commission (the ACC ), the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada (the PUCN ), the California Public Utilities Commission (the CPUC ), and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the FERC ). Due to the size of Southwest s regulated operations and the frequency of rate cases and other procedural activities with its commissions, the following discussion focuses primarily on the proceedings within its natural gas distribution operations. 
 General Rate Relief and Rate Design 
 Rates charged to customers vary according to customer class and rate jurisdiction and are set by the individual state and federal regulatory commissions that govern Southwest s service territories. Southwest makes periodic filings for rate adjustments as the cost of providing service (including the cost of natural gas purchased) changes, and as additional investments in new or replacement pipeline and related facilities are made. Rates are intended to provide for recovery of all commission-approved costs and a reasonable return on investment. The mix of fixed and variable components in rates assigned to various customer classes (rate design) can significantly impact the operating margin actually realized by Southwest. Management has worked with its regulatory commissions in designing rate structures that strive to provide affordable and reliable service to its customers while mitigating volatility in prices to customers and stabilizing returns to investors. Such rate structures were in place in all of Southwest s operating areas during all periods for which results of natural gas distribution operations are disclosed above. 
 Arizona Jurisdiction 
 Arizona General Rate Case. In December 2021, Southwest filed a general rate case application proposing a revenue increase of approximately 90.7 million. Although updated rates related to the previous rate case became effective in January 2021, the most significant driver for the December 2021 request was the necessity to reflect in rates the substantial capital investments that have been made since the end of the test year in the previous case, including the customer information system implemented in May 2021. The filing was based on a test year ended August 31, 2021 and proposed a return on common equity of 9.90 relative to a target equity ratio of 51 . Southwest also proposed a twelve-month post-test year adjustment to reflect otherwise non-revenue producing plant in service as of August 31, 2022 and certain expense adjustments. Recovery (over three years) of the approximately 12 million related to the outstanding deferral balance associated with the LNG facility (see below) was included in the request, along with the approximate 2.1 million (also over three years) in late payment charges that were suppressed from customer accounts during the COVID-19 pandemic. A request to continue the Delivery Charge Adjustment DCA ), Southwest s full-revenue decoupling mechanism, was also included, while the only proposed change to Southwest s existing rate design contemplated the year-round offering of the Low Income Ratepayer Assistance program. 
 At a hearing held in September 2022, Southwest, the Utilities Division Staff (the Staff ), and the Residential Utility Consumer Office jointly stipulated to several issues, including a target capital structure consisting of 50 equity and 50 debt; a 9.30 return on equity; and foregoing recovery of the requested COVID-19 moratorium waived late fees, as well as an acquisition premium related to the recent Graham County acquisition. Among the uncontested issues identified prior to the hearing were the continuation of the DCA mechanism, the continuation of the existing rate design, and Southwest s alternate property tax expense calculation, reflecting actual incurred property tax expense in 2021, instead of a pro forma adjustment reflecting forecasted property tax expense. The Administrative Law Judge issued the Recommended Opinion and Order in mid-December 2022, and the ACC approved a modified final order at their January 10, 2023 open meeting, authorizing a 54.3 million increase. New rates were effective February 1, 2023. 
 Delivery Charge Adjustment. The DCA is filed each April, which along with other reporting requirements, contemplates a rate to recover the over- or under-collected margin tracker (decoupling mechanism) balance. An April 2022 request proposed a rate to return 10.5 million, the over-collected balance existing at the end of the first quarter 2022, which was approved effective July 1, 2022. A filing will be made prior to the end of April 2023 to request a rate to address the outstanding balance at March 31, 2023. 
 Tax Reform. A Tax Expense Adjustor Mechanism TEAM was approved in Southwest s 2019 general rate case to timely recognize tax rate changes resulting from federal or state tax legislation following the TEAM implementation. In addition, the TEAM tracks and returns/recovers the revenue requirement impact of changes in amortization of EADIT (including that which resulted from 2017 U.S. federal tax reform) compared to the amount authorized in the most recently concluded rate case. In December 2021, Southwest filed its inaugural TEAM rate application, which proposed a 4.7 million refund, comprised of an approximate 9 million decrease in revenue requirement offset by an under-collected balance of 4.3 million. Staff issued a proposed order supporting the TEAM credit, which was approved by the ACC with rates effective November 1, 2022. In 

7 

December 2022, Southwest filed its second TEAM rate application, which proposes to update the TEAM surcredit effective April 2023 to incorporate a base revenue reduction of 6.6 million. A decision is anticipated in the second quarter of 2023. 
 Liquefied Natural Gas LNG Facility . In 2014, Southwest sought ACC preapproval to construct, operate, and maintain a 233,000 dekatherm LNG facility in southern Arizona. This facility is intended to enhance service reliability and flexibility related to natural gas deliveries in the southern Arizona area by providing a local storage option, connecting directly to Southwest s distribution system. Southwest was ultimately granted approval for construction and deferral of costs. The facility was placed in service in December 2019. The capital costs and operating expenses associated with plant operation were approved and considered as part of Southwest s 2019 general rate case. Approximately 12 million in costs, incurred following the in-service date of the facility and after the period considered as part of the 2019 general rate case, were deferred in the authorized regulatory asset. These costs will be amortized over four years consistent with the ACC s decision in the most recent general rate case. 
 Customer-Owned Yard Line COYL Program. Southwest originally received approval, in connection with its 2010 Arizona general rate case, to implement a program to conduct leak surveys, and if leaks were present, to replace and relocate service lines and meters for Arizona customers whose meters were set off from the customer s home, representing a non-traditional configuration. A filing in May 2021 proposed the recovery of previously unrecovered surcharge revenue from 2019 and 2020 (collectively, 13.7 million) over a one-year period. Such amounts related to plant investments that were made in advance of those periods. In November 2021, the ACC approved full recovery within the proposed timeline, the rate for which was implemented the same month. In a February 2022 filing, Southwest requested and received approval to increase its surcharge revenue by 3.4 million to recover the revenue requirement associated with investments made since August 2020 and through calendar year 2021. The rate was implemented in June 2022. A decrease in the COYL rate became effective in November 2022 to reflect the expiration of the collection period associated with the 2019 and 2020 COYL program revenue referred to above. Recovery of the remaining investments is ongoing. 
 Vintage Steel Pipe Program VSP . Southwest received approval, in connection with its 2016 Arizona general rate case, to implement a VSP replacement program, due to having a substantial amount of pre-1970s vintage steel pipe in Arizona. However, as part of Southwest s 2020 rate case decision, the ACC ultimately decided to discontinue the accelerated VSP program. A filing in May 2021 proposed the recovery of previously unrecovered surcharge revenue relating to investments during 2019 and 2020, with approximately 60 million to be recovered over a three-year period. In November 2021, the ACC approved full recovery over the proposed three-year timeline with updated rates, which became effective in March 2022. 
 Graham County Utilities. In April 2021, Southwest and Graham County Utilities, Inc. GCU filed a joint application with the ACC for approval to transfer assets of GCU to Southwest and extend Southwest s Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity to serve the more than 5,000 associated customers, for a purchase price of 3.5 million. Approval of the application by the ACC was received in December 2021, with final transfer in mid-January 2022. Former GCU customers retained their existing rates while Southwest s most recent rate case was processed; however, the customers will move to Southwest s rates February 1, 2023, consistent with the effective date of new rates associated with Southwest s most recent general rate case. 
 California Jurisdiction 
 California General Rate Case. Southwest s most recent general rate case concluded following an agreement in principle with the Public Advocate s Office, unanimously approved by the CPUC on March 25, 2021, including a 6.4 million total combined revenue increase with a 10 return on common equity, relative to a 52 equity ratio. Approximately 4 million of the original proposed increase was associated with a North Lake Tahoe project that would not ultimately be completed by the beginning of 2021; consequently, the parties agreed to provide for recovery of the cost of service impacts of the project through the annual attrition filing. The rate case decision maintains Southwest s existing 2.75 annual attrition adjustments and the continuation of the pension balancing account. It also includes cumulative expenditures totaling 119 million over the five-year rate cycle to implement risk-informed proposals, consisting of a school COYL replacement, meter protection, and pipe replacement programs. New rates were ultimately implemented April 1, 2021, with Southwest permitted to establish a general rate case memorandum account to track the impacts of a delay in the implementation of new rates (between January 1, 2021 and the date rates were implementation) for purposes of later recovery. 
 Attrition Filing. Following the 2021 implementation of new rates approved as part of the recently concluded general rate case, Southwest is also authorized to continue annual Post Test Year PTY attrition increases of 2.75 , the first of which began in January 2022, with the latest such increase effective in January 2023. 
 Customer Data Modernization Initiative CDMI ). In April 2019, Southwest filed an application with the CPUC seeking authority to establish a two-way, interest-bearing balancing account to record costs associated with the CDMI to mitigate adverse financial implications related to the multi-year project (including a new customer information system, ultimately implemented in May 2021). Effective October 2019, the CPUC granted a memorandum account, which allowed Southwest to track costs, including operations and maintenance costs and capital-related costs, such as depreciation, taxes, and return 

8 

associated with California s portion of the CDMI (initially estimated at 19 million). The balance tracked in the memorandum account was transferred to the two-way balancing account in July 2020. A rate to begin recovering the balance accumulated through June 30, 2020 was established and made effective September 1, 2020, and updated multiple times since, including in January 2023, with ongoing updates expected at least annually. 
 Carbon Offset Program. In March 2022, Southwest filed an application to seek approval to offer a voluntary program to California customers to purchase carbon offsets in an effort to provide customers additional options to reduce their respective GHG emissions. A request to establish a two-way balancing account to track program-related costs and revenues was included as part of the application. The CPUC issued Decision 22-09-010 dismissing Southwest s application without prejudice. Southwest intends to file a new application in the second quarter 2023 addressing the concerns raised by third parties, which included a request to demonstrate that purchased offsets would result in GHG emissions reductions. 
 Building Decarbonization. A CPUC decision was issued regarding the elimination of monetary allowances for gas line extensions, a 10-year refundable payment option, and the 50 discount payment option for both residential and non-residential customers of all California gas utilities. This applies to new applications for gas line extensions submitted on or after July 1, 2023. Although this decision eliminates the various allowances related to line extensions, it does not preclude extending natural gas service to customers in California. 
 Residential Disconnection Protections. A decision was issued by the CPUC establishing disconnection protections for residential customers of small and multi-jurisdictional utilities, including Southwest. A similar decision was adopted for four large California utilities in 2020. This decision prohibits the utility from assessing credit deposits for residential customers in establishing or re-establishing service, and prohibits the assessment of reconnection fees for residential customers, among other provisions. The decision, however, also provides authorization to establish a two-way balancing account to track residential uncollectible charges for future recovery in a general rate case, subject to a relevant cap. 
 Nevada Jurisdiction 
 Nevada General Rate Case. Southwest filed its most recently concluded Nevada general rate case in August 2021, which was further updated by a certification filing in December 2021. The request proposed a combined revenue increase of approximately 28.7 million (as of the certification date); the most significant driver for which was the substantial capital investments that were made since the end of the test year in the previous case, including the customer information system implemented in May 2021. The filing included a proposed return on common equity of 9.90 with a target equity ratio of 51 ; recovery of previously deferred late payment charges related to a regulatory asset associated with COVID-19; and continuation of full revenue decoupling under the General Revenues Adjustment GRA mechanism. On February 7, 2022, the parties filed a stipulation with the PUCN, providing for a statewide revenue increase of 14.05 million, a return on common equity of 9.40 relative to a 50 target equity ratio, and continuation of Southwest s full revenue decoupling mechanism. The stipulation was approved by the PUCN, and new rates became effective April 1, 2022. The PUCN s order did not include recovery of the approximate 6.6 million in deferred late payment charges related to a regulatory asset associated with COVID-19, which had previously been reserved. 
 General Revenues Adjustment . As noted above, the continuation of the GRA was affirmed as part of Southwest s most recent general rate case with an expansion to include a large customer class (with average monthly throughput requirements greater than 15,000 therms), effective April 2022. Southwest makes Annual Rate Adjustment ARA filings to update rates to recover or return amounts associated with various regulatory mechanisms, including the GRA. Southwest made its most recent ARA filing in November 2022 related to balances as of September 30, 2022, with new rates expected to become effective July 1, 2023. While there is no impact to net income overall from adjustments to recovery rates associated with the related regulatory balances, operating cash flows are impacted by such changes. 
 COYL Program . In August 2021, Southwest filed a joint petition with the Regulatory Operations Staff of the PUCN proposing a Nevada COYL replacement program to include residential COYLs, public school COYLs, and any other COYLs that are identified to be a safety concern. The petition was approved in January 2022 and provides for capital investments up to 5 million per year for five years and the establishment of a regulatory asset to track the capital-related costs. After five years, the program will be reassessed to determine if it should be continued. 
 Infrastructure Replacement Mechanism. In 2014, the PUCN approved final rules for the Gas Infrastructure Replacement GIR mechanism, which provided for the deferral and recovery of certain costs associated with accelerated replacement of qualifying infrastructure that would not otherwise provide incremental revenues between general rate cases. Associated with the replacement of various types of pipe infrastructure under the mechanism (Early Vintage Plastic Pipe, COYL, and VSP), the related regulations provide Southwest with the opportunity to file a GIR Advance Application annually to seek preapproval of qualifying replacement projects. 

9 

In cases where preapproval of projects is requested and granted, a GIR rate application is separately filed to reset the GIR recovery surcharge rate related to previously approved and completed projects. On September 27, 2022, Southwest filed its latest rate application to reset the recovery surcharge in January 2023 to include cumulative deferrals through August 31, 2022. However, in November 2022, Southwest reached a settlement with parties to discontinue the GIR, and determined it would not plan to seek further ratemaking recovery, related to which, it wrote off the immaterial remaining balance. 
 Conservation and Energy Efficiency. The PUCN allows deferral (and later recovery) of approved conservation and energy efficiency costs, recovery rates for which are adjusted in association with ARA filings. In its November 2022 ARA filing, Southwest proposed an annualized margin increase of 139,000 and a decrease of 290,000 for southern and northern Nevada, respectively. A PUCN decision is anticipated in the second quarter 2023 with rates expected to become effective July 2023. Separately, in May 2022, Southwest filed an application seeking approval of its annual Conservation and Energy Efficiency Plan Report for 2021, with no proposed modifications to the previously approved 1.3 million annual budget for years 2022-2024. The parties reached a stipulation that was approved by the PUCN in July 2022. 
 Expansion and Economic Development Legislation. In January 2016, final regulations were approved by the PUCN associated with legislation SB 151 previously introduced and signed into law in Nevada. The legislation authorized natural gas utilities to expand their infrastructure to provide service to unserved and underserved areas in Nevada. 
 In November 2017, Southwest filed for preapproval of a project to extend service to Mesquite, Nevada, in accordance with the SB 151 regulations, which was ultimately approved. Southwest provides periodic updates, and requests adjustment of recovery rates (as part of ARA filings and other rate proceedings) for the revenue requirement associated with the investments to serve customers. As of December 2022, ap proximately 49 mile s of natural gas infrastructure have been installed throughout the Mesquite expansion area. 
 In June 2019, Southwest filed for preapproval to construct the infrastructure necessary to expand natural gas service to Spring Creek, near Elko, Nevada, and to implement a cost recovery methodology to recover the associated revenue requirement consistent with the SB 151 regulations. The expansion facilities consist of a high-pressure approach main and associated regulator stations, an interior backbone, and an extension of the distribution system from the interior backbone. The total capital investment was estimated to be 61.9 million. A stipulation was reached with the parties and approved by the PUCN in December 2019, including a rate recovery allocation amongst northern Nevada, Elko, and Spring Creek expansion customers. Construction began in the third quarter of 2020, with service to customers starting in December 2020. As of December 2022, approximately 60 miles of natural gas infrastructure have been installed throughout the Spring Creek expansion area, with completion anticipated in 2026. 
 Carbon Offset Program. In June 2021, Southwest filed an application to seek approval to offer a voluntary program to northern and southern Nevada customers to purchase carbon offsets in an effort to provide customers additional options to reduce their GHG emissions. A request to establish a regulatory asset to track program-related costs and revenues was included as part of the application. The parties reached a stipulation that was approved by the PUCN in December 2021, approving Southwest s proposal. The program opened for participation in the fourth quarter of 2022. 
 FERC Jurisdiction 
 General Rate Case. Great Basin Gas Transmission Company Great Basin ), a wholly owned subsidiary of Southwest, reached an agreement in principle with the FERC Staff providing that its three largest transportation customers and all storage customers would be required to have primary service agreement terms of at least five years, that term-differentiated rates would continue generally, and included a 9.90 pre-tax rate of return. Interim rates were made effective February 2020. As part of the settlement, Great Basin will not file a rate case later than May 31, 2025. 
 MountainWest Overthrust Pipeline. On September 22, 2022, the FERC issued an order initiating an investigation, pursuant to section 5 of the Natural Gas Act, to determine whether rates currently charged by MountainWest Overthrust Pipeline, LLC, a subsidiary of MountainWest, are just and reasonable and setting the matter for hearing (the Section 5 Rate Case ). Unless earlier settled by the parties, a hearing on the matter is to commence on August 1, 2023 with an initial decision from the presiding administrative law judge due by November 14, 2023. Under the terms of the MountainWest Purchase Agreement, the Company is obligated, for a period of four years following the closing of the sale of MountainWest, to indemnify Williams and MountainWest for any damages and liabilities resulting from the Section 5 Rate Case, including any reduction to the current applicable rate, up to a cap of 75 million. Williams has agreed that it will not enter into any settlement of the Section 5 Rate Case that will result in any damages being paid by the Company under such indemnity without the prior written consent of the Company (and such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). The range of loss, if any, that could result from this matter cannot currently be estimated.

PGA Filings 
 The rate schedules in all of Southwest s service territories contain provisions that permit adjustments to rates as the cost of purchased gas changes. These deferred energy provisions and purchased gas adjustment clauses are collectively referred to as PGA clauses. Differences between gas costs recovered from customers and amounts paid for gas by Southwest result in over- or under-collections. Balances are recovered from or refunded to customers on an ongoing basis with interest. As of December 31, 2022, under-collections in each of Southwest s service territories resulted in an asset of approximately 450.1 million on the Company s and Southwest s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The market price of natural gas spiked due to numerous market forces including historically low storage levels, unexpected upstream pipeline maintenance events, and cold weather conditions across the western region in the latter part of 2022 and continuing into January 2023. As a result of this increase in pricing, Southwest entered into a 450 million term loan in order to fund the incremental cost. We may be required to incur additional indebtedness in connection with future spikes in natural gas prices as a result of extreme weather events or otherwise. See also Deferred Purchased Gas Costs in Note 1 - Background, Organization, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . 
 Filings to change rates in accordance with PGA clauses are subject to audit by state regulatory commission staffs. PGA changes impact cash flows, but have no direct impact on operating margin. However, gas cost deferrals and recoveries can impact comparisons between periods of individual consolidated income statement components. These include Regulated operations revenues, Net cost of gas sold, Net interest deductions, and Other income (deductions). 
 The following table presents Southwest s outstanding PGA balances receivable/(payable) at the end of its two most recent fiscal years: 
 December 31, (Thousands of dollars) 2022 2021 Arizona 292,472 214,387 Northern Nevada 27,384 12,632 Southern Nevada 122,959 55,967 California 7,305 8,159 450,120 291,145 
 Arizona PGA Filings. In Arizona, Southwest calculates the change in the gas cost component of customer rates monthly (to allow for timely refunds to/recoveries from customers), utilizing a rolling twelve-month average. During 2022, the Gas Cost Balancing Account continued with a surcharge in order to recover the under-collected balance. 
 California Gas Cost Filings. In California, a monthly gas cost adjustment based on forecasted monthly prices is utilized. Monthly adjustments modeled in this fashion provide the timeliest recovery of gas costs in any Southwest jurisdiction. 
 Nevada ARA Application. In November 2022, Southwest filed to adjust its quarterly Deferred Energy Account Adjustment rate, which is based upon a twelve-month rolling average, in addition to requesting adjusted Base Tariff Energy rates, both of which were most recently approved effective July 2022. These new rates are intended to address the outstanding balances over a twelve-month period. 
 Gas Price Volatility and Mitigation 
 To mitigate price volatility to its customers, Southwest periodically enters into fixed-price term contracts under its volatility mitigation programs for up to 25 of the California jurisdictions annual normal weather supply needs and to a limited extent, in the Arizona jurisdiction. For the 2022/2023 heating season, contracts contained in the fixed-price portion of the supply portfolio ranged from approximately 4.59 to approximately 9.89 per dekatherm. In consultation with its regulators, for periods beyond October 2020, Southwest currently does not plan to make any fixed-price term purchases in other than California (as set above), nor to enter into swap agreements. Southwest s natural gas purchases, not covered by fixed-price contracts, are under variable-price contracts with firm quantities, or on the spot market. The contract price for these contracts is either determined at the beginning of each month to reflect the published first-of-month index price, or at market prices based on a published daily price index. In each case, the index price is not published or known until the purchase period begins. 
 Pipeline Safety Regulation 
 In July 2021, the PUCN issued an order revising its regulations to require annual leak surveys (previously every three years) of all distribution pipelines transporting natural gas and/or liquefied petroleum, effective January 1, 2023. In conjunction with this change, the PUCN authorized the establishment of a regulatory asset account to track the incremental cost of compliance related to the new regulation, for consideration in a future general rate case filing. 

11 

In March 2022, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration PHMSA issued final rules that amended the federal pipeline safety regulations applicable to the valve installation and minimum rupture detection standards for gas transmission pipelines (effective October 2022). Southwest has integrated the requirements of this new rule into its operating procedures. In addition, in August 2022, PHMSA issued final rules that amended the federal pipeline safety regulations applicable to the integrity management of gas transmission pipelines (effective May 2023). Southwest is integrating the requirements of this new rule into its operating procedures related to repair criteria, integrity management improvements, cathodic protection, management of change, and other related gas transmission integrity related amendments. 
 Southwest continues to monitor changing pipeline safety legislation and participates, to the extent possible, in providing public comments and working with industry associations, such as the American Gas Association, in shaping regulatory language associated with these new mandates and reporting requirements. Additionally, management works with its state and federal commissions to develop customer rates that are responsive to incremental costs of compliance. However, due to the timing of when rates are implemented in response to new requirements, and as additional rules are developed, compliance requirements could impact expenses and the timing and amount of capital expenditures for Southwest. 
 
 Capital Resources and Liquidity 
 Historically , cash on hand and cash flows from operations have provided a substantial portion of cash used in investing activities (primarily construction expenditures and property additions). In recent years, Southwest has accelerated pipe replacement activities to fortify system integrity and reliability, including on an accelerated basis in association with certain gas infrastructure replacement programs. This activity has necessitated the issuance of both debt and equity securities to supplement cash flows from operations. The Company, in executing on its interim plans to fund the 2021 MountainWest acquisition, initially funded the transaction through short-term borrowings, which were expected to be refinanced through a multi-pronged permanent financing plan, part of which was executed during the first quarter of 2022 when the Company used 452 million in net proceeds from an underwritten offering of common stock to repay a portion of the short-term borrowings. Also, in September 2022, the Company amended the short-term borrowing arrangement related to the remaining acquisition indebtedness to extend the maturity date to December 2023 and replace the benchmark borrowin g rates. Upon the close of the MountainWest sale in February 2023, the Company paid down 1.075 billion of the term loan associated with the earlier acquisition indebtedness. The C ompan y s capitalization strategy is to maintain an appropriate balance of equity and debt to preserve investment-grade credit ratings, which help minimize interest costs. Investment-grade credit ratings have been maintained by the Company. 
 Cash Flows 
 Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc.: 
 Operating Cash Flows. Cash flows provided by consolidated operating activities increased 296 million between 2022 and 2021. The improvement in operating cash flows primarily resulted from the change in purchased gas costs in the PGA mechanism, including amounts incurred and deferred, as well as impacts related to when amounts are incorporated in customer bills to recover or return deferred balances. Amounts were greatly impacted due to the higher than expected natural gas costs during the winter period noted above in PGA Filings . Other impacts include a decrease in net income, and the impact of changes in components of working capital overall. Depreciation and amortization impact earnings, but not cash flows directly. As described above, an impairment was recognized related to the negotiated sale price associated with MountainWest, also impacting earnings, but did not impact cash flows directly in 2022. 
 The corporate and administrative expenses/outflows for Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. include outlays related to stockholder activism and the strategic review, in addition to financing costs for debt used to fund the MountainWest acquisition. 
 Investing Cash Flows. Cash used in consolidated investing activities decreased 2.2 billion in 2022 as compared to 2021 . The change was primarily due to the acquisitions of Riggs Distler by Centuri and MountainWest by Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc., in 2021, including post-closing true-up amounts under the agreements. The overall decrease was partly offset by an increase in capital expenditures in both the natural gas distribution and utility infrastructure services segments. 
 Financing Cash Flows. Net cash provided by consolidated financing activities decreased 2.7 billion in 2022 as compared to 2021. T he change was primarily due to financing the acquisitions of MountainWest and Riggs Distler. The Company entered into a 364-day 1.6 billion Term Loan Facility to temporarily fund the MountainWest acquisition in 2021, and Centuri entered into an amended and restated credit agreement providing for a 1.145 billion secured term loan facility and a 400 million secured revolving credit facility, which in addition to funding the Riggs Distler acquisition, refinanced its previous 590 million loan facility in 2021. 
 The Company reduced its 364-day Term Loan facility through net proceeds of 452 million from the issuance of common stock in an underwritten public offering in 2022. Furthermore, debt proceeds were received by Southwest from a March 2022 issuance of 600 million in notes and an additional December 2022 issuance of 300 million in notes, offset by a pay down in 

12 

February 2022 of 25 million in 7.78 series Medium-term notes then maturing, as well as 250 million in notes maturing in April 2022. 
 The capital requirements and resources of the Company generally are determined independently for the individual business segments. Each business segment is generally responsible for securing its own financing sources. However, the holding company may raise funds through stock issuances or other external financing sources in support of each business segment. 
 Southwest Gas Corporation: 
 Operating Cash Flows. Cash flows provided by operating activities increased 259 million between 2022 and 2021. The improvement in operating cash flows was primarily attributable to the impacts related to deferred purchased gas costs and the related regulatory mechanism (described above), as well as changes in other working capital components overall. 
 Investing Cash Flows. Cash used in investing activities increased 69 million in 2022 as compared to 2021, primarily due to the increase in cash outlays for construction expenditures. See also 2022 Construction Expenditures below . 
 Financing Cash Flows. Net cash provided by financing activities decreased 175 million in 2022 as compared to 2021. During 2022 no parent capital was contributed to Southwest, but in 2021, over 200 million was contributed to Southwest. Southwest issued 600 million in notes in March 2022 used to pay down amounts then outstanding under its credit facility, paid down 25 million in maturing notes in February 2022, redeemed 250 million in notes maturing in April 2022, and issued an additional 300 million in notes in December 2022. In 2021, Southwest borrowed 250 million in a term loan for financing a gas cost run-up surrounding Winter Storm Uri and issued 300 million in notes. Other financing activity related to borrowing and repayments under Southwest s credit facility. 
 2022 Construction Expenditures 
 During the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, total gas plant in service increased from 7.8 billion to 9.5 billion , or at an average annual rate of 7 . Replacement, new business, and reinforcement work was a substantial portion of the plant increase during the three-year noted. Customer growth impacted expenditures as Southwest set approximately 116,000 meters during this time, which is reflected in new business. 
 During 2022, construction expenditures (through cash outlays) for the natural gas distribution segment were 683 million. The majority of these expenditures represented costs associated with replacement of existing transmission and distribution plant to fortify system integrity and reliability, as well as general plant additions. Cash flows from operating activities of Southwest were 284 million , providing approximately 35 of construction expenditures and dividend requirements of the natural gas operations segment. O ther funding was provided by cash on hand, external financing activities, and funds from the existing credit facility. 
 2022 Financing Activity 
 In March 2022, the Company sold, through a prospectus supplement under its Universal Shelf (as defined below), an aggregate of 6.325 million shares of common stock, with an underwritten public offering price of 74.00 per share, resulting in proceeds to the Company of 452.3 million, net of the underwriters discount of 15.8 million. These net proceeds were used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the 364-day term loan credit agreement to earlier fund the MountainWest acquisition. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company had up to 342 million of common stock available for sale under its Equity Shelf Program (as defined below). See Note 7 - Common Stock for more information. 
 Net proceeds received under the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan during 2022 was approximately 10.5 million, from the issuance of approximately 142,000 shares of Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. common stock. 
 Gas Segment Construction Expenditures, Debt Maturities, and Financing 
 Management estimates natural gas distribution segment const ruction expenditures during the three-year period ending December 31, 2025 will be approximately 2.0 billion. Of this amount, approximately 665 million to 685 million is expected to be incurred in 2023. Southwest plans to continue to request regulatory support to undertake projects, or to accelerate projects as necessary, for the improvement of system flexibility and reliability, or to expand, where relevant, to unserved or underserved areas. Southwest may expand existing, or initiate new, programs. Significant replacement activities are expected to continue well beyond the next few years. During the three-year period ending December 31, 2025, cash flows from operating activities of Southwest are expected to provide approximat ely 77 of the funding for gas operations of Southwest and total construction expenditures and dividend requirements. From a debt maturity standpoint , Southwest has a 225 million Term Loa n due in March 2023. Any additional cash requirements, including construction-related, and any paydown or refinancing of debt, are expected to be provided by existing credit facilities, equity contributions from the Company, and/or other external financing sources. The timing, types, and amounts of any additional external financings will be dependent on a number of factors, 

13 

including the cost of gas purchases, conditions in the capital markets, timing and amounts of rate relief, timing and amounts of surcharge collections from, or amounts returned to, customers related to other regulatory mechanisms, as well as growth levels in Southwest s service areas and earnings. External financings could include the issuance of debt securities, bank and other short-term borrowings, and other forms of financing. 
 Liquidity 
 Several factors (some of which are out of the control of the Company) that could significantly affect liquidity in future years include: variability of natural gas prices, changes in ratemaking policies of regulatory commissions, regulatory lag, customer growth in the natural gas distribution segment, the ability to access and obtain capital from external sources, interest rates, changes in income tax laws, pension funding requirements, inflation, and the level of earnings. Natural gas prices and related gas cost recovery rates, as well as plant investment, have historically had the most significant impact on liquidity, aside from the Company s recent strategic undertakings, including acquisition and disposition undertakings. 
 On an interim basis, Southwest defers over- or under-collections of gas costs to PGA balancing accounts. In addition, Southwest uses this mechanism to either refund amounts over-collected or recoup amounts under-collected as compared to the price paid for natural gas during the period since the last PGA rate change went into effect. At December 31, 2022, the combined balance in the PGA accounts totaled an under-collection of 450.1 million . As described earlier, the market price of natural gas spiked as a result of numerous market forces including historically low storage levels, unexpected upstream pipeline maintenance events, and cold weather conditions across the western region in the latter part of 2022 and continuing into January 2023. As a result of this increase in pricing, in January 2023, Southwest entered into a 364-day 450 million term loan in order to fund the incremental cost. We may be required to incur additional indebtedness in connection with future spikes in natural gas prices as a result of extreme weather events or otherwise. See PGA Filings for more information. 
 In March 2022, Southwest amended its 250 million Term Loan (first borrowed in March 2021), extending the maturity date to March 21, 2023. The proceeds were originally used to fund the increased cost of natural gas supply during the month of February 2021 caused by extreme weather conditions in the central U.S. during Winter Storm Uri. The March 2021 Term Loan was extended as a result of the current gas cost environment and management s funding plans for other gas purchases. At December 31, 2022, there was 225 million outstanding under the amended March 2021 Term Loan. 
 In March 2022, Southwest issued 600 million aggregate principal amount of 4.05 Senior Notes. The notes will mature in March 2032. Southwest used the net proceeds to redeem 250 million 3.875 notes due in April 2022 and to repay amounts then outstanding under its credit facility, with the remaining net proceeds used for general corporate purposes. 
 In December 2022, Southwest issued 300 million aggregate principal amount of 5.80 Senior Notes. The notes will mature in December 2027. Southwest used the net proceeds to repay amounts then outstanding under its credit facility, with the remaining net proceeds used for general corporate purposes. 
 Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. has a credit facility with a borrowing capacity o f 300 million that expires in December 2026. The total commitment amount available under the credit facility was increased by 100 million from 200 million to 300 million in December 2022. This facility is intended for short-term financing needs. At December 31, 2022, 173 million was outstanding under this facility, which was also the maximum amount outstanding during 2022 . 
 Southwest has a credit facility with a borrowing capacity of 400 million, which expires in April 2025. Southwest designates 150 million of the facility for long-term borrowing needs and the remaining 250 million for working capital purposes. The maximum amount outstanding during 2022 occurred during the fourth qu arter and was 285 million 150 million outstanding on the long-term portion of the credit facility, none under the commercial paper program, in addition to 135 million outstanding on the short-term portion). As of December 31, 2022, 50 million was outstanding on the long-term portion of the credit facility (no borrowings were outstanding under the commercial paper program), and no borrowings were outstanding on the short-term portio n. The credit facility has been used as necessary to meet liquidity requirements, including temporarily financing under-collected PGA balances, meeting the refund needs of over-collected balances, or temporarily funding capital expenditures. The credit facility has generally been adequate for Southwest s working capital needs outside of funds raised through operations and other types of external financing. 
 Southwest has a 50 million commercial paper program. Any issuance under the commercial paper program is supported by the revolving credit facility and, therefore, does not represent additional borrowing capacity. Any borrowing under the commercial paper program is designated as long-term debt. Interest rates for the commercial paper program are calculated at the then current commercial paper rate. At December 31, 2022, there were no borrowings outstanding under this program. 
 Centuri has a senior secured revolving credit and term loan multi-currency facility. The line of credit portion comprises 400 million ; associated amounts borrowed and repaid are available to be re-borrowed. The term loan facility portion provided approximately 1.145 billion in financing. The term loan facility expires on August 27, 2028 and the revolving credit facility expires on August 27, 2026 . This multi-currency facility allows the borrower to request loan advances in either Canadian 

14 

dollars or U.S. dollars. The obligations under the credit agreement are secured by present and future ownership interests in substantially all direct and indirect subsidiaries of Centuri, substantially all of the tangible and intangible personal property of each borrower, certain of their direct and indirect subsidiaries, and all products, profits, and proceeds of the foregoing. Centuri assets securing the facility at December 31, 2022 totaled 2.5 billion. The maximum amount outstanding on the combined facility during 2022 was 1.221 billion, which occurred in the first quarter, at which point 1.117 billion was outstanding on the term loan facility. As of December 31, 2022, 82 million was outstanding on the revolving credit facility, in addition to 1.009 billion that was outstanding on the term loan portion of the facility. A lso at December 31, 2022, there was approximately 254 million, net of letters of credit, available for borrowing under the line of credit. 
 In November 2022, Centuri amended the financial covenants of the revolving credit facility (the Centuri Credit Facility Amendment to increase the maximum total net leverage ratio during the period from December 31, 2022 through December 31, 2023. The Credit Facility Amendment also transitioned the interest rate benchmark for the revolving credit facility from LIBOR to SOFR. The applicable margin for the revolving credit facility now ranges from 1.0 to 2.5 for SOFR loans and from 0.0 to 1.5 for CDOR and base rate loans, depending on Centuri s total net leverage ratio. Further, the Centuri Credit Facility Amendment increases a letter of credit sub-facility from 100 million to 125 million. The Centuri Credit Facility Amendment did not modify any terms of the term loan facility. 
 In November 2021, the Company entered into a 1.6 billion delayed-draw Term Loan Facility that was funded on December 31, 2021 in connection with the acquisition of MountainWest. In March 2022, the Company used net proceeds from the issuance of common stock to repay a portion of borrowings under the Term Loan Facility. In September 2022, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Term Loan Facility. The amendment, among other things, (1) extended the maturity date of the Term Loan to December 30, 2023, and (2) replaced LIBOR interest rate benchmarks with SOFR interest rate benchmarks. There was 1.15 billion outstanding under this Term Loan Facility as of December 31, 2022. Upon the close of the MountainWest sale (February 14, 2023), the Company paid down 1.075 billion, resulting in an outstanding balance of 72 million as of the date of the date of closing the sale. 
 In April 2021, the Company entered into a Sales Agency Agreement between it and BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (the Equity Shelf Program for the offer and sale of up to 500 million of common stock from time to time in an at-the-market offering program. There was no activity under this multi-year program in 2022. Net proceeds from the sales of shares of common stock under the Equity Shelf Program are intended for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of property for the construction, completion, extension, or improvement of pipeline systems and facilities located in and around the communities served by Southwest, as well as for repayment or repurchase of indebtedness (including amounts outstanding from time to time under the credit facilities, senior notes, term loan or future credit facilities), and to provide for working capital. See Note 7 - Common Stock . 
 Interest rates for Centuri s term loan contain LIBOR-based rates. Certain LIBOR-based rates were discontinued as a benchmark or reference rate after 2021, while other LIBOR-based rates are scheduled to be discontinued after June 2023. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 1.009 billion in aggregate outstanding borrowings under Centuri s term loan facility. The conversion to an alternate rate is not expected to have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations; however, the alternative rate may be less predictable or less attractive than LIBOR. 
 Credit Ratings 
 Credit ratings apply to debt securities such as bonds, notes, and other debt instruments and do not apply to equity securities such as common stock. Borrowing costs and the ability to raise funds are directly impacted by the credit ratings of the Company. Credit ratings issued by nationally recognized ratings agencies (Moody s Investors Service, Inc. Moody s ), Standard Poor s Ratings Services Standard Poor s ), and Fitch Ratings Fitch )) provide a method for determining the creditworthiness of an issuer. Credit ratings are important because long-term debt constitutes a significant portion of total capitalization. These credit ratings are a factor considered by lenders when determining the cost of current and future debt for each debt obligor (i.e., generally the better the rating, the lower the cost to borrow funds). The current unsecured long-term debt ratings of the companies are considered investment grade.

 (1) Moody s debt ratings range from Aaa (highest rating possible) to C (lowest quality, usually in default). A numerical modifier of 1 (high end of the category) through 3 (low end of the category) is included with the rating to indicate the approximate rank of a company within the range. 
 (2) Standard Poor s S P debt ratings range from AAA (highest rating possible) to D (obligation is in default). The ratings from AA to CCC may be modified by the addition of a plus + or minus - sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories. 
 (3) Fitch debt ratings range from AAA (highest credit quality) to D (defaulted debt obligation). The modifiers + or - may be appended to a rating to denote relative status within major rating categories. 
 A credit rating, including the foregoing, is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold a debt security, but is intended to provide an estimation of the relative level of credit risk of debt securities, and is subject to change or withdrawal at any time by the rating agency. Numerous factors, including many that are not within management s control, are considered by the ratings agencies in connection with the assigning of credit ratings. 
 None of Southwest s debt instruments have credit triggers or other clauses that result in default if these bond ratings are lowered by rating agencies. Interest and fees on certain debt instruments are subject to adjustment depending on Southwest s bond ratings. Certain debt instruments are subject to a leverage ratio cap, and the 6.1 Notes due 2041 are also subject to a minimum net worth requirement. At December 31, 2022, Southwest was in compliance with all of its covenants. Under the most restrictive of the financial covenants, approximately 2.5 billion in additional debt could be issued and the leverage ratio requirement would still be met. At least 2 billion of cushion in equity relating to the minimum net worth requirement exists at December 31, 2022. No specific limitations as to dividends exist under the collective covenants. None of the debt instruments contain material adverse change clauses. 
 At December 31, 2022, Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. was also in compliance with all of the covenants of its credit facility and 364-day Term Loan. Interest and fees on its credit facility and 364-day Term Loan are subject to adjustment depending on its senior debt ratings. The credit facility and 364-day Term Loan are subject to a leverage ratio cap. Under the most restrictive of the financial covenants, approximately 1 billion in additional debt could be issued while still meeting the leverage ratio requirement. No specific limitations as to dividends exist under the collective covenants. The credit facility and 364-day Term Loan do not contain material adverse change clauses. 
 Certain Centuri debt instruments have leverage ratio caps and interest coverage ratio requirements. At December 31, 2022, Centuri was in compliance with all of its covenants. Under the most restrictive of the covenants, Centuri could issue approximately 222 million in additional debt and meet the leverage ratio requirement. Centuri has approximately 33 million of cushion relating to the minimum interest coverage ratio requirement. Centuri s revolving credit and term loan facility is secured by underlying assets of the utility infrastructure services segment. Centuri also has restrictions on how much it could give to the Company in cash dividends, which is limited to a calculated available amount, generally defined a s 50 of its rolling twelve-month consolidated net income adjusted for certain items, such as parent contributions inflows, Linetec redeemable noncontrolling interest payments, or dividend payments, among other adjustments, as applicable. 
 Inflation 
 Inflation can impact results of operations for each of the Company s business segments, and it has increased substantially over the past year. Labor, employee benefits, fuel, natural gas, professional services, and construction costs are the categories most significantly impacted by inflation. Changes to the cost of gas are generally recovered through PGA mechanisms and do not 

16 

significantly impact net earnings. Labor, employee benefits, and professional services are components of the cost of service, and gas infrastructure costs are the primary component of utility rate base. In order to recover increased costs, and earn a fair return on rate base, general rate cases or other procedural filings are made by our regulated operations, when deemed necessary, for review and approval by regulatory authorities. Regulatory lag, that is, the time between the date increased costs are incurred and the time such increases are recovered through the ratemaking process, can impact earnings. See Rates and Regulatory Proceedings for a discussion of recent rate case proceedings. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 Our largest contractual obligations as of December 31, 2022 consisted of: 
 Debt-related obligations for scheduled principal payments, other borrowings, and interest payments over the life of the debt. Debt obligations are included in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 8 - Debt for additional information. 
 Centuri operating and finance leases are included in our consolidated balance sheets and represent multi-year obligations for buildings, land, equipment, and vehicles. Southwest and MountainWest operating and finance leases are immaterial. See Note 2 - Regulated Operations Plant and Leases for additional information. 
 Southwest has gas purchase obligations that include fixed-price and variable-rate gas purchase contracts. Variable-rate contracts reflect minimum contractual obligations with estimation in pricing based on market information. Actual future variable-rate purchase commitments may vary depending on market prices at the time of delivery and values may change significantly from their estimated amounts. Certain other variable-rate contracts allow for variability in quantities for which associated demand charges are included in the gas purchase obligations based on the maximum daily quantities available under the contracts. Renewable natural gas purchase obligations, in which the commencement dates are not specifically determinable and the volumes and contract prices are inestimable until certain contract provisions are met, are excluded from gas purchase obligations. As of December 31, 2022, g as purchase obligations of 907 million are payable within the next 12 months. 
 Southwest has pipeline capacity and storage contracts for firm transportation service, both on a short- and long-term basis with several companies in all of its service territories, some with terms extending to 2044. Southwest also has interruptible contracts in place that allow additional capacity to be acquired should an unforeseen need arise. Costs associated with these pipeline capacity contracts are a component of the cost of gas sold and are recovered from customers primarily through the PGA mechanisms. As of December 31, 2022 pipeline capacity and storage obligations of 89.8 million are payable within 12 months. 
 Other commitments associated with noncancellable obligations consist primarily of software licensing, equipment, outsourced processing subscriptions, and operating and/or maintenance agreements, as applicable. 
 Estimated funding for pension and other postretirement benefits during calendar year 2023 is 59.3 million. Funding amounts for years beyond 2023 are not currently known. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Standards Updates 
 The Financial Accounting Standards Board routinely issues Accounting Standards Updates. See Note 1 - Background, Organization, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for more information regarding these Accounting Standards Updates and their potential impact on the Company s and Southwest s financial position, results of operations, and disclosures. 
 Application of Critical Accounting Policies 
 A critical accounting policy is one that is very important to the portrayal of the financial condition and results of a company, and requires the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments of management. The need to make estimates about the effect of items that are uncertain is what makes these judgments difficult, subjective, and/or complex. Management makes subjective judgments about the accounting and regulatory treatment of many items and bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments. These estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained, and as the operating environment changes. While management may make many estimates and judgments, many would not be materially altered, or provide a material impact to the financial statements taken as a whole, if different estimates, or means of estimation were employed. The following are accounting policies that are deemed critical to the financial statements. For more information regarding significant accounting policies, see notes to the consolidated financial statements. 
 Regulatory Accounting 
 Natural gas distribution operatio ns are subject to the specific regulation of the ACC, PUCN, CPUC, or the FERC, as applicable. The accounting policies of the Company and Southwest conform to U.S. GAAP applicable to rate-regulated entities and reflect the effects of the ratemaking process. As such, the Company and Southwest are allowed to defer, as regulatory assets, costs that otherwise would be expensed, if it is probable that future recovery from customers (subject to our rate-regulated operations) will occur. Companies are also permitted to recognize, as regulatory assets, amounts associated with various revenue 

17 

decoupling mechanisms, as long as the requirements of alternative revenue programs permitted under U.S. GAAP continue to be met. Management reviews the regulatory assets to assess their ultimate recoverability within the approved regulatory guidelines. If rate recovery is no longer probable, due to competition or the actions of regulators, write-off of the related regulatory asset (which would be recognized as current-period expense) is required. Regulatory liabilities are recorded if it is probable that revenues will be reduced for amounts that will be refunded to customers through the ratemaking process. The timing and inclusion of costs in rates is often delayed (regulatory lag) and results in a reduction of current-period earnings. Refer to Note 5 - Regulatory Assets and Liabilities . 
 Accrued Utility Revenues 
 Revenues related to the sale and/or delivery of natural gas are generally recorded when natural gas is delivered to customers. However, the determination of natural gas sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, operating margin associated with natural gas service that has been provided but not yet billed is accrued. This accrued utility revenue is estimated each month based primarily on applicable rates, number of customers, rate structure, analyses reflecting significant historical trends, seasonality, and experience. The interplay of these assumptions can impact the variability of the accrued utility revenue estimates. All Southwest rate jurisdictions have decoupled rate structures, limiting variability due to extreme weather conditions. 
 Accounting for Income Taxes 
 The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and Canada. Income tax calculations require estimates due to known future tax rate changes, book to tax differences, and uncertainty with respect to regulatory treatment of certain property items. The asset and liability method of accounting is utilized for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Regulatory tax assets and liabilities are recorded to the extent management believes they will be recoverable from, or refunded to, customers in future rates. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Management regularly assesses financial statement tax provisions to identify any change in the regulatory treatment or tax-related estimates, assumptions, or enacted tax rates that could have a material impact on cash flows, financial position, and/or results of operations. 
 Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits 
 Southwest has a noncontributory qualified retirement plan with defined benefits covering substantially all employees hired on or before December 31, 2021. In addition, there is a separate unfunded supplemental retirement plan which is limited to officers hired on or before December 31, 2021. Pension obligations and costs for these plans are affected by the amount and timing of cash contributions to the plans, the return on plan assets, discount rates, and by employee demographics, including age, compensation, and length of service. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future pension costs. Actuarial formulas are used in the determination of pension obligations and costs and are affected by actual plan experience and assumptions about future experience. Key actuarial assumptions include the expected return on plan assets, the discount rate used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs, and the assumed rate of increase in employee compensation. Relatively small changes in these assumptions (particularly the discount rate) may significantly affect pension obligations and costs for these plans. For example, a change of 0.25 in the discount rate assumption would change the pension plan projected benefit obligation by approximately 39 million and future pension expense by 4 million. A change of 0.25 in the employee compensation assumption would change the pension obligation by approximately 10 million and expense by 2 million. A 0.25 change in the expected asset return assumption would change pension expense by approximately 3 million (but has no impact on the pension obligation). 
 At December 31, 2022, the discount rate was 5.25 , an increase from the 3.00 rate used at December 31, 2021. The methodology utilized to determine the discount rate was consistent with prior years. The weighted-average rate of compensation escalation remained at 3.25 at December 31, 2022, the same as the rate used at December 31, 2021. T he asset return assumption is 6.75 to be used for 2023 expense, an increase from the 6.50 utilized for 2021. Pension costs for 2023 are estimated to decrease approximately 40 million as compared to that experienced in 2022. Future years expense level movements (up or down) will continue to be greatly influenced by long-term interest rates, asset returns, and funding levels. 
 Goodwill 
 Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually as of October, or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred before that time. As permitted under accounting guidance on testing goodwill for impairment, we perform either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative assessment of each of our reporting units based on management s judgment. Adjustment of values would only occur if conditions of impairment were deemed to be permanent. With respect to our qualitative assessments, we consider events and circumstances specific to us, such as macroeconomic 

18 

conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, and overall financial performance, when evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying amounts. The assumptions we use in our analysis, including discount rates, are subject to uncertainty, and declines in the future performance of our reporting units and changing business conditions could result in the recognition of impairment charges, which could be significant. The Company s reporting units are the same as its segments for purposes of impairment evaluation. In December 2022, the Company announced the planned sale of MountainWest. The Board determined to sell MountainWest in order to simplify the business. As the consideration to be received for the sale was below the equity interests in MountainWest, the Company recorded held for sale losses, including a pre-tax goodwill impairment loss of 449.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Further adjustments to this estimate are likely, as a result of post-closing true-up and validation processes contained in the sale agreement. See Note 15 - Acquisitions and Dispositions for additional information. 
 Held for Sale 
 The Company and Southwest recognize the assets and liabilities of a disposal group as held for sale in the period (i) they have approved and committed to a plan to sell the disposal group, (ii) the disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition, (iii) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions to sell the disposal group have been initiated, (iv) it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. The disposal group that is classified as held for sale is initially measured at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell. Any loss resulting from this measurement is recognized in the period in which the held for sale criteria are met. Upon designation as held for sale, the Company stops recording depreciation expense and assesses the fair value of the disposal group less any costs to sell at each reporting period and until it is no longer classified as held for sale. 
 In December 2022, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell 100 of MountainWest in an all-cash transaction to Williams for 1.5 billion in total enterprise value, subject to certain adjustments, which closed on February 14, 2023. In addition to the loss attributable to goodwill impairment, as noted above, the Company recognized an additional loss of 5.8 million related to estimated costs to sell. We use judgment to estimate such costs to sell, including consulting with external advisors and attorneys and considering the level of such costs in prior transactions. See Note 15 - Acquisitions and Dispositions for additional information. 
 Business Combinations 
 In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquired business are recorded at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. The amount of goodwill initially recognized in a business combination is based on the excess of the purchase price of the acquired company over the fair value of the other assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The determination of these fair values requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. For example, assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of future revenues and expenses associated with an asset are used to determine its fair value, but the actual timing and amount may differ materially, resulting in impairment of the asset s recorded value. In some cases, the Company engages independent third-party valuation firms to assist in determining the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities assumed. Critical assumptions used to value the trade name and customer relationship intangibles include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows of the acquired business, trademarks, trade names, customer relationships, technology obsolescence, attrition rates, royalty rates, and discount rates. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated at the acquisition date. These items are reevaluated quarterly, based upon facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date with any adjustments to the preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill, provided that the Company is within the twelve-month measurement period allowed by authoritative guidance. Subsequent to the measurement period or the final determination of the estimated value of the tax allowance or contingency, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances will affect the provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income, and could have a material impact on the Company s results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 15 - Acquisitions and Dispositions . 
 Certifications 
 The SEC requires the filing of certifications of the Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO of registrants regarding reporting accuracy, disclosure controls and procedures, and internal control over financial reporting as exhibits to periodic filings. The CEO and CFO certifications for the period ended December 31, 2022 are included as exhibits to the 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC.

In December 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors (the Board unanimously determined to take strategic actions to simplify the Company s portfolio of businesses. These actions included entering into a definitive agreement to sell of MountainWest in an all-cash transaction to Williams Partners Operating LLC Williams for billion in total enterprise value, subject to certain adjustments. Additionally, the Company determined it will pursue a spin-off of Centuri (the Centuri spin-off ), to form a new independent publicly traded utility infrastructure services company. The MountainWest transaction closed on February 14, 2023, following the expiration of an applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. The Centuri spin-off is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2023 or the first quarter of 2024 and to be tax free to the Company and its stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Centuri spin-off will be subject to, among other things, finalizing the transaction structure, final approval by the Board, approval by the Arizona Corporation Commission, the receipt of a favorable Internal Revenue Service private letter ruling relating to the tax-free nature of the transaction, and the effectiveness of a registration statement that will be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Upon classifying the pipeline and storage segment disposal group as held for sale, the Company recorded a loss, composed of a goodwill impairment loss of million, plus an additional loss of approximately million for estimated costs to sell , in the fourth quarter of 2022. The Company elected to not reclassify MountainWest s assets and liabilities as held for sale as of December 31, 2021; therefore, balance sheet information as of December 31, 2021 in the accompanying notes to financial statements has not been adjusted. See Note 15 - Acquisitions and Dispositions for additional information. 
 On May 6, 2022, the Company entered into a Cooperation Agreement (the Cooperation Agreement with Carl C. Icahn and the persons and entities referenced therein (collectively, the Icahn Group ). In accordance with the Cooperation Agreement, among other things, John P. Hester, then President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and Southwest, retired from his positions with the Company and Southwest and resigned from the Board. Karen S. Haller, the Company s former Executive Vice President/Chief Legal and Administrative Officer, was appointed President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and Chief Executive Officer of Southwest, and was appointed as a member of the Board effective immediately following the completion of the Company s 2022 annual meeting of stockholders. Justin L. Brown, formerly Southwest s Senior Vice President/General Counsel, was appointed as President of Southwest. 
 In addition, pursuant to the Cooperation Agreement, as modified by a letter agreement, dated as of August 3, 2022 (the "Letter Agreement" and together with the Cooperation Agreement, the "Initial Cooperation Agreement") by and between the Company and the Icahn Group, the Icahn Group has the ability to designate up to directors to the Board (collectively, the "Icahn Designees"), subject to certain ownership thresholds. As of the date of this Annual Report on 10-K, the Icahn Designees are Andrew W. Evans, Henry P. Linginfelter, Ruby Sharma, and Andrew J. Teno.

directors to directors, comprised of the existing members of the Strategic Transactions Committee in addition to the Initial Icahn Designees. As long as the Icahn Group has the ability to designate at least members of the Board, of such individuals are to be included on the Strategic Transactions Committee. If the Icahn Group may only designate members of the Board, then both would serve on the Strategic Transactions Committee. 
 On May 9, 2022, the Company also entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Rights Agreement dated October 10, 2021 (the Original Rights Agreement and as amended, the Amended Rights Agreement ), to increase the triggering percentage from to pursuant to the terms of the Initial Cooperation Agreement and permit the subsequent consummation of the Offer. The Amended Rights Agreement expired on October 9, 2022. The Company filed a Certificate of Elimination with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on January 13, 2023, eliminating from the Company's Certificate of Incorporation the Certificate of Designation of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock filed on October 10, 2022, and the associated Preferred Stock Purchase Rights were deregistered by the SEC and delisted by the New York Stock Exchange on the same day. 
 An earlier civil suit (initiated in November 2021) by Icahn entities against the Company and certain directors and officers of the Company was subject to a stipulation of dismissal as part of the Initial Cooperation Agreement, which also provided for the reimbursement by the Company of certain out-of-pocket third-party expenses, including certain legal fees, incurred by the Icahn Group. 
 On October 24, 2022, the Company and the Icahn Group entered into an Amended and Restated Cooperation Agreement (the Amended Cooperation Agreement ), which amended, restated, superseded, and replaced in its entirety the Initial Cooperation Agreement. Among other things, the Amended Cooperation Agreement provides for the nomination of the Icahn Designees for election at the Company's 2023 annual meeting of stockholders (the "2023 Annual Meeting"), the extension of the standstill restrictions on the Icahn Group through the 2023 Annual Meeting or the Company's 2024 annual meeting of stockholders, subject to certain restrictions and exceptions, and subject to certain ownership thresholds by the Icahn Group and the approval by the Strategic Transactions Committee, certain aspects of the corporate structure and conduct of the first annual meeting of any independent, publicly traded company resulting from a separation of the Company's businesses. 
 
 interest in W.S. Nicholls Western Construction Ltd. Western ), a Canadian infrastructure services company that is a variable interest entity. Centuri determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of the entity due to a shared-power structure; therefore, Centuri does not consolidate the entity and has recorded its investment, and results related thereto, using the equity method. The investment in Western, related earnings, and dividends received from Western in 2022 and 2021 were not significant. C enturi s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with Western was estimated at million as of December 31, 2022. 
 MountainWest, through its subsidiaries, holds a noncontrolling interest in MountainWest White River Hub, LLC, a FERC-regulated transporter of natural gas with facilities that connect with six interstate pipeline systems and a major processing plant in Colorado. As noted above, MountainWest does not consolidate the entity and has recorded its investment using the equity method. The investment in White River Hub is approximately million as of December 31, 2022 and the related proportional earnings and dividends in 2022 were not significant to the Company.

These life insurance policies on members of management and other key employees are used by Southwest to indemnify itself against the loss of talent, expertise, and knowledge, as well as to provide indirect funding for certain nonqualified benefit plans. The term non-regulated in regard to assets and related balances in the table above is in reference to the non-rate regulated operations of Centuri, and to a more limited extent, MountainWest as of year-end 2021. MountainWest is not reflected in the table above as of December 31, 2022, since the balance has been reclassified as held for sale on the Company s Consolidated Balance sheet as of that date.

The money market fund investments for Southwest were million at December 31, 2022 and insignificant at December 31, 2021. These investments fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, due to the asset valuation methods used by money market fund s. 
 Noncash investing activities for the Company and Southwest include capital expenditures that were not yet paid as of year end, thereby remaining in accounts payable, the amounts related to which increased by approximately million and million, for the Company and Southwest, respectively during the year ended December 31, 2022, and million and million, for the Company and Southwest, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2021. Additionally for Southwest, noncash investing activities include customer advances applied as contributions toward utility construction activity, such amounts were not significant for the periods presented herein. Also, see Note 2 - Regulated Operations Plant and Leases for information related to right-of-use ROU assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities, which are noncash investing and financing activities.

 The Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB issued guidance to allow an accounting policy election of either (i) treating taxes attributable to future taxable income related to Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income GILTI as a current period expense when incurred or (ii) recognizing deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years. The Company has elected to treat GILTI as a current period cost when incurred and has considered the estimated 2022 GILTI impact to its 2022 tax expense, which was immaterial.

 million in 2022 and million in 2021. Additionally, Southwest had gas pipe materials and operating supplies of million in 2022 and million in 2021 (carried at weighted average cost). MountainWest s materials and supplies were immaterial in the 2021 period in which they were included in the balance of Prepaid and other current assets in regard to the Company. 
 See Note 15 - Acquisitions and Dispositions for information related to the MountainWest assets and liabilities held for sale. 
 T he Company and Southwest had earlier classified certain assets associated with its previous corporate headquarters as held for sale. The sale was not completed and management determined that the assets no longer meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale. As a result, the Company and Southwest reclassified approximately million fr om Prepaid and other current assets to Other property and investments on their respective Consolidated Balance Sheets during the fourth quarter of 2022. Southwest also received an updated appraisal on these assets, and as a result, recorded a los s of million i n the fourth quarter of 2022. 
 The Company and Southwest determined that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of the Centuri and Southwest reporting units were less than their carrying amounts in either 2022 or 2021, and therefore, impairment was recorded in either year in regard to these entities. 
 In regard to MountainWest, and the agreement to sell the equity interests to Williams, which was undertaken to simplify the Company s business overall and ultimately position it as a pure-play local distribution company, management considered the expected proceeds, which were below the carrying value of the equity interests at that time; as such, a loss was recognized, recorded primarily as a goodwill impairment of million in the fourth quarter of 2022. See Note 15 - Acquisitions and Dispositions for additional information. Additional losses are possible through the post-closing process for MountainWest, as customary final adjustments are made. There can also be no assurances that future assessments of remaining goodwill on the Company s and Southwest s balance sheets will not result in an impairment; various factors, including the planned spin-off of Centuri, or changes in economic conditions, governmental monetary policies, interest rates, or others, on their own or in combination, could result in the fair value of the related reporting units being lower than their carrying value.

of the original cost of depreciable and amortizable property. Transmission and distribution plant are associated with the core natural gas delivery infrastructure, and combined, constitute the majority of gas plant. Annual regulated operations depreciation expense for Southwest averaged approximately of the original cost of depreciable transmission and distribution plant during the period 2020 through 2022. 
 
 Included in the figures above is amortization of regulated operations intangibles of million, million, and million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The amounts above exclude regulatory asset and liability amortization. 
 Leases 
 Determinations are made as to whether an arrangement is a lease at inception. ROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term; lease liabilities represent obligations to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. When leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, an incremental borrowing rate based on information available at commencement is used in determining the present value of lease payments; an implicit rate, if readily determinable, is used. Lease terms utilized in the computations may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. When lease agreements include non-lease components, they are included with the lease component and accounted for as a single component, for all asset classes. Southwest and MountainWest have no significant operating, finance, or short-term leases. 
 Centuri has operating and finance leases for corporate and field offices, construction equipment, and transportation ve hicles. Centuri is currently not a lessor in any significant lease arrangements. Centuri s leases have remaining lease terms o f up to years. Some of these include options to extend the leases, generally for optional terms of up to years, and some include options to terminate the leases within year. Centur i s equipment l eases may include variable payment terms in addition to the fixed lease payments if machinery is used in excess of the standard work periods. These variable payments are not probable of occurring under the current operating environment and have not been included in consideration of lease payments. During 2021, the presentation of short-term lease cost changed to include all short-term costs associated with leases with a term of less than one month as compared to the historical presentation of only including short-term lease costs for leases with a duration of over one month and less than one year. The lease costs associated with leases with terms of less than one month were million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Due to the seasonality of Centuri s business, expense for short-term leases will fluctuate throughout the year with higher expense incurred during the warmer months. Short-term leases were not recorded on the balance sheet as permitted under the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 842. As of December 31, 2022, Centuri had no executed lease agreements that had not yet commenced.

types of services to its customers: tariff sales and transportation only service. Tariff sales encompass sales to many types of customers (primarily residential) under various rate schedules, subject to cost-of-service ratemaking, which is based on the rate-regulation of state commissions and the FERC. Southwest provides both the commodity and the related distribution service to nearly all of its approximate million customers, and only several hundred customers (who are eligible to secure their own gas) subscribe to transportation-only service. Natural gas is delivered and consumed by the customer simultaneously. The provision of service is represented by the turn of the meter dial and is the primary representation of the satisfaction of performance obligations of Southwest. The amount billable via regulated rates (both volumetric and fixed monthly rates as part of rate design) corresponds to the value to the customer, and management believes that the amount billable (amount Southwest has the right to invoice) is appropriate to utilize for purposes of recognizing revenue. Estimated amounts remaining unbilled since the last meter read date are restricted from being billed due only to the passage of time and therefore are also recognized for service provided through the balance sheet date. While natural gas service is typically recurring, there is generally not a contract term for utility service. Therefore, the contract term is not generally viewed to extend beyond the service provided to date, and customers can generally terminate service at will. 
 Transportation-only service is also governed by tariff rate provisions. Transportation-only service is generally only available to very large customers under requirements of Southwest s various tariffs. With this service, customers secure their own gas supply and Southwest provides transportation services to move the customer-supplied gas to the intended location. Southwest concluded that transportation/transmission service is suitable to an over time recognition model. Rate structures under Southwest s regulation for transportation customers include a combination of volumetric charges and monthly fixed charges (including charges commonly referred to as capacity charges, demand charges, or reservation charges) as part of the rate design of regulated jurisdictions. These types of fixed charges represent a separate performance obligation associated with standing ready over the period of the month to deliver quantities of gas, regardless of whether the customer takes delivery of any quantity of gas. The performance obligations under these circumstances are satisfied over the course of the month under an output measure of progress based on time, which correlates to the period for which the charges are eligible to be invoiced. 
 Under its regulation, Southwest enters into negotiated rate contracts for those customers located in proximity to another pipeline, which pose a threat of bypassing its distribution system. Southwest may also enter into similar contracts for customers otherwise able to satisfy their energy needs by means of alternative fuel to natural gas . Less than two dozen customers are party to contracts with rate components subject to negotiation. Many rate provisions and terms of service for these less common type s of contracts are also subject to regulatory oversight and tariff provisions. The performance obligations for these customers are satisfied similarly to those for other customers by means of transporting/delivering natural gas to the customer. Many or most of the rate components, and structures, for these types of customers are the same as those for similar customers without negotiated rate components; and the negotiated rates are within the parameters of the tariff guidelines. Furthermore, while some of these contracts include contract periods extending over time, including multiple years, as amounts billable under the contract are based on rates in effect for the customer for service provided to date, no significant financing component is deemed to exist. 
 As indicated above, revenues also include the net impacts of margin tracker/decoupling accruals. All of Southwest s service territories have decoupled rate structures (also referred to as alternative revenue programs) that are designed to eliminate the direct link between volumetric sales and revenue, thereby mitigating the impacts of unusual weather variability and conservation on margin. The primary alternative revenue programs involve permissible adjustments for differences between stated tariff benchmarks and amounts billed through revenue from contracts with customers via existing rates. Such adjustments are recognized monthly in revenue and in the associated regulatory asset/liability accounts in advance of rate adjustments intended to collect or return amounts recognized. Revenues recognized for the adjustment to the benchmarks noted are required to be presented separately from revenues from contracts with customers, and as such, are provided below and identified as related to alternative revenue programs (which excludes recoveries from customers).

 Utility Infrastructure Services Segment : 
 The majority of Centuri contracts are performed under unit-price contracts. Generally, these contracts state prices per unit of installation. Typical installations are accomplished in a few weeks or less. Revenues are recorded as installations are completed. Revenues are recorded for long-term fixed-price contracts in a pattern that reflects the transfer of control of promised goods and services to the customer over time. The amount of revenue recognized on fixed-price contracts is based on costs expended to date relative to anticipated final contract costs (a method of recognition based on inputs). Some unit-price contracts contain caps that if encroached, trigger revenue and loss recognition similar to a fixed-price contract model. 
 Centuri is required to collect taxes imposed by various governmental agencies on the work performed for its customers. These taxes are not included in Utility infrastructure services revenues. Management uses the net classification method to report taxes collected from customers to be remitted to governmental authorities. 
 Centuri derives revenue from the installation, replacement, repair, and maintenance of energy distribution systems. Centuri has operations in the U.S. and Canada. The primary focus of Centuri operations is replacement of natural gas distribution pipe and electric service lines, as well as new infrastructure installations. In addition, Centuri performs certain industrial construction activities for various customers and industries. Centuri has types of agreements with its customers: master services agreements MSAs and bid contracts. Most of Centuri s customers supply many of their own materials in order for Centuri to complete its work under the contracts. 
 An MSA identifies most of the terms describing each party s rights and obligations that will govern future work authorizations. An MSA is often effective for multiple years. A work authorization is issued by the customer to describe the location, timing, and any additional information necessary to complete the work for the customer. The combination of the MSA and the work authorization determines when a contract exists and revenue recognition may begin. Each work authorization is generally a single performance obligation as Centuri is performing a significant integration service. 
 A bid contract is typically a one-time agreement for a specific project that has all necessary terms defining each party s rights and obligations. Each bid contract is evaluated for revenue recognition individually. Control of assets created under bid contracts generally passes to the customer over time. Bid contracts often have a single performance obligation as Centuri is providing a significant integration service. 
 Centuri s MSA and bid contracts are characterized as either fixed-price contracts or unit-price contracts for revenue recognition purposes. The cost-to-cost input method is used to measure progress towards the satisfaction of a performance obligation for fixed-price contracts. Input methods result in the recognition of revenue based on the entity s expended effort toward satisfaction of the performance obligation relative to the total expected effort to satisfy it in full. For unit-price contracts, an output method is used to measure progress towards satisfaction of a performance obligation (based on the completion of each unit that is required under the contract). 
 Actual revenues and project costs can vary, sometimes substantially, from previous estimates due to changes in a variety of factors, including unforeseen circumstances. These factors, along with other risks inherent in performing fixed-price contracts

primary service types: gas construction, electrical construction, and other construction. Gas construction includes work involving previously existing gas pipelines and the installation of new pipelines or service lines. Electrical construction includes work involving installation and maintenance of transmission and distribution lines, including storm restoration services. Other construction includes all other work and can include industrial and water utility services. 
 Contracts can have compensation/consideration that is variable. For MSAs, variable consideration is evaluated at the customer level as the terms creating variability in pricing are included within the MSA and are not specific to a work authorization. For multi-year MSAs, variable consideration items are typically determined for each year of the contract and not for the full contract term. For bid contracts, variable consideration is evaluated at the individual contract level. The expected value method or most likely amount method is used based on the nature of the variable consideration. Types of variable consideration include liquidated damages, delay penalties, performance incentives, safety bonuses, payment discounts, and volume rebates. Centuri will typically estimate variable consideration and adjust financial information, as necessary. 
 Change orders involve the modification in scope, price, or both to the current contract, requiring approval by both parties. The existing terms of the contract continue to be accounted for under the current contract until such time as a change order is approved. Once approved, the change order is either treated as a separate contract or as part of the existing contract, as appropriate under the circumstances. When the scope is agreed upon in the change order but not the price, Centuri estimates the change to the transaction price.

Revenue earned on contracts in progress in excess of billings Amounts billed in excess of revenue earned on contracts 
 The revenue earned on contracts in progress in excess of billings (contract asset) primarily relates to Centuri s rights to consideration for work completed but not billed and/or approved at the reporting date. These contract assets are transferred to contracts receivable when the rights become unconditional. These contract assets are recoverable from Centuri s customers based upon various measures of performance, including achievement of certain milestones, completion of specified units or completion of a contract. In addition, many of Centuri s time and materials arrangements are billed in arrears pursuant to contract terms that are standard within the industry, resulting in contract assets and/or unbilled receivables being recorded, as revenue is recognized in advance of billings. Due to the lag in invoicing associated with contractual provisions (or other economic or market conditions that may impact a customer s business), Centuri s ability to bill and subsequently collect amounts due may be impacted. These changes may result in the need to record an estimated valuation allowance to adjust contract asset balances to their net realizable value. 
 The amounts billed in excess of revenue earned (contract liability) primarily relate to the advance consideration received from customers for which work has not yet been completed. The change in this contract liability balance from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022 was due to revenue recognized of approximately million that was included in this balance as of January 1, 2022, after which time it became earned and the balance was reduced, in addition to increases due to amounts received, net of revenue recognized during the period related to contracts that commenced during the period. 
 For contracts that have an original duration of one year or less, Centuri does not consider/compute an interest component based on the time value of money. Further, because of the short duration of these contracts, the Company has not disclosed the transaction price for the remaining performance obligations as of the end of each reporting period or when the Company expects to recognize the revenue. 
 As of December 31, 2022, Centuri has contracts with an original duration of more than one year. The aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the unsatisfied performance obligations of these contracts as of December 31, 2022 was million. Centuri expects to recognize the remaining performance obligations over approximately the next ; however, the timing of that recognition is largely within the control of the customer, including when the necessary equipment and materials required to complete the work will be provided by the customer.

 Pipeline and Storage Segment: 
 MountainWest derives revenue on the basis of services rendered, commodities delivered, or contracts settled and includes amounts yet to be billed to customers. MountainWest generates revenue and earnings from annual reservation payments under firm peaking storage and firm transportation contracts. Straight-fixed-variable rate designs are used to allow for recovery of substantially all fixed costs in demand or reservation charges, thereby reducing the earnings impact of volume changes on gas transportation and storage operations. 
 MountainWest receives upfront payment for certain storage services it provides to customers, which are considered to be contract liabilities. These payments are amortized to revenue over the term of the contract.

-state region of Arizona, Nevada, and California. Southwest s accounts receivable are short-term in nature, with billing due dates customarily not extending beyond , with customers credit worthiness assessed upon account creation by evaluation of other utility service or their credit file, and related payment history. Although Southwest seeks generally to minimize its credit risk related to utility operations by requiring security deposits from new customers, imposing late fees, and actively pursuing collection on overdue accounts, some accounts are ultimately not collected. Customer accounts are subject to collection procedures that vary by jurisdiction (late fee assessment, notice requirements for disconnection of service, and procedures for actual disconnection and/or reestablishment of service). After disconnection of service, accounts are customarily written off approximately after disconnection if the account remains inactive. Dependent upon the jurisdiction, reestablishment of service requires both payment of previously unpaid balances and additional deposit requirements. Provisions for uncollectible accounts are recorded monthly based on experience, consideration of current and expected future conditions, customer and rate composition, and write-off processes. They are included in the ratemaking process as a cost of service. The Nevada jurisdictions have a regulatory mechanism associated with the gas-cost-related portion of uncollectible accounts. Such amounts are deferred and collected through a surcharge in the ratemaking process. Southwest lifted the moratorium on disconnection of natural gas service for non-payment in Arizona and Nevada in September 2021, which was initiated (at the same time as a moratorium on late fees) in March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The moratorium on disconnection in California ended in November 2021. Southwest recommenced assessing late fees on past-due balances in Arizona and Nevada in April 2021, and in California in August 2021. After these moratoriums were lifted, Southwest resumed collection efforts. These moratoriums have influenced our bad debt expense and write-offs through 2022. S outhwest continues to actively work with customers experiencing financial hardship by means of flexible payment options and partnering with assistance agencies. Management continues to monitor expected credit losses in light of the impacts of events/conditions such as COVID-19, local/regional inflation, and others. In addition, management is monitoring the impact of certain residential disconnection protections recently established in Southwest s California jurisdictions, such as prohibiting credit deposits and fees for reconnection, among other things. While a two-way balancing account was permitted to track residential uncollectible accounts for future recovery, the mechanism is subject to a cap, above which uncollectible expense would nonetheless be incurred and recognized. The allowance as of December 31, 2022 reflects the expected impact from the pandemic on balances as of that date, including consideration of customers current and future ability to pay those amounts that are due. 
 Utility infrastructure services accounts receivable are recorded at face amounts less an allowance for doubtful accounts. Centuri s customers are generally investment-grade gas and electric utility companies for which Centuri has historically recognized an insignificant amount of write-offs. Centuri s accounts receivable balances carry standard payment terms of up to days. Centuri maintains an allowance that is estimated based on historical collection experience, current and estimated future economic and market conditions, and a review of the current status of each customer's accounts receivable balance. Account balances are monitored at least monthly, and are charged off against the allowance when management determines it is probable the balance will not be recovered. Centuri has not been significantly impacted, nor does it anticipate it will experience significant difficulty in collecting amounts due, given the nature of its customers, as a result of the COVID-19 environment, historically high inflation, or other conditions.

 The fair values of Southwest's and the Company s revolving credit facilities and Southwest s Industrial Development Revenue Bonds IDRBs are categorized as Level 1 based on the FASB s fair value hierarchy, due to the ability to access similar debt arrangements at measurement dates with comparable terms, including variable/market rates. Additionally, Southwest s revolving credit facility and IDRBs have interest rates that reset frequently. The fair values of Southwest s debentures (which include senior and medium-term notes) and the Company's term loan facility and unsecured senior notes were determined utilizing a market-based valuation approach, where fair values are determined based on evaluated pricing data, and as such are categorized as Level 2 in the hierarchy. 
 Southwest has a million credit facility that is scheduled to expire in April 2025 . Southwest designates million of associated capacity as long-term debt and the remaining million for working capital purposes. Interest rates for the credit facility are calculated at either the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR or an alternate base rate, plus in each case an applicable margin that is determined based on Southwest s senior unsecured debt rating. At December 31, 2022, the applicable margin ranges from to for loans bearing interest with reference to SOFR and from to for loans bearing interest with reference to the alternative base rate. At December 31, 2022, the applicable margin is for loans with reference to SOFR and for loans bearing interest with reference to the alternative base rate. Southwest is also required to pay a commitment fee, ranging from to per annum, on the unfunded portion of the commitments, which was not significant for the year ended December 31, 2022. The credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring Southwest to maintain a ratio of funded debt to total capitalization not to exceed to 1.00 as of the end of any quarter of any fiscal year. At December 31, 2022, million was outstanding on the long-term portion borrowings were outstanding under the commercial paper program discussed below). The effective interest rate on the long-term portion of the credit facility was at December 31, 2022. 
 Southwest has a million commercial paper program. Issuances under the commercial paper program are supported by Southwest s current revolving credit facility and, therefore, do not represent additional borrowing capacity.

Share-based compensation plan related tax benefits Omnibus Incentive Plan 
 The omnibus incentive plan is used to promote the long-term growth and profitability of the Company, including its subsidiaries, by providing directors, employees, and certain other individuals with incentives to increase stockholder value and otherwise contribute to the success of the Company. In addition, the plan enables the Company to attract, retain, and reward the best available persons for positions of responsibility. The omnibus incentive plan provides for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, and other equity-based and cash awards. Employees, directors, and consultants who provide services to the Company or any subsidiary may be eligible under this plan. For grants under the omnibus incentive plan, directors continue to immediately vest in the shares upon grant but are provided the option to defer receipt of equity compensation until they leave the Board of Directors. 
 Performance-based incentive opportunities under the omnibus plan were granted to all officers of Southwest in the form of performance shares and are based, depending on the officer, on consolidated earnings per share, utility net income, and utility return on equity, with an adjustment based on relative total shareholder return, in each case, measured over a

million , million, and million of estimated compensation expense associated with these shares during 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. 
 Restricted Stock/Units 
 Restricted stock/units under the restricted stock/unit plan were previously granted to attract, motivate, retain, and reward key employees of the Company with an incentive to attain high levels of individual performance and improved financial performance. The legacy plan was also established to attract, motivate, and retain experienced and knowledgeable directors. As noted above, grants of restricted stock during 2022, were granted under the omnibus incentive plan. All remaining shares under the legacy restricted stock/unit plan (in regard to employees) were issued during 2021 ; remaining unissued legacy program shares relate solely to directors, and such shares were immediately vested at the time of grant, with distribution to occur when service on the Board ends. No new grants are made under the legacy plan, as all future stock-based incentive compensation, including with regard to restricted stock, is granted under programs of the omnibus incentive plan, which for directors, with advance election, issuance may occur upon grant. Conversely, with regard to management, grants under the omnibus plan are of time-lapse character, with graded vesting (and issuance in the form of common stock) occurring, at the end of year one and at the end of years two and three.

 million (self-insured retention) of each incident plus the first million in aggregate claims above its self-insured retention in the policy year. When amounts are expected to be incurred above these amounts, subject to insurance carrier indemnity, a liability is recognized for the additional amount, in addition to a receivable from the insurance carrier amounts, without impact to earnings. 
 Centuri maintains liability insurance for various risks associated with its operations. In connection with these liability insurance policies, Centuri is responsible for an initial deductible or self-insured retention amount per occurrence, after which the insurance carriers would be responsible for amounts up to the policy limits. For the polic y year May 2022 to April 2023, Centuri is responsible for the first (self-insured retention) per occurrence under these liability insurance policies. 
 In August 2021, a natural gas pipe operated by Southwest was involved in an explosion that injured individuals and damaged property.

million (the maximum noted above). In 2021, pursuant to ASC 450 - Contingencies , Southwest recorded a million liability related to this incident reflecting its best estimate of the probable loss at that time. Additional amounts, subject to insurance indemnity, have been recognized on the consolidated balance sheets, in accordance with the above-noted accounting for amounts above the self-insurance retention provisions, which were not material to our financial position. Any amounts above that which has already been recognized (to be covered by insurance) cannot be estimated as of the date these financial statements are issued. 
 Other contingencies are also recognized where appropriate, if claims are brought, or expected to be brought, against the Company or Southwest, where management expects it may settle (or be required to settle) claims in cash, or in some cases, by means of insurance indemnification. The balance of such reserves was updated for additional accruals, including in regard to a contract dispute. For that item, million was recorded during the second quarter of 2022, based on management s estimate of Southwest s exposure. The amount was paid in the fourth quarter of 2022 and the matter is closed. 
 As described in Note 1 - Background, Organization, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , the November 2021 civil suit filed by the Icahn Group, against the Company and certain officers and directors, was subject to a stipulation of dismissal with prejudice in May 2022, pursuant to the terms of the Cooperation Agreement. 
 On November 18, 2021, the City Pension Fund for Firefighters and Police Officers in the City of Miami Beach commenced a putative class action lawsuit in the Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware on behalf of a putative class of persons who purchased the Company s stock. The action is captioned City Pension Fund for Firefighters and Police Officers in the City of Miami Beach v. Robert L. Boughner, et al., C.A. No. 2021-0990-KSJM (Del. Ch.). The complaint was later amended on November 30, 2021. The amended complaint named the Company and the individual members of the Board as defendants. The complaint sought to assert breach of fiduciary duty claims, alleging that the Board s recommendation that stockholders reject Icahn s offer to purchase shares of the Company s common stock omitted material information about the Company s financial analysis; and sought to have the Board approve Icahn s slate of nominees as continuing directors under certain of the Company s debt instruments. In March 2022, the City Pension Fund filed a motion for summary judgment on its claim; however, in April 2022, the City Pension Fund filed a notice of withdrawal of its motion for summary judgment. The Company believes that the claims lack merit and intends to vigorously defend against them.

 The service cost component of net periodic benefit costs included in the table below is part of an overhead loading process associated with the cost of labor. The overhead process ultimately results in allocation of that portion of overall net periodic benefit costs to the same accounts to which productive labor is charged. As a result, service costs become components of various accounts, primarily Operations and maintenance expense, Net regulated operations plant, and Deferred charges and other assets for both the Company and Southwest. The non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost are reflected in Other income (deductions) on the Consolidated Statements of Income of each entity, based on accounting guidance for the presentation of such costs.

 Shares in the commingled trust equity funds may be redeemed given one business day notice. While they are trust equity funds and reported at NAV, due to the short redemption notice period, the lack of redemption fees, the fact that the underlying investments are exchange-traded, and that substantial liabilities do not exist subject to the NAV calculation, these investments are viewed as indirectly observable (Level 2) in the fair value hierarchy and are therefore not excluded from the body of the fair value table as a reconciling item. 
 The global fund provides diversified exposure to global equity markets. The fund seeks to provide long-term capital growth by investing primarily in securities listed on the major developed equity markets of the U.S., Europe, and Asia, as well as within those listed on emerging country equity markets on a tactical basis. 
 The international fund invests in international financial markets, primarily those of developed economies in Europe and the Pacific Basin. The fund invests primarily in equity securities issued by foreign corporations, but may invest in other securities perceived as offering attractive investment return opportunities. 
 The domestic equities securities funds include a large and medium capitalization fund and a small capitalization fund. The large and medium capitalization fund is designed to track the performance of the large and medium capitalization companies contained in the index, which represents approximately 90 of the market capitalization of the U.S. stock market. The small capitalization fund is designed to provide maximum long-term appreciation through investments that are well diversified by industry. 
 The emerging markets fund invests in countries defined as an emerging market country. Fund investments are made directly in each country or, where direct investment is inefficient or prohibited, through appropriate financial instruments or participation in commingled funds.

Centuri 
 Defined Contribution Plans 
 Centuri offers defined contribution plans under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code to its eligible employees, regardless of whether they are covered under collective-bargaining agreements. Eligibility requirements vary, as does timing of participation, matching, vesting, and profit-sharing features of the plans. Contributions by Centuri to these plans for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were million , million, and million, re spectively. 
 Deferred Compensation Plan 
 Centuri sponsors a nonqualified deferred compensation plan that is offered to a select group of management and highly-compensated employees. The plan allows participants to defer up to of base salary and provides a match of of contributions up to of a participant s salary. The plan also allows Centuri, at its election, to credit participant accounts with discretionary contributions. Participants are vested in salary deferrals, contributions, and all earnings. Participant accounts include a return based on the performance of the underlying investment options selected. Payments from the plan are designated at each annual enrollment period based on specified triggering events and are payable by lump sum or on an annual installment basis. 
 Multiemployer Pension Plans 
 Centuri makes defined contributions to several multiemployer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective bargaining agreements CBAs with various unions representing certain employees. Contribution rates are generally specified in the CBAs and are made to the plans on a pay-as-you-go basis. Such contributions correspond to the number of union employees and the particular plans in which they participate, and vary depending upon the location, number of ongoing projects, and the need for union resources in connection with those projects. 
 The risks of participating in multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans, including: (i) assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers; (ii) if a participating employer stops contributing to the multiemployer plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may become the obligation of the remaining participating employers; and (iii) if a participating employer chooses to stop participating in these multiemployer plans, the employer may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan. 
 The Pension Protection Act of 2006 requires special funding and operational rules for multiemployer plans in the U.S., including classification of the plans (based on multiple factors, including the funded status of the plan), the most severe of which is critical. Depending upon the classification, plans may be required to adopt measures to improve their funded status through a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan, which may require additional contributions from employers (in the form of a surcharge on benefit contributions) and/or modification of retiree benefits. The amount of additional funds, if any, that Centuri may be obligated to contribute to these plans in the future cannot be estimated due to the uncertainty regarding future levels of work that may require the utilization of union employees covered by these plans, as well as uncertainty as to the future contribution levels and possible surcharges on contributions that may apply to these plans at that time. 
 Centuri contributed million, million , and million c ollectively to the plans for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Substantially all of the contributions made by Centuri during these years were to U.S. plans that were not classified as critical, and for which special surcharges were assessed. plans were classified as critical and required special surcharges; the aggregate contributions to these plans were million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and were insignificant during the periods ending December 31, 2021 and 2020.

 In assessing whether uncertain tax positions should be recognized in its financial statements, management first determines whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluations of whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, management presumes that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information. For tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, management measures the amount of benefit recognized in the financial statements at the largest amount of benefit that is greater tha n 50 li kely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in the first financial reporting period in which information becomes available indicating that such benefits will more-likely-than-not be realized. For each reporting period, management applies a consistent methodology to measure unrecognized tax benefits, and all unrecognized tax benefits are reviewed periodically and adjusted as circumstances warrant. Measurement of

 The Company s regulated operations accounting for income taxes is impacted by the FASB s ASC Topic 980 Regulated Operations . Reductions in accumulated deferred income tax balances due to the reduction in the corporate income tax rates to 21 under the provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJA ), enacted in December 2017, may continue to result in a refund of excess deferred taxes to customers, generally through reductions in future rates. The TCJA included provisions that stipulate how these excess deferred taxes may be passed back to customers for certain accelerated tax depreciation benefits. T he December 31, 2022 Consolidated Balance Sheets of Southwest and the Company reflect the impact of the TCJA and the remaining unamortized balance of the regulatory liability (including a gross-up), barring further changes to income tax rates.

 The Company and each of its subsidiaries, including Southwest, participate in a tax sharing agreement to establish the method for allocating tax benefits and losses among members of the consolidated group. The consolidated federal income tax is apportioned among the subsidiaries using a separate return method. 
 The acquisition of MountainWest by the Company was a taxable transaction for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. As a result, the Company obtained a step-up in the basis of the assets acquired (as determined for income tax purposes), without succeeding to the holding period, accounting methods, or historical income tax liabilities associated with MountainWest. Accordingly, the deferred income taxes were redetermined on the date of acquisition, December 31, 2021.

Effective January 2022, the Company, by means of Centuri, has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase at fair value (subject to a floor) a portion of the interest held by the noncontrolling party, and in incremental amounts each year thereafter. In March 2022, the parties agreed to a partial redemption based on these provisions, and as a result, Centuri paid million to the previous owner of Linetec for a equity interest in Linetec, thereby reducing the balance continuing to be redeemable to under the terms of the original agreement. In order to fund the redemption, Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. contributed capital to Centuri.

If the Company does not exercise its rights in accordance with the timeline noted, or upon the occurrence of certain other triggering events, the noncontrolling party has the ability, but not the obligation, to exit their investment retained by requiring Centuri to purchase all of their outstanding interest. The outstanding noncontrolling interest is not subject to minimum purchase provisions and, following the eligibility date for the election, they do not expire. The redemption price represents the fair value of the ownership interest to be redeemed on the redemption date under the terms of the agreement. A portion of the redeemable noncontrolling interest acquired was funded through promissory notes made to noncontrolling interest holders bearing interest at the prime rate plus . The promissory notes are payable by the noncontrolling interest holders upon certain triggering events including, but not limited to, termination of employment or the redemption of any interest under the agreement. The promissory notes are recognized as a reduction to the Company s stockholders equity. Additionally, the Company has determined that this noncontrolling interest is a redeemable noncontrolling interest and, in accordance with SEC guidance, is classified as mezzanine equity (temporary equity) in the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 Dispositions 
 In December 2022, the Company announced that the Board unanimously determined to take strategic actions to simplify the Company s portfolio of businesses. These actions included entering into a definitive agreement to sell of MountainWest in an all-cash transaction to Williams for billion in total enterprise value, subject to certain adjustments. Additionally, the Company determined it will pursue a spin-off of Centuri to form a new independent publicly traded utility infrastructure services company. The MountainWest transaction closed on February 14, 2023. Upon close, the Company is expected to provide certain services to Williams under a transition services agreement for a brief period, generally not beyond . The Centuri spin-off is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2023 or the first quarter of 2024 and to be tax free to the Company and its stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The separation will be subject to, among other things,

million. The goodwill impairment loss is reported in Goodwill impairment and cost to sell on the Company s Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company believes that the sale price of billion, as adjusted for indebtedness and other estimated adjustments per the purchase and sale agreement, provided a reasonable indication of the fair value of MountainWest as it represents an exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants. While the fair value was estimated based on the closing statement from the sale of MountainWest, it is subject to certain adjustments, including a post-closing payment related to final working capital balances. T he amount of such post-closing payment is not determinable at this time . The Company estimated the working capital balances as of February 14, 2023; however, these amounts are subject to change and could result in additional losses in the second quarter of 2023 when working capital is finalized. The Company recorded an additional loss of approximately million, attributable to estimated selling costs, which is also included in Goodwill impairment and cost to sell on the Company s Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2022.

 On September 22, 2022, the FERC issued an order initiating an investigation, pursuant to section 5 of the Natural Gas Act, to determine whether rates currently charged by MountainWest Overthrust Pipeline, LLC, a subsidiary of MountainWest, are just and reasonable and setting the matter for hearing (the Section 5 Rate Case ). Unless earlier settled by the parties, a hearing on the matter is to commence on August 1, 2023 with an initial decision from the presiding administrative law judge due by November 14, 2023. Under the terms of the MountainWest Purchase Agreement, the Company is obligated, for a period of

following the closing of the sale of MountainWest, to indemnify Williams and MountainWest for any damages and liabilities resulting from the Section 5 Rate Case, including any reduction to the current applicable rate, up to a cap of million. Williams has agreed that it will not enter into any settlement of the Section 5 Rate Case that will result in any damages being paid by the Company under such indemnity without the prior written consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). The range of loss, if any, that could result from this matter cannot currently be estimated.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 Basis for Opinions 
 The Company s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Reports on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Regulatory Assets and Liabilities 
 As described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s net regulatory assets were 195 million as of December 31, 2022. The Company is subject to the regulation of the Arizona Corporation Commission, the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada, the California Public Utilities Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Accounting treatment for rate-regulated entities allows for deferral as regulatory assets, costs that otherwise would be expensed, if it is probable that future recovery from customers will occur. As disclosed by management, they review the regulatory assets to assess their recoverability. If rate recovery is no longer probable, due to competition or the actions of regulators, management is required to write-off the related regulatory asset. Regulatory liabilities are recorded if it is probable that revenues will be reduced for amounts that will be refunded to customers through the ratemaking process. 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to regulatory assets and liabilities is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in the ongoing evaluation of regulatory assets and liabilities and in applying guidance contained in regulatory proceedings and other relevant evidence, including the timing of recognition of regulatory assets and liabilities; and (ii) the significant auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to management s judgments about the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities. 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management s assessment of regulatory proceedings, including the probability of recovery of regulatory assets, refund of regulatory liabilities, and disclosure impacts. These procedures also included, among others (i) obtaining the Company s correspondence with regulators; (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of management s assessment regarding the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities based on the status of regulatory proceedings; and (iii) evaluating the related accounting and disclosure implications.
