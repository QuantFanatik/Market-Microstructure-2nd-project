Part I 

Item 1. Business 

Metaurus Equity Component Trust (the Trust was formed in September 2016 and is authorized to have multiple series or portfolios. The Trust is a statutory trust formed under the
laws of the state of Delaware. The Trust had one series or fund traded on the NYSE Arca, Inc. exchange NYSE Arca in 2022,
U.S. Equity Cumulative Dividends Fund Series 2027 ((the Dividend Fund, Fund or ETF which was
liquidated on December 21, 2022.) Metaurus Advisors LLC (the Sponsor or Advisor serves as the sponsor, commodity
pool operator and commodity trading advisor of the Fund. The Dividend Fund commenced operations on January 17, 2018 and commenced investment
operations on February 5, 2018. 

The Trust has had no investment operations prior
to February 5, 2018 other than matters relating to its organization, the registration of each series/Fund under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, and matters relating to their establishment and the capital contribution by the Sponsor of 1,000 to the Fund on December
22, 2017. 

On November 11, 2022, the Sponsor notified the
NYSE Arca stock exchange that it has determined to close the Dividend Fund and delist and liquidate the Dividend Fund s shares
from trading on the NYSE Arca. Trading in IDIV shares was suspended following the market close on December 9, 2022, and IDIV was liquidated
on December 21, 2022. 

The investment objective of the ETF is to employ
a passive management, or indexing, investment approach designed to correspond to the performance of each underlying index, before fees
and expenses. 

Undefined capitalized terms shall have the meaning
as set forth in the registration statement. 

The Dividend Fund seeks investment results that,
before fees and expenses, correspond to the performance of the Solactive U.S. Cumulative Dividends Index Series 2027 (the Solactive
Dividend Index over each calendar year so as to provide Shareholders with returns designed to replicate the dividends on constituent
companies of the S P 500, without exposure to the underlying securities. The Dividend Fund intends primarily to invest its assets
in the component instruments of the Solactive Dividend Index, as well as in cash and/or cash equivalents. The component instruments of
the Solactive Dividend Index consist of U.S. Treasury Securities Treasury Securities and long positions in annual futures
contracts listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange CME that provide exposure to dividends paid on the S P 500 constituent
companies S P 500 Dividend Futures Contracts pro rata for each year of the life of the Dividend Fund. 

1 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. The Fund maintains deposits with financial institutions
in amounts that may, at times, exceed the insured limits under applicable law. 

Short-Term Investments 

The Fund may purchase U.S. Treasury Bills and
cash equivalents. Additionally, the Fund may enter into short-term loans and reverse repurchase agreements for liquidity purposes. There
were no short-term loans or reverse repurchase agreements held in the Fund as of, and during the period ended December 21, 2022. 

Accounting for Derivative Instruments 

All open derivative positions at period end are
reflected on the ETF s Schedules of Investments. The ETF utilized a varying level of derivative instruments in conjunction with
investment securities in seeking to meet their investment objective during the period. While the volume of open positions may vary on
a daily basis as the ETF transacts derivatives contracts in order to achieve the appropriate exposure to meet its investment objective,
the volume of these open positions relative to the net assets of the ETF at the date of this report is generally representative of open
positions throughout the reporting period. Following is a description of the derivative instruments used by the ETF during the reporting
period, including the primary underlying risk exposures related to each instrument type. 

Futures Contracts 

The ETF enters into futures contracts to gain
exposure to changes in the value of, or as a substitute for investing directly in (or shorting), an underlying index, currency or commodity,
as set forth above. A futures contract obligates the seller to deliver (and the purchaser to accept) the future delivery of a specified
quantity and type of asset at a specified time and place. The contractual obligations of a buyer or seller may generally be satisfied
by taking or making physical delivery of the underlying commodity, if applicable, or by making an offsetting sale or purchase of an identical
futures contract on the same or linked exchange before the designated date of delivery, or by cash settlement at expiration of contract.
The particular futures contracts utilized by the ETF permit settlement only in cash. Upon entering into a futures contract, the ETF is
required to deposit and maintain as collateral at least such initial margin as required by the exchange on which the transaction is affected. 

The initial margin is segregated as cash and/or
securities balances with brokers for futures contracts, as disclosed in the Statements of Financial Condition and Schedules of Investments,
and is restricted as to its use. The ETF that enters into futures contracts maintains collateral at the broker in the form of cash and/or
securities. Pursuant to the futures contract, the Fund generally agrees to receive from or pay to the broker(s) an amount of cash equal
to the daily fluctuation in value of the futures contract. Such receipts or payments are known as variation margin and are recorded by
the Fund as unrealized gains or losses. The Fund will realize a gain or loss upon closing of a futures transaction. Futures contracts
involve, to varying degrees, elements of market risk (specifically commodity price risk or equity market volatility risk) and exposure
to loss in excess of the amount of variation margin. The face or contract amounts reflect the extent of the total exposure the Fund has
in the particular classes of instruments. Additional risks associated with the use of futures contracts are imperfect correlation between
movements in the price of the futures contracts and the market value of the underlying index or commodity and the possibility of an illiquid
market for a futures contract. With futures contracts, there is minimal but some counterparty risk to the ETF since futures contracts
are exchange-traded and the exchange s clearinghouse, as counterparty to all exchange-traded futures contracts, guarantees the futures
contracts against default. Many futures exchanges and boards of trade limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in futures contract prices
during a single trading day. Once the daily limit has been reached in a particular contract, no trades may be made that day at a price
beyond that limit or trading may be suspended for specified times during the trading day. Futures contracts prices could move to the limit
for several consecutive trading days with little or no trading, thereby preventing prompt liquidation of futures positions and potentially
subjecting a Fund to substantial losses. If trading is not possible, or if a Fund determines not to close a futures position in anticipation
of adverse price movements, the Fund will be required to make daily cash payments of variation margin. The risk that the Fund will be
unable to close out a futures position will be minimized by entering into such transactions on a national exchange with an active and
liquid secondary market. 

2 

The Fund issued and redeemed shares on a continuous
basis at NAV in one or more large blocks of Shares called Baskets as set forth in the Fund s Prospectus and any prospectus supplements
thereto. As noted above, IDIV was liquidated on December 21, 2022. 

The manner by which redemptions are made
is dictated by the terms of the respective authorized participant agreement between an Authorized Participant and the Trust Authorized
Participant Agreement ). Except when aggregated in Baskets, Shares are not redeemable securities of a Fund. Shares of the Fund may
be purchased or redeemed only by Authorized Participants. An Authorized Participant is an institution that (i) is a broker-dealer; (ii)
is a registered futures commission merchant and/or clears through a registered futures commission merchant; (iii) is a Depository Trust
Company Participant and a member of the National Securities Clearing Corporation; (iv) has entered into an Authorized Participant agreement
with the Trust; and (v) is in a position to transfer the required Deposit Instruments and/or the cash to buy and sell whole Baskets. Investors
will purchase Shares in the secondary market, generally with the assistance of a broker or investment advisor and will be subject to customary
brokerage commissions, mark ups and mark downs and fees. 

Authorized Participants will pay a transaction
fee per Basket created or redeemed. The Sponsor may choose to pay transaction fees on behalf of Authorized Participants and has done so
to date on Baskets that have been created. There is no guarantee that the Sponsor will continue to do so. In addition, to the extent that
cash is delivered or received in lieu of any of the Deposit Instruments upon the creation or redemption of Shares by an Authorized Participant,
such Authorized Participants will pay an additional variable charge up to 2 of the cash that is delivered or received in lieu of any
of the Deposit Instruments to a Fund to pay for any additional transaction costs and fees and price changes associated with the purchase
or disposition of any of the Deposit Instruments. 

Administrator, Custodian, Fund Accountant and
Transfer Agent 

SEI Investments Global Fund Services, Inc. (the
 Administrator serves as the Fund s Administrator pursuant to an administration agreement. Brown Brothers Harriman
 Co. (the Custodian serves as the Fund s custodian and transfer agent pursuant to a custodian and transfer agent
agreement. 

Clearing FCM 

Morgan Stanley Co. LLC MS Co. 
or the Clearing FCM serves as the Fund s Clearing FCM pursuant to the terms of a commodity futures customer agreement
among the Sponsor, on behalf of the Fund, severally and not jointly, and the Clearing FCM (the Futures Account Agreement ).
As Clearing FCM, MS Co. serves as the Fund s clearing broker and as such arranges for the execution and clearing of the Fund s
futures transactions. As such, MS Co. holds, on behalf of the Fund, positions in futures contracts and Treasury Securities, cash and
cash equivalents as futures margin. Treasury Securities, cash and cash equivalents not held as futures margin will be held by the Custodian.
The Fund may engage additional and/or other futures commission merchants in the future. 

Distribution Agreement 

SEI Investments Distribution Co., a wholly-owned
subsidiary of SEI Investments and an affiliate of the Administrator, serves as the Fund s distributor of Baskets pursuant to a distribution
agreement. The Distributor does not maintain any secondary market in the Shares.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

The following risk factors should be read in
connection with the other information included in this annual report on Form 10-K, including Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Fund s financial statements and the related notes, and the factors discussed
beginning Page 11 Risk Factors in our prospectus dated May 9, 2022, and all subsequent supplements thereto, which could
materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in the prospectus are not the only risks facing
the Trust. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially
adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 

Principal Risks 

A shareholder of the Fund is subject to the risk
that his or her investment could lose money. The Fund is subject to the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect
a Fund s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. A more complete description of principal
risks is included in the prospectus under the heading Principal Risks . This could result in the Fund s underperformance
compared to other funds with similar investment objectives. 

Market Trading Risks 

Individual Shares may be purchased and sold only
on a national securities exchange, an alternative trading system, or in the over-the-counter market and may not be directly purchased
or redeemed from the Fund. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for Shares will develop or be maintained, or that the
listing of the Shares will continue unchanged. Buying and selling Shares may require a shareholder to pay brokerage commissions and expose
a shareholder to other trading costs. Due to brokerage commissions and other transaction costs that may apply, frequent trading may detract
from realized investment returns. Trading prices of Shares may be above, at or below the Fund s NAV, will fluctuate in relation
to NAV based on supply and demand in the market for Shares and other factors, and may vary significantly from NAV during periods of market
volatility. The return on an investor s investment will be reduced when the investor sells Shares at a discount or buys Shares at
a premium to NAV. 

Contingent Pricing Risks 

Creation and redemption prices of Baskets are
directly linked to the Fund s next-computed NAV, which is normally determined at the end of each business day. Buyers and sellers
of Shares will not know the value of their purchases and sales until the Fund s NAV is determined at the end of the trading day.
Like mutual funds, the Fund does not offer opportunities to purchase or redeem Baskets intraday at currently determined (as opposed to
end-of-day) prices. Creation and redemption prices of Baskets are contingent upon the determination of NAV and may vary significantly
from anticipated levels (including estimates based on intraday indicative values disseminated by the Fund) during periods of market volatility.
Although limit orders can be used to restrict differences between prices of the Shares in the secondary market and NAV i.e. , premiums
and discounts to NAV), they cannot be used to specify trade execution prices. However, unlike shares of mutual funds, Shares will trade
on NYSE Arca, Inc. during the day at market-determined prices. The Fund will disseminate an indicative NAV every 15 seconds during the
trading day. 

Cash Transactions Risk 

The Fund intends to create and redeem Baskets
primarily through EFRP transactions. In certain instances, the Fund may effect creations and redemptions partly or wholly for cash, rather
than through an EFRP transaction. Because the Fund may effect redemptions for cash, rather than through an EFRP transaction, they may
be required to sell Deposit Instruments in order to obtain the cash needed to distribute redemption proceeds, and they may subsequently
recognize gains on such sales. As a result, an investment in Shares redeemed partially or wholly for cash may be less tax-efficient than
if the Shares were redeemed through an EFRP transaction which generally will not trigger any tax consequences to Shareholders. Moreover,
cash transactions may have to be carried out over several days if the market for any of the Deposit Instruments is relatively illiquid
and may involve considerable brokerage fees and taxes. These brokerage fees and taxes, which generally are expected to be higher than
if the Basket was created or redeemed through an EFRP transaction, may be passed on to purchasers and redeemers of Baskets in the form
of creation and redemption transaction fees. In addition, these factors may result in wider spreads between the bid and the offered prices
of the Shares. 

4 

Authorized Participant Concentration Risk 

Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation
or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund may have relationships with a limited number of institutions that act as Authorized
Participants. To the extent these institutions exit the business or are unable or unwilling to proceed with creation and/or redemption
orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Baskets, Shares of the
Fund may trade at a discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts and/or delisting. 

Substantial Interests of each Fund are Held
by a Small Number of Investors and Authorized Participants. 

A substantial portion of the Shares of the Fund
are held by a small number of investors, Beneficial Owners and Authorized Participants. Additionally, at any future time, and from time
to time, a substantial portion of the Shares of either Fund may be held by one or a small number of investors, Beneficial Owners and/or
Authorized Participants. In the event of substantial redemptions of Shares by one or more of these persons the Shares could be impacted
adversely. 

Guarantees and Indemnifications 

In the normal course of business, the Fund enters
into contracts with third-party service providers that contain a variety of representations and warranties and that provide general indemnifications.
Additionally, under the Fund s organizational documents, the Sponsor, Wilmington Trust, N.A., a national banking association and
the trustee of the Trust, and their officers and affiliates are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance
of their duties to the Fund. The Fund s maximum exposure under these arrangements cannot be known, as it involves possible future
claims that may or may not be made against the Fund. Based on experience, the Sponsor is of the view that the risk of loss to the Fund
in connection with the Fund s indemnification obligations is remote; however, there can be no assurance that such obligations will
not result in material liabilities that adversely affect the Fund. 

Natural Disaster/Epidemic Risk . 

Natural or environmental disasters, such as earthquakes,
fires, floods, hurricanes, tsunamis and other severe weather-related phenomena generally, and widespread disease, including pandemics
and epidemics (for example, the novel coronavirus COVID-19), have been and can be highly disruptive to economies and markets and have
recently led, and may continue to lead, to increased market volatility and significant market losses. Such natural disaster and health
crises could exacerbate political, social, and economic risks previously mentioned, and result in significant breakdowns, delays, shutdowns,
social isolation, and other disruptions to important global, local and regional supply chains affected, with potential corresponding results
on the operating performance of the Fund. A climate of uncertainty and panic, including the contagion of infectious viruses or diseases,
may adversely affect global, regional, and local economies. These circumstances may adversely impact the Fund s performance. Further,
such events can be highly disruptive to economies and markets, significantly disrupt the operations of individual companies (including,
but not limited to, the Fund s Sponsor and third-party service providers), sectors, industries, markets, securities and commodity
exchanges, currencies, interest and inflation rates, credit ratings, investor sentiment, and other factors affecting the value of the
Fund s Underlying Index. These factors can cause substantial market volatility, exchange trading suspensions and closures, changes
in the availability of and the margin requirements for certain instruments, and can impact the ability of the Fund to complete redemptions
and otherwise affect the Fund s performance and the Fund s trading in the secondary market. A widespread crisis may also affect
the global economy in ways that cannot necessarily be foreseen at the current time. How long such events will last and whether they will
continue or recur cannot be predicted. Impacts from these could have a significant impact on the Fund s performance, resulting in
losses to your investment. 

5 

Risk that Current Assumptions and Expectations
Could Become Outdated as a Result of Global Economic Shock . 

The onset of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19)
has caused significant shocks to global financial markets and economies, with many governments taking extreme actions to slow and contain
the spread of COVID-19. These actions have had, and likely will continue to have, a severe economic impact on global economies as economic
activity in some instances has essentially ceased. Financial markets across the globe are experiencing severe distress at least equal
to what was experienced during the global financial crisis in 2008. In March 2020, U.S. equity markets entered a bear market in the fastest
such move in the history of U.S. financial markets. Contemporaneous with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US, oil experienced
shocks to supply and demand, impacting the price and volatility of oil. The global economic shocks being experienced as of the date hereof
may result in significant losses to your investment. 

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments 

None. 

Item 2. Properties 

Not applicable. 

Item 3. Legal Proceedings 

From time to time, the Fund may receive subpoenas
or other requests for information from various U.S. federal, state governmental and domestic and international regulatory authorities
in connection with certain industry-wide or other investigations or proceedings. It is the Fund s general policy to cooperate fully
with such inquiries. The Fund may also be named as a defendant in legal actions, including arbitrations and other litigation arising in
connection with their activities, any of which potentially could harm the investment returns of the Fund or result in it being liable
for any resulting damages. 

The Sponsor, after consultation with legal counsel,
currently does not anticipate that the aggregate liability arising out of regulatory matters or lawsuits, if any, will have a material
effect on either Fund s results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. However, there is no assurance as to whether any
such pending or threatened matters, if any, will have a material effect on a Fund s results of operations, financial position or
cash flows in any future reporting period. Due to uncertainties surrounding the outcome of these matters, if any, the Fund cannot reasonably
estimate the possible loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters, if any.

Introduction 

The Metaurus Equity Component Trust (the Trust is a statutory trust formed under the laws of the State of Delaware in September 2016. The Trust is neither managed like a corporation
nor registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and is not required to register under such act. 

The U.S. Equity Cumulative Dividends Fund Series
2027 (the Dividend Fund , the Fund is a series of the Trust. The Fund is a commodity pool that will issue
shares to shareholders Shareholders representing fractional undivided beneficial interests in, and ownership of, the net
assets of the Fund Shares ). The Fund is a passive, unleveraged investment pool. 

Shares in the Fund are being separately offered.
The Fund is a term fund that will terminate on or prior to December 31, 2027. The Fund began issuing shares on February 5, 2018, and its
units of beneficial interest Shares represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of only
that Fund. The Shares of the Fund are listed on the New York Stock Exchange Archipelago (a/k/a NYSE Arca). The Trust qualifies as an emerging
growth company subject to reduced public company reporting requirements under U.S. federal securities laws. 

On November 11, 2022, the Sponsor notified the
NYSE Arca stock exchange that it has determined to close the Dividend Fund and delist and liquidate the Dividend Fund s shares from
trading on the NYSE Arca. Trading in the Dividend Fund s shares was suspended following the market close on December 9, 2022, and
the Fund was liquidated on December 21, 2022. 

Metaurus Advisors LLC Metaurus is the sponsor, commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor of the Fund. Metaurus, a limited liability company formed in the
State of Delaware on September 15, 2016, serves as the Trust s Sponsor, commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor.
The Sponsor is exempt from registration as a commodity trading advisor with the CFTC under CFTC Rule 4.14(a)(4), as the Sponsor is registered
as a commodity pool operator, and the Sponsor s commodity trading advice is directed solely to, and for the sole use of, the Funds,
pools for which it is so registered. The address of Metaurus is 22 Hudson Place, Suite 3, Hoboken, NJ 07030. The main business telephone
number of Metaurus is (201) 683-7979. The Trust had no investment operations prior to February 5, 2018, other than matters relating to
its organization, the registration of each series under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the contribution of 1,000 in the
Fund by the Sponsor.

The Sponsor is responsible for making operational
decisions necessary to maintain the proper number of investment positions to meet the investment objectives of the Fund, monitor the performance
results of the Fund s portfolios and reallocate assets within the portfolios with a view to causing the performance of the Fund s
portfolio to track that of its Underlying Index over each calendar year. The Fund is designed to terminate operations in December 2027. 

The Fund generally invests 100 of its assets
in U.S Treasury Securities, cash and cash equivalent securities and seeks to gain exposure to certain financial futures whose value is
derived from the underlying assets, as a substitute for investing directly in U.S equity securities directly, in order to gain or lose
exposure to certain component of their return. 

More specifically, the Dividend Fund is a passive,
unleveraged fund that seeks to track the Solactive U.S. Cumulative Dividends Index - Series 2027 (the Dividends Index ).
The Dividends Index (and the Dividend Fund) seeks to represent the discounted present value of all dividend futures contracts out to and
including December 2027. Each annual dividend futures contract represents the total value of all dividends paid on the S P 500 Index
constituent stocks during the contract year (as measured from mid-December to mid-December). The Dividend Fund holds a portfolio of sequentially
maturing U.S. Treasury Notes and cash. In order to gain exposure to the annual dividends paid on the S P 500 Index in each year, the
Dividend Fund holds long positions in the series of annual dividend futures contracts that are linked to the amounts of dividends paid
on the S P 500 Index constituent stock in each year during the term of the Dividend Fund. Unlike most futures contracts, dividend
futures contracts do not need to be rolled periodically but may be held to their annual expiry. 

The Fund continuously offers and redeems its Shares
in blocks of Shares as set forth in the Prospectus and any prospectus supplements thereto (each such block a Creation Unit ).
Only Authorized Participants may purchase and redeem Shares from a Fund and then only in Creation Units. An Authorized Participant is
an entity that has entered into an Authorized Participant Agreement with the Fund. Shares of the Dividend Fund are offered to Authorized
Participants in Creation Units at the Fund s NAV. Authorized Participants may then offer to the public, from time to time, Shares
from any Creation Unit they create at a per-Share market price that varies depending on, among other factors, the trading price of the
Shares of the Dividend Fund on the NYSE Arca, the NAV and the supply of and demand for the Shares at the time of the offer. Shares from
the same Creation Unit may be offered at different times and may have different offering prices based upon the above factors. The form
of Authorized Participant Agreement and related Authorized Participant Handbook set forth the terms and conditions under which an Authorized
Participant may purchase or redeem a Creation Unit. Authorized Participants do not receive from any Fund, the Sponsor, or any of their
affiliates, any underwriting fees or compensation in connection with their sale of Shares to the public. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

In order to maintain margin on futures positions
held by the Fund, a portion of the NAV of the Fund is held in cash and/or U.S. Treasury securities at Morgan Stanley, the Fund s
Futures Commission Merchant, and, in the case of the Dividend Fund, to fund its monthly distributions. The Fund also maintains cash positions
to fund certain fees and expenses of the Fund. The percentage that U.S. Treasury bills and other short-term cash positions held by the
Fund can be expected to vary from period to period as the market values of the underlying futures contracts change. During the years ended
December 21, 2022 and December 31, 2021, 2020, 2019 and the period ended December 31, 2018, IDIV earned interest income as follows:

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The duly authorized officers of the Sponsor, performing
functions equivalent to those a principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Trust would perform if the Trust had
any officers, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Trust s disclosure controls and procedures, and have concluded that the disclosure
controls and procedures of the Trust were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 

Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed
to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Trust files or submits under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the applicable
rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the duly authorized officers of the Sponsor performing functions
equivalent to those a principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Trust would perform if the Trust had any officers
and/or an Audit Committee, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Management s Annual Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting 

The duly authorized officers of the Sponsor are
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Trust s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance
to the Sponsor regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter
how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance
with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. 

In connection with the preparation of this annual
report, our duly authorized officers of the Sponsor, performing functions equivalent to those a principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of the Trust would perform if the Trust had any officers, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making that assessment, our duly authorized officers of the Sponsor used the criteria set forth
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based
on that assessment, the Sponsor believes that, as of December 31, 2022, the Trust s internal control over financial reporting is
effective. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There has been no change in the internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during the period ended that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
the Trust s internal control over financial reporting.

changes in shareholders equity, and the related notes, for each of the periods indicated below (collectively referred to as the

position of the Fund, the results of its operations, the changes in shareholders equity, and the cash flows for each of the periods
indicated below in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Basis for Opinion 

These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Fund s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Fund s financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Fund in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted
our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement whether due to error or fraud. The Fund is not required
to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required
to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the Fund s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits
included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,
and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of December 21, 2022, by correspondence
with the custodian and broker. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion. 

We have served as the Fund s
auditor since 2017 .

trust formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on September 28, 2016, pursuant to a short-form declaration of trust between
the Sponsor and the Trustee. An amended and restated Trust Agreement has been entered into between the Sponsor and the Trustee. The Trust
was organized in separate series rather than as separate statutory trusts in order to achieve administrative efficiencies. The principal
office of the Trust is located at c/o Metaurus Advisors LLC, 22 Hudson Place, 3 rd Floor, Hoboken, NJ 07030, and the Trust s
telephone number is 201-683-7979. 

The Trust and the Fund are governed by the Trust Agreement, which sets
out the rights of the registered holders of the Shares and the rights and obligations of the Sponsor and the Trustee. Delaware law governs
the Trust Agreement, the Trust, the Fund and the Shares. The following describes in brief the Shares and the material provisions of the
Trust Agreement. It is qualified by reference to the entire Trust Agreement, which has been filed as an exhibit to the registration statement
of which the most recent prospectus is a part. The Trust was terminated pursuant to a termination agreement, dated as of December 22,
2022. A certificate of cancellation of the Trust was filed in the office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on December
22, 2022.

NYSE Arca, Inc. exchange NYSE Arca in 2022, U.S. Equity Cumulative Dividends Fund Series 2027 ((the Dividend
Fund, Fund or ETF which was liquidated on December 21, 2022.) Metaurus Advisors LLC (the Sponsor 
or Advisor serves as the sponsor, commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor of the Fund. 

The Sponsor has filed on behalf of the Fund a Registration
Statement on Form S-1 with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933. The Annual Report on Form 10-K to which this Description of
Securities is attached as an exhibit, and this exhibit itself do not contain all of the information contained in the Registration Statement,
including the exhibits to the Registration Statement, parts of which have been omitted in accordance with the rules and regulations of
the SEC. For further information about the Funds and the Shares, please refer to the Registration Statement, which you may view at the
internet website the SEC maintains at www.sec.gov. 

Capitalized terms used but
not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Annual Report on Form 10-K to which this Description of Securities
is attached as an exhibit. 

Description of the Shares 

Each Share represents a unit of fractional undivided beneficial interest
in and ownership of the Fund. The Sponsor may from time to time divide or combine Shares of the Fund into a greater or lesser number of
Shares of the Fund. The Fund is not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act and Fund is not required to register
under that Act. 

The Shares may be purchased from the Fund or redeemed on a continuous
basis, but only by Authorized Participants and only in Creation Units. Individual Shares may not be purchased or redeemed from the Fund.
Shareholders that are not Authorized Participants may not purchase or redeem any shares or Creation Units from the Fund. Individual Shares
of the ETFs may be purchased and sold only on a national securities exchange, an alternative trading system or in the over-the-counter
market and not directly from the ETF. The Fund will issue and redeem Shares on a continuous basis, through SEI Investments Distribution
Co., the Distributor, at NAV per Share only in one or more large blocks of Shares, called Baskets as set forth in the ETF s
current Prospectus and any prospectus supplements thereto. Baskets may be issued and redeemed for cash but are expected to be issued and
redeemed principally through exchange for related positions EFRP transactions for (i) futures contracts, Treasury securities
and other financial instruments designed to track such Fund s underlying index Deposit Instruments and (ii) a cash
amount that includes a variable charge. Creation and redemption prices of Baskets are directly linked to the Fund s next computed
NAV and will vary from NAV by a market-determined trading cost, which may be zero. Shares generally will trade in the secondary market
in amounts less than a Basket at market prices that change throughout the day. Trading prices in the secondary market for the Shares may
be different from the NAVs of the ETFs 

Suspension of Creations and Redemptions 

The creation and redemption of Baskets may be suspended or refused
with respect to specific orders by the Sponsor, in its sole discretion, for any reason at any time or from time to time including during
any period in which a market disruption event occurs such that the Sponsor determines, in its discretion, that any component instruments
in the Underlying Index are unavailable for investment or their prices are not available or not representative or the Underlying Index
is unavailable or has been suspended. 

Certificates Evidencing the Shares 

The ownership of Shares is recorded on the books of the Trust or a
transfer or similar agent for the Trust. The Sponsor expects that DTC will accept the Shares for settlement through its book-entry settlement
system. So long as the Shares are eligible for DTC settlement, there will be one or more certificates evidencing Shares that will be registered
in the name of a nominee of DTC. You will be able to own Shares only in the form of book-entry security entitlements with DTC or direct
or indirect participants in DTC. You will not be entitled to receive a separate certificate evidencing Shares. Because Shares can be held
only in the form of book-entries through DTC and its participants, you must rely on DTC, a DTC participant and any other financial
intermediary through which they hold Shares to receive the benefits and exercise the rights described in this section. You should consult
with your broker or financial institution to find out about the procedures and requirements for instruments held in DTC book-entry form. 

Cash and Other Distributions 

The Dividend Fund expects to pay distributions to its Shareholders
monthly. The Dividend Fund may make distributions on a more frequent basis. 

In the event that the Dividend Fund makes a cash or other distribution,
as a registered holder of such Fund s Shares, you will receive these distributions in proportion to the number of Shares that you
own. Before making a distribution, the Sponsor may deduct any applicable withholding taxes and any fees and expenses of the Fund that
have not been paid. It will distribute only whole United States dollars and cents and will round fractional cents down to the nearest
whole cent. 

Voting Rights 

The Shareholders of the Fund take no part in the management or control
of, and have no voice in, the Trust s operations or business. Shares do not have any voting rights except (i) as otherwise required
by law or under the rules or regulations of NYSE Arca and (ii) in the limited circumstances as described below under Amendment
of the Trust Agreement. 

Limitations on Obligations and Liability and Indemnification Obligations 

The Trust Agreement expressly limits the obligations of the Sponsor
and the Trustee. It also limits the liability of each of the Sponsor and the Trustee. 

The Trust Agreement provides that the Sponsor, the Trustee, and their
respective directors, officers, principals, representatives, partners, manager, agents, employees and members (together Covered
Persons shall have no liability to the Trust or to any shareholder for any loss suffered by the Trust arising out of any action
or inaction of Covered Persons, if such Covered Person, in good faith, determined that such course of conduct was in the best interests
of the Trust or the Fund and such course of conduct did not constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct by such Covered Person.
The Trust has agreed to indemnify each Covered Person against all claims, losses or liabilities based on their conduct relating to the
Trust, provided that the conduct resulting in the claims, losses or liabilities for which indemnity is sought did not constitute gross
negligence or willful misconduct and was done in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the Fund.

Amendment of the Trust Agreement 

The Sponsor and the Trustee may agree to amend the Trust Agreement
without your consent; provided that the Shareholders have the right to vote only if expressly required under Delaware or federal
law or rules or regulations of the NYSE Arca, or if submitted to the Shareholders by the Sponsor in its sole discretion. No amendment
affecting the Trustee shall be binding upon or effective against the Trustee unless consented to by the Trustee in writing. 

Dissolution and Termination 

The Trust Agreement permits the termination of the Trust or of the
Fund by the Sponsor for any reason with notice to Shareholders.

that it had determined to close the Fund and delist and liquidate the Dividend Fund s shares from trading on the NYSE Arca. Trading
in the Fund s shares was suspended following the market close on December 9, 2022, and the Fund was liquidated on December 21, 2022
