Our Company was originally formed with the intent to engage in the worldwide distribution of custom handmade Italian road bikes, made by Renzo Formigli. On December 3, 2015, Amy Chaffe, our former President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and founder, decided to conduct a corporate restructuring. Our Company filed Articles of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation with the Florida Department of State whereby we amended our Articles of Incorporation by (i) changing our name to Cloudweb, Inc. , (ii) increasing our authorized number of shares of common stock from 100 million to 500 million, and (iii) increasing our total issued and outstanding shares of common stock by conducting a forward split of such shares at the rate of 100 shares for every one (1) share currently issued and outstanding and made submission to FINRA with respect to the corporate action and requested a change of ticker symbol to CLOU .

The increase in working capital deficit was primarily due to an increase in accrued interest on convertible and promissory notes and due to related party. Cash Flow from Operating Activities We have not generated positive cash flow from operating activities. During the year ended December 31, 2022, net cash used in operating activities was 61,800 compared to 34,960 used during the year ended December 31, 2021.

Cash Flow from Financing Activities During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our Company received 61,800 and 34,960 for proceeds from issuance of convertible notes, respectively. Going Concern As of the year ended December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of 233,310,529. We believe that its existing capital resources may not be adequate to enable it to execute its business plan. These conditions raise substantial doubt as to our Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Our Company is currently seeking new business opportunities with established business entities for merger with or acquisition of a target business. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. If we fail to generate positive cash flow or obtain additional financing, when required, we may have to modify, delay, or abandon some or all of our business plans. Contractual Obligations As a smaller reporting company , we are not required to provide tabular disclosure obligations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. A change in managements estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented. Fair Value of Financial Instruments ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs in measuring fair value. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. These tiers include: Level 1: defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2: defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3: defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. The carrying value of cash, prepayments and the Company s loan from shareholder approximates its fair value due to their short-term maturity. 10 Table of Contents Web Development Cost In accordance with FASB ASC350-50 Web Development Costs , all costs incurred during the website planning stage are incurred. During the website application and infrastructure development stage, software tool costs and internet domain costs are capitalized, and website hosting costs are expensed. Cost incurred in the graphics development, content development and operating stage are generally expensed unless the costs are software related and should then be capitalized. During the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company incurred 18,500 and 0 web development cost on three websites contributed by the Company s director, respectively. Share-based Expenses ASC 718 Compensation Stock Compensation prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all share-based payment transactions in which employee services and non-employee services are acquired. Transactions include incurring liabilities, or issuing or offering to issue shares, options, and other equity instruments such as employee stock ownership plans and stock appreciation rights. Share-based payments to employees and non-employees, including grants of employee stock options, are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values. That expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). Recent Accounting Pronouncements Management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued. Our Company s management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on our financial statements. ITEM 7A.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cloudweb, Inc. (the "Company") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Substantial Doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company s significant operating losses raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or are required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters. /s/ BF Borgers CPA PC (PCAOB ID We have served as the Company's auditor since 2014 March 30, 2023 F-1 Table of Contents CLOUDWEB, INC.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE There were no disagreements related to accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, internal controls or auditing scope or procedure during the two fiscal years and interim periods. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation Of Disclosure Controls And Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer (our chief executive officer), we have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 , as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded as of the evaluation date that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective such that the material information required to be included in our Securities and Exchange Commission reports is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and financial officer, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms relating to our Company, particularly during the period when this report was being prepared. Management s Annual Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, for our Company. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of its management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Management recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control, and accordingly, even effective internal control can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect material misstatements. In addition, effective internal control at a point in time may become ineffective in future periods because of changes in conditions or due to deterioration in the degree of compliance with our established policies and procedures. A material weakness is a significant deficiency, or combination of significant deficiencies, that results in there being a more than remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. Under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2022, based on the framework set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our evaluation under this framework, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of the evaluation date due to the factors stated below. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of evaluation date and identified the following material weaknesses: Insufficient Resources : We have an inadequate number of personnel with requisite expertise in the key functional areas of finance and accounting. Inadequate Segregation Of Duties : We have an inadequate number of personnel to properly implement control procedures. Lack Of Audit Committee Outside Directors On The Company s Board Of Directors: We do not have a functioning audit committee or outside directors on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures. 13 Table of Contents Management is committed to improving its internal controls and will (1) continue to use third party specialists to address shortfalls in staffing and to assist the Company with accounting and finance responsibilities, (2) increase the frequency of independent reconciliations of significant accounts which will mitigate the lack of segregation of duties until there are sufficient personnel and (3) may consider appointing outside directors and audit committee members in the future. Management, including our chief executive officer, has discussed the material weakness noted above with our independent registered public accounting firm. Due to the nature of this material weakness, there is a more than remote likelihood that misstatements which could be material to the annual or interim financial statements could occur that would not be prevented or detected. This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management s report in this annual report. Changes In Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
